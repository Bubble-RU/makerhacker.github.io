</p><p>3 Then, given a small number of labeled static images, it uses that model to extrapolate beyond the given exemplars and generate “synthetic ” training examples—poses that could link the observed images and/or immediately precede or follow them in time. [sent-5, score-0.68]
</p><p>4 Applying our approach to recognize actions in both images and video, we show it enhances a state-of-the-art technique when very few labeled training examples are available. [sent-8, score-0.392]
</p><p>5 While researchers have trained activity models from video data for many years, there is increasing interest in methods that can learn an action category from static image snapshots [17, 33, 34, 7, 36, 35]. [sent-11, score-0.992]
</p><p>6 First, labeling training videos is more expensive; it requires more elaborate annotation interfaces, more work by annotators, and it can even be ambiguous in terms of when the action starts and ends. [sent-13, score-0.479]
</p><p>7 Third, the ability to infer actions from static inputs has potential to aid object and scene recognition, since all three can serve as mutual context. [sent-15, score-0.38]
</p><p>8 However, training an action recognition system with grauman@cs . [sent-16, score-0.401]
</p><p>9 edu  unlabeled video, and then leverages that knowledge to train novel action categories from very few static snapshots. [sent-18, score-0.736]
</p><p>10 The snapshots and video (left) are used together to extrapolate “synthetic” poses relevant to that category (center), augmenting the training set. [sent-19, score-0.898]
</p><p>11 How can we be assured to adequately cover the space of an action with an array of training photos? [sent-22, score-0.373]
</p><p>12 People can understand a human activity by looking at just a few static snapshots, yet today’s systems typically require hundreds of such exemplars to learn an action category well. [sent-28, score-0.732]
</p><p>13 Building on this intuition, we propose an approach to 555777002  learn action categories from a small number of static images by leveraging prior observations of generic human motion to augment the training process. [sent-32, score-0.744]
</p><p>14 Given unlabeled video, the system first learns how body pose changes over time. [sent-33, score-0.496]
</p><p>15 We assume this video has some human activity in it, and that humans are often detectable when present, but otherwise make no assumptions about which actions are present in the data. [sent-34, score-0.488]
</p><p>16 Then, given a small set of labeled images for an action category, the system uses the generic knowledge obtained from watching the video to extrapolate beyond those exemplars during training. [sent-35, score-0.728]
</p><p>17 In particular, it augments its labeled set with “synthetic” examples, which depict poses that could immediately precede or follow the given examples in time. [sent-36, score-0.482]
</p><p>18 The first uses an example-based representation of pose dynamics; we match the labeled training images to unlabeled video frames based on their pose similarity, and then augment the training set with the poses appearing before and after the matched frames. [sent-39, score-1.411]
</p><p>19 The second technique uses a manifold-based representation; we learn a nonlinear manifold over body poses, relying on the temporal nearness of the video frames to establish which should maintain proximity. [sent-40, score-0.465]
</p><p>20 Then, we map the static training instances to the manifold, and explore their neighborhoods on the manifold to augment the training set. [sent-41, score-0.621]
</p><p>21 In both cases, we adopt a part-based representation of pose, and use domain adaptation to account for the mismatch between the source images and the unlabeled video. [sent-42, score-0.484]
</p><p>22 We show that our synthetic expansions to the training set yield more accurate predictions, especially when labeled data is quite sparse. [sent-43, score-0.374]
</p><p>23 Notably, the gains come at no additional labeling cost, since we make no assumptions about which actions appear in the unlabeled video. [sent-44, score-0.41]
</p><p>24 , [20]), as well as the use of graphics software to generate images of people (often driven by mocap) with variable clothing and body sizes to train pose estimators [26, 12, 27]. [sent-48, score-0.344]
</p><p>25 We demonstrate the proposed approach to recognize actions in both static images and videos from multiple challenging datasets. [sent-52, score-0.412]
</p><p>26 For our target scenario where training examples are very few, our approach outperforms both a method limited to the original static exemplars, as well as alternative methods to pad the data by introducing appearance variation. [sent-54, score-0.426]
</p><p>27 More relevant to our problem, recent work considers action recognition in static images. [sent-65, score-0.472]
</p><p>28 During both training and testing, these algorithms use only static snapshots of the actions of interest. [sent-66, score-0.707]
</p><p>29 Our focus is artificially expanding the training set for “free” via pose dynamics learned from unlabeled data, regardless of the specific descriptor. [sent-70, score-0.616]
</p><p>30 We use domain adaptation to account for the possible mismatch in statistics between the video frames and images. [sent-72, score-0.415]
</p><p>31 Domain adaptation can improve event learning across two domains of videos, such as Web videos to consumer videos [10] or one benchmark dataset to another [5], and it can also help train an object detector from videos [21]. [sent-73, score-0.389]
</p><p>32 The availability of 555777113  humanoid models in graphics software, together with mocap data, make it possible to generate synthetic images useful for training action recognition [18] and pose estimation methods [26, 12, 27]. [sent-80, score-0.85]
</p><p>33 Web images noisily labeled by tags can also serve as a “free” source of data for action classification [13]. [sent-81, score-0.37]
</p><p>34 No prior work attempts to augment action images with unlabeled video samples, as we propose. [sent-82, score-0.713]
</p><p>35 , people in different clothes; the object facing the other direction), our idea is to better populate the pose parameter space as learned from unlabeled video. [sent-85, score-0.481]
</p><p>36 Approach Our approach augments a small set of static images labeled by their action category by introducing synthetic body pose examples. [sent-87, score-1.046]
</p><p>37 The synthetic examples extend the real ones locally in time, so that we can train action classifiers on a wider set of poses that are (likely) relevant for the actions of interest. [sent-88, score-0.933]
</p><p>38 2), we present two methods to infer synthetic pose examples; one is example-based (Sec. [sent-94, score-0.394]
</p><p>39 Finally, we explain how we use a mix of real and synthetic data to train a classifier that can predict actions in novel static images (Sec. [sent-101, score-0.637]
</p><p>40 We use this descriptor because it captures human body pose at a high level, and it is robust to occlusion and cluttered backgrounds. [sent-116, score-0.348]
</p><p>41 This is fine for our data-driven approach, which will synthesize poses that expand exemplars as viewed from a similar viewpoint. [sent-125, score-0.391]
</p><p>42 Unlabeled Video Data Our method requires access to unlabeled videos containing human activity. [sent-128, score-0.366]
</p><p>43 The video has no action category labels associated with it, and the activity is not segmented in any way. [sent-129, score-0.552]
</p><p>44 In particular, we do not assume that the activities present belong to the same categories as we will observe in the static training images. [sent-130, score-0.354]
</p><p>45 We would like the system to  build a model of human motion dynamics—typical changes of body pose over time—without knowing in advance what novel actions it will be asked to learn from snapshots. [sent-132, score-0.55]
</p><p>46 Intuitively, this suggests that a large and diverse set of clips would be ideal, as we cannot hope to extrapolate poses for inputs that are unlike anything the system has seen before. [sent-133, score-0.381]
</p><p>47 In our current implementation, we use video from the Hollywood dataset [15] to form the unlabeled pool. [sent-134, score-0.38]
</p><p>48 Generating Synthetic Pose Examples Our key idea is to expand limited training data by exploring unlabeled video, which implicitly provides rules governing how human pose changes over time for various activities. [sent-147, score-0.652]
</p><p>49 Thus, the heart of our method is to generate synthetic pose examples. [sent-148, score-0.394]
</p><p>50 , (piN , yN)} denote the N training snapshots our system receives as input, where the superscript idenotes image, and each pij ∈ RP is a PAV descriptor with an associated action class label yj ∈ {1, . [sent-153, score-0.745]
</p><p>51 , tK} denote the K person tracks from the unlabeled video, and let each track tk be represented by a sequence of PAV descriptors, tk = (pvk1 , . [sent-162, score-0.366]
</p><p>52 1 Example-based strategy Our example-based method treats the video as a nonparametric representation of pose dynamics. [sent-168, score-0.353]
</p><p>53 For each training snapshot pose pij, we find its nearest neighbor pose in any of the video tracks, according to Euclidean distance  in PAV space. [sent-169, score-0.867]
</p><p>54 Then, we simply sample temporally adjacent poses to pvj∗ to form synthetic examples that will “pad” the training set for class yj . [sent-171, score-0.626]
</p><p>55 Specifically, we take pvj∗ and pvj∗+T, the poses T frames before and T frames after the match (accounting for boundary cases if the neighbor starts or ends a track). [sent-172, score-0.342]
</p><p>56 We repeat this process for all training snapshots, yielding an expanded training set S+ with two new synthetic examples for each original snapshot: S+ = {S {(pjv∗ yj) , (pvj∗+T, yj)}jN=1 }. [sent-174, score-0.486]
</p><p>57 2 Manifold-based strategy We also explore a method to extrapolate poses using a nonlinear pose manifold. [sent-182, score-0.59]
</p><p>58 Whereas the example-based method extrapolates pose solely in the temporal dimension—and solely using one sequence at a time—the manifold variant unifies connections in both appearance and dynamics, and it effectively samples synthetic examples from a mix of sequences at once. [sent-183, score-0.633]
</p><p>59 For each labeled training snapshot (top left), we use its pose description (depicted in bottom left) to find a neighbor in the unlabeled video (center panel). [sent-187, score-0.956]
</p><p>60 Then we synthesize additional training poses based on its temporal neighbors or nearby instances on a pose manifold (right panel). [sent-188, score-0.67]
</p><p>61 We use the PAVs from the unlabeled video to build the manifold. [sent-192, score-0.38]
</p><p>62 Recall that pkq denotes the PAV for the q-th frame within the k-th track in the unlabeled video (dropping the superscript v for clarity). [sent-193, score-0.486]
</p><p>63 Next, for each training snapshot, we find nearby poses on the manifold to generate synthetic examples. [sent-210, score-0.641]
</p><p>64 Specifically, for snapshot pij with nearest neighbor pvj∗ in PAV space, we take the associated pˆ jv∗ manifold coordinate, and compute its closest two embedded points from the video. [sent-211, score-0.366]
</p><p>65 to  LLE [2]  555777335  Discussion Whether example- or manifold-based, we stress that the synthetic examples exist in pose space—not raw image space. [sent-215, score-0.457]
</p><p>66 Thus, we are padding our training set with plausible poses that could immediately precede or follow the observed static snapshot poses, and ignoring surrounding context, objects, etc. [sent-216, score-0.819]
</p><p>67 Furthermore, it is entirely possible that the action the person in the video was performing when taking on that pose was not the action labeled in the static snapshot. [sent-217, score-1.175]
</p><p>68 Our idea is that the generic human motion dynamics gleaned from the unlabeled video allow us to extrapolate the poses observed in novel static images, at least to very near instants in time. [sent-218, score-1.15]
</p><p>69 This allows, for example, the system to infer that a kicking action could take on more diverse poses than the few available in the training set (compare left and right panels in Figure 1). [sent-219, score-0.585]
</p><p>70 Training with a Mix ofReal and Synthetic Poses Finally, we use the augmented training set S+ to train SVM action classifiers to predict the labels of novel images. [sent-222, score-0.412]
</p><p>71 First, we employ domain adaptation to account for the potential mismatch in feature distributions between the labeled snapshots and unrelated video. [sent-224, score-0.538]
</p><p>72 In our case, we can think of the static snapshots (whether training or testing) as the target domain, and the unlabeled video as the source domain. [sent-228, score-0.977]
</p><p>73 Every synthetic (source) pose example is mapped to = [pv , , 0], where 0 = [0, . [sent-231, score-0.394]
</p><p>74 Specifically, the cost for label errors on the real examples Creal is set to 1, while the cost for synthetic examples  pv  pv? [sent-242, score-0.421]
</p><p>75 This weighting, combined with the soft-margin SVM, will give some resilience to off-base synthetic pose examples wrongly hypothesized by our method. [sent-245, score-0.457]
</p><p>76 Datasets For the unlabeled video data, we use the training and testing clips from the Hollywood Human Actions dataset [15]. [sent-251, score-0.491]
</p><p>77 For the video recognition task, we compile a test set from multiple video sources, since no existing video dataset has both images and videos for a set of action labels. [sent-261, score-0.844]
</p><p>78 We gather 78 test videos from the HMDB5 1 [14], Action Similarity Labeling Challenge [14], and UCF Sports [24] datasets that contain activities also appearing in PASCAL: phoning, riding bike, riding horse, running, and walking. [sent-262, score-0.344]
</p><p>79 Note that the unlabeled video source remains the Hollywood data for this task; in all cases, the only labels our method gets are those on the static snapshots in PASCAL. [sent-263, score-0.866]
</p><p>80 Accuracy on static action recognition datasets as a function of the number of training images. [sent-271, score-0.583]
</p><p>81 Recognizing Activity in Novel Images The primary comparison of interest is to see whether  recognition improves when adding our synthetic training data, versus a baseline that does everything else the same (i. [sent-277, score-0.37]
</p><p>82 This baseline is useful to see the extent to which we need to extrapolate poses across time (dynamics), versus merely padding the data with variations in appearance (similar instances of the same pose). [sent-287, score-0.417]
</p><p>83 Our approach substantially boosts accuracy when few training snapshots are available. [sent-290, score-0.369]
</p><p>84 2 Adding poses from random frames degrades accuracy across the board, confirming that our method’s gain is not due to having more pose examples; rather, it synthesizes useful ones relevant to the recognition task. [sent-296, score-0.47]
</p><p>85 Adding a pose from the neighbor frame itself (“current”) increases the baseline’s accuracy by synthesizing more varied appearances of the poses in the training set, but it is inferior to using the pose dynamics as proposed. [sent-297, score-0.857]
</p><p>86 Figure 5 shows examples of images responsible for synthetic poses added to the original training set for PASCAL. [sent-298, score-0.587]
</p><p>87 For example, the bottom image of a man phoning has synthetic poses generated from a man who is not phoning—but who nonetheless takes on poses and facial expressions that could have been (were the objects in the scene different). [sent-300, score-0.742]
</p><p>88 In the special case that a familiar action actually appears in the unlabeled video, it too can help, as we see in the horse-riding and walking examples. [sent-301, score-0.482]
</p><p>89 Each pose in the center panel finds a neighbor in the unlabeled video pvj∗ , which generates  a synthetic example for what could come immediately  before (pvj∗  −T,  left) and after (pvj∗  +T,  right) that pose. [sent-315, score-0.926]
</p><p>90 Just as a training set that is too small needs our method to fill in intermediate poses, so too a class whose examples are too tightly clustered in pose space (e. [sent-329, score-0.403]
</p><p>91 Table 1 isolates the impact of domain adaptation on our results, when the number of training examples N = 30. [sent-332, score-0.379]
</p><p>92 Impact on mAP of domain adaptation on the static datasets. [sent-340, score-0.346]
</p><p>93 racy for both variants of our method, showing it is worthwhile to model the potential data mismatch between the unlabeled video and training snapshots. [sent-341, score-0.545]
</p><p>94 Recognizing Activity in Novel Video Next, we apply our method to predict activities in novel video, still using the same static image training set idea (see  dataset details in Sec. [sent-347, score-0.354]
</p><p>95 Note that this test should allow our method to shine, since the novel videos will exhibit many intermediate poses that the original snapshots did not cover—but that our method will 555777668  W ith oDutADAO0. [sent-356, score-0.544]

</p><p>97 Its synthetic padding of the data makes the training set less sparse, yielding more reliable predictions on the video frames. [sent-366, score-0.52]
</p><p>98 Our approach leverages knowledge of human pose patterns over time, as represented by an unlabeled video repository. [sent-371, score-0.678]
</p><p>99 To implement our idea, we explore simple but effective example- and manifold-based representations of pose dynamics, and combine them with a domain adaptation feature mapping that can connect the real and generated examples. [sent-372, score-0.414]
</p><p>100 Our results classifying activities in three datasets show that the synthetic poses have significant impact when the labeled training examples are sparse. [sent-373, score-0.751]

<p>Author: Chao-Yeh Chen, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to learn action categories from static images that leverages prior observations of generic human motion to augment its training process. Using unlabeled video containing various human activities, the system first learns how body pose tends to change locally in time.

In this way, we expand the training set without requiring additional manually labeled examples. We explore both example-based and manifold-based methods to implement our idea.

<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the “best” one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>3 0.30879226 <a title="459-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Unconstrained_Monocular_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_by_Action_Detection_and_Cross-Modality_Regression_Forest.html">444 cvpr-2013-Unconstrained Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation by Action Detection and Cross-Modality Regression Forest</a></p>
<p>Author: Tsz-Ho Yu, Tae-Kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenging problem of unconstrained 3D human pose estimation (HPE)from a novelperspective. Existing approaches struggle to operate in realistic applications, mainly due to their scene-dependent priors, such as background segmentation and multi-camera network, which restrict their use in unconstrained environments. We therfore present a framework which applies action detection and 2D pose estimation techniques to infer 3D poses in an unconstrained video. Action detection offers spatiotemporal priors to 3D human pose estimation by both recognising and localising actions in space-time.

<p>Author: Alireza Fathi, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a model of action based on the change in the state of the environment. Many actions involve similar dynamics and hand-object relationships, but differ in their purpose and meaning. The key to differentiating these actions is the ability to identify how they change the state of objects and materials in the environment. We propose a weakly supervised method for learning the object and material states that are necessary for recognizing daily actions. Once these state detectors are learned, we can apply them to input videos and pool their outputs to detect actions. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to segment discrete actions from a continuous video of an activity. Our results outperform state-of-the-art action recognition and activity segmentation results.</p><p>5 0.25101283 <a title="459-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_Videos_Using_Mid-level_Discriminative_Patches.html">355 cvpr-2013-Representing Videos Using Mid-level Discriminative Patches</a></p>
<p>Author: Arpit Jain, Abhinav Gupta, Mikel Rodriguez, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: How should a video be represented? We propose a new representation for videos based on mid-level discriminative spatio-temporal patches. These spatio-temporal patches might correspond to a primitive human action, a semantic object, or perhaps a random but informative spatiotemporal patch in the video. What defines these spatiotemporal patches is their discriminative and representative properties. We automatically mine these patches from hundreds of training videos and experimentally demonstrate that these patches establish correspondence across videos and align the videos for label transfer techniques. Furthermore, these patches can be used as a discriminative vocabulary for action classification where they demonstrate stateof-the-art performance on UCF50 and Olympics datasets.</p><p>6 0.2401984 <a title="459-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Instance_Constraints.html">387 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation with Instance Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Chao-Yeh Chen, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to learn action categories from static images that leverages prior observations of generic human motion to augment its training process. Using unlabeled video containing various human activities, the system first learns how body pose tends to change locally in time. Then, given a small number of labeled static images, it uses that model to extrapolate beyond the given exemplars and generate “synthetic ” training examples—poses that could link the observed images and/or immediately precede or follow them in time. In this way, we expand the training set without requiring additional manually labeled examples. We explore both example-based and manifold-based methods to implement our idea. Applying our approach to recognize actions in both images and video, we show it enhances a state-of-the-art technique when very few labeled training examples are available.</p><p>2 0.83081734 <a title="459-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Key-Framing%3A_A_Model_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">336 cvpr-2013-Poselet Key-Framing: A Model for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new model for recognizing human actions. An action is modeled as a very sparse sequence of temporally local discriminative keyframes collections of partial key-poses of the actor(s), depicting key states in the action sequence. We cast the learning of keyframes in a max-margin discriminative framework, where we treat keyframes as latent variables. This allows us to (jointly) learn a set of most discriminative keyframes while also learning the local temporal context between them. Keyframes are encoded using a spatially-localizable poselet-like representation with HoG and BoW components learned from weak annotations; we rely on structured SVM formulation to align our components and minefor hard negatives to boost localization performance. This results in a model that supports spatio-temporal localization and is insensitive to dropped frames or partial observations. We show classification performance that is competitive with the state of the art on the benchmark UT-Interaction dataset and illustrate that our model outperforms prior methods in an on-line streaming setting.</p><p>3 0.81233925 <a title="459-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Approach_to_Pose-Based_Action_Recognition.html">40 cvpr-2013-An Approach to Pose-Based Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the “best” one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>4 0.79830855 <a title="459-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Cross-View_Action_Recognition_via_a_Continuous_Virtual_Path.html">98 cvpr-2013-Cross-View Action Recognition via a Continuous Virtual Path</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhong Zhang, Chunheng Wang, Baihua Xiao, Wen Zhou, Shuang Liu, Cunzhao Shi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for cross-view action recognition via a continuous virtual path which connects the source view and the target view. Each point on this virtual path is a virtual view which is obtained by a linear transformation of the action descriptor. All the virtual views are concatenated into an infinite-dimensional feature to characterize continuous changes from the source to the target view. However, these infinite-dimensional features cannot be used directly. Thus, we propose a virtual view kernel to compute the value of similarity between two infinite-dimensional features, which can be readily used to construct any kernelized classifiers. In addition, there are a lot of unlabeled samples from the target view, which can be utilized to improve the performance of classifiers. Thus, we present a constraint strategy to explore the information contained in the unlabeled samples. The rationality behind the constraint is that any action video belongs to only one class. Our method is verified on the IXMAS dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.77418202 <a title="459-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Unconstrained_Monocular_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_by_Action_Detection_and_Cross-Modality_Regression_Forest.html">444 cvpr-2013-Unconstrained Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation by Action Detection and Cross-Modality Regression Forest</a></p>

We extend the inference machines framework of Ross et al. by adding spatial factors that model mid-range and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. The new model is able to account for semantic spatial context. During training, our method automatically isolates and retains factors modelling spatial dependencies between variables that are relevant for achieving higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method by using it to predict 1 7-category semantic segmentations on sets of stitched Kinect scans.

<p>Author: Fernando Flores-Mangas, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: The problem of rigid motion segmentation of trajectory data under orthography has been long solved for nondegenerate motions in the absence of noise. But because real trajectory data often incorporates noise, outliers, motion degeneracies and motion dependencies, recently proposed motion segmentation methods resort to non-trivial representations to achieve state of the art segmentation accuracies, at the expense of a large computational cost. This paperproposes a method that dramatically reduces this cost (by two or three orders of magnitude) with minimal accuracy loss (from 98.8% achieved by the state of the art, to 96.2% achieved by our method on the standardHopkins 155 dataset). Computational efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Subsets of motion models with the best balance between prediction accuracy and model complexity are chosen from a pool of candidates, which are then used for segmentation. 1. Rigid Motion Segmentation Rigid motion segmentation (MS) consists on separating regions, features, or trajectories from a video sequence into spatio-temporally coherent subsets that correspond to independent, rigidly-moving objects in the scene (Figure 1.b or 1.f). The problem currently receives renewed attention, partly because of the extensive amount of video sources and applications that benefit from MS to perform higher level computer vision tasks, but also because the state of the art is reaching functional maturity. Motion Segmentation methods are widely diverse, but most capture only a small subset of constraints or algebraic properties from those that govern the image formation process of moving objects and their corresponding trajectories, such as the rank limit theorem [9, 10], the linear independence constraint (between trajectories from independent motions) [2, 13], the epipolar constraint [7], and the reduced rank property [11, 15, 13].

Wˆf (rif (cif methods [11, 6, 8] balance model complexity with modeling accuracy and have been successful at incorporating more of these aspects into a single formulation. For instance, in [8] most model parameters are estimated automatically from the data, including the number of independent motions and their complexity, as well as the segmentation labels (including outliers). However, because of the large number of necessary motion hypotheses that need to be instantiated, as well as the varying and potentially very large number of 222222555977 model parameters that must be estimated, the flexibility offered by this method comes at a large computational cost. Current state of the art methods follow the trend of using sparse low-dimensional subspaces to represent trajectory data. This representation is then fed into a clustering algorithm to obtain a segmentation result. A prime example of this type of method is Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [3] in which each trajectory is represented as a sparse linear combination of a few other basis trajectories. The assumption is that the basis trajectories must belong to the same rigid motion as the reconstructed trajectory (or else, the reconstruction would be impossible). When the assumption is true, the sparse mixing coefficients can be interpreted as the connectivity weights of a graph (or a similarity matrix), which is then (spectral) clustered to obtain a segmentation result. At the time of publication, SSC produced segmentation results three times more accurate than the best predecessor. The practical downside, however, is the inherently large computational cost of finding the optimal sparse representation, which is at least cubic on the number of trajectories. The work of [14] also falls within the class of subspace separation algorithms. Their approach is based on clustering the principal angles (CPA) of the local subspaces associated to each trajectory and its nearest neighbors. The clustering re-weights a traditional metric of subspace affinity between principal angles. Re-weighted affinities are then used for segmentation. The approach produces segmentation results with accuracies similar to those of SSC, but the computational cost is close to 10 times bigger than SSC’s. In this work we argue that competitive segmentation results are possible using a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. The proposed method is approximately 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than [3] and [14] respectively, currently considered the state of the art. 1.1. Affine Motion Projective Geometry is often used to model the image motion of trajectories from rigid objects between pairs of frames. However, alternative geometric relationships that facilitate parameter computation have also been proven useful for this purpose. For instance, in perspective projection, general image motion from rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of two elements: a 2D homography, and parallax residual displacements [5]. The homography describes the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the parallax residuals account for relative depths, that are unaccounted for by the planar surface model. Under orthography, in contrast, image motion of rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of a 2D affine transformation plus epipolar residual displacements. The 2D affine transformation models the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the epipolar residuals account for relative depths. Crucially, these two components can be computed separately and incrementally, which enables an explicit mechanism to deal with motion degeneracy. In the context of 3D motion, a motion is degenerate when the trajectories originate from a planar (or linear) object, or when neither the camera nor the imaged object exercise all of their degrees of freedom, such as when the object only translates, or when the camera only rotates. These are common situations in real world video sequences. The incremental nature of the decompositions described above, facilitate the transition between degenerate motions and nondegenerate ones. Planar Model Under orthography, the projection of trajectories from a planar surface can be modeled with the affine transformation: ⎣⎡xy1c ⎦⎤=?0D? 1t?⎡⎣yx1w ⎦⎤= A2wD→c⎣⎡yx1w ⎦⎤, (1) where D ∈ R2×2 is an invertible matrix, and t ∈ R2 is a threarnesl Datio ∈n v Rector. Trajectory icboloer mdiantartixe,s (axnwd , tyw ∈) are in the plane’s reference frame (modulo a 2D affine transformation) and (xc, yc) are image coordinates.

Deter- mining the motion and structure parameters of a 3D model from point correspondences can be done using the classical matrix factorization approach [10], but besides being sensitive to noise and outliers, the common scenario where the solution becomes degenerate makes the approach difficult to use in real-world applications. Appropriately accommodating and dealing with the degenerate cases is one of the key features of our work. 2. Overview of the Method The proposed motion segmentation algorithm has three stages.

The problem is framed as an objective function that must be minimized. The objective function is the negative loglikelihood over prediction accuracy, regularized by model complexity (number of model parameters) and modeling overlap (trajectories explained by multiple models). Notice that after this stage, the segmentation that results from the optimal model combination could be reported as a segmentation result (§5). ioTnhe r tshuilrtd ( stage incorporates the results from a set of model combinations that are closest to the optimal. Segmentation results are aggregated into an affinity matrix, which is then passed to a spectral clustering algorithm to produce the final segmentation result. This refinement stage generally results in improved accuracy and reduced segmentation variability (§6). 3.

The input to our model instantiation algorithm is a spatially-local, randomly drawn subset of trajectory data Wˆ[2F×I] ⊆ W[2F×P] (§3.1). In turn, at each RANSAC trial, the algorithm draw(§s3 uniformly d,i asttr eibaucthed R, A rNanSdoAmC subsets of three control trajectories (C[2F×3] ⊂ Wˆ[2F×I]).

The residuals are determined by the differences between the predictions made by a hypothesized model Af, and the observations at each frame ?r?1f?=? w˜1?f?− Af? w˜1?s?. (11) 3D likelihoods. The negative log-likelihood term for the 3D case is based on the the 2DAPE decomposition. The 2D affinities Af and residuals rf are reused, but to account for the effect of relative depth, an epipolar line segment ef is robustly fit to the residual data at each frame (please see supplementary material for details on the segment fitting algorithm). The 2DAPE does not constrain relative depths to remain constant across frames, but only requires trajectories to be close to the epipolar line. So, if the unitary vector ef indicates the orthogonal direction to ef, then the negativ⊥e log-likelihood term for the 3D case is estimated with: L3D( wˆfi| Af,σf) = −2log⎜⎝⎛√21πσfexp⎪⎨⎪⎧−?r2if(?σfe)f⊥2?2⎪⎬⎪⎫⎞⎟⎠, ⎠(12,) which is also a zero-mean 2D Norma⎩l distribution ⎭computed as the product of two identical, separable, singlevariate, normal distributions, evaluated at the distance from the residual to the epipolar line. The first one corresponds to the actual deviation in the direction of ef , which is analyti- cally computed using rif?ef. The seco⊥nd one corresponds to an estimate of the deviat⊥ion in the perpendicular direction (ef), which cannot be determined using the 2DAPE decomposition model, but can be approximated to be equal to rif ? ef, which is a plausible estimate under the isotropic noise as⊥sumption. Note that Eq. 7 does not evaluate the quality of a model using the number of inliers, as it is typical for RANSAC. Instead, we found that better motion models resulted from Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation × Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation Input:b Traasejec frtoamrye d bata W[2F×P], number of RANSAC trials K, arbitrary Output: Parameters of the motion model M = {B , σn , ω} // determine the training set c ← rand( 1, P) ; r ← rand(rmin , rmax ) // random center and radius I] ← t ra j e ct oriesWithinDis k (W, r,c) // support subset X ← homoCoords(Wˆb) // points at base frame for K RANSAC trials do Wˆ[2F Wˆ return M = {B} optimizing over the accuracy ofthe model predictions for an (estimated) inlier subset, which also means that the effect of outliers is explicitly uncounted.

Figures 1.d and 1.e show a model’s control points and its corresponding (class-labeled) residuals, respectively. A pseudocode description of the motion instantiation algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. Details on how to determine Wˆ, as well as B, σ, and ω follow. 3.1. Local Coherence The subset of trajectories Wˆ given to RANSAC to generate a model M is constrained to a spatially local region. The probability ofchoosing an uncontaminated set of 3 control trajectories, necessary to compute a 2D affine model, from a dataset with a ratio r of inliers, after k trials is: p = 1 − (1 − r3)k. This means that the number of trials pne =ede 1d −to (fi1n d− a subset of 3 inliers with probability p is k =lloogg((11 − − r p3)). (13) A common assumption is that trajectories from the same underlying motion are locally coherent. Hence, a compact region is likely to increase r, exponentially reducing 222222666200 Figure 2: Predictions (red) from a 2D affine model with standard Gaussian noise (green) on one of the control points (black). Noiseless model predictions in blue. All four scenarios have identical noise. The magnitude of the extrapolation error changes with the distance between the control points. k, and with it, RANSAC’s computation time by a proportional amount. The trade-off that results from drawing model control points from a small region, however, is extrapolation error. A motion model is extrapolated when utilized to make predictions for trajectories outside the region defined by the control points. The magnitude of modeling error depends on the magnitude of the noise affecting the control points, and although hard to characterize in general, extrapolation error can be expected to grow with the distance from the prediction to the control points, and inversely with the distance between the control points themselves. Figure 2 shows a series of synthetic scenarios where one of the control points is affected by zero mean Gaussian noise of small magnitude. Identical noise is added to the same trajectory in all four scenarios. The figure illustrates the relation between the distance between the control points and the magnitude of the extrapolation errors. Our goal is to maximize the region size while limiting the number of outliers. Without any prior knowledge regarding the scale of the objects in the scene, determining a fixed size for the support region is unlikely to work in general. Instead, the issue is avoided by randomly sampling disk-shaped regions of varying sizes and locations to construct a diverse set of support subsets. Each support subset is then determined by Wˆ = {wi | (xbi − ox)2 + (ybi − oy)2 < r2}, (14) where (ox , oy) are the coordinates of the center of a disk of radius r. To promote uniform image coverage, the disk is centered at a randomly chosen trajectory (ox , oy) = (xbi, yib) with uniformly distributed i ∼ U(1, P) and base frame b) w∼i h U u(1n,i fFor)m. yTo d asltrloibwu efodr idi ∼ffer Ue(n1t, region ds bizaesse, tfhraem read bius ∼ r is( ,cFho)s.en T ofro amllo a u fnoirfo dirmffe rdeinsttr riebugtiioonn r ∼s, tUh(erm raidni,u ursm rax i)s.

It is worth noting that the construction of theW support region does not incorporate any knowledge about the motion of objects in the scene, and in consequence will likely contain trajectories that originate from more than one independently moving object (Figure 3).

Characterizing the Residual Distribution At each RANSAC iteration, residuals rf are computed using the 2D affine model Af that results from the constraints provided by the control trajectories C. Characterizing the distribution of rf has three initial goals. The first one is to determine 2D model inliers b2fD (§4.1), the second one is to compute estimates of the magnitude ,o tfh thee s ncooinsed at every frame σ2fD (§4.2), and the third one is to determine whether the residual( §d4i.s2t)r,ib auntidon th originates efr iosm to a planar or a 3D object (§4.3).

(17) But because σf is generally unknown, the threshold (τ) is estimated from the residual data. To do so, let be the vector of residual magnitudes where rˆi ≤ ˆ ri+1 . Now, let r˜ = median ( rˆi+1 −ˆ r i). The threshold i≤s trˆ h en defined as r τ = min{ rˆi | (ri+1 − ri) > λr˜ r}, (18) which corresponds to the smallest residual magnitude before a salient magnitude gap. Our experiments showed this test to be efficient and effective. Figure 1.e shows classlabeled residuals. Notice the presence of a (low density) gap between the residuals from the trajectories explained by the correct model (in red, close to the origin), and the rest. 4.2. Magnitude of the Noise, 2D Model r2fD Let contain only the residuals of the inlier trajectories (those where = 1), and let USV? be the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix bif ofˆ r2fD: USV?= svd??1bpf( rˆ2fD)? rˆ2fD?.(19) Then the magnitude of the n?oise corresponds to the largest singular value σ2 = s1, because if the underlying geometry is in fact planar, then the only unaccounted displacements captured by the residuals are due to noise. Model capacity can also be determined from S, as explained next. 4.3. Model Capacity The ratio of largest over smallest singular values (s1/s2) determines when upgrading to a 3D model is beneficial. When the underlying geometry is actually non-planar, the residuals from a planar model should distribute along a line (the epipolar line), reflecting that their relative depth is being unaccounted for. This produces a covariance matrix with a large ratio s1/s2 ? 1. If on the other hand, if s1/s2 ≈ 1, then there is no in 1d.ic Iafti oonn tohfe unexplained relative depth, tihn wnh thicehr case, fitting a olinne o tfo u spherically distributed residuals will only increase the model complexity without explaining the residual variance much better. A small spherical residual covariance strongly suggests a planar underlying geometry. 4.4. 3D Inlier Detection When the residual distribution is elongated (s1/s2 ? 1), a line segment is robustly fit to the (potentially con?tam 1i)-, nated) set of residuals. The segment must go through the origin and its parameters are computed using a Hough transform. Further details about this algorithm can be found in the supplementary material. Inlier detection The resulting line segment is used to determine 3D model inliers. Trajectory ibecomes an inlier at frame f if it satisfies two conditions. First, the projection of rif onto the line must lie within the segment limits (β ≤ ≤ γ). Second, the normalized distance to the rif?ef (ef?rif line must be below a threshold ≤ σ2λd). Notice that the threshold depends on the smalle≤st singular value from Eq. 19 to (roughly) account for the presence of noise in the direction perpendicular to the epipolar (ef). 4.5. Magnitude of the Noise, 3D Model let rˆf3D Similarly to the 2D case, contain the residual data from the corresponding 3D inlier trajectories. An estimate for the magnitude of the noise that reflects the use of a 3D model can be obtained from the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix of r3fD (as in Eq. 19). In this case, the largest singular value s1 captures the spread of residuals along the epipolar line, so its magnitude is mainly related to the magnitude of the displacements due to relative depth. However, s2 captures deviations from the epipolar line, which in a rigid 3D object can only be attributed to noise, making σ2 = s2 a reasonable estimate for its magnitude. Optimal model parameters When both 2D and 3D models are instantiated, the one with the smallest penalized negative log-likelihood (7) becomes the winning model for the current RANSAC run. The same penalized negative loglikelihood metric is used to determine the better model from across all RANSAC iterations. The winning model is added to the pool M, and the process is repeated M times, forming hthee p pool MM, a=n d{ tMhe1 , . . . , MssM is} r.e 5.

Details follow. Prediction Accuracy In order to determine how well a model M predicts an arbitrary trajectory w, the affine transformations estimated by RANSAC could be re-used. However, the inherent noise in the control points, and the potentially short distance between them, often render this approach impractical, particularly when w is spatially distant from the control points (see §3. 1).

The orthonormal basis S of a ω = 2D (or 3D) motion model can be determined by the 2 (or 3) left singular vectors of WB. Using S as the model’s motion matrices, prediction accuracy can be computed using: E(w, M) = ??SS?w − w??2 , (22) which is the sum of squared?? Euclidean d??eviations from the predictions (SS?w), to the observed data (w). Our experiments indicated that, although sensitive to outliers, these model predictions are much more robust to noise. Ownership variables Π ∈ {0, 1}[P×N] indicate whether trajectory p i ps explained by t {he0 ,n1-}th model (πp,n = 1) or not (πp,n = 0), and are determined by maximum prediction accuracy (i.e. minimum Euclidean deviation): πp,n=⎨⎧01,, oift hMerjw,nis=e. aMrg∈mMinjE(wp,M) (23) Regularization terms The second term from Eq. 21 penalizes situations where multiple models explain a trajectory (w) with relatively small residuals.

A spectral clustering method is applied on F to produce the method’s final segmentation result. 7. Experiments Evaluation was made through three experimental setups. Hopkins 155 The Hopkins 155 (H155) dataset has been the standard evaluation metric for the problem of motion segmentation of trajectory data since 2007. It consists of checkerboard, traffic and articulated sequences with either 2 or 3 motions. Data was automatically tracked, but tracking errors were manually corrected; further details are available in [12]. The use of a standard dataset enables direct comparison of accuracy and run-time performance. Table 1 shows the relevant figures for the two most competitive algorithms that we are aware of. The data indicates that our algorithm has run-times that are close to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art methods, with minimal accuracy loss. Computation times are measured in the same (or very similar) hardware architectures. Like in CPA, our implementation uses a single set of parameters for all the experiments, but as others had pointed out [14], it remains unclear whether the same is true for the results reported in the original SSC paper. 222222666533 Figure 4: Accuracy error-bars across artificial H155 datasets with controlled levels of Gaussian noise. Artificial Noise The second experimental setup complements an unexplored dimension in the H155 dataset: noise. The goal is to determine the effects of noise of different magnitudes towards the segmentation accuracy of our method, in comparison with the state of the art. We noted that H155 contains structured long-tailed noise, but for the purpose of this experiment we required a noise-free dataset as a baseline. To generate such a dataset, ground-truth labels were used to compute a rank 3 reconstruction of (mean-subtracted) trajectories for each segment. Then, multiple versions of H155 were computed by contaminating the noise-free dataset with Gaussian noise of magnitudes σn ∈ {0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8}. Our method, as well as SSC a∈nd { 0C.0PA1, were run on t2h,e4s,e8 }n.oi Ose-ucro mnterothlloedd, datasets; results are shown in Figure 4. The error bars on SSC and Ours indicate one standard deviation, computed over 20 runs. The plot for CPA is generated with only one run for each dataset (running time: 11.95 days). The graph indicates that our method only compromises accuracy for large levels of noise, while still being around 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the most competitive algorithms. KLT Tracking The last experimental setup evaluates the applicability of the algorithm in real world conditions using raw tracks from an off-the-shelf implementation [1] of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm. Several sequences were tracked and the resulting trajectories classified by our method. Figure 5 shows qualitatively good motion segmentation results for four sequences. Challenges include very small relative motions, tracking noise, and a large presence of outliers. 8. Conclusions We introduced a computationally efficient motion segmentation algorithm for trajectory data. Efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Run-time comparisons indicate that our method is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, with only a small loss in accuracy.

The spatial constraints are learned along with the object detectors using an online structured SVM algorithm.

On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>5 0.91564316 <a title="459-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Integrating_Grammar_and_Segmentation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">225 cvpr-2013-Integrating Grammar and Segmentation for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon Rothrock, Seyoung Park, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a compositional and-or graph grammar model for human pose estimation. Our model has three distinguishing features: (i) large appearance differences between people are handled compositionally by allowingparts or collections ofparts to be substituted with alternative variants, (ii) each variant is a sub-model that can define its own articulated geometry and context-sensitive compatibility with neighboring part variants, and (iii) background region segmentation is incorporated into the part appearance models to better estimate the contrast of a part region from its surroundings, and improve resilience to background clutter. The resulting integrated framework is trained discriminatively in a max-margin framework using an efficient and exact inference algorithm. We present experimental evaluation of our model on two popular datasets, and show performance improvements over the state-of-art on both benchmarks.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.91562504 <a title="459-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Watching_Unlabeled_Video_Helps_Learn_New_Human_Actions_from_Very_Few_Labeled_Snapshots.html">459 cvpr-2013-Watching Unlabeled Video Helps Learn New Human Actions from Very Few Labeled Snapshots</a></p>

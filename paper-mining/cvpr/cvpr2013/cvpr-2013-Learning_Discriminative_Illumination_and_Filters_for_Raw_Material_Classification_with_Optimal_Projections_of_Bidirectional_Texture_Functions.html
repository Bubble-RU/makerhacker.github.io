<p>Author: Manmohan Chandraker, Dikpal Reddy, Yizhou Wang, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a theory that addresses the problem of determining shape from the (small or differential) motion of an object with unknown isotropic reflectance, under arbitrary unknown distant illumination, , for both orthographic and perpsective projection. Our theory imposes fundamental limits on the hardness of surface reconstruction, independent of the method involved. Under orthographic projection, we prove that three differential motions suffice to yield an invariant that relates shape to image derivatives, regardless of BRDF and illumination. Under perspective projection, we show that four differential motions suffice to yield depth and a linear constraint on the surface gradient, with unknown BRDF and lighting. Further, we delineate the topological classes up to which reconstruction may be achieved using the invariants. Finally, we derive a general stratification that relates hardness of shape recovery to scene complexity. Qualitatively, our invariants are homogeneous partial differential equations for simple lighting and inhomogeneous for complex illumination. Quantitatively, our framework shows that the minimal number of motions required to resolve shape is greater for more complex scenes. Prior works that assume brightness constancy, Lambertian BRDF or a known directional light source follow as special cases of our stratification. We illustrate with synthetic and real data how potential reconstruction methods may exploit our framework.</p><p>3 0.22013439 <a title="251-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Calibrating_Photometric_Stereo_by_Holistic_Reflectance_Symmetry_Analysis.html">75 cvpr-2013-Calibrating Photometric Stereo by Holistic Reflectance Symmetry Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: Under unknown directional lighting, the uncalibrated Lambertian photometric stereo algorithm recovers the shape of a smooth surface up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We resolve this ambiguity from the halfvector symmetry, which is observed in many isotropic materials. Under this symmetry, a 2D BRDF slice with low-rank structure can be obtained from an image, if the surface normals and light directions are correctly recovered. In general, this structure is destroyed by the GBR ambiguity. As a result, we can resolve the ambiguity by restoring this structure. We develop a simple algorithm of auto-calibration from separable homogeneous specular reflection of real images. Compared with previous methods, this method takes a holistic approach to exploiting reflectance symmetry and produces superior results.</p><p>4 0.21627802 <a title="251-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-BRDF_Slices%3A_Accurate_Adaptive_Anisotropic_Appearance_Acquisition.html">54 cvpr-2013-BRDF Slices: Accurate Adaptive Anisotropic Appearance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jirí Filip, Radomír Vávra, Michal Haindl, Pavel Žid, Mikuláš Krupika, Vlastimil Havran</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce unique publicly available dense anisotropic BRDF data measurements. We use this dense data as a reference for performance evaluation of the proposed BRDF sparse angular sampling and interpolation approach. The method is based on sampling of BRDF subspaces at fixed elevations by means of several adaptively-represented, uniformly distributed, perpendicular slices. Although this proposed method requires only a sparse sampling of material, the interpolation provides a very accurate reconstruction, visually and computationally comparable to densely measured reference. Due to the simple slices measurement and method’s robustness it allows for a highly accurate acquisition of BRDFs. This in comparison with standard uniform angular sampling, is considerably faster yet uses far less samples.</p><p>5 0.15842834 <a title="251-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenglong Zhou, Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to capture both 3D shape and spatially varying reflectance with a multi-view photometric stereo technique that works for general isotropic materials. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera and a handheld light source. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction (BRDF) is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. According to our experiments, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.3 millimeters. The captured reflectance has relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9%.</p><p>6 0.14745711 <a title="251-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Antony Lam, Imari Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral reflectance data allows for highly accurate spectral relighting under arbitrary illumination, which is invaluable to applications ranging from archiving cultural e-heritage to consumer product design. Past methods for capturing the spectral reflectance of scenes has proven successful in relighting but they all share a common assumption. All the methods do not consider the effects of fluorescence despite fluorescence being found in many everyday objects. In this paper, we describe the very different ways that reflectance and fluorescence interact with illuminants and show the need to explicitly consider fluorescence in the relighting problem. We then propose a robust method based on well established theories of reflectance and fluorescence for imaging each of these components. Finally, we show that we can relight real scenes of reflective-fluorescent surfaces with much higher accuracy in comparison to only considering the reflective component.</p><p>5 0.59977448 <a title="251-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>

In this paper, we conduct experiments to better understand the relationship between images, the eye movements people make while viewing images, and how people construct natural language to describe images. We explore these relationships in the context of two commonly used computer vision datasets.

We develop new models with a compositional parameterization of cluster centers, so representational capacity increases super-linearly in the number of parameters. This allows one to effectively quantize data using billions or trillions of centers. We formulate two such models, Orthogonal k-means and Cartesian k-means. They are closely related to one another, to k-means, to methods for binary hash function optimization like ITQ [5], and to Product Quantization for vector quantization [7]. The models are tested on largescale ANN retrieval tasks (1M GIST, 1B SIFT features), and on codebook learning for object recognition (CIFAR-10). 1. Introduction and background Techniques for vector quantization, like the well-known k-means algorithm, are used widely in vision and learning. Common applications include codebook learning for object recognition [16], and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for information retrieval [12, 14]. In general terms, such techniques involve partitioning an input vector space into multiple regions {Si}ik=1, mapping points x in each region uinlttiop region-specific representatives {ci}ik=1, known as cioennte irnst.o A resg siuonch-,s a quantizer, qse(nxt)a,t can b {ec expressed as k q(x) = ?1(x∈Si)ci, (1) i?= ?1 where 1(·) is the usual indicator function. eTrhee 1 quality oef u a quantizer oisr expressed in terms of expected distortion, a common measure of which is squared error ?x − q(x) ?22.

The k-means algorithm can be used to learn centers from data. To reduce expected distortion, crucial for many applications, one can shrink region volumes by increasing k, the number of regions. In practice, however, increasing k results in prohibitive storage and run-time costs. Even if one resorts to ANN search with approximate k-means [14] or hierarchical k-means [12], it is hard to scale to large k (e.g., k = 264), as storing the centers is untenable. This paper concerns methods for scalable quantization with tractable storage and run-time costs. Inspired by Product Quantization (PQ), a state-of-the-art algorithm for ANN search with high-dimensional data (e.g., [7]), compositionality is one key. By expressing data in terms of recurring, reusable parts, the representational capacity of compositional models grows exponentially in the number ofparameters. Compression techniques like JPEG accomplish this by encoding images as disjoint rectangular patches. PQ divides the feature space into disjoint subspaces that are quantized independently. Other examples include part-based recognition models (e.g., [18]), and tensor-based models for stylecontent separation (e.g., [17]). Here, with a compositional parameterization of region centers, we find a family of models that reduce the enc√oding cost of k centers down from k to between log2 k and √k. A model parameter controls the trade-off between model fidelity and compactness. We formulate two related algorithms, Orthogonal kmeans (ok-means) and Cartesian k-means (ck-means). They are natural extensions of k-means, and are closely related to other hashing and quantization methods. The okmeans algorithm is a generalization of the Iterative Quantization (ITQ) algorithm for finding locality-sensitive binary codes [5]. The ck-means model is an extension of okmeans, and can be viewed as a generalization of PQ.1 We then report empirical results on large-scale ANN search tasks, and on codebook learning for recognition. For ANN search we use datasets of 1M GIST and 1B SIFT features, with both symmetric and asymmetric distance measures on the latent codes. We consider codebook learning for a generic form of recognition on CIFAR-10. 2. k-means Given a dataset of n p-dim points, D ≡ {xj }jn=1, the kmeans algorithm partitions ithme n points in ≡to { kx c}lusters, and 1A very similar generalization of PQ, was developed concurrently by Ge, He, Ke and Sun, and also appears in CVPR 2013 [4]. 333000111755 represents each cluster by a center point. Let C ∈ Rp×k breep a mseantrtsix e wachhos celu sctoelurm byns a comprise tihnet .k Lceltus Cter ∈ centers, i.e., C = [c1, c2 , · · · , ck] . The k-means objective is to minimize the within,-c··lu·s ,tecr squared distances: ?k-means(C) = = x?∈Dmiin?x − ci?22 x?∈Db∈mHin1/k?x − Cb?22 (2) where H1/k ≡ {b | b ∈ {0, 1}k and ?b? = 1}, i.e., b is a binary vee Hctor comprising a ,1-1o}f-ka encoding. Lloyd’s b k- imse aa bni-s algorithm [11] finds a local minimum of (2) by iterative, alternating optimization with respect to C and the b’s. The k-means model is simple and intuitive, using NN search to assign points to centers. The assignment of points to centers can be represented with a log k-bit index per data point. The cost of storing the centers grows linearly with k. 3. Orthogonal k-means with 2m centers With a compositional model one can represent cluster centers more efficiently. One such approach is to re- construct each input with an additive combination of the columns of C. To this end, instead of the 1-of-k encoding in (2), we let b be a general m-bit vector, b ∈ Hm ≡ {0, 1}m, (a2n)d, wCe e∈ l Rt bp× bme. aA gse nsuerchal, meac-bhi tc vluesctteorr c, ebnt ∈er H His th≡e sum o}f a asundbs Cet o∈f Rthe columns of C. There are 2m possible subsets, and therefore k = 2m centers. While the number of parameters in the quantizer is linear in m, the number of centers increases exponentially. While efficient in representing cluster centers, the approach is problematic, because solving bˆ = abrg∈Hmmin?x − Cb?22,(3) is intractable; i.e., the discrete optimization is not submodular. Obviously, for small 2m one could generate all possible centers and then perform NN search to find the optimal solution, but this would not scale well to large values of m. One key observation is that if the columns of C are orthogonal, then optimization (3) becomes tractable. To explain this, without loss of generality, assume the bits belong to {−1, 1} instead of {0, 1}, i.e., b? ∈ Hm? ≡ {−1, 1}m. tToh e{−n, ?x − Cb??22 = xTx + b?TCTCb? − 2xTCb? .(4) For diagonal CTC, the middle quadratic term on the RHS becomes trace(CTC), independent of b?. As a consequence, when C has orthogonal columns, abr?g∈mH?min?x − Cb??22 = sgn(CTx) ,(5) where sgn(·) is the element-wise sign function. Cluster centers are depicted by dots, and cluster boundaries by dashed lines. (Left) Clusters formed by a 2-cube with no rotation, scaling or translation; centers = {b? |b? ∈ H2? }. (Right) Rotation, scaling and translation are used to reduce distances between data points and cluster centers; centers = {μ + RDb? | b? ∈ H2? }. To reduce quantization error further we can also introduce an offset, denoted μ, to translate x. Taken together with (5), this leads to the loss function for the model we call orthogonal k-means (ok-means):2 ?ok-means(C,μ) = x?∈Db?m∈iHn?m?x − μ − Cb??22.

The transform, via C and μ, maps the hypercube vertices onto the input feature space, ideally as close as possible to the data points. The matrix C has orthogonal columns and can therefore be expressed in terms of rotation and scaling; i.e., C ≡ RD, where R ∈ Rp×m has orthonormal cinoglu;m i.ne.s, ( CRT ≡R = R DIm,) w, ahnerde eD R Ris ∈ diagonal and positive definite. The goal of learning is to find the parameters, R, D, and μ, which minimize quantization error. Fig. 1 depicts a small set of 2D data points (red x’s) and two possible quantizations. Fig. 1 (left) depicts the vertices of a 2-cube with C = I2 and zero translation. The cluster regions are simply the four quadrants of the 2D space. The distances between data points and cluster centers, i.e., the quantization errors, are relatively large. By comparison, Fig. 1 (right) shows how a transformed 2-cube, the full model, can greatly reduce quantization errors. 3.1. Learning ok-means To derive the learning algorithm for ok-means we first rewrite the objective in matrix terms. Given n data points, let X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] ∈ Rp×n.

Like k-means, coordinate descent is effective for optimizing (8). We first initialize μ and R, and then iteratively optimize ?ok-means with respect to B?, D, R, and μ: • Optimize B? and D: With straightforward algebraic manipulation, one can show that ?ok-means = ?RTX?−DB??f2 + ?R⊥TX??f2 , (9) where columns of R⊥ span the orthogonal complement of the column-space of R (i.e., the block matrix [R R⊥] is orthogonal). It follows that, given X? and R, we can optimize the first term in (9) to solve for B? and D. Here, DB? is the leastsquares approximation to RTX?, where RTX? and DB? × are m n.

Optimize μ: Given R, B? and D, the optimal μ is given by the column average of X −RDB?: μ ← mcoeluamn(X−RDB?) (12) 3.2. Approximate nearest neighbor search One application of scalable quantization is ANN search. Before introducing more advanced quantization techniques, we describe some experimental results with ok-means on Euclidean ANN search. The benefits of ok-means for ANN search are two-fold. Storage costs for the centers is reduced to O(log k), from O(k) with k-means. Second, substantial speedups are possible by exploiting fast methods for NN search on binary codes in Hamming space (e.g., [13]). Generally, in terms of a generic quantizer q(·), there are twoG neanteurraalll ways etrom messti omfa ate g ethneer dicis qtaunanceti z beetrw qe(·e)n, ttwheor vectors, v and u [7].

For ANN search, in a pre-processing stage, each database entry, u, is encoded into a binary vector corresponding to the cluster center index to which u is assigned. At test time, the queries may or may not be encoded into indices, depending on whether one uses SQD or AQD. In the ok-means model, the quantization of an input x is straightforwardly shown to be qok(x) = μ + RD sgn(RT(x − μ)) . (13) The corresponding m-bit cluster index is sgn(RT(x − μ)). Given two indices, namely b?1 , b?2 ∈ {−1, +1}m,( txhe − symmetric ok-means quantizer distance∈ ∈is { SQDok(b?1, b?2) = ?μ + RDb?1 − μ − RDb?2 ?22 = ?D(b?1 − b?2)?22 .(14) In effect, SQDok is a weighted Hamming distance. It is the sum of the squared diagonal entries of D corresponding to bits where b?1 and b?2 differ. Interestingly, in our experiments with ok-means, Hamming and weighted Hamming distances yield similar results. Thus, in ok-means experiments we simply report results for Hamming distance, to facilitate comparisons with other techniques. When the scaling in ok-means is constrained to be isotropic (i.e., D = αIm for α ∈ R+), then SQDok becomes a constant multiple off othre α αu ∈sua Rl Hamming distance. As discussed in Sec. 5, this isotropic ok-means is closely related to ITQ [5]. The ok-means AQD between a feature vector x and a cluster index b?, is defined as AQDok(x, b?) = ?x −μ − RDb??22 = ?RTx? − Db??22 + ?R⊥Tx??22 , (15) where x? = x−μ.

Without this term, AQDok becomes a form of asymmetric Hamming (AH) distance between RTx? and b?. While previous work [6] discussed various ad hoc AH distance measures for binary hashing, interestingly, the optimal AH distance for ok-means is derived directly in our model. 333000111977 1M SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) lRc@aeR0 . 206148 10 RIoPT1Qk K−Q m( AHeDa)Hn )s (AH)10K Figure 2. Euclidean ANN retrieval results for different methods and distance functions on the 1M SIFT dataset. 3.3. Experiments with ok-means Following [7], we report ANN search results on 1M SIFT, a corpus of 128D SIFT descriptors with disjoint sets of 100K training, 1M base, and 10K test vectors. The training set is used to train models. The base set is the database, and the test points are queries. The number of bits m is typically less than p, but no pre-processing is needed for dimensionality reduction. Rather, to initialize learning, R is a random rotation of the first m principal directions of the training data, and μ is the mean of the data. For each query we find R nearest neighbors, and compute Recall@R, the fraction of queries for which the ground-truth Euclidean NN is found in the R retrieved items. Fig. 2 shows the Recall@R plots for ok-means with Hamming (H) ≈ SQDok and asymmetric Hamming (AH) H≡a mAmQiDngok ( Hd)is t≈an SceQ, vs. ITQ [5] and PQ [7]. The PQ ≡met AhoQdD exploits a more complex asymmetric distance func- tion denoted AD ≡ AQDck (defined in Sec. 6. 1). Note first tthioant od ke-nmoeteadns A improves upon ITQ, with both Hamming and asymmetric Hamming distances. This is due to the scaling parameters (i.e., D) in ok-means. If one is interested in Hamming distance efficient retrieval, ok-means is prefered over ITQ. But better results are obtained with the asymmetric distance function. Fig. 2 also shows that PQ achieves superior recall rates. This stems from its joint encoding of multiple feature dimensions. In ok-means, each bit represents a partition ofthe feature space into two clusters, separated by a hyperplane. The intersection of m orthogonal hyperplanes yields 2m regions. Hence we obtain just two clusters per dimension, and each dimension is encoded independently. In PQ, by comparison, multiple dimensions are encoded jointly, with arbitrary numbers of clusters. PQ thereby captures statistical dependencies among different dimensions. We next extend ok-means to jointly encode multiple dimensions. 4. Cartesian k-means In the Cartesian k-means (ck-means) model, each region center is expressed parametrically as an additive combination of multiple subcenters.

Finally, assume that each cluster center, c, is the∈ sum of exactly one element from each subcenter set: = ?C(i)b(i) m c i?= ?1 , (16) where b(i) ∈ H1/h is a 1-of-h encoding. As a conc∈re Hte example (see Fig. 3), suppose we are given 4D inputs, x ∈ R4, and we split each datum into m = 2 parts: z(1) = ?I2 0? x , and Then, suppose w?e z(2) = ?0 I2? x .(17) qu?antize each part, z(?1) and? z(2) , sepa- × rately. As depicted in Fig. 3 (left and middle), we could use h = 5 subcenters for each one. Placing the corresponding subcenters in the columns of 4 5 matrices C(1) and C(2) , C(1)=?d1d20d2×35d4d5?, C(2)=?d?1d?20d2×?35d?4d?5?, we obtain a model (16) that provides 52 possible centers with which to quantize the data. More generally, the total number of model centers is k = hm. Each center is a member of the Cartesian product of the subcenter sets, hence the name Cartesian k-means. Importantly, while the number of centers is hm, the number of subcenters is only mh. The model provides a super-linear number of centers with a linear number of parameters. The learning objective for Cartesian k-means is ?ck-means(C) =x?∈D{b(mi)}inim=1???x −i?=m1C(i)b(i)??22 where b(i) ∈ H1/h, and C ≡ [C(1), ··· , (18) C(m)] ∈ Rp×mh. [b(1)T, ··· ,b(m)T] If we let bT ≡ then the second sum in (18) can be expressed succinctly as Cb. 3While here we assume a fixed cardinality for all subcenter sets, the model is easily extended to allow sets with different cardinalities. 333000112088 The key problem with this formulation is that the min- imization of (18) with respect to the b(i) ’s is intractable. Nevertheless, motivated by orthogonal k-means (Sec. 3), encoding can be shown to be both efficient and exact if we impose orthogonality constraints on the sets of subcenters. To that end, assume that all subcenters in different sets are pairwise orthogonal; i.e., ∀i,j | i = j C(i)TC(j) = 0h×h .(19) Each subcenter matrix C(i) spans a linear subspace of Rp, and the linear subspaces for different subcenter sets do not intersect. Hence, (19) implies that only the subcenters in C(i) can explain the projection of x onto the C(i) subspace. In the example depicted in Fig. 3, the input features are simply partitioned (17), and the subspaces clearly satisfy the orthogonality constraints. It is also clear that C ≡ [ C(1) C(2)] is block diagonal, Iwtit ihs 2 a ×lso o5 c bleloacrks t,h adte Cnote ≡d D(1) and D(]2 i)s . bTlohec quantization error t×he5re bfolorcek bse,c doemnoeste ?x − Cb?22 = ???zz((12))?−?D0(1) D0(2)? ?b ( 21) ? ?2 = ?????z(1)−D(1)b(1)??2+???z(2)−D(2??)b(2)??2. In words, the squa??zred quantization?? erro??r zis the sum of t??he squared errors on the subspaces. One can therefore solve for the binary coefficients of the subcenter sets independently. In the general case, assuming (19) is satisfied, C can be expressed as a product R D, where R has orthonormal columns, and D is block diagonal; i.e., C = R D where Ra=nd[hRe(n1c),e·C(,i)R=(mR)]i,Dan(di).DW=i⎢t⎡⎣⎢hDs0i.(1≡)Dra0(n2)k.

This≡ ≡shRows that, with orthogonality constraints (19), the ck-means encoding problem can be split into m independent sub-encoding problems, one for each subcenter set.

Alternatively, one could perform NN search in p-dim C(i) ’s, to find the b(i) ’s, which costs O(mhp). Table 1 summerizes the models in terms of their number of centers, index size, and cost of storage and encoding. 4.1. Learning ck-means We can re-write the ck-means objective (18) in matrix form with the Frobenius norm; i.e., ?ck-means(R, D, B) = ? X − RDB ?f2 (22) where the columns of X and B comprise the data points and the subcenter assignment coefficients. The input to the learning algorithm is the training data X, the number of subcenter sets m, the cardinality of the subcenter sets h, and an upper bound on the rank of C, i.e., s. In practice, we also let each rotation matrix R(i) have the same number of columns, i.e., si = s/m. The outputs are the matrices {R(i) } and {D(i) } that provide a local minima of (22).

Relations and related work As mentioned above, there are close mathematical relationships between ok-means, ck-means, ITQ for binary hashing [5], and PQ for vector quantization [7]. It is instructive to specify these relationships in some detail. Iterative Quantization vs. Orthogonal k-means. ITQ [5] is a variant of locality-sensitive hashing, mapping data to binary codes for fast retrieval. To extract m-bit codes, ITQ first zero-centers the data matrix to obtain X?. PCA is then used for dimensionality reduction, fromp down to m dimensions, after which the subspace representation is randomly rotated. The composition of PCA and the random rotation can be expressed as WTX? where W ∈ Rp×m. ITQ then solves for the m×m rotation mawthriex,r eR W, t ∈hatR minimizes ?ITQ(B?, R) = ?RTWTX?− B??f2 , s.t. RTR = Im×m, (23) where B? ∈ {−1, +1}n×p. ITQ ro∈tate {s− t1h,e+ subspace representation of the data to match the binary codes, and then minimizes quantization error within the subspace. By contrast, ok-means maps the binary codes into the original input space, and then considers both the quantization error within the subspace and the out-of-subspace projection error. A key difference is the inclusion of ?R⊥X? ?f2 in the ok-means objective (9). This is important s ?inRce one can often reduce quantization errors by projecting out significant portions of the feature space. Another key difference between ITQ and ok-means is the inclusion of non-uniform scaling in ok-means. This is important when the data are not isotropic, and contributes to the marked improvement in recall rates in Fig. 2. Orthogonal k-means vs. Cartesian k-means. We next show that ok-means is a special case of ck-means with h = 2, where each subcenter set has two elements. To this end, let C(i) = and let b(i) = be the ith subcenter matrix selection vector. Since b(i) is a 1-of-2 encoding (?10? or ?01?), it follows that: [c(1i) c2(i)], b1(i)c(1i)+ b(2i)c2(i) = [b(1i) b2(i)]T c(1i)+2 c2(i)+ bi?c1(i)−2 c2(i), (24) b1(i) − b2(i) where bi? ≡ ∈ {−1, +1}. With the following setting of t≡he bok-m−e abns parameters, μ=?i=m1c1(i)+2c(2i),andC=?c1(1)−2c2(1),...,c1(m)−2c2(m)?, it should be clear that ?i C(i)b(i) = μ + Cb?, where b? ∈ {−1, +1}m, and b??i is the ith bit of b?, used in (24). Similarly, one can also map ok-means parameters onto corresponding subcenters for ck-means. Thus, there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the parameterizations of cluster centers in ok-means and ck-means for h = 2. The benefits of ok-means are its small number of parameters, and its intuitive formulation. The benefit of the ck-means generalization is its joint encoding of multiple dimensions with an arbitrary number of centers, allowing it to capture intrinsic dependence among data dimensions. Product Quantization vs. Cartesian k-means. PQ first splits the input vectors into m disjoint sub-vectors, and then quantizes each sub-vector separately using a subquantizer. Thus PQ is a special case of ck-means where the rotation R is not optimized; rather, R is fixed in both learning and retrieval. This is important because the sub-quantizers act independently, thereby ignoring intrasubspace statistical dependence. Thus the selection of subspaces is critical for PQ [7, 8]. J e´gou et al. [8] suggest using PCA, followed by random rotation, before applying PQ to high-dimensional vectors. Finding the rotation to minimize quantization error is mentioned in [8], but it was considered too difficult to estimate. Here we show that one can find a rotation to minimize the quantization error. The ck-means learning algorithm optimizes sub-quantizers in the inner loop, but they interact in an outer loop that optimizes the rotation (Sec. 4.1). 6. Experiments 6.1. Euclidean ANN search Euclidean ANN is a useful task for comparing quantization techniques. Given a database of ck-means indices, and a query, we use Asymmetric and Symmetric ck-means quantizer distance, denoted AQDck and SQDck. The AQDck between a query x and a binary index b ≡ ?b(1)T, ...,b(m)T?T, derived in (21), is AQDck(x,b) ?m?z(i)−D(i)b(i)?22+ ?R⊥Tx?22.(25) = i?= ?1 ?z(i)−D(i)b(i)?22is the distance between the ithpro- Here, jection?? of x, i.e., z(i) , ?a?nd a subcenter projection from D(i) selecte?d by b(i) .

So computing AQDck entails m lookups and additions, somewhat more costly than Hamming distance. The last term on the RHS of (25) is irrelevant for NN search. Since PQ is a special case of ck-means with pre-defined subspaces, the same distances are used for PQ (cf. [7]). The SQDck between binary codes b1 and b2 is given by SQDck(b1,b2) = ?m?D(i)b1(i)− D(i)b2(i)?22.(26) i?= ?1 Since b1(i) and b(2i) are 1-of-?h encodings, an m×h?×h lookup table can be createadre t 1o- sft-ohre e nacllo pairwise msu×bh×-dhis ltaonockeusp. 333000222200 1M SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) 1M GIST, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) 1B SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) Re@acl0 .4186021RcIPoTQk0−Q m( SAeDaH)n s (SADH)1K0 .1642081 0RIocP1TkQ −K m (SAeDHa)n s (ASHD1)0K .186420 1 R0IoPc1TkQ −KQm( ASe DaHn) s (SADH1)0K Figure 4. Euclidean NN recall@R (number of items retrieved) based on different quantizers and corresponding distance functions on the 1M SIFT, 1M GIST, and 1B SIFT datasets. The dashed curves use symmetric distance. (AH ≡ AQDok, SD ≡ SQDck, AD ≡ AQDck) While the cost of computing SQDck is the same as AQDck, SQDck could also be used to estimate the distance between the indexed database entries, for diversifying the retrieval results, or to detect near duplicates, for example. Datasets. We use the 1M SIFT dataset, as in Sec. 3.3, along with two others, namely, 1M GIST (960D features) and 1B SIFT, both comprising disjoint sets of training, base and test vectors. 1M GIST has 500K training, 1M base, and 1K query vectors. 1B SIFT has 100M training, 1B base, and 10K query points. In each case, recall rates are averaged over queries in test set for a database populated from the base set. For expedience, we use only the first 1M training points for the 1B SIFT experiments. Parameters. In ANN experiments below, for both ckmeans and PQ, we use m = 8 and h = 256. Hence the number of clusters is k = 2568 = 264, so 64-bits are used as database indices. Using h = 256 is particularly attractive because the resulting lookup tables are small, encoding is fast, and each subcenter index fits into one byte. As h increases we expect retrieval results to improve, but encoding and indexing of a query to become slower. Initialization. To initialize the Di’s for learning, as in kmeans, we simply begin with random samples from the set of Zi’s (see Sec. 4.1). To initialize R we consider the different methods that J e´gou et al. [7] proposed for splitting the feature dimensions into m sub-vectors for PQ: (1) natural: sub-vectors comprise consecutive dimensions, (2) structured: dimensions with the same index modulo 8 are grouped, and (3) random: random permutations are used. For PQ in the experiments below, we use the orderings that produced the best results in [7], namely, the structured ordering for 960D GIST, and the natural ordering for 128D SIFT. For learning ck-means, R is initialized to the identity with SIFT corpora. For 1M GIST, where the PQ ordering is significant, we consider all three orderings to initialize R. Results.

On 1M SIFT, the Recall@ 10 numbers for PQ and ck-means, both using AD, × are 59.9% and 63.7%. On 1B SIFT, Recall@ 100 numbers are 56.5% and 64.9%. As expected, with increasing dataset size, the difference between methods is more significant. In 1B SIFT, each feature vector is 128 bytes, hence a total of 119 GB. Using any method in Fig. 4 (including ckmeans) to index the database into 64 bits, this storage cost reduces to only 7.5 GB. This allows one to work with much larger datasets. In the experiments we use linear scan to find the nearest items according to quantizer distances. For NN search using 10K SIFT queries on 1B SIFT this takes about 8 hours for AD and AH and 4 hours for Hamming distance on a 2 4-core computer. Search can be sped up significantly; using a coarse tienri.tia Sl quantization sapnedd an pin svigenritefidfile structure for AD and AH, as suggested by [7, 1], and using the multi-index hashing method of [13] for Hamming distance. In this paper we did not implement these efficiencies as we focus primarily on the quality of quantization. Fig. 5 compares ck-means to PQ when R in ck-means is initialized using the 3 orderings of [7]. It shows that ckmeans is superior in all cases. Simiarly interesting, it also shows that despite the non-convexity ofthe optimization objective, ck-means learning tends to find similarly good encodings under different initial conditions. Finally, Fig. 6 compares the methods under different code dimensionality. 333000222311 1M GIST, encoding with 64, 96, and 128 bits Rl@ace0 .814206 1 R0cP kQ − m1 69e4216a−8 Knb −itsb 1t69248− bit10K Figure 6.

Learning visual codebooks While the ANN seach tasks above require too many clusters for k-means, it is interesing to compare k-means and ck-means on a task with a moderate number of clusters. To this end we consider codebook learning for bag-ofword√s models [3, 10]. We use ck-means with m = 2 and h = √k, and hence k centers. The main advantage of ck- × here is that finding the closest cluster center is done in O(√k) time, much faster than standard NN search with k-means in O(k). Alternatives for k-means, to improve efficiency, include approximate k-means [14], and hierarchical k-means [12]. Here we only compare to exact k-means. CIFAR-10 [9] comprises 50K training and 10K test images (32 32 pixels).

Recognition accuracy rates on the test set for different models and k are given in Table 2. Despite having fewer parameters, ck-means performs on par or better than kmeans. This is consistent for different initializations of the algorithms. Although k-means has higher fedility than ckmeans, with fewer parameters, ck-means may be less susceptible to overfitting. Table 2, also compares with the approach of [19], where PQ without learning a rotation is used for clustering features. As expected, learning the rotation has a significant impact on recognition rates, outperforming all three initializations of PQ. mean√s 7. Conclusions We present the Cartesian k-means algorithm, a generalization of k-means with a parameterization of the clus- ter centers such that number of centers is super-linear in the number of parameters. The method is also shown to be a generalization of the ITQ algorithm and Product Quantization. In experiments on large-scale retrieval and codebook learning for recognition the results are impressive, outperforming product quantization by a significant margin.

<p>Author: Julien P.C. Valentin, Sunando Sengupta, Jonathan Warrell, Ali Shahrokni, Philip H.S. Torr</p><p>Abstract: Semantic reconstruction of a scene is important for a variety of applications such as 3D modelling, object recognition and autonomous robotic navigation. However, most object labelling methods work in the image domain and fail to capture the information present in 3D space. In this work we propose a principled way to generate object labelling in 3D. Our method builds a triangulated meshed representation of the scene from multiple depth estimates. We then define a CRF over this mesh, which is able to capture the consistency of geometric properties of the objects present in the scene. In this framework, we are able to generate object hypotheses by combining information from multiple sources: geometric properties (from the 3D mesh), and appearance properties (from images). We demonstrate the robustness of our framework in both indoor and outdoor scenes. For indoor scenes we created an augmented version of the NYU indoor scene dataset (RGB-D images) with object labelled meshes for training and evaluation. For outdoor scenes, we created ground truth object labellings for the KITTI odometry dataset (stereo image sequence). We observe a signifi- cant speed-up in the inference stage by performing labelling on the mesh, and additionally achieve higher accuracies.</p><p>5 0.59605139 <a title="251-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Composite_Statistical_Inference_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">86 cvpr-2013-Composite Statistical Inference for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Joao Carreira, Guy Lebanon, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an inference procedure for the semantic segmentation of images. Differentfrom many CRF approaches that rely on dependencies modeled with unary and pairwise pixel or superpixel potentials, our method is entirely based on estimates of the overlap between each of a set of mid-level object segmentation proposals and the objects present in the image. We define continuous latent variables on superpixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then output the optimal segments from the inferred superpixel statistics. The algorithm is capable of recombine and refine initial mid-level proposals, as well as handle multiple interacting objects, even from the same class, all in a consistent joint inference framework by maximizing the composite likelihood of the underlying statistical model using an EM algorithm. In the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge, the proposed approach obtains high accuracy and successfully handles images of complex object interactions.</p><p>6 0.59406573 <a title="251-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_and_Discovering_Adversarial_Team_Behaviors_Using_Player_Roles.html">356 cvpr-2013-Representing and Discovering Adversarial Team Behaviors Using Player Roles</a></p>

<p>Author: Luca Del_Pero, Joshua Bowdish, Bonnie Kermgard, Emily Hartley, Kobus Barnard</p><p>Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Bayesian generative model for understanding indoor scenes. While it is common in this domain to approximate objects with 3D bounding boxes, we propose using strong representations with finer granularity. For example, we model a chair as a set of four legs, a seat and a backrest. We find that modeling detailed geometry improves recognition and reconstruction, and enables more refined use of appearance for scene understanding. We demonstrate this with a new likelihood function that re- wards 3D object hypotheses whose 2D projection is more uniform in color distribution. Such a measure would be confused by background pixels if we used a bounding box to represent a concave object like a chair. Complex objects are modeled using a set or re-usable 3D parts, and we show that this representation captures much of the variation among object instances with relatively few parameters. We also designed specific data-driven inference mechanismsfor eachpart that are shared by all objects containing that part, which helps make inference transparent to the modeler. Further, we show how to exploit contextual relationships to detect more objects, by, for example, proposing chairs around and underneath tables. We present results showing the benefits of each of these innovations. The performance of our approach often exceeds that of state-of-the-art methods on the two tasks of room layout estimation and object recognition, as evaluated on two bench mark data sets used in this domain. work. 1) Detailed geometric models, such as tables with legs and top (bottom left), provide better reconstructions than plain boxes (top right), when supported by image features such as geometric context [5] (top middle), or an approach to using color introduced here. 2) Non convex models allow for complex configurations, such as a chair under a table (bottom middle). 3) 3D contextual relationships, such as chairs being around a table, allow identifying objects supported by little image evidence, like the chair behind the table (bottom right).

<p>Author: Brandon Rothrock, Seyoung Park, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a compositional and-or graph grammar model for human pose estimation. Our model has three distinguishing features: (i) large appearance differences between people are handled compositionally by allowingparts or collections ofparts to be substituted with alternative variants, (ii) each variant is a sub-model that can define its own articulated geometry and context-sensitive compatibility with neighboring part variants, and (iii) background region segmentation is incorporated into the part appearance models to better estimate the contrast of a part region from its surroundings, and improve resilience to background clutter. The resulting integrated framework is trained discriminatively in a max-margin framework using an efficient and exact inference algorithm. We present experimental evaluation of our model on two popular datasets, and show performance improvements over the state-of-art on both benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.19553679 <a title="381-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Point_Clouds%3A_Scene_Understanding_by_Reasoning_Geometry_and_Physics.html">61 cvpr-2013-Beyond Point Clouds: Scene Understanding by Reasoning Geometry and Physics</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Zheng, Yibiao Zhao, Joey C. Yu, Katsushi Ikeuchi, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for scene understanding by reasoning physical stability of objects from point cloud. We utilize a simple observation that, by human design, objects in static scenes should be stable with respect to gravity. This assumption is applicable to all scene categories and poses useful constraints for the plausible interpretations (parses) in scene understanding. Our method consists of two major steps: 1) geometric reasoning: recovering solid 3D volumetric primitives from defective point cloud; and 2) physical reasoning: grouping the unstable primitives to physically stable objects by optimizing the stability and the scene prior. We propose to use a novel disconnectivity graph (DG) to represent the energy landscape and use a Swendsen-Wang Cut (MCMC) method for optimization. In experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves substantially better performance for i) object segmentation, ii) 3D volumetric recovery of the scene, and iii) better parsing result for scene understanding in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in both public dataset and our own new dataset.</p><p>6 0.1930777 <a title="381-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Hallucinated_Humans_as_the_Hidden_Context_for_Labeling_3D_Scenes.html">197 cvpr-2013-Hallucinated Humans as the Hidden Context for Labeling 3D Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Arpit Jain, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: Junctions are strong cues for understanding the geometry of a scene. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting junctions and using them for recovering the spatial layout of an indoor scene. Junction detection has always been challenging due to missing and spurious lines. We work in a constrained Manhattan world setting where the junctions are formed by only line segments along the three principal orthogonal directions. Junctions can be classified into several categories based on the number and orientations of the incident line segments. We provide a simple and efficient voting scheme to detect and classify these junctions in real images. Indoor scenes are typically modeled as cuboids and we formulate the problem of the cuboid layout estimation as an inference problem in a conditional random field. Our formulation allows the incorporation of junction features and the training is done using structured prediction techniques. We outperform other single view geometry estimation methods on standard datasets.</p><p>6 0.62457752 <a title="381-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bayesian_Grammar_Learning_for_Inverse_Procedural_Modeling.html">57 cvpr-2013-Bayesian Grammar Learning for Inverse Procedural Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Asma Rejeb Sfar, Nozha Boujemaa, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We study fine-grained categorization, the task of distinguishing among (sub)categories of the same generic object class (e.g., birds), focusing on determining botanical species (leaves and orchids) from scanned images. The strategy is to focus attention around several vantage points, which is the approach taken by botanists, but using features dedicated to the individual categories. Our implementation of the strategy is based on vantage feature frames, a novel object representation consisting of two components: a set of coordinate systems centered at the most discriminating local viewpoints for the generic object class and a set of category-dependentfeatures computed in these frames. The features are pooled over frames to build the classifier. Categorization then proceeds from coarse-grained (finding the frames) to fine-grained (finding the category), and hence the vantage feature frames must be both detectable and discriminating. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the art algorithms, in particular those using more distributed representations, on standard databases of leaves.</p><p>2 0.89356399 <a title="381-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Graphlet_Cut%3A_Exploiting_Spatial_Structure_Cue_for_Weakly_Supervised_Image_Segmentation.html">339 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Graphlet Cut: Exploiting Spatial Structure Cue for Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Luming Zhang, Mingli Song, Zicheng Liu, Xiao Liu, Jiajun Bu, Chun Chen</p><p>Abstract: Weakly supervised image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision field. In this paper, we present a new weakly supervised image segmentation algorithm by learning the distribution of spatially structured superpixel sets from image-level labels. Specifically, we first extract graphlets from each image where a graphlet is a smallsized graph consisting of superpixels as its nodes and it encapsulates the spatial structure of those superpixels. Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transform graphlets of different sizes into equal-length feature vectors. Thereafter, we use GMM to learn the distribution of the post-embedding graphlets. Finally, we propose a novel image segmentation algorithm, called graphlet cut, that leverages the learned graphlet distribution in measuring the homogeneity of a set of spatially structured superpixels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised image segmentation methods, and its performance is comparable to those of the fully supervised segmentation models.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.87240905 <a title="381-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Scene_Parsing_by_Integrating_Function%2C_Geometry_and_Appearance_Models.html">381 cvpr-2013-Scene Parsing by Integrating Function, Geometry and Appearance Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Indoor functional objects exhibit large view and appearance variations, thus are difficult to be recognized by the traditional appearance-based classification paradigm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essentialproperty to define an indoor object, e.g. “a chair to sit on ”; ii) The geometry (3D shape) ofan object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometryappearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, , functional groups, , functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate theproposed approach not only significantly widens the scope ofindoor sceneparsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance.</p><p>4 0.8681795 <a title="381-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>5 0.85455036 <a title="381-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Motion_Estimation_for_Self-Driving_Cars_with_a_Generalized_Camera.html">290 cvpr-2013-Motion Estimation for Self-Driving Cars with a Generalized Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>6 0.84183967 <a title="381-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>

<p>Author: Ian Endres, Kevin J. Shih, Johnston Jiaa, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to learn a diverse collection of discriminative parts from object bounding box annotations. Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors â€™ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>3 0.20798863 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Part_Discovery_from_Partial_Correspondence.html">325 cvpr-2013-Part Discovery from Partial Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Subhransu Maji, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of part discovery when partial correspondence between instances of a category are available. For visual categories that exhibit high diversity in structure such as buildings, our approach can be used to discover parts that are hard to name, but can be easily expressed as a correspondence between pairs of images. Parts naturally emerge from point-wise landmark matches across many instances within a category. We propose a learning framework for automatic discovery of parts in such weakly supervised settings, and show the utility of the rich part library learned in this way for three tasks: object detection, category-specific saliency estimation, and fine-grained image parsing.</p><p>4 0.20684978 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Block_and_Group_Regularized_Sparse_Modeling_for_Dictionary_Learning.html">66 cvpr-2013-Block and Group Regularized Sparse Modeling for Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Ajit Rajwade, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a dictionary learning framework that combines the proposed block/group (BGSC) or reconstructed block/group (R-BGSC) sparse coding schemes with the novel Intra-block Coherence Suppression Dictionary Learning (ICS-DL) algorithm. An important and distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that all dictionary blocks are trained simultaneously with respect to each data group while the intra-block coherence being explicitly minimized as an important objective. We provide both empirical evidence and heuristic support for this feature that can be considered as a direct consequence of incorporating both the group structure for the input data and the block structure for the dictionary in the learning process. The optimization problems for both the dictionary learning and sparse coding can be solved efficiently using block-gradient descent, and the details of the optimization algorithms are presented. We evaluate the proposed methods using well-known datasets, and favorable comparisons with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods demonstrate the viability and validity of the proposed framework.</p><p>5 0.19110128 <a title="67-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Augmenting_Bag-of-Words%3A_Data-Driven_Discovery_of_Temporal_and_Structural_Information_for_Activity_Recognition.html">49 cvpr-2013-Augmenting Bag-of-Words: Data-Driven Discovery of Temporal and Structural Information for Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinay Bettadapura, Grant Schindler, Thomas Ploetz, Irfan Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present data-driven techniques to augment Bag of Words (BoW) models, which allow for more robust modeling and recognition of complex long-term activities, especially when the structure and topology of the activities are not known a priori. Our approach specifically addresses the limitations of standard BoW approaches, which fail to represent the underlying temporal and causal information that is inherent in activity streams. In addition, we also propose the use ofrandomly sampled regular expressions to discover and encode patterns in activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experimental evaluations where we successfully recognize activities and detect anomalies in four complex datasets.</p><p>6 0.1660894 <a title="67-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_an_Object_Detector_and_Extracting_Regions_Using_Superpixels.html">217 cvpr-2013-Improving an Object Detector and Extracting Regions Using Superpixels</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiang Chen, Zheng Song, Rogerio Feris, Ankur Datta, Liangliang Cao, Zhongyang Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, efficiency of large-scale object detection has arisen as an important topic due to the exponential growth in the size of benchmark object detection datasets. Most current object detection methods focus on improving accuracy of large-scale object detection with efficiency being an afterthought. In this paper, we present the Efficient Maximum Appearance Search (EMAS) model which is an order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art large-scale object detection approaches, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our EMAS model consists of representing an image as an ensemble of densely sampled feature points with the proposed Pointwise Fisher Vector encoding method, so that the learnt discriminative scoring function can be applied locally. Consequently, the object detection problem is transformed into searching an image sub-area for maximum local appearance probability, thereby making EMAS an order of magnitude faster than the traditional detection methods. In addition, the proposed model is also suitable for incorporating global context at a negligible extra computational cost. EMAS can also incorporate fusion of multiple features, which greatly improves its performance in detecting multiple object categories. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can perform detection of 1000 object classes in less than one minute per image on the Image Net ILSVRC2012 dataset and for 107 object classes in less than 5 seconds per image for the SUN09 dataset using a single CPU.</p><p>3 0.75046915 <a title="67-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Part_Discovery_from_Partial_Correspondence.html">325 cvpr-2013-Part Discovery from Partial Correspondence</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian Dong, Wei Xia, Qiang Chen, Jianshi Feng, Zhongyang Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a subcategory-aware object classification framework to boost category level object classification performance. Motivated by the observation of considerable intra-class diversities and inter-class ambiguities in many current object classification datasets, we explicitly split data into subcategories by ambiguity guided subcategory mining. We then train an individual model for each subcategory rather than attempt to represent an object category with a monolithic model. More specifically, we build the instance affinity graph by combining both intraclass similarity and inter-class ambiguity. Visual subcategories, which correspond to the dense subgraphs, are detected by the graph shift algorithm and seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art detection assisted classification framework. Finally the responses from subcategory models are aggregated by subcategory-aware kernel regression. The extensive experiments over the PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2010 databases show the state-ofthe-art performance from our framework.</p><p>6 0.7456159 <a title="67-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Class-to-Image_Distance_with_Object_Matchings.html">247 cvpr-2013-Learning Class-to-Image Distance with Object Matchings</a></p>

<p>Author: Arpit Jain, Abhinav Gupta, Mikel Rodriguez, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: How should a video be represented? We propose a new representation for videos based on mid-level discriminative spatio-temporal patches. These spatio-temporal patches might correspond to a primitive human action, a semantic object, or perhaps a random but informative spatiotemporal patch in the video. What defines these spatiotemporal patches is their discriminative and representative properties. We automatically mine these patches from hundreds of training videos and experimentally demonstrate that these patches establish correspondence across videos and align the videos for label transfer techniques. Furthermore, these patches can be used as a discriminative vocabulary for action classification where they demonstrate stateof-the-art performance on UCF50 and Olympics datasets.</p><p>2 0.99691504 <a title="67-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Context-Aware_Modeling_and_Recognition_of_Activities_in_Video.html">94 cvpr-2013-Context-Aware Modeling and Recognition of Activities in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingying Zhu, Nandita M. Nayak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, rather than modeling activities in videos individually, we propose a hierarchical framework that jointly models and recognizes related activities using motion and various context features. This is motivated from the observations that the activities related in space and time rarely occur independently and can serve as the context for each other. Given a video, action segments are automatically detected using motion segmentation based on a nonlinear dynamical model. We aim to merge these segments into activities of interest and generate optimum labels for the activities. Towards this goal, we utilize a structural model in a max-margin framework that jointly models the underlying activities which are related in space and time. The model explicitly learns the duration, motion and context patterns for each activity class, as well as the spatio-temporal relationships for groups of them. The learned model is then used to optimally label the activities in the testing videos using a greedy search method. We show promising results on the VIRAT Ground Dataset demonstrating the benefit of joint modeling and recognizing activities in a wide-area scene.</p><p>3 0.9952724 <a title="67-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level_Hand_Detection_in_Ego-centric_Videos.html">332 cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level Hand Detection in Ego-centric Videos</a></p>

However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.99361342 <a title="67-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Blocks_That_Shout%3A_Distinctive_Parts_for_Scene_Classification.html">67 cvpr-2013-Blocks That Shout: Distinctive Parts for Scene Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mayank Juneja, Andrea Vedaldi, C.V. Jawahar, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The automatic discovery of distinctive parts for an object or scene class is challenging since it requires simultaneously to learn the part appearance and also to identify the part occurrences in images. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective method to do so. We address this problem by learning parts incrementally, starting from a single part occurrence with an Exemplar SVM. In this manner, additional part instances are discovered and aligned reliably before being considered as training examples. We also propose entropy-rank curves as a means of evaluating the distinctiveness of parts shareable between categories and use them to select useful parts out of a set of candidates. We apply the new representation to the task of scene categorisation on the MIT Scene 67 benchmark. We show that our method can learn parts which are significantly more informative and for a fraction of the cost, compared to previouspart-learning methods such as Singh et al. [28]. We also show that a well constructed bag of words or Fisher vector model can substantially outperform the previous state-of- the-art classification performance on this data.</p><p>5 0.99231005 <a title="67-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-GRASP_Recurring_Patterns_from_a_Single_View.html">183 cvpr-2013-GRASP Recurring Patterns from a Single View</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingchen Liu, Yanxi Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised method for discovering recurring patterns from a single view. A key contribution of our approach is the formulation and validation of a joint assignment optimization problem where multiple visual words and object instances of a potential recurring pattern are considered simultaneously. The optimization is achieved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with moves specifically designed for fast convergence. We have quantified systematically the performance of our approach under stressed conditions of the input (missing features, geometric distortions). We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art methods for recurring pattern discovery on a diverse set of 400+ real world and synthesized test images.</p><p>6 0.99187392 <a title="67-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries.html">185 cvpr-2013-Generalized Domain-Adaptive Dictionaries</a></p>

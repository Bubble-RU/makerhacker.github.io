<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images). This approach also leads to state-ofthe-art performance on the zero-shot learning task on AwA.</p><p>3 0.2999332 <a title="461-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Complex_Event_Detection_via_Multi-source_Video_Attributes.html">85 cvpr-2013-Complex Event Detection via Multi-source Video Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.29059646 <a title="461-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>5 0.28299096 <a title="461-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.27144513 <a title="461-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Catherine Wah, Serge Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in computer vision has addressed zero-shot learning or unseen class detection, which involves categorizing objects without observing any training examples. However, these problems assume that attributes or defining characteristics of these unobserved classes are known, leveraging this information at test time to detect an unseen class. We address the more realistic problem of detecting categories that do not appear in the dataset in any form. We denote such a category as an unfamiliar class; it is neither observed at train time, nor do we possess any knowledge regarding its relationships to attributes. This problem is one that has received limited attention within the computer vision community. In this work, we propose a novel ap. ucs d .edu Unfamiliar? or?not?

<p>Author: Zeynep Akata, Florent Perronnin, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Attributes are an intermediate representation, which enables parameter sharing between classes, a must when training data is scarce. We propose to view attribute-based image classification as a label-embedding problem: each class is embedded in the space of attribute vectors. We introduce a function which measures the compatibility between an image and a label embedding. The parameters of this function are learned on a training set of labeled samples to ensure that, given an image, the correct classes rank higher than the incorrect ones. Results on the Animals With Attributes and Caltech-UCSD-Birds datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the standard Direct Attribute Prediction baseline in a zero-shot learning scenario. The label embedding framework offers other advantages such as the ability to leverage alternative sources of information in addition to attributes (e.g. class hierarchies) or to transition smoothly from zero-shot learning to learning with large quantities of data.</p><p>6 0.79294831 <a title="461-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Object-Centric_Anomaly_Detection_by_Attribute-Based_Reasoning.html">310 cvpr-2013-Object-Centric Anomaly Detection by Attribute-Based Reasoning</a></p>

<p>Author: Dror Sholomon, Omid David, Nathan S. Netanyahu</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper wepropose thefirst effective automated, genetic algorithm (GA)-based jigsaw puzzle solver. We introduce a novel procedure of merging two ”parent” solutions to an improved ”child” solution by detecting, extracting, and combining correctly assembled puzzle segments. The solver proposed exhibits state-of-the-art performance solving previously attempted puzzles faster and far more accurately, and also puzzles of size never before attempted. Other contributions include the creation of a benchmark of large images, previously unavailable. We share the data sets and all of our results for future testing and comparative evaluation of jigsaw puzzle solvers.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72721398 <a title="461-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_for_Attribute_Localization_in_Outdoor_Scenes.html">461 cvpr-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning for Attribute Localization in Outdoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuo Wang, Jungseock Joo, Yizhou Wang, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for simultaneously learning scene parts and attributes from a collection ofimages associated with attributes in text, where the precise localization of the each attribute left unknown. Our method includes three aspects. (i) Compositional scene configuration. We learn the spatial layouts of the scene by Hierarchical Space Tiling (HST) representation, which can generate an excessive number of scene configurations through the hierarchical composition of a relatively small number of parts. (ii) Attribute association. The scene attributes contain nouns and adjectives corresponding to the objects and their appearance descriptions respectively. We assign the nouns to the nodes (parts) in HST using nonmaximum suppression of their correlation, then train an appearance model for each noun+adjective attribute pair. (iii) Joint inference and learning. For an image, we compute the most probable parse tree with the attributes as an instantiation of the HST by dynamic programming. Then update the HST and attribute association based on the in- ferred parse trees. We evaluate the proposed method by (i) showing the improvement of attribute recognition accuracy; and (ii) comparing the average precision of localizing attributes to the scene parts.</p><p>3 0.70603204 <a title="461-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding%2C_Calibration_and_Rectification_for_Lenselet-Based_Plenoptic_Cameras.html">102 cvpr-2013-Decoding, Calibration and Rectification for Lenselet-Based Plenoptic Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>4 0.70391393 <a title="461-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>5 0.69425732 <a title="461-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Enriching_Texture_Analysis_with_Semantic_Data.html">146 cvpr-2013-Enriching Texture Analysis with Semantic Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim Matthews, Mark S. Nixon, Mahesan Niranjan</p><p>Abstract: We argue for the importance of explicit semantic modelling in human-centred texture analysis tasks such as retrieval, annotation, synthesis, and zero-shot learning. To this end, low-level attributes are selected and used to define a semantic space for texture. 319 texture classes varying in illumination and rotation are positioned within this semantic space using a pairwise relative comparison procedure. Low-level visual features used by existing texture descriptors are then assessed in terms of their correspondence to the semantic space. Textures with strong presence ofattributes connoting randomness and complexity are shown to be poorly modelled by existing descriptors. In a retrieval experiment semantic descriptors are shown to outperform visual descriptors. Semantic modelling of texture is thus shown to provide considerable value in both feature selection and in analysis tasks.</p><p>6 0.68395138 <a title="461-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Object_Detection_and_Segmentation_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition.html">145 cvpr-2013-Efficient Object Detection and Segmentation for Fine-Grained Recognition</a></p>

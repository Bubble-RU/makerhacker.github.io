<p>Author: Brandon Rothrock, Seyoung Park, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a compositional and-or graph grammar model for human pose estimation. Our model has three distinguishing features: (i) large appearance differences between people are handled compositionally by allowingparts or collections ofparts to be substituted with alternative variants, (ii) each variant is a sub-model that can define its own articulated geometry and context-sensitive compatibility with neighboring part variants, and (iii) background region segmentation is incorporated into the part appearance models to better estimate the contrast of a part region from its surroundings, and improve resilience to background clutter. The resulting integrated framework is trained discriminatively in a max-margin framework using an efficient and exact inference algorithm. We present experimental evaluation of our model on two popular datasets, and show performance improvements over the state-of-art on both benchmarks.</p><p>3 0.15285535 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Label_Trees_for_Efficient_Large_Scale_Image_Classification.html">340 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Label Trees for Efficient Large Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Liu, Fereshteh Sadeghi, Marshall Tappen, Ohad Shamir, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale recognition problems with thousands of classes pose a particular challenge because applying the classifier requires more computation as the number of classes grows. The label tree model integrates classification with the traversal of the tree so that complexity grows logarithmically. In this paper, we show how the parameters of the label tree can be found using maximum likelihood estimation. This new probabilistic learning technique produces a label tree with significantly improved recognition accuracy.</p><p>4 0.129324 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Shuo Wang, Jungseock Joo, Yizhou Wang, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for simultaneously learning scene parts and attributes from a collection ofimages associated with attributes in text, where the precise localization of the each attribute left unknown. Our method includes three aspects. (i) Compositional scene configuration. We learn the spatial layouts of the scene by Hierarchical Space Tiling (HST) representation, which can generate an excessive number of scene configurations through the hierarchical composition of a relatively small number of parts. (ii) Attribute association. The scene attributes contain nouns and adjectives corresponding to the objects and their appearance descriptions respectively. We assign the nouns to the nodes (parts) in HST using nonmaximum suppression of their correlation, then train an appearance model for each noun+adjective attribute pair. (iii) Joint inference and learning. For an image, we compute the most probable parse tree with the attributes as an instantiation of the HST by dynamic programming. Then update the HST and attribute association based on the in- ferred parse trees. We evaluate the proposed method by (i) showing the improvement of attribute recognition accuracy; and (ii) comparing the average precision of localizing attributes to the scene parts.</p><p>6 0.11667579 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Subcategory-Aware_Object_Classification.html">417 cvpr-2013-Subcategory-Aware Object Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Andelo Martinovic, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Within the fields of urban reconstruction and city modeling, shape grammars have emerged as a powerful tool for both synthesizing novel designs and reconstructing buildings. Traditionally, a human expert was required to write grammars for specific building styles, which limited the scope of method applicability. We present an approach to automatically learn two-dimensional attributed stochastic context-free grammars (2D-ASCFGs) from a set of labeled buildingfacades. To this end, we use Bayesian Model Merging, a technique originally developed in the field of natural language processing, which we extend to the domain of two-dimensional languages. Given a set of labeled positive examples, we induce a grammar which can be sampled to create novel instances of the same building style. In addition, we demonstrate that our learned grammar can be used for parsing existing facade imagery. Experiments conducted on the dataset of Haussmannian buildings in Paris show that our parsing with learned grammars not only outperforms bottom-up classifiers but is also on par with approaches that use a manually designed style grammar.</p><p>4 0.62814248 <a title="136-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_Structural_Alternatives_and_Sharing_into_Hierarchy_for_Multiclass_Object_Recognition_and_Detection.html">221 cvpr-2013-Incorporating Structural Alternatives and Sharing into Hierarchy for Multiclass Object Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin, Lichao Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a reconfigurable model to recognize and detect multiclass (or multiview) objects with large variation in appearance. Compared with well acknowledged hierarchical models, we study two advanced capabilities in hierarchy for object modeling: (i) “switch” variables(i.e. or-nodes) for specifying alternative compositions, and (ii) making local classifiers (i.e. leaf-nodes) shared among different classes. These capabilities enable us to account well for structural variabilities while preserving the model compact. Our model, in the form of an And-Or Graph, comprises four layers: a batch of leaf-nodes with collaborative edges in bottom for localizing object parts; the or-nodes over bottom to activate their children leaf-nodes; the andnodes to classify objects as a whole; one root-node on the top for switching multiclass classification, which is also an or-node. For model training, we present an EM-type algorithm, namely dynamical structural optimization (DSO), to iteratively determine the structural configuration, (e.g., leaf-node generation associated with their parent or-nodes and shared across other classes), along with optimizing multi-layer parameters. The proposed method is valid on challenging databases, e.g., PASCAL VOC2007and UIUCPeople, and it achieves state-of-the-arts performance.</p><p>5 0.62354344 <a title="136-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Hyeongwoo Kim, Hailin Jin, Sunil Hadap, Inso Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to separate specular reflection from a single image. Separating an image into diffuse and specular components is an ill-posed problem due to lack of observations. Existing methods rely on a specularfree image to detect and estimate specularity, which however may confuse diffuse pixels with the same hue but a different saturation value as specular pixels. Our method is based on a novel observation that for most natural images the dark channel can provide an approximate specular-free image. We also propose a maximum a posteriori formulation which robustly recovers the specular reflection and chromaticity despite of the hue-saturation ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real and synthetic examples. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-theart methods in separating specular reflection.</p><p>2 0.83718508 <a title="136-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_Localization_of_3D_Objects_from_RGB-D_Data_Using_Segmentation_Hypotheses.html">30 cvpr-2013-Accurate Localization of 3D Objects from RGB-D Data Using Segmentation Hypotheses</a></p>
<p>Author: Byung-soo Kim, Shili Xu, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we focus on the problem of detecting objects in 3D from RGB-D images. We propose a novel framework that explores the compatibility between segmentation hypotheses of the object in the image and the corresponding 3D map. Our framework allows to discover the optimal location of the object using a generalization of the structural latent SVM formulation in 3D as well as the definition of a new loss function defined over the 3D space in training. We evaluate our method using two existing RGB-D datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-theart as methods well as a number of baseline approaches for both 3D and 2D object recognition tasks.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83383918 <a title="136-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_And-Or_Tree_Models_for_Object_Detection.html">136 cvpr-2013-Discriminatively Trained And-Or Tree Models for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Song, Tianfu Wu, Yunde Jia, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method of learning reconfigurable And-Or Tree (AOT) models discriminatively from weakly annotated data for object detection. To explore the appearance and geometry space of latent structures effectively, we first quantize the image lattice using an overcomplete set of shape primitives, and then organize them into a directed acyclic And-Or Graph (AOG) by exploiting their compositional relations. We allow overlaps between child nodes when combining them into a parent node, which is equivalent to introducing an appearance Or-node implicitly for the overlapped portion. The learning of an AOT model consists of three components: (i) Unsupervised sub-category learning (i.e., branches of an object Or-node) with the latent structures in AOG being integrated out. (ii) Weaklysupervised part configuration learning (i.e., seeking the globally optimal parse trees in AOG for each sub-category). To search the globally optimal parse tree in AOG efficiently, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. (iii) Joint appearance and structural parameters training under latent structural SVM framework. In experiments, our method is tested on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 detection , benchmarks of 20 object classes and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.82647425 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute_Queries%3A_To_Merge_or_Not_to_Merge%3F.html">293 cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute Queries: To Merge or Not to Merge?</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Diba, Devi Parikh, Ali Farhadi</p><p>Abstract: Users often have very specific visual content in mind that they are searching for. The most natural way to communicate this content to an image search engine is to use keywords that specify various properties or attributes of the content. A naive way of dealing with such multi-attribute queries is the following: train a classifier for each attribute independently, and then combine their scores on images to judge their fit to the query. We argue that this may not be the most effective or efficient approach. Conjunctions of attribute often correspond to very characteristic appearances. It would thus be beneficial to train classifiers that detect these conjunctions as a whole. But not all conjunctions result in such tight appearance clusters. So given a multi-attribute query, which conjunctions should we model? An exhaustive evaluation of all possible conjunctions would be time consuming. Hence we propose an optimization approach that identifies beneficial conjunctions without explicitly training the corresponding classifier. It reasons about geometric quantities that capture notions similar to intra- and inter-class variances. We exploit a discrimina- tive binary space to compute these geometric quantities efficiently. Experimental results on two challenging datasets of objects and birds show that our proposed approach can improveperformance significantly over several strong baselines, while being an order of magnitude faster than exhaustively searching through all possible conjunctions.</p><p>5 0.81355399 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>6 0.81325543 <a title="136-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Compressed_Tomography_Sensing.html">35 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Compressed Tomography Sensing</a></p>

</p><p>4 Prediction using these models typically comprises two key steps: learning, which involves estimation of the dependencies between variables from training data, and inference, which involves estimation of the most probable values of the variables of interest under the model.

</p><p>5 Pairwise Markov random field (MRF) is a widely-used variant of graphical models that incorporates dependencies Pushmeet Kohli Microsoft Research Cambridge http : / / re s earch . [sent-17, score-0.293]
</p><p>6 The dependencies  in pairwise random fields are typically sparse (with few exceptions, e. [sent-20, score-0.287]
</p><p>7 This enables efficient inference ofthe MAP solution under the model, but low expressive power of such sparse MRFs limits their prediction accuracy. [sent-24, score-0.285]
</p><p>8 Sequential classification is an alternative prediction mechanism that can also handle dependencies between variables. [sent-27, score-0.321]
</p><p>9 [15] inter222999888533  pret this idea as performing generalized message-passing inference in graphical models and develop the inference machines framework to explain it. [sent-46, score-0.456]
</p><p>10 Under this framework, the solution to the labelling problem is found by performing inference in a graphical model. [sent-47, score-0.304]
</p><p>11 However, instead of learning the parameters of potential functions and then performing inference using a message passing algorithm, they propose to learn the messages passed by the inference algorithm directly. [sent-48, score-0.792]
</p><p>12 While in theory inference machines can employ factors that span different parts of the scene, it remains unclear how to define them. [sent-53, score-0.412]
</p><p>13 The source (group of variables) of the factor affects the belief about the label of the destination (individual variable) by passing a message in this direction;  we incorporate prior knowledge about different kinds owfe c ionnctoerxptuoaral dependencies by means of factor types. [sent-59, score-1.39]
</p><p>14 A separate prediction function is learned for each factor type, which helps to keep them simple. [sent-60, score-0.413]
</p><p>15 The aim of factor type design is to model mid-range (scene context) dependencies that can be highly anisotropic unlike to close-range (low-level) dependencies. [sent-61, score-0.585]
</p><p>16 We show how to use these factors to account for spatial semantic context in 3D point cloud segmentation. [sent-62, score-0.419]
</p><p>17 Prior to describing the spatial inference machines framework, we review the formulation of graphical models in terms of factor graphs to settle the notation. [sent-69, score-0.693]
</p><p>18 In semantic segmentation, each variable state yv may denote the label assigned to the corresponding super-pixel—a group of co-located similar image pixels or 3D points. [sent-71, score-0.435]
</p><p>19 We define a factor f ∈ F as a group of fvoarrimab olfes f along . [sent-73, score-0.304]
</p><p>20 Pairwise random field is a special case of this formulation where each factor is a set of exactly two variables. [sent-80, score-0.304]
</p><p>21 For segmentation of image pixels or 3D point clouds, those pairwise factors typically correspond to the pairs of superpixels that are spatially close to each other and/or have similar appearance. [sent-81, score-0.408]
</p><p>22 The potential function of any given factor is typically modeled as a parametric function defined over the variables from the the factor scope and features of local scene appearance. [sent-82, score-0.776]
</p><p>23 These methods work by iteratively passing messages between variables and factors. [sent-88, score-0.456]
</p><p>24 The messages sent from factors to variables in the n-th iteration of the algorithm are computed as  μfn→v(yv)  =  ? [sent-89, score-0.72]
</p><p>25 f\{v}  (2)  222999888644  where μvn→f are the messages from variables to factors: μvn→f(yv)  =  ? [sent-99, score-0.425]
</p><p>26 To obtain the final unnormalized estimates of marginal probabilities for each variable, messages from the corresponding factors are multiplied: p(yv) ∝ ? [sent-108, score-0.523]
</p><p>27 Note that the message-passing formalism allows us to directly deal with messages rather than factors forming the graphical model. [sent-117, score-0.575]
</p><p>28 So instead of learning the factors, one may try to directly learn how to update messages that are circulating during loopy belief propagation. [sent-118, score-0.362]
</p><p>29 In their method, messages to factors are treated as arbitrary functions of the previous iteration messages to factors:  μvn→f(yv) = g ¯n? [sent-121, score-0.942]

</p><p>31 Similar to belief propagation, inference machines recompute messages iteratively, applying (4). [sent-147, score-0.597]
</p><p>32 In the last iteration, the classifier applies a function with a slightly dif-  ferent signature: for each variable it takes as argument all the messages from the neighbouring factors and returns the predicted label of the variable. [sent-148, score-0.615]
</p><p>33 The function g¯n depends on the factor f only by means of its features xf. [sent-151, score-0.304]
</p><p>34 During training, the previous iteration messages are estimated on the hold-out set. [sent-154, score-0.406]
</p><p>35 The rest of the data are used for fitting the prediction functions, where ground truth values of yv serve as values of the target variables. [sent-155, score-0.403]
</p><p>36 Spatial inference machines This section explains how we extend the inference machine model by employing the new notion of factor types. [sent-157, score-0.679]
</p><p>37 We first define d-factor (short for directed factor) using a pair p = (df , Sf) composed of a destination variable df and a set of source variables Sf. [sent-158, score-0.538]
</p><p>38 Each d-factor f belongs to one of the factor types t(f) ∈ T, which encodes how source vonaeria obfl ethse’ flaacbteolsr aynpde corresponding fceha teunrceosd impact tsoheu rlcaebel of destination. [sent-159, score-0.498]
</p><p>39 We compute the messages from the source to the destination variables using learned factor type specific functions:  (ydf ) = ? [sent-163, score-1.137]
</p><p>40 The d-factor features are combined with destination features xdf , the previous iteration beliefs about the label pn−1 (ydf ), d-factor features xf, aggregated source features xSf , and the averaged source set beliefs from previous iteration Ev∼Sf (pn−1 (yv)). [sent-167, score-0.972]
</p><p>41 In the n-th iteration of the algorithm, the belief (probability of each label yv) is defined as the weighted product of d-factor messages from Sf to df:  (pn−1(yv))? [sent-168, score-0.484]
</p><p>42 f =v }  ,  (6)  where αt(f) is the weight of the response of the factor type t(f) . [sent-172, score-0.373]
</p><p>43 This causes the loss of information about the layout of  the labels within the source region, but prevents overfitting and makes inference computationally tractable and independent of point density. [sent-174, score-0.355]
</p><p>44 [15] (a) use the previous iteration messages that have been sent to all variables that share a factor with the marked variable. [sent-180, score-0.847]
</p><p>45 Also, the scope of our predictors is smaller: they take the predicted labels for only the variables involved in a single factor, while the prediction functions used by Ross et al. [sent-185, score-0.406]
</p><p>46 [15] take concatenated messages from all the variables that share a factor with v, excluding the target factor f. [sent-186, score-1.033]
</p><p>47 We combine the results of the small-scope predictors explicitly using (6) to get the beliefs for the next iteration or final marginal probabilities. [sent-189, score-0.333]
</p><p>48 Since message prediction functions depend on the beliefs from the previous iteration, usage of the same training set for estimation of previous iteration beliefs might lead to a biased model. [sent-193, score-0.68]
</p><p>49 For a certain fold, the predictors for each factor type are trained on all the other folds, and then used to get the fold labels for the next iteration. [sent-196, score-0.49]
</p><p>50 Spatial factors are important special  types of d-factors that model dependencies between variables that represent points in some coordinate space. [sent-200, score-0.601]
</p><p>51 For example, factor types could be parameterized by a pair: Algorithm 1 Inference machine training 1:Input: labeled instance (x,y), set of factors F divided on folds f, set of factor types T, number of iter’s N. [sent-201, score-1.076]

</p><p>54 Pairwise dependencies between neighboring points may form a special factor type too. [sent-231, score-0.585]
</p><p>55 Using a large number of factor types may lead to overfitting and degradation of final predictive performance. [sent-235, score-0.459]
</p><p>56 The rows contain names of factor types and their acronyms, followed by relative coordinates of corresponding support regions  the class labels L. [sent-245, score-0.452]
</p><p>57 L1 regularization of weights is used to remove weak factor types and leads to a sparse representation. [sent-246, score-0.538]
</p><p>58 In particular, if the data lacks mid-range dependencies, the corresponding factor types’ weights are set to zero due to regularization (see Section 5). [sent-247, score-0.434]
</p><p>59 Note that this factor type selection step is conceptually similar to the one in the things and stuff model [6], although the authors solve a different problem, i. [sent-250, score-0.402]
</p><p>60 Their spatial dependencies of the form “the detection iis about 100 pixels away from the region j” are similar to our spatial factors. [sent-253, score-0.358]

</p><p>62 The red sphere and plain segment denote the destination point and superpixel in the point cloud, respectively. [sent-256, score-0.405]
</p><p>63 See Table 1 for the list of spatial factor types we use. [sent-276, score-0.481]
</p><p>64 For example, Down factor type (line 4) assumes that spatial d-factor source includes all the points lower than the destination with 10 cm  ×  gap in the 60 cm 60 cm corridor (Fig. [sent-277, score-0.944]
</p><p>65 Thus, for a tabletop segment, Down factor type collects all the points below it with 10 cm gap and including a 30 cm border (Fig. [sent-280, score-0.578]
</p><p>66 The basic classifiers (5) use concatenation of local feature vectors and previous iteration labels, which may depend on the factor type. [sent-296, score-0.393]
</p><p>67 For spatial dfactors we concatenate local features of destination, mean  previous iteration labels of source and destination, totally 56 + 2|L| values, where |L| is the number of class labels. [sent-297, score-0.296]
</p><p>68 Each of the 24 office and 28 home scenes was reconstructed from 8–9 scans. [sent-312, score-0.286]
</p><p>69 We perform 4-fold cross-validation for both home and office scenes such that no scene can be shared by two or more folds. [sent-318, score-0.286]
</p><p>70 The structural links used by our model correspond to the pairwise factors used in [8] which only operate on points that labelled with one of the 17 classes, i. [sent-319, score-0.358]
</p><p>71 This results in 690 super-pixels for the office scenes and 800 for the home scenes. [sent-322, score-0.286]
</p><p>72 The model with only structural dependencies (STR) works better than the linear CRF [8], although the same structure and features are used. [sent-334, score-0.348]
</p><p>73 It turns out that adding spatial factor types without learning weights (STR+SPAT), in spite of being well-motivated from a probabilistic viewpoint, performs worse than just using structural factors. [sent-336, score-0.733]
</p><p>74 STR+SPAT: structural and all spatial factor types are combined, all weights are assumed to be 1. [sent-340, score-0.703]
</p><p>75 STR+SPAT C: 10 factor types, learn coefficients with regularization, C = 0. [sent-341, score-0.304]

</p><p>77 The model with only structural factor types (b) misclassifies the book superpixel (on the left) and the floor superpixel (on the right), while the model with structural and spatial factor types (c) classifies the whole scene correctly. [sent-349, score-1.537]
</p><p>78 In practice, large regularization coefficients lead to the spa-  tial factor types being discarded (they are assigned zero weights). [sent-353, score-0.452]
</p><p>79 In office scenes learned spatial factor types gain 1–1. [sent-354, score-0.642]
</p><p>80 While a single wall is present in office data, corners are usual in home data. [sent-357, score-0.344]
</p><p>81 Near the corners, the relative angle the to wall is ambiguous, so “horizontal” spatial factor types are not reliable. [sent-358, score-0.579]
</p><p>82 While “vertical” factor types are still reliable in this case, they are often overpowered by structural factors, which connect the superpixels within 0. [sent-359, score-0.628]

</p><p>84 It can be seen that structural (S) factor type weights are never null, while left (Lr) and right (Rr) factor types are almost useless. [sent-387, score-1.003]
</p><p>85 Spatial factor types (Table 1) were defined suboptimally, which also provides room for improvement. [sent-389, score-0.408]
</p><p>86 The parametrization of spatial factor types with continuous variables potentially allows for efficient search of the bestperforming factor types using gradient-based or sampling techniques, which is a promising direction for future work. [sent-390, score-0.997]

</p><p>88 Spatial features of structural dependencies are not expressive enough to forbid cpuTop anywhere except on the top of cpuFront and cpuSide. [sent-393, score-0.384]
</p><p>89 Also, structural factors are restricted to the length of 0. [sent-396, score-0.313]
</p><p>90 Increasing the distance threshold for structural dependencies would lead to capturing spurious dependencies given the limited training data [8]. [sent-398, score-0.594]
</p><p>91 The model with spatial factor types classifies the floor superpixel correctly. [sent-399, score-0.694]
</p><p>92 For the model with the structural  and 9 spatial factor types, average inference time for an office scene is 0. [sent-402, score-0.774]
</p><p>93 Note that this does not include pre-processing time, where source indices and features of structural and spatial d-factors are computed. [sent-404, score-0.299]
</p><p>94 Right: error after 5 iterations when depth of trees is restricted during training  Relevance of spatial factor types. [sent-499, score-0.447]
</p><p>95 The null weights mean irrelevant factor types, so the weights can give us a clue on which subset of factor types is sufficient for modeling the relations (see Fig. [sent-501, score-0.884]
</p><p>96 In our experiments, we observed that in the first iteration only the weights corresponding to struc-  tural factors were assigned non-zero weights for both the home and office datasets. [sent-504, score-0.684]
</p><p>97 This hints to the fact that structural factors define strong relationships, which can be later improved by spatial d-factors. [sent-505, score-0.386]
</p><p>98 Another explanation is that there are typically several structural factors for each destination (that have a single weight for all) and one d-factor of each spatial type (with separate weights), so the regularization penalizes the latter more. [sent-507, score-0.778]
</p><p>99 During the entire training process, accuracy is uniformly higher in the model with spatial factor types than without them. [sent-512, score-0.515]

<p>Author: Yan Wang, Rongrong Ji, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understanding the semantics of point clouds in a wide variety of applications. However, point cloud labeling remains an open problem, due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient 3D point labels towards training effective classifiers. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the existing massive 2D semantic labeled datasets from decadelong community efforts, such as ImageNet and LabelMe, and a novel “cross-domain ” label propagation approach. Our proposed method consists of two major novel components, Exemplar SVM based label propagation, which effectively addresses the cross-domain issue, and a graphical model based contextual refinement incorporating 3D constraints. Most importantly, the entire process does not require any training data from the target scenes, also with good scalability towards large scale applications. We evaluate our approach on the well-known Cornell Point Cloud Dataset, achieving much greater efficiency and comparable accuracy even without any 3D training data. Our approach shows further major gains in accuracy when the training data from the target scenes is used, outperforming state-ofthe-art approaches with far better efficiency.</p><p>3 0.15027755 <a title="406-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonparametric_Scene_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Feature_Relevance_and_Semantic_Context.html">309 cvpr-2013-Nonparametric Scene Parsing with Adaptive Feature Relevance and Semantic Context</a></p>

We learn the relevance of individual feature channels at test time using a locally adaptive distance metric. To further improve the accuracy of the nonparametric approach, we examine the importance of the retrieval set used to compute the nearest neighbours using a novel semantic descriptor to retrieve better candidates.

<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>5 0.12367433 <a title="406-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-GeoF%3A_Geodesic_Forests_for_Learning_Coupled_Predictors.html">186 cvpr-2013-GeoF: Geodesic Forests for Learning Coupled Predictors</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Kontschieder, Pushmeet Kohli, Jamie Shotton, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Conventional decision forest based methods for image labelling tasks like object segmentation make predictions for each variable (pixel) independently [3, 5, 8]. This prevents them from enforcing dependencies between variables and translates into locally inconsistent pixel labellings. Random field models, instead, encourage spatial consistency of labels at increased computational expense. This paper presents a new and efficient forest based model that achieves spatially consistent semantic image segmentation by encoding variable dependencies directly in the feature space the forests operate on. Such correlations are captured via new long-range, soft connectivity features, computed via generalized geodesic distance transforms. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of the successful Semantic Texton Forest, Auto-Context, and Entangled Forest models. A second contribution is to show the connection between the typical Conditional Random Field (CRF) energy and the forest training objective. This analysis yields a new objective for training decision forests that encourages more accurate structured prediction. Our GeoF model is validated quantitatively on the task of semantic image segmentation, on four challenging and very diverse image datasets. GeoF outperforms both stateof-the-art forest models and the conventional pairwise CRF.</p><p>6 0.12069701 <a title="406-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems.html">6 cvpr-2013-A Comparative Study of Modern Inference Techniques for Discrete Energy Minimization Problems</a></p>

<p>Author: Aurélien Lucchi, Yunpeng Li, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a working set based approximate subgradient descent algorithm to minimize the margin-sensitive hinge loss arising from the soft constraints in max-margin learning frameworks, such as the structured SVM. We focus on the setting of general graphical models, such as loopy MRFs and CRFs commonly used in image segmentation, where exact inference is intractable and the most violated constraints can only be approximated, voiding the optimality guarantees of the structured SVM’s cutting plane algorithm as well as reducing the robustness of existing subgradient based methods. We show that the proposed method obtains better approximate subgradients through the use of working sets, leading to improved convergence properties and increased reliability. Furthermore, our method allows new constraints to be randomly sampled instead of computed using the more expensive approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation and graph cuts, which can be used to reduce learning time at only a small cost of performance. We demonstrate the strength of our method empirically on the segmentation of a new publicly available electron microscopy dataset as well as the popular MSRC data set and show state-of-the-art results.</p><p>3 0.73547673 <a title="406-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Label_Propagation_from_ImageNet_to_3D_Point_Clouds.html">242 cvpr-2013-Label Propagation from ImageNet to 3D Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Wang, Rongrong Ji, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understanding the semantics of point clouds in a wide variety of applications. However, point cloud labeling remains an open problem, due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient 3D point labels towards training effective classifiers. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the existing massive 2D semantic labeled datasets from decadelong community efforts, such as ImageNet and LabelMe, and a novel “cross-domain ” label propagation approach. Our proposed method consists of two major novel components, Exemplar SVM based label propagation, which effectively addresses the cross-domain issue, and a graphical model based contextual refinement incorporating 3D constraints. Most importantly, the entire process does not require any training data from the target scenes, also with good scalability towards large scale applications. We evaluate our approach on the well-known Cornell Point Cloud Dataset, achieving much greater efficiency and comparable accuracy even without any 3D training data. Our approach shows further major gains in accuracy when the training data from the target scenes is used, outperforming state-ofthe-art approaches with far better efficiency.</p><p>4 0.71737409 <a title="406-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Tensor-Based_High-Order_Semantic_Relation_Transfer_for_Semantic_Scene_Segmentation.html">425 cvpr-2013-Tensor-Based High-Order Semantic Relation Transfer for Semantic Scene Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Heesoo Myeong, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric approach for semantic segmentation using high-order semantic relations. Conventional context models mainly focus on learning pairwise relationships between objects. Pairwise relations, however, are not enough to represent high-level contextual knowledge within images. In this paper, we propose semantic relation transfer, a method to transfer high-order semantic relations of objects from annotated images to unlabeled images analogous to label transfer techniques where label information are transferred. Wefirst define semantic tensors representing high-order relations of objects. Semantic relation transfer problem is then formulated as semi-supervised learning using a quadratic objective function of the semantic tensors. By exploiting low-rank property of the semantic tensors and employing Kronecker sum similarity, an efficient approximation algorithm is developed. Based on the predicted high-order semantic relations, we reason semantic segmentation and evaluate the performance on several challenging datasets.</p><p>5 0.71245939 <a title="406-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonparametric_Scene_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Feature_Relevance_and_Semantic_Context.html">309 cvpr-2013-Nonparametric Scene Parsing with Adaptive Feature Relevance and Semantic Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Fernando Flores-Mangas, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: The problem of rigid motion segmentation of trajectory data under orthography has been long solved for nondegenerate motions in the absence of noise. But because real trajectory data often incorporates noise, outliers, motion degeneracies and motion dependencies, recently proposed motion segmentation methods resort to non-trivial representations to achieve state of the art segmentation accuracies, at the expense of a large computational cost. This paperproposes a method that dramatically reduces this cost (by two or three orders of magnitude) with minimal accuracy loss (from 98.8% achieved by the state of the art, to 96.2% achieved by our method on the standardHopkins 155 dataset). Computational efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Subsets of motion models with the best balance between prediction accuracy and model complexity are chosen from a pool of candidates, which are then used for segmentation. 1. Rigid Motion Segmentation Rigid motion segmentation (MS) consists on separating regions, features, or trajectories from a video sequence into spatio-temporally coherent subsets that correspond to independent, rigidly-moving objects in the scene (Figure 1.b or 1.f). The problem currently receives renewed attention, partly because of the extensive amount of video sources and applications that benefit from MS to perform higher level computer vision tasks, but also because the state of the art is reaching functional maturity. Motion Segmentation methods are widely diverse, but most capture only a small subset of constraints or algebraic properties from those that govern the image formation process of moving objects and their corresponding trajectories, such as the rank limit theorem [9, 10], the linear independence constraint (between trajectories from independent motions) [2, 13], the epipolar constraint [7], and the reduced rank property [11, 15, 13].

Wˆf (rif (cif methods [11, 6, 8] balance model complexity with modeling accuracy and have been successful at incorporating more of these aspects into a single formulation. For instance, in [8] most model parameters are estimated automatically from the data, including the number of independent motions and their complexity, as well as the segmentation labels (including outliers). However, because of the large number of necessary motion hypotheses that need to be instantiated, as well as the varying and potentially very large number of 222222555977 model parameters that must be estimated, the flexibility offered by this method comes at a large computational cost. Current state of the art methods follow the trend of using sparse low-dimensional subspaces to represent trajectory data. This representation is then fed into a clustering algorithm to obtain a segmentation result. A prime example of this type of method is Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [3] in which each trajectory is represented as a sparse linear combination of a few other basis trajectories. The assumption is that the basis trajectories must belong to the same rigid motion as the reconstructed trajectory (or else, the reconstruction would be impossible). When the assumption is true, the sparse mixing coefficients can be interpreted as the connectivity weights of a graph (or a similarity matrix), which is then (spectral) clustered to obtain a segmentation result. At the time of publication, SSC produced segmentation results three times more accurate than the best predecessor. The practical downside, however, is the inherently large computational cost of finding the optimal sparse representation, which is at least cubic on the number of trajectories. The work of [14] also falls within the class of subspace separation algorithms. Their approach is based on clustering the principal angles (CPA) of the local subspaces associated to each trajectory and its nearest neighbors. The clustering re-weights a traditional metric of subspace affinity between principal angles. Re-weighted affinities are then used for segmentation. The approach produces segmentation results with accuracies similar to those of SSC, but the computational cost is close to 10 times bigger than SSC’s. In this work we argue that competitive segmentation results are possible using a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. The proposed method is approximately 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than [3] and [14] respectively, currently considered the state of the art. 1.1. Affine Motion Projective Geometry is often used to model the image motion of trajectories from rigid objects between pairs of frames. However, alternative geometric relationships that facilitate parameter computation have also been proven useful for this purpose. For instance, in perspective projection, general image motion from rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of two elements: a 2D homography, and parallax residual displacements [5]. The homography describes the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the parallax residuals account for relative depths, that are unaccounted for by the planar surface model. Under orthography, in contrast, image motion of rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of a 2D affine transformation plus epipolar residual displacements. The 2D affine transformation models the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the epipolar residuals account for relative depths. Crucially, these two components can be computed separately and incrementally, which enables an explicit mechanism to deal with motion degeneracy. In the context of 3D motion, a motion is degenerate when the trajectories originate from a planar (or linear) object, or when neither the camera nor the imaged object exercise all of their degrees of freedom, such as when the object only translates, or when the camera only rotates. These are common situations in real world video sequences. The incremental nature of the decompositions described above, facilitate the transition between degenerate motions and nondegenerate ones. Planar Model Under orthography, the projection of trajectories from a planar surface can be modeled with the affine transformation: ⎣⎡xy1c ⎦⎤=?0D? 1t?⎡⎣yx1w ⎦⎤= A2wD→c⎣⎡yx1w ⎦⎤, (1) where D ∈ R2×2 is an invertible matrix, and t ∈ R2 is a threarnesl Datio ∈n v Rector. Trajectory icboloer mdiantartixe,s (axnwd , tyw ∈) are in the plane’s reference frame (modulo a 2D affine transformation) and (xc, yc) are image coordinates. Now, let W ∈ R2F×P be matrix of trajectory data that conNtaoiwns, tlehet x a n∈d y image coordinates of P feature points tracked through F frames, as in TocmputehW pa=r⎢m⎣ ⎡⎢ etyx e1F r.,s 1 ofA· . ·2.Dfyx r1Fo m., P tra⎦⎥ ⎤je.ctorydat,(l2e)t C = [c1, c2 , c3] ∈ R2f×3 be three columns (three full trajectories) from W, and let = be the x and y coordinates of the i-th control trajectory at frame f. Then the transformation between points from an arbitrary source frame s to a target frame f can be written as: cif [ci2f−1, ci2f]? ?c1f1 c12f c1f3?= A2sD→f?c11s and A2s→Df c12s c13s?, (3) ?−1. (4) can be simply computed as: A2sD→f= ? c11f c12f c13f ? ? c11s c12s c13s The inverse in the right-hand side matrix of Eq. 4 exists so long as the points cis are not collinear. For simplicity we refer to as and consequently A2sD is the identity matrix. A2s→Df A2fD 222222556088 3D Model In order to upgrade a planar (degenerate) model into a full 3D one, relative depth must be accounted using the epipolar residual displacements. This means extending Eq. 1 with a direction vector, scaled by the corresponding relative depth of each point, as in: ⎣⎡xy1c ⎦⎤=?0?D? t1? ⎡⎣xy1w ⎦⎤+ δzw⎣⎡a 0213 ⎦⎤. The depth δzw is relative to the arbitrary plane tion is modeled by A2D; a point that lies on would have δzw = 0.

Deter- mining the motion and structure parameters of a 3D model from point correspondences can be done using the classical matrix factorization approach [10], but besides being sensitive to noise and outliers, the common scenario where the solution becomes degenerate makes the approach difficult to use in real-world applications. Appropriately accommodating and dealing with the degenerate cases is one of the key features of our work. 2. Overview of the Method The proposed motion segmentation algorithm has three stages.

The problem is framed as an objective function that must be minimized. The objective function is the negative loglikelihood over prediction accuracy, regularized by model complexity (number of model parameters) and modeling overlap (trajectories explained by multiple models). Notice that after this stage, the segmentation that results from the optimal model combination could be reported as a segmentation result (§5). ioTnhe r tshuilrtd ( stage incorporates the results from a set of model combinations that are closest to the optimal. Segmentation results are aggregated into an affinity matrix, which is then passed to a spectral clustering algorithm to produce the final segmentation result. This refinement stage generally results in improved accuracy and reduced segmentation variability (§6). 3.

The input to our model instantiation algorithm is a spatially-local, randomly drawn subset of trajectory data Wˆ[2F×I] ⊆ W[2F×P] (§3.1). In turn, at each RANSAC trial, the algorithm draw(§s3 uniformly d,i asttr eibaucthed R, A rNanSdoAmC subsets of three control trajectories (C[2F×3] ⊂ Wˆ[2F×I]).

The residuals are determined by the differences between the predictions made by a hypothesized model Af, and the observations at each frame ?r?1f?=? w˜1?f?− Af? w˜1?s?. (11) 3D likelihoods. The negative log-likelihood term for the 3D case is based on the the 2DAPE decomposition. The 2D affinities Af and residuals rf are reused, but to account for the effect of relative depth, an epipolar line segment ef is robustly fit to the residual data at each frame (please see supplementary material for details on the segment fitting algorithm). The 2DAPE does not constrain relative depths to remain constant across frames, but only requires trajectories to be close to the epipolar line. So, if the unitary vector ef indicates the orthogonal direction to ef, then the negativ⊥e log-likelihood term for the 3D case is estimated with: L3D( wˆfi| Af,σf) = −2log⎜⎝⎛√21πσfexp⎪⎨⎪⎧−?r2if(?σfe)f⊥2?2⎪⎬⎪⎫⎞⎟⎠, ⎠(12,) which is also a zero-mean 2D Norma⎩l distribution ⎭computed as the product of two identical, separable, singlevariate, normal distributions, evaluated at the distance from the residual to the epipolar line. The first one corresponds to the actual deviation in the direction of ef , which is analyti- cally computed using rif?ef. The seco⊥nd one corresponds to an estimate of the deviat⊥ion in the perpendicular direction (ef), which cannot be determined using the 2DAPE decomposition model, but can be approximated to be equal to rif ? ef, which is a plausible estimate under the isotropic noise as⊥sumption. Note that Eq. 7 does not evaluate the quality of a model using the number of inliers, as it is typical for RANSAC. Instead, we found that better motion models resulted from Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation × Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation Input:b Traasejec frtoamrye d bata W[2F×P], number of RANSAC trials K, arbitrary Output: Parameters of the motion model M = {B , σn , ω} // determine the training set c ← rand( 1, P) ; r ← rand(rmin , rmax ) // random center and radius I] ← t ra j e ct oriesWithinDis k (W, r,c) // support subset X ← homoCoords(Wˆb) // points at base frame for K RANSAC trials do Wˆ[2F Wˆ return M = {B} optimizing over the accuracy ofthe model predictions for an (estimated) inlier subset, which also means that the effect of outliers is explicitly uncounted.

Figures 1.d and 1.e show a model’s control points and its corresponding (class-labeled) residuals, respectively. A pseudocode description of the motion instantiation algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. Details on how to determine Wˆ, as well as B, σ, and ω follow. 3.1. Local Coherence The subset of trajectories Wˆ given to RANSAC to generate a model M is constrained to a spatially local region. The probability ofchoosing an uncontaminated set of 3 control trajectories, necessary to compute a 2D affine model, from a dataset with a ratio r of inliers, after k trials is: p = 1 − (1 − r3)k. This means that the number of trials pne =ede 1d −to (fi1n d− a subset of 3 inliers with probability p is k =lloogg((11 − − r p3)). (13) A common assumption is that trajectories from the same underlying motion are locally coherent. Hence, a compact region is likely to increase r, exponentially reducing 222222666200 Figure 2: Predictions (red) from a 2D affine model with standard Gaussian noise (green) on one of the control points (black). Noiseless model predictions in blue. All four scenarios have identical noise. The magnitude of the extrapolation error changes with the distance between the control points. k, and with it, RANSAC’s computation time by a proportional amount. The trade-off that results from drawing model control points from a small region, however, is extrapolation error. A motion model is extrapolated when utilized to make predictions for trajectories outside the region defined by the control points. The magnitude of modeling error depends on the magnitude of the noise affecting the control points, and although hard to characterize in general, extrapolation error can be expected to grow with the distance from the prediction to the control points, and inversely with the distance between the control points themselves. Figure 2 shows a series of synthetic scenarios where one of the control points is affected by zero mean Gaussian noise of small magnitude. Identical noise is added to the same trajectory in all four scenarios. The figure illustrates the relation between the distance between the control points and the magnitude of the extrapolation errors. Our goal is to maximize the region size while limiting the number of outliers. Without any prior knowledge regarding the scale of the objects in the scene, determining a fixed size for the support region is unlikely to work in general. Instead, the issue is avoided by randomly sampling disk-shaped regions of varying sizes and locations to construct a diverse set of support subsets. Each support subset is then determined by Wˆ = {wi | (xbi − ox)2 + (ybi − oy)2 < r2}, (14) where (ox , oy) are the coordinates of the center of a disk of radius r. To promote uniform image coverage, the disk is centered at a randomly chosen trajectory (ox , oy) = (xbi, yib) with uniformly distributed i ∼ U(1, P) and base frame b) w∼i h U u(1n,i fFor)m. yTo d asltrloibwu efodr idi ∼ffer Ue(n1t, region ds bizaesse, tfhraem read bius ∼ r is( ,cFho)s.en T ofro amllo a u fnoirfo dirmffe rdeinsttr riebugtiioonn r ∼s, tUh(erm raidni,u ursm rax i)s.

It is worth noting that the construction of theW support region does not incorporate any knowledge about the motion of objects in the scene, and in consequence will likely contain trajectories that originate from more than one independently moving object (Figure 3).

Characterizing the Residual Distribution At each RANSAC iteration, residuals rf are computed using the 2D affine model Af that results from the constraints provided by the control trajectories C. Characterizing the distribution of rf has three initial goals. The first one is to determine 2D model inliers b2fD (§4.1), the second one is to compute estimates of the magnitude ,o tfh thee s ncooinsed at every frame σ2fD (§4.2), and the third one is to determine whether the residual( §d4i.s2t)r,ib auntidon th originates efr iosm to a planar or a 3D object (§4.3).

(15) A1f Now, assume we know the true affine transformations and that describe the motion of trajectories for the subsets Wˆ1 and Wˆ2, respectively. If is used to compute predictions for all of Wˆ (at frame f), the expected value (denoted by ?·?) of the magnitude of the residuals (rf from Eq. 11) for trajectories aing nWiˆtud1 will be in the order of the magnitude of the underlying noise ?|rif |? = σf for each i∈ {1, . . . , I}.

(17) But because σf is generally unknown, the threshold (τ) is estimated from the residual data. To do so, let be the vector of residual magnitudes where rˆi ≤ ˆ ri+1 . Now, let r˜ = median ( rˆi+1 −ˆ r i). The threshold i≤s trˆ h en defined as r τ = min{ rˆi | (ri+1 − ri) > λr˜ r}, (18) which corresponds to the smallest residual magnitude before a salient magnitude gap. Our experiments showed this test to be efficient and effective. Figure 1.e shows classlabeled residuals. Notice the presence of a (low density) gap between the residuals from the trajectories explained by the correct model (in red, close to the origin), and the rest. 4.2. Magnitude of the Noise, 2D Model r2fD Let contain only the residuals of the inlier trajectories (those where = 1), and let USV? be the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix bif ofˆ r2fD: USV?= svd??1bpf( rˆ2fD)? rˆ2fD?.(19) Then the magnitude of the n?oise corresponds to the largest singular value σ2 = s1, because if the underlying geometry is in fact planar, then the only unaccounted displacements captured by the residuals are due to noise. Model capacity can also be determined from S, as explained next. 4.3. Model Capacity The ratio of largest over smallest singular values (s1/s2) determines when upgrading to a 3D model is beneficial. When the underlying geometry is actually non-planar, the residuals from a planar model should distribute along a line (the epipolar line), reflecting that their relative depth is being unaccounted for. This produces a covariance matrix with a large ratio s1/s2 ? 1. If on the other hand, if s1/s2 ≈ 1, then there is no in 1d.ic Iafti oonn tohfe unexplained relative depth, tihn wnh thicehr case, fitting a olinne o tfo u spherically distributed residuals will only increase the model complexity without explaining the residual variance much better. A small spherical residual covariance strongly suggests a planar underlying geometry. 4.4. 3D Inlier Detection When the residual distribution is elongated (s1/s2 ? 1), a line segment is robustly fit to the (potentially con?tam 1i)-, nated) set of residuals. The segment must go through the origin and its parameters are computed using a Hough transform. Further details about this algorithm can be found in the supplementary material. Inlier detection The resulting line segment is used to determine 3D model inliers. Trajectory ibecomes an inlier at frame f if it satisfies two conditions. First, the projection of rif onto the line must lie within the segment limits (β ≤ ≤ γ). Second, the normalized distance to the rif?ef (ef?rif line must be below a threshold ≤ σ2λd). Notice that the threshold depends on the smalle≤st singular value from Eq. 19 to (roughly) account for the presence of noise in the direction perpendicular to the epipolar (ef). 4.5. Magnitude of the Noise, 3D Model let rˆf3D Similarly to the 2D case, contain the residual data from the corresponding 3D inlier trajectories. An estimate for the magnitude of the noise that reflects the use of a 3D model can be obtained from the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix of r3fD (as in Eq. 19). In this case, the largest singular value s1 captures the spread of residuals along the epipolar line, so its magnitude is mainly related to the magnitude of the displacements due to relative depth. However, s2 captures deviations from the epipolar line, which in a rigid 3D object can only be attributed to noise, making σ2 = s2 a reasonable estimate for its magnitude. Optimal model parameters When both 2D and 3D models are instantiated, the one with the smallest penalized negative log-likelihood (7) becomes the winning model for the current RANSAC run. The same penalized negative loglikelihood metric is used to determine the better model from across all RANSAC iterations. The winning model is added to the pool M, and the process is repeated M times, forming hthee p pool MM, a=n d{ tMhe1 , . . . , MssM is} r.e 5.

Details follow. Prediction Accuracy In order to determine how well a model M predicts an arbitrary trajectory w, the affine transformations estimated by RANSAC could be re-used. However, the inherent noise in the control points, and the potentially short distance between them, often render this approach impractical, particularly when w is spatially distant from the control points (see §3. 1).

The orthonormal basis S of a ω = 2D (or 3D) motion model can be determined by the 2 (or 3) left singular vectors of WB. Using S as the model’s motion matrices, prediction accuracy can be computed using: E(w, M) = ??SS?w − w??2 , (22) which is the sum of squared?? Euclidean d??eviations from the predictions (SS?w), to the observed data (w). Our experiments indicated that, although sensitive to outliers, these model predictions are much more robust to noise. Ownership variables Π ∈ {0, 1}[P×N] indicate whether trajectory p i ps explained by t {he0 ,n1-}th model (πp,n = 1) or not (πp,n = 0), and are determined by maximum prediction accuracy (i.e. minimum Euclidean deviation): πp,n=⎨⎧01,, oift hMerjw,nis=e. aMrg∈mMinjE(wp,M) (23) Regularization terms The second term from Eq. 21 penalizes situations where multiple models explain a trajectory (w) with relatively small residuals.

A spectral clustering method is applied on F to produce the method’s final segmentation result. 7. Experiments Evaluation was made through three experimental setups. Hopkins 155 The Hopkins 155 (H155) dataset has been the standard evaluation metric for the problem of motion segmentation of trajectory data since 2007. It consists of checkerboard, traffic and articulated sequences with either 2 or 3 motions. Data was automatically tracked, but tracking errors were manually corrected; further details are available in [12]. The use of a standard dataset enables direct comparison of accuracy and run-time performance. Table 1 shows the relevant figures for the two most competitive algorithms that we are aware of. The data indicates that our algorithm has run-times that are close to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art methods, with minimal accuracy loss. Computation times are measured in the same (or very similar) hardware architectures. Like in CPA, our implementation uses a single set of parameters for all the experiments, but as others had pointed out [14], it remains unclear whether the same is true for the results reported in the original SSC paper. 222222666533 Figure 4: Accuracy error-bars across artificial H155 datasets with controlled levels of Gaussian noise. Artificial Noise The second experimental setup complements an unexplored dimension in the H155 dataset: noise. The goal is to determine the effects of noise of different magnitudes towards the segmentation accuracy of our method, in comparison with the state of the art. We noted that H155 contains structured long-tailed noise, but for the purpose of this experiment we required a noise-free dataset as a baseline. To generate such a dataset, ground-truth labels were used to compute a rank 3 reconstruction of (mean-subtracted) trajectories for each segment. Then, multiple versions of H155 were computed by contaminating the noise-free dataset with Gaussian noise of magnitudes σn ∈ {0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8}. Our method, as well as SSC a∈nd { 0C.0PA1, were run on t2h,e4s,e8 }n.oi Ose-ucro mnterothlloedd, datasets; results are shown in Figure 4. The error bars on SSC and Ours indicate one standard deviation, computed over 20 runs. The plot for CPA is generated with only one run for each dataset (running time: 11.95 days). The graph indicates that our method only compromises accuracy for large levels of noise, while still being around 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the most competitive algorithms. KLT Tracking The last experimental setup evaluates the applicability of the algorithm in real world conditions using raw tracks from an off-the-shelf implementation [1] of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm. Several sequences were tracked and the resulting trajectories classified by our method. Figure 5 shows qualitatively good motion segmentation results for four sequences. Challenges include very small relative motions, tracking noise, and a large presence of outliers. 8. Conclusions We introduced a computationally efficient motion segmentation algorithm for trajectory data. Efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Run-time comparisons indicate that our method is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, with only a small loss in accuracy.

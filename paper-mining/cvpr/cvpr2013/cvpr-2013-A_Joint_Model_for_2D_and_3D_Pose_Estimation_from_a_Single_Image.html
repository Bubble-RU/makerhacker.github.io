</p><p>6 Introduction Estimating the 3D human pose using a single image is a  severely under-constrained problem, because many different body poses may have very similar image projections. [sent-12, score-0.572]
</p><p>7 In any event, most of these generative and discriminative approaches rely on the fact that 2D features, such as edges, silhouettes or joints may be easily obtained from the image. [sent-16, score-0.461]
</p><p>8 Top middle: Ground truth 2D pose (green) and the result of our approach (red). [sent-20, score-0.371]
</p><p>9 Additionally, we plot a few part detectors and their corresponding score, used to estimate 3D pose. [sent-21, score-0.289]
</p><p>10 Note that despite the detectors not being very precise, our generative model allows estimating a pose very close to the actual solution. [sent-24, score-0.769]

</p><p>12 For this purpose we formulate a Bayesian approach combining a generative latent variable model that constrains the space of possible 3D body poses with a HOG-based discriminative model that constrains the 2D location of the body parts. [sent-27, score-0.793]
</p><p>13 The two models are simultaneously updated using an evolutionary strategy. [sent-28, score-0.14]
</p><p>14 Our optimization framework simultaneously solves for both the 2D and 3D pose using an evolutionary strategy. [sent-30, score-0.459]
</p><p>15 A set of weighted samples are generated from the probabilistic generative model and are subsequently reweighted by the score given by the 2D part detectors. [sent-31, score-0.351]

</p><p>18 1these strong ties make it possible to accurately detect and estimate the 3D pose even when image evidence is very poor. [sent-36, score-0.491]
</p><p>19 Results are competitive with the state-of-the-art despite our relaxation of restrictions as we do not use any  2D prior and instead use directly raw detector outputs. [sent-38, score-0.152]
</p><p>20 Related Work Without using prior information, monocular 3D human pose estimation is known to be an ill-posed problem. [sent-40, score-0.482]
</p><p>21 One of the most straightforward approaches consists of modeling the pose deformations as linear combinations of modes learned from training data [5]. [sent-42, score-0.366]
</p><p>22 Other approaches follow a discriminative strategy and use learning algorithms such as support vector machines, mixtures of experts or random forest to directly learn the mappings from image evidence to the 3D pose space [1, 16, 20, 23]. [sent-45, score-0.514]
</p><p>23 Modern approaches detect each individual part using strong detectors [2, 25, 27, 29] in order to obtain good 2D pose estimations. [sent-48, score-0.65]
</p><p>24 The deformable parts model has also been extended to use 3D models for 3D viewpoint estimation of rigid objects [17]. [sent-49, score-0.183]
</p><p>25 Recently, the estimations of an off-the-shelf 2D detector [29] have already been used for 3D pose estimation in [24]. [sent-50, score-0.564]
</p><p>26 Yet, and in contrast to the solution we propose here, the 2D estimations are not updated while inferring the 3D shape, and thus, the final 3D pose strongly depends on the result of the 2D detector. [sent-51, score-0.409]
</p><p>27 The same applies for [3], which computes 2D and 3D pose in two consecutive steps with no feedback. [sent-52, score-0.319]
</p><p>28 Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation Figure 2 shows an overview of our model for simultaneous 2D people detection and 3D pose estimation. [sent-55, score-0.319]
</p><p>29 It consists of two main components: a 3D generative kinematic model, which generates pose hypotheses, and a discriminative part model, which weights the hypotheses based on image appearance. [sent-56, score-0.75]
</p><p>30 Drawing inspiration from the approach proposed in [2] for 2D articulated shapes, we represent this model  using a Bayesian formulation. [sent-57, score-0.129]

</p><p>32 Assuming conditional independence of the evidence maps given L, and that the part map di only depends on li, the likelihood 333666333533  of the image evidence given a specific body configuration  becomes:  N  p (D | L) =  ? [sent-70, score-0.535]

</p><p>38 Discriminative Detectors Recent literature proposes two principal alternatives for discriminative detectors: the shape context descriptors built by applying boosting on the limbs [2], and the HOG template matching approach [29]. [sent-104, score-0.16]
</p><p>39 For our purposes we have  found the HOG-based template matching to be more adequate because it matches our joint-based 3D model better as we can place a detector at each joint part instead of having to infer the limb positions from the joints. [sent-105, score-0.286]
</p><p>40 As mentioned above, each part li has an associated scale parameter si. [sent-107, score-0.118]
</p><p>41 This parameter is used to pick a specific scale among the evidence maps. [sent-108, score-0.13]
</p><p>42 Note that while some detectors, such as the head one in the first row, generally give good results, others do not, such as the left hand detector in the middle row. [sent-113, score-0.155]
</p><p>43 Our approach can handle these issues by combining these 2D part detectors with a generative model. [sent-114, score-0.521]

</p><p>45 , wN} be the set of templates in the HOG space associated to each body part. [sent-122, score-0.142]
</p><p>46 Given a body part li, its image evidence di is computed by evaluating the template wi over the entire image for a range of scales si. [sent-124, score-0.406]
</p><p>47 Figure 3 illustrates the response of three part detectors at different scales. [sent-125, score-0.289]
</p><p>48 By interpreting each detector as a log-likelihood, the image evidence of a configuration L can be computed as: N  logp(L | D)  ‚âà  score(L) =  ? [sent-126, score-0.293]

</p><p>51 Latent variables can either be mapped to the conjoint motion of various parts or be used as internal states containing internal structure of the pose. [sent-132, score-0.186]
</p><p>52 It is meant to adapt the 2D detectors and 3D generative model due to the fact they were trained independently on different datasets. [sent-134, score-0.502]
</p><p>53 Additionally, when evaluating a part detector at a point, we consider a small window from which we use the largest  detector value in order to give additional noise tolerance to the detector. [sent-135, score-0.299]
</p><p>54 Latent Generative Model Our goal is to learn a compression function: œÜ(XL) : XL ‚Üí H that maps points in the high dimensional local 3D pose space XL to a lower dimensional space H. [sent-139, score-0.402]
</p><p>55 The local pose space consists of aligning the coordinates X to a local reference so that they are independent of the global position in the world and represent only local deformation. [sent-140, score-0.319]
</p><p>56 To create the compression function we define a latent variable model of the joint distribution of a set of variables H ‚àà H and a pose XL ‚àà XL. [sent-142, score-0.686]
</p><p>57 As a first step we map the RN√ó3 continuous pose space to a discrete domain by doing vector quantization of groups of 3D joint positions. [sent-143, score-0.416]
</p><p>58 More specifically, we group the joints into five coarse parts: right arm (ra), left arm (la), right leg (rl), left leg (ll) and torso+head (th). [sent-144, score-0.37]
</p><p>59 Thus, we can map every pose to a discrete vector T = [ra, la, rl, ll, th] ‚àà K5 where ra, la, rl, ll, th are cluster indexes belonging to K = {1, 2, . [sent-145, score-0.365]
</p><p>60 We will now define a joint distribution over latent variables H ‚àà H = {1, . [sent-148, score-0.284]

</p><p>63 Figure 4 illustrates the graphical model corresponding to this joint distribution, where the graph G specifies the dependencies between the latent states. [sent-158, score-0.225]
</p><p>64 This leaves a total of 12 parameters to be learnt including the detector scale factor  Œ≤. [sent-177, score-0.114]

</p><p>66 Note that part detectors which one would assume to be most useful, such as the head, have low values. [sent-183, score-0.289]
</p><p>67 This is caused by the mismatch between the annotations used to train the 2D detectors and the 3D ground truth. [sent-184, score-0.274]
</p><p>68 These parameters are learned by translating and rotating random pose samples from the 3D training set and using them as negatives such as those seen in Fig. [sent-185, score-0.319]

</p><p>80 We evaluate three times on every 5 images using all three cameras and all three subjects for both the walking and jogging actions, for a total of 13 18 unique images. [sent-230, score-0.318]

</p><p>84 With these assumptions, each 3D pose can be estimated in roughly one minute. [sent-242, score-0.37]
</p><p>85 An interesting result is that we outperform the 2D pose obtained by [29], using their own part detectors. [sent-252, score-0.39]
</p><p>86 The coarse initialization consists in estimating the 3D location based on a 2D pose estimate and using completely random orientation and latent states for the generative model. [sent-257, score-0.908]

</p><p>97 We believe the model we have presented in this paper is a step forward to combining the works of 2D pose estimation with 3D pose estimation. [sent-303, score-0.679]
</p><p>98 We have shown it is not only possible to estimate 3D poses by applying part detectors used in 2D pose estimation, but that it is also beneficial to the 2D pose estimation itself, as the 2D deformations are being generated by an underlying 3D model. [sent-304, score-1.106]

Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose.

<p>Author: Tsz-Ho Yu, Tae-Kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenging problem of unconstrained 3D human pose estimation (HPE)from a novelperspective. Existing approaches struggle to operate in realistic applications, mainly due to their scene-dependent priors, such as background segmentation and multi-camera network, which restrict their use in unconstrained environments. We therfore present a framework which applies action detection and 2D pose estimation techniques to infer 3D poses in an unconstrained video. Action detection offers spatiotemporal priors to 3D human pose estimation by both recognising and localising actions in space-time. Instead of holistic features, e.g. silhouettes, we leverage the flexibility of deformable part model to detect 2D body parts as a feature to estimate 3D poses. A new unconstrained pose dataset has been collected to justify the feasibility of our method, which demonstrated promising results, significantly outperforming the relevant state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.25145712 <a title="14-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Class_Generative_Models_Based_on_Feature_Regression_for_Pose_Estimation_of_Object_Categories.html">82 cvpr-2013-Class Generative Models Based on Feature Regression for Pose Estimation of Object Categories</a></p>
<p>Author: Michele Fenzi, Laura Leal-Taix√©, Bodo Rosenhahn, J√∂rn Ostermann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for learning a class representation that can return a continuous value for the pose of an unknown class instance using only 2D data and weak 3D labelling information. Our method is based on generative feature models, i.e., regression functions learnt from local descriptors of the same patch collected under different viewpoints. The individual generative models are then clustered in order to create class generative models which form the class representation. At run-time, the pose of the query image is estimated in a maximum a posteriori fashion by combining the regression functions belonging to the matching clusters. We evaluate our approach on the EPFL car dataset [17] and the Pointing‚Äô04 face dataset [8]. Experimental results show that our method outperforms by 10% the state-of-the-art in the first dataset and by 9% in the second.</p><p>4 0.24802776 <a title="14-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Physical_Connections%3A_Tree_Models_in_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">60 cvpr-2013-Beyond Physical Connections: Tree Models in Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>5 0.23828387 <a title="14-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Approach_to_Pose-Based_Action_Recognition.html">40 cvpr-2013-An Approach to Pose-Based Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>6 0.2354957 <a title="14-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>

<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms.

<p>Author: Magnus Burenius, Josephine Sullivan, Stefan Carlsson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of automatically estimating the 3D pose of humans from images, taken from multiple calibrated views. We show that it is possible and tractable to extend the pictorial structures framework, popular for 2D pose estimation, to 3D. We discuss how to use this framework to impose view, skeleton, joint angle and intersection constraints in 3D. The 3D pictorial structures are evaluated on multiple view data from a professional football game. The evaluation is focused on computational tractability, but we also demonstrate how a simple 2D part detector can be plugged into the framework.</p><p>3 0.9172526 <a title="14-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>4 0.89346433 <a title="14-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Computationally_Efficient_Regression_on_a_Dependency_Graph_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">89 cvpr-2013-Computationally Efficient Regression on a Dependency Graph for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ‚Äôs position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ‚Äô positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>5 0.8908757 <a title="14-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-MODEC%3A_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">277 cvpr-2013-MODEC: Multimodal Decomposable Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multimodal, decomposable model for articulated human pose estimation in monocular images. A typical approach to this problem is to use a linear structured model, which struggles to capture the wide range of appearance present in realistic, unconstrained images. In this paper, we instead propose a model of human pose that explicitly captures a variety of pose modes. Unlike other multimodal models, our approach includes both global and local pose cues and uses a convex objective and joint training for mode selection and pose estimation. We also employ a cascaded mode selection step which controls the trade-off between speed and accuracy, yielding a 5x speedup in inference and learning. Our model outperforms state-of-theart approaches across the accuracy-speed trade-off curve for several pose datasets. This includes our newly-collected dataset of people in movies, FLIC, which contains an order of magnitude more labeled data for training and testing than existing datasets. The new dataset and code are avail- able online. 1</p><p>6 0.88920367 <a title="14-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, Jo√£o F. Henriques, F√°tima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91990894 <a title="14-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Lu Xia, J.K. Aggarwal</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) and the resulting features from RGB videos have been proven successful at activity recognition that can handle cluttered backgrounds and partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose its counterpart in depth video and show its efficacy on activity recognition. We present a filtering method to extract STIPsfrom depth videos (calledDSTIP) that effectively suppress the noisy measurements. Further, we build a novel depth cuboid similarity feature (DCSF) to describe the local 3D depth cuboid around the DSTIPs with an adaptable supporting size. We test this feature on activity recognition application using the public MSRAction3D, MSRDailyActivity3D datasets and our own dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art activity recognition algorithms on depth videos, and the framework is more widely applicable than existing approaches. We also give detailed comparisons with other features and analysis of choice of parameters as a guidance for applications.</p><p>4 0.91316998 <a title="14-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Statistical_Textural_Distinctiveness_for_Salient_Region_Detection_in_Natural_Images.html">411 cvpr-2013-Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scharfenberger, Alexander Wong, Khalil Fergani, John S. Zelek, David A. Clausi</p><p>Abstract: A novel statistical textural distinctiveness approach for robustly detecting salient regions in natural images is proposed. Rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations are extracted and used to learn a set of representative texture atoms for defining a sparse texture model for the image. Based on the learnt sparse texture model, a weighted graphical model is constructed to characterize the statistical textural distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs. Finally, the saliency of each pixel in the image is computed based on the probability of occurrence of the representative texture atoms, their respective statistical textural distinctiveness based on the constructed graphical model, and general visual attentive constraints. Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>5 0.90853924 <a title="14-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories.

On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ‚Äô ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints.

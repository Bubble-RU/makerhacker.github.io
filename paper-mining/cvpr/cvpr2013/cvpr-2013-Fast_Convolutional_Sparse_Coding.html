<p>Author: Roberto Rigamonti, Amos Sironi, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: Learning filters to produce sparse image representations in terms of overcomplete dictionaries has emerged as a powerful way to create image features for many different purposes. Unfortunately, these filters are usually both numerous and non-separable, making their use computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that such filters can be computed as linear combinations of a smaller number of separable ones, thus greatly reducing the computational complexity at no cost in terms of performance. This makes filter learning approaches practical even for large images or 3D volumes, and we show that we significantly outperform state-of-theart methods on the linear structure extraction task, in terms ofboth accuracy and speed. Moreover, our approach is general and can be used on generic filter banks to reduce the complexity of the convolutions.</p><p>3 0.21402517 <a title="164-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>4 0.14743271 <a title="164-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-stage_Feature_Learning.html">328 cvpr-2013-Pedestrian Detection with Unsupervised Multi-stage Feature Learning</a></p>

Adding to the list of successful applications of deep learning methods to vision, we report state-of-theart and competitive results on all major pedestrian datasets with a convolutional network model. The model uses a few new twists, such as multi-stage features, connections that skip layers to integrate global shape information with local distinctive motif information, and an unsupervised method based on convolutional sparse coding to pre-train the filters at each stage.</p><p>5 0.13429986 <a title="164-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Subspace_Interpolation_via_Dictionary_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation.html">419 cvpr-2013-Subspace Interpolation via Dictionary Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Ni, Qiang Qiu, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the problem where data instances of a source domain have different distributions from that of a target domain, which occurs frequently in many real life scenarios. This work focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are only available in the source domain. We propose to interpolate subspaces through dictionary learning to link the source and target domains. These subspaces are able to capture the intrinsic domain shift and form a shared feature representation for cross domain recognition. Further, we introduce a quantitative measure to characterize the shift between two domains, which enables us to select the optimal domain to adapt to the given multiple source domains. We present exumd .edu , rama@umiacs .umd .edu training and testing data are captured from the same underlying distribution. Yet this assumption is often violated in many real life applications. For instance, images collected from an internet search engine are compared with those captured from real life [28, 4]. Face recognition systems trained on frontal and high resolution images, are applied to probe images with non-frontal poses and low resolution [6]. Human actions are recognized from an unseen target view using training data taken from source views [21, 20]. We show some examples of dataset shifts in Figure 1. In these scenarios, magnitudes of variations of innate characteristics, which distinguish one class from another, are oftentimes smaller than the variations caused by distribution shift between training and testing dataset. Directly applying the classifier from the training set to testing set periments on face recognition across pose, illumination and blur variations, cross dataset object recognition, and report improved performance over the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.11856704 <a title="164-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Learning_of_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Object_Detection_in_a_Video.html">388 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Learning of Feature Hierarchies for Object Detection in a Video</a></p>

<p>Author: Peng Ye, Jayant Kumar, Le Kang, David Doermann</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of general-purpose No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) with the goal ofdeveloping a real-time, cross-domain model that can predict the quality of distorted images without prior knowledge of non-distorted reference images and types of distortions present in these images. The contributions of our work are two-fold: first, the proposed method is highly efficient. NR-IQA measures are often used in real-time imaging or communication systems, therefore it is important to have a fast NR-IQA algorithm that can be used in these real-time applications. Second, the proposed method has the potential to be used in multiple image domains. Previous work on NR-IQA focus primarily on predicting quality of natural scene image with respect to human perception, yet, in other image domains, the final receiver of a digital image may not be a human. The proposed method consists of the following components: (1) a local feature extractor; (2) a global feature extractor and (3) a regression model. While previous approaches usually treat local feature extraction and regres- sion model training independently, we propose a supervised method based on back-projection, which links the two steps by learning a compact set of filters which can be applied to local image patches to obtain discriminative local features. Using a small set of filters, the proposed method is extremely fast. We have tested this method on various natural scene and document image datasets and obtained stateof-the-art results.</p><p>4 0.68240207 <a title="164-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Sifre, Stéphane Mallat</p><p>Abstract: An affine invariant representation is constructed with a cascade of invariants, which preserves information for classification. A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained over texture databases with uncontrolled viewing conditions.</p><p>5 0.58264679 <a title="164-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>3 0.74788576 <a title="164-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_for_Structured_Prediction_Using_Approximate_Subgradient_Descent_with_Working_Sets.html">262 cvpr-2013-Learning for Structured Prediction Using Approximate Subgradient Descent with Working Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurélien Lucchi, Yunpeng Li, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a working set based approximate subgradient descent algorithm to minimize the margin-sensitive hinge loss arising from the soft constraints in max-margin learning frameworks, such as the structured SVM. We focus on the setting of general graphical models, such as loopy MRFs and CRFs commonly used in image segmentation, where exact inference is intractable and the most violated constraints can only be approximated, voiding the optimality guarantees of the structured SVM’s cutting plane algorithm as well as reducing the robustness of existing subgradient based methods. We show that the proposed method obtains better approximate subgradients through the use of working sets, leading to improved convergence properties and increased reliability. Furthermore, our method allows new constraints to be randomly sampled instead of computed using the more expensive approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation and graph cuts, which can be used to reduce learning time at only a small cost of performance. We demonstrate the strength of our method empirically on the segmentation of a new publicly available electron microscopy dataset as well as the popular MSRC data set and show state-of-the-art results.</p><p>4 0.70202053 <a title="164-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Trust_Region_for_Segmentation.html">171 cvpr-2013-Fast Trust Region for Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lena Gorelick, Frank R. Schmidt, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Trust region is a well-known general iterative approach to optimization which offers many advantages over standard gradient descent techniques. In particular, it allows more accurate nonlinear approximation models. In each iteration this approach computes a global optimum of a suitable approximation model within a fixed radius around the current solution, a.k.a. trust region. In general, this approach can be used only when some efficient constrained optimization algorithm is available for the selected nonlinear (more accurate) approximation model. In this paper we propose a Fast Trust Region (FTR) approach for optimization of segmentation energies with nonlinear regional terms, which are known to be challenging for existing algorithms. These energies include, but are not limited to, KL divergence and Bhattacharyya distance between the observed and the target appearance distributions, volume constraint on segment size, and shape prior constraint in a form of 퐿2 distance from target shape moments. Our method is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art methods while converging to comparable or better solutions.</p><p>5 0.68600482 <a title="164-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Hofmann, Daniel Wolf, Gerhard Rigoll</p><p>Abstract: We generalize the network flow formulation for multiobject tracking to multi-camera setups. In the past, reconstruction of multi-camera data was done as a separate extension. In this work, we present a combined maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation, which jointly models multicamera reconstruction as well as global temporal data association. A flow graph is constructed, which tracks objects in 3D world space. The multi-camera reconstruction can be efficiently incorporated as additional constraints on the flow graph without making the graph unnecessarily large. The final graph is efficiently solved using binary linear programming. On the PETS 2009 dataset we achieve results that significantly exceed the current state of the art.</p><p>6 0.62265855 <a title="164-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised_Dual_Clustering_for_Image_Semantic_Segmentation.html">460 cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised Dual Clustering for Image Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

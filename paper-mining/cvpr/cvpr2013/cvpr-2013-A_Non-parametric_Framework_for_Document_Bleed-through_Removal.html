<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.</p><p>3 0.10730135 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_Based_on_Filter_Learning.html">346 cvpr-2013-Real-Time No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Filter Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Ye, Jayant Kumar, Le Kang, David Doermann</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of general-purpose No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) with the goal ofdeveloping a real-time, cross-domain model that can predict the quality of distorted images without prior knowledge of non-distorted reference images and types of distortions present in these images. The contributions of our work are two-fold: first, the proposed method is highly efficient. NR-IQA measures are often used in real-time imaging or communication systems, therefore it is important to have a fast NR-IQA algorithm that can be used in these real-time applications. Second, the proposed method has the potential to be used in multiple image domains. Previous work on NR-IQA focus primarily on predicting quality of natural scene image with respect to human perception, yet, in other image domains, the final receiver of a digital image may not be a human. The proposed method consists of the following components: (1) a local feature extractor; (2) a global feature extractor and (3) a regression model. While previous approaches usually treat local feature extraction and regres- sion model training independently, we propose a supervised method based on back-projection, which links the two steps by learning a compact set of filters which can be applied to local image patches to obtain discriminative local features. Using a small set of filters, the proposed method is extremely fast. We have tested this method on various natural scene and document image datasets and obtained stateof-the-art results.</p><p>4 0.10275938 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Video_Object_Cut_in_Highly_Dynamic_Scenes.html">148 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Video Object Cut in Highly Dynamic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaobo Ren, Tony X. Han, Zhihai He</p><p>Abstract: We consider video object cut as an ensemble of framelevel background-foreground object classifiers which fuses information across frames and refine their segmentation results in a collaborative and iterative manner. Our approach addresses the challenging issues of modeling of background with dynamic textures and segmentation of foreground objects from cluttered scenes. We construct patch-level bagof-words background models to effectively capture the background motion and texture dynamics. We propose a foreground salience graph (FSG) to characterize the similarity of an image patch to the bag-of-words background models in the temporal domain and to neighboring image patches in the spatial domain. We incorporate this similarity information into a graph-cut energy minimization framework for foreground object segmentation. The background-foreground classification results at neighboring frames are fused together to construct a foreground probability map to update the graph weights. The resulting object shapes at neighboring frames are also used as constraints to guide the energy minimization process during graph cut. Our extensive experimental results and performance comparisons over a diverse set of challenging videos with dynamic scenes, including the new Change Detection Challenge Dataset, demonstrate that the proposed ensemble video object cut method outperforms various state-ofthe-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.072879262 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Unsupervised_Joint_Object_Discovery_and_Segmentation_in_Internet_Images.html">450 cvpr-2013-Unsupervised Joint Object Discovery and Segmentation in Internet Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Rubinstein, Armand Joulin, Johannes Kopf, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a new unsupervised algorithm to discover and segment out common objects from large and diverse image collections. In contrast to previous co-segmentation methods, our algorithm performs well even in the presence of significant amounts of noise images (images not containing a common object), as typical for datasets collected from Internet search. The key insight to our algorithm is that common object patterns should be salient within each image, while being sparse with respect to smooth transformations across images. We propose to use dense correspondences between images to capture the sparsity and visual variability of the common object over the entire database, which enables us to ignore noise objects that may be salient within their own images but do not commonly occur in others. We performed extensive numerical evaluation on es- tablished co-segmentation datasets, as well as several new datasets generated using Internet search. Our approach is able to effectively segment out the common object for diverse object categories, while naturally identifying images where the common object is not present.</p><p>6 0.070640162 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated_Photometric_Stereo_for_Unknown_Isotropic_Reflectances.html">443 cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo for Unknown Isotropic Reflectances</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaowu Chen, Dongqing Zou, Steven Zhiying Zhou, Qinping Zhao, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the manifold preserving editing propagation [4] essentially introduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth priorfrom matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from color sampling in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method produces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.76649123 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Background_Modeling_Based_on_Bidirectional_Analysis.html">55 cvpr-2013-Background Modeling Based on Bidirectional Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsushi Shimada, Hajime Nagahara, Rin-ichiro Taniguchi</p><p>Abstract: Background modeling and subtraction is an essential task in video surveillance applications. Most traditional studies use information observed in past frames to create and update a background model. To adapt to background changes, the backgroundmodel has been enhancedby introducing various forms of information including spatial consistency and temporal tendency. In this paper, we propose a new framework that leverages information from a future period. Our proposed approach realizes a low-cost and highly accurate background model. The proposed framework is called bidirectional background modeling, and performs background subtraction based on bidirectional analysis; i.e., analysis from past to present and analysis from future to present. Although a result will be output with some delay because information is takenfrom a futureperiod, our proposed approach improves the accuracy by about 30% if only a 33-millisecond of delay is acceptable. Furthermore, the memory cost can be reduced by about 65% relative to typical background modeling.</p><p>5 0.70521158 <a title="22-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_the_Change_for_Automatic_Image_Cropping.html">263 cvpr-2013-Learning the Change for Automatic Image Cropping</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianzhou Yan, Stephen Lin, Sing Bing Kang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Image cropping is a common operation used to improve the visual quality of photographs. In this paper, we present an automatic cropping technique that accounts for the two primary considerations of people when they crop: removal of distracting content, and enhancement of overall composition. Our approach utilizes a large training set consisting of photos before and after cropping by expert photographers to learn how to evaluate these two factors in a crop. In contrast to the many methods that exist for general assessment of image quality, ours specifically examines differences between the original and cropped photo in solving for the crop parameters. To this end, several novel image features are proposed to model the changes in image content and composition when a crop is applied. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of our method over recent cropping algorithms on a broad range of images.</p><p>6 0.67886609 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Jointly_Aligning_and_Segmenting_Multiple_Web_Photo_Streams_for_the_Inference_of_Collective_Photo_Storylines.html">235 cvpr-2013-Jointly Aligning and Segmenting Multiple Web Photo Streams for the Inference of Collective Photo Storylines</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian Dong, Wei Xia, Qiang Chen, Jianshi Feng, Zhongyang Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a subcategory-aware object classification framework to boost category level object classification performance. Motivated by the observation of considerable intra-class diversities and inter-class ambiguities in many current object classification datasets, we explicitly split data into subcategories by ambiguity guided subcategory mining. We then train an individual model for each subcategory rather than attempt to represent an object category with a monolithic model. More specifically, we build the instance affinity graph by combining both intraclass similarity and inter-class ambiguity. Visual subcategories, which correspond to the dense subgraphs, are detected by the graph shift algorithm and seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art detection assisted classification framework. Finally the responses from subcategory models are aggregated by subcategory-aware kernel regression. The extensive experiments over the PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2010 databases show the state-ofthe-art performance from our framework.</p><p>3 0.60800606 <a title="22-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>

By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>4 0.60440445 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojie Guo, Xiaochun Cao, Xiaowu Chen, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Given an area of interest in a video sequence, one may want to manipulate or edit the area, e.g. remove occlusions from or replace with an advertisement on it. Such a task involves three main challenges including temporal consistency, spatial pose, and visual realism. The proposed method effectively seeks an optimal solution to simultaneously deal with temporal alignment, pose rectification, as well as precise recovery of the occlusion. To make our method applicable to long video sequences, we propose a batch alignment method for automatically aligning and rectifying a small number of initial frames, and then show how to align the remaining frames incrementally to the aligned base images. From the error residual of the robust alignment process, we automatically construct a trimap of the region for each frame, which is used as the input to alpha matting methods to extract the occluding foreground. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the accurate and robust performance of our method.</p><p>5 0.60379374 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>6 0.60270989 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>

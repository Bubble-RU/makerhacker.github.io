The extracted primary object regions are then used to build object models for optimized video segmentation. The proposed approach has several contributions: First, a novel layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based framework is presented for detection and segmentation of the primary object in video. We exploit the fact that, in general, objects are spatially cohesive and characterized by locally smooth motion trajectories, to extract the primary object from the set of all available proposals based on motion, appearance and predicted-shape similarity across frames. Second, the DAG is initialized with an enhanced object proposal set where motion based proposal predictions (from adjacent frames) are used to expand the set of object proposals for a particular frame. Last, the paper presents a motion scoring function for selection of object proposals that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at proposal boundaries to discriminate between moving objects and the background. The proposed approach is evaluated using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods. 1. Introduction & Related Work In this paper, our goal is to detect the primary object in videos and to delineate it from the background in allframes. Video object segmentation is a well-researched problem in the computer vision community and is a prerequisite for a variety of high-level vision applications, including content based video retrieval, video summarization, activity understanding and targeted content replacement. Both fully automatic methods and methods requiring manual initialization have been proposed for video object segmentation. In the latter class of approaches, [2, 15, 23] need annotations of object segments in key frames for initialization. Frame #38 #39 #61 #62 V ideo Frames Key-?fram e Object Regions [13] ?

The third row shows primary object proposals selected by the proposed method. Note that the proposed method was able to find primary object proposals in all frames. The results in row 2 and 3 are prior to per-pixel segmentation. In this paper we demonstrate that temporally dense extraction of primary object proposals results in significant improvement in object segmentation performance. Please see Table 1for quantitative results and comparisons to state of the art.[Please Print in Color] Optimization techniques employing motion and appearance constraints are then used to propagate the segments to all frames. Other methods ([16, 20]) only require accurate object region annotation for the first frame, then employ region tracking to segment the rest of frames into object and background regions. Note that, the aforementioned semi-automatic techniques generally give good segmenta666222668 Figure 2. Object proposals from a video frame employing the method in [7]. The left side image is one of the video frames. Note that the monkey is the object of interest in the frame. Images on the right show some of the top ranked object proposals from the frame. Most of the proposals do not correspond to an actual object. The goal of the proposed work is to generate an enhanced set of object proposals and extract the segments related to the primary object from the video. tion results. However, most computer vision applications involve processing of large amounts of video data, which makes manual initialization cost prohibitive. Consequently, a large number of automatic methods have also been proposed for video object segmentation. A subset of these methods employs motion grouping ([19, 18, 4]) for object segmentation. Other methods ([10, 3, 21]) use appearance cues to segment each frame first and then use both appearance and motion constraints for a bottom-up final segmentation. Methods like [9, 3, 11, 22] present efficient optimization frameworks for spatiotemporal grouping of pixels for video segmentation. However, all of these automatic methods do not have an explicit model of how an object looks or moves, and therefore, the segments usually don’t correspond to a particular object but only to image regions that exhibit coherent appearance or motion. Recently, several methods ([7, 5, 1]) were proposed that provided an explicit notion of how a generic object looks like. Specifically, the method [7] could extract object-like regions or ‘object proposals’ from images. This work was built upon by Lee et al. [13] and Ma and Latecki [14] to employ object proposals for object video segmentation. Lee et al. [13] proposed to detect the primary object by collecting a pool of object proposals from the video, and then applying spectral graph clustering to obtain multiple binary inlier/outlier partitions. Each inlier cluster corresponds to a particular object’s regions. Both motion and appearance based cues are used to measure the ‘objectness’ of a proposal in the cluster. The cluster with the largest average ‘objectness’ is likely to contain the primary object in video. One shortcoming of this approach is that the clustering process ignores the order of the proposals in the video, and there- fore, cannot model the evolution of object’s shape and location with time. The work by Ma and Latecki [14] attempts Input Videos Figure 3. The Video Object Segmentation Framework to mitigate this issue by utilizing relationships between object proposals in adjacent frames. The object region selection problem is modeled as a constrained Maximum Weight Cliques problem in order to find the true object region from all the video frames simultaneously. However, this problem is NP-hard ([14]) and an approximate optimization technique is used to obtain the solution. The object proposal based segmentation approaches [13, 14] have two additional limitations compared to the proposed method. First, in both approaches, object proposal generation for a particular frame doesn’t directly depend on object proposals generated for adjacent frames. Second, both approaches do not actually predict the shape of the object in adjacent frames when computing region similarity, which degrades segmentation performance for fast moving objects. In this paper, we present an approach that though inspired from aforementioned approaches, attempts to remove their shortcomings. Note that, in general, an object’s shape and appearance varies slowly from frame to frame. Therefore, the intuition is that the object proposal sequence in a video with high ‘objectness’, and high similarity across frames is likely to be the primary object. To this end, we use optical flow to track the evolution of object shape, and compute the difference between predicted and actual shape (along with appearance) to measure similarity of object proposals across frames. The ‘objectness’ is measured using appearance and a motion based criterion that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at the boundaries between objects proposals and the background. Moreover, the primary object proposal selection problem is formulated as the longest path problem for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), for which (unlike [14]) an optimal solution exists in linear time. Note that, if the temporal order of object proposals locations (across frames) is not used ([13], then it can result in no proposals being associated with the prima666222779 ry object for many frames (please see Figure 1). The proposed method not only uses object proposals from a particular frame (please see Figure 2), but also expands the proposal set using predictions from proposals of neighboring frame. The combination of proposal expansion, and the predicted shape based similarity criteria results in temporally dense and spatially accurate primary object proposal extraction. We have evaluated the proposed approach using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods In Section 2, the proposed layered DAG based object selection approach is introduced and discussed in detail; In Section 3, both qualitative and quantitative experiments results for two publicly available datasets and some other challenging videos are shown; The paper is concluded in Section 4. 2. Layered DAG based Video Object Segmentation 2.1. The Framework The proposed framework consists of 3 stages (as shown in Figure 3): 1. Generation of object proposals per-frame and then expansion of the proposal set for each frame based on object proposals in adjacent frames. 2. Generation of a layered DAG from all the object proposals in the video. The longest path in the graph fulfills the goal of maximizing ob- jectness and similarity scores, and represents the most likely set of proposals denoting the primary object in the video. 3. The primary object proposals are used to build object and background models using Gaussian mixtures, and a graph-cuts based optimization method is used to obtain refined per-pixel segmentation. Since the proposed approach is centered around layered DAG framework for selection of primary object regions, we will start with its description. 2.2. Layered DAG Structure We want to extract object proposals with high objectness likelihood, high appearance similarity and smoothly varying shape from the set of all proposals obtained from the video. Also since we want to extract the primary object only, we want to extract at most a single proposal per frame. Keeping these objectives in mind, the layered DAG is formed as follows. Each object proposal is represented by two nodes: a ‘beginning node’ and an ‘ending node’ and there are two types of edges: unary edges and binary edges. The unary edges have weights which measure the objectness of a proposal. The details of the function for unary weight assignments (measuring objectness) are given in section 2.2. 1. All the beginning nodes in the same frame form a layer, so as the ending nodes. A directed unary edge is built from beginning node to ending node. Thus, each video frame is represented by two layers in the graph. DiFrame i-1 Frame i Frame i+1 s… … La2i-ye3rL2ai-y2erL2ayi-1erLa2yierL2ai+y1erL2ai+y2er… … t Figure 4. Layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure. Node “s” and “t” are source and sink nodes respectively, which have zero weights for edges with other nodes in the graph. The yellow nodes and the green nodes are “beginning nodes” and “ending nodes” respectively and they are paired such that each yellow-green pair represents an object proposal. All the beginning nodes in the same frame are arranged in a layer and the same as the ending nodes. The green edges are the unary edges and red edges are the binary edges. rected binary edges are built from any ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. The binary edges have weights which measure the appearance and shape similarity between the corresponding object proposals across frames. The binary weight assignment functions are introduced in Section 2.2.2. Figure 4 is an illustration of the graph structure. It shows frame i− 1, iand i 1 of the graph, with corresponding layers oif − −2i 1 1−,3 i, a2nid d− i2, + +2 i1 1− o1f, h2ie, 2gira+p 1h ,a wndi t2hi +co2rr. eNspooten tdhinagt, only 3s object proposals are s1h, o2wi,n 2 ifo+r 1e aacnhd layer f.or N simplic- + ity, however, there are usually hundreds of object proposals for each frame and the number of object proposals for different frames are not necessary the same. The yellow nodes are “beginning nodes”, the green nodes are “ending nodes”, the green edges are unary edges with weights indicating objectness and the red edges are binary edges with weights indicating appearance and shape similarity (note that the graph only shows some of the binary edges for simplicity). There is also a virtual source node s and a sink node t with 0 weighted edges (black edges) to the graph. Note that, it is not necessary to build binary edges from an ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. In practice, only building binary edges to the next three subsequent frames is enough for most of the videos. 2.2.1 Unary Edges Unary edges measure the objectness of the proposals. Both appearance and motion are important to infer the objectness, so the scoring function for object proposals is defined as Sunary (r) = A(r) + M(r), in which r is any object proposal, A(r) is the appearance score and M(r) is the motion score. We define M(r) as the average Frobenius norm of optical flow gradient around the boundary of object pro666232880 Figure 5. Optical Flow Gradient Magnitude Motion Scoring. In row 1, column 1 shows the original video frame, column 2 is one of the object proposals and column 3 shows dilated boundary of the object proposal. In row 2, column 1 shows the forward optical flow of the frame, column 2 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude map and column 3 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude response for the specific object proposal around the boundary. [Please Print in Color] posal r. The Frobenius norm of optical flow gradients is defined as: ??UX??F=?????uvxx uvy ?????F=?ux2+ u2y+ vx2+ vy2, in ?whic?h U =? (1) (u, v) is th??e forward optical flow of the frame, ux , vx and uy, vy are optical flow gradients in x and y directions respectively. The intuition behind this motion scoring function is that, the motions of foreground object and background are usually distinct, so boundary of moving objects usually implies discontinuity in motion. Therefore, ideally, the gradient of optical flow should have high magnitude around foreground object boundary (this phenomenon could be easily observed from Figure 5). In equation 1, we use the Frobenius norm to measure the optical flow gradient magnitude, the higher the value, the more likely the region is from a moving object. In practice, usually the maximum of optical flow gradient magnitude does not coincide exactly with the moving object boundary due to underlying approximation of optical flow calculation. Therefore, we dilate the object proposal boundary and get the average optical flow gradient magnitude as the motion score. Figure 5 is an illustration of this process. The appearance scoring function A(r) is measured by the objectness ([7]). 2.2.2 Binary Edges Binary edges measure the similarity between object proposals across frames. For measuring the similarity of regions, color, location, size and shape are the properties to be considered. We define the similarity between regions as the weight of binary edges as follows: Sbinary(rm, rn) = λ · Scolor(rm, rn) · Soverlap(rm, rn), (2) in which rm and rn are regions from frame m and n, λ is a constant value for adjusting the ratio between unary and binary edges, Soverlap is the overlap similarity between regions and Scolor is the color histogram similarity: Scolor(rm, rn) = hist(rm) · hist(rn)T, (3) in which hist(r) is the normalized color histogram for a region r. Soverlap(rm,rn) =||rrmm∩∪ wwaarrppmmnn((rrnn))||, (4) in which warpmn (rn) is the warped region from rn by optical flow to frame m. It is clear that Scolor encodes the color similarity between regions and Soverlap encodes the size and location similarity between regions. If two regions are close, and the sizes and shapes are similar, the value would be higher, and vice versa. Note that, unlike prior approaches [13, 14], we use optical flow to predict the region (i.e. encoding location and shape), and therefore we are better able to compute similarity for fast moving objects. 2.2.3 Dynamic Programming Solution Until now, we have built the layered DAG and the objective is clear: to find the highest weighted path in the DAG. Assume the graph contains 2F + 2 layers (F is the frame number), the source node is in layer 0 and the sink node is in layer 2F + 2. Let Nij denotes the jth node in ith layer and E(Nij , Nkl) denotes the edge from Nij to Nkl. Layer i has Mi nodes. Let P = (p1, p2 , ..., pm+1) = (N01, Nj1j2, ..., Njm−1jm, N(2n+2)1) be a path from source to sink node. Therefore, ?m Pmax= arg mPax?i=1E(pi,pi+1). (5) Pmax forms a Longest (simple) Path Problem for DAG. Let OPT(i, j) be the maximum path value for Nij from source node. The maximum path value satisfies the following recurrence for i≥ 1and j ≥ 1: OPT(i,j) = k=0...i−m1a,lx=1...Mk[OPT(k,l) + E(Nkl,Nij)]. (6) This problem could be solved by dynamic programming in linear time [12]. The computational complexity for the algorithm is O(n + m), in which n is the number of nodes 666322 919 and m is the number of edges. The most important parameter for the layered DAG is the ratio λ between unary edges and binary edges. However, in practice, the results are not sensitive to it, and in the experiments λ is simply set to be 1. 2.3. Per-pixel Video Object Segmentation Once the primary object proposals are obtained in a video, the results are further refined by a graph-based method to get per-pixel segmentation results. We define a spatiotemporal graph by connecting frames temporally with optical flow displacement. Each of the nodes in the graph is a pixel in a frame, and edges are set to be the 8-neighbors within one frame and the forward-backward 18 neighbors in adjacent frames. We define the energy function for labeling f = [f1, f2, ..., fn] of n pixels with prior knowledge of h: E(f,h) = ?Dhi(fi) + λ ?i∈S ? Vi,j(fi,fj), (7) (i,?j)∈N where S = {pi, ..., pn} is the set of n pixels in the video, N cwohnesriest Ss o =f neighboring pixels, ta ondf i,j ixnedlesx in nt thhee pixels. pi could be set to 0 or 1which represents background or foreground respectively. The unary term Dih defines the cost of labeling pixel iwith label fi which we get from the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for both color and location. Dih(fi) = −log(αUic(fi, h) + (1 − α)Uil(fi, h)), (8) where Uic(.) is the color-induced cost and Uil (.) is the location cost. For the binary term Vi,j (fi, fj), we follow the definitions in [17]: Vi,j(fi, fj) = [fi = fj]exp−β(Ci−Cj)2, (9) where [.] denotes the indicator function taking values 0 and 1, (Ci − Cj)2 is the Euclidean distance betwe?en two adjacent nodes in RGB space, and β = (2? (Ci − Cj)2)−1|(i,j)∈N ?We use −th Ce graph-cuts based minimization method in [8] to o?btain the optimal solution for equation 7, and thus get the final segmentation results. Next, we describe the method for object proposal generation that is used to initialize the video object segmentation process. 2.4. Object Proposal Generation & Expansion In order to achieve our goal of identifying image regions belonging to the primary object in the video, it is preferable (though not necessary) to have an object proposal corresponding to the actual object for each frame in which object is present. Using only appearance or optical flow based Figure 6. Object Proposal Expansion. For each optical flow warped object proposal in frame i− 1, we look for object proposals din o fbjreamcte p ir owpohsicahl ihnav fer high overlap erat liooosk kw fiotrh tohbej warped one. If some object proposals all have high overlap ratios with the warped one, they are merged into a new large object proposal. This process will produce the right object proposal if it is not discovered by [7] from frame i, but frame i− 1. cues to generate object proposals is usually not enough for this purpose. This phenomenon could be observed in the example shown in Figure 6. For frame iin this figure, hundreds of object proposals were generated using method in [7], however, no proposal is consistent with the true object, and the object is fragmented between different proposals. We assume that an object’s shape and location changes smoothly across frames and propose to enhance the set of object proposals for a frame by using the proposals generated for its adjacent frames. The object proposal expansion method works by the guidance of optical flow (see Figure 6). For the forward version of object proposal expansion, each object proposal rk in frame i− 1 is warped by the forward optical flow toi −fra1mine fir,a tmheen i a −ch 1ec isk wisa rmpaedde bify any proposal in frame i has a large overlap ratio with the rij 666333002 warped object proposal, i.e., o =|warpi−1,|ir(jir|ik−1) ∩ rij|. (10) The contiguous overlapped areas, for regions in i+1 with o greater than 0.5, are merged into a single region, and are used as additional proposals. Note that, the old original proposals are also kept, so this is an ‘expansion’ of the proposal set, and not a replacement. In practice, this process is carried out both forward and backward in time. Since it is an iterative process, even if suitable object proposals are missing in consecutive frames, they could potentially be produced by this expansion process. Figure 6 shows an example image sequence where the expansion process resulted in generation of a suitable proposal. 3. Experiments The proposed method was evaluated using two wellknown segmentation datasets: SegTrack dataset [20] and GaTech video segmentation dataset [9]. Quantitative comparisons are shown for SegTrack dataset since ground-truth is available for this dataset. Qualitative results are shown for GaTech video segmentation dataset. We also evaluated the proposed approach on additional challenging videos, for which we will share the ground-truth to aid future evaluations. 3.1. SegTrack Dataset We first evaluate our method on Segtrack dataset [20]. There are 6 videos in this dataset, and also a pixel-level segmentation ground-truth for each video is available. We follow the setup in the literature ([13, 14]), and use 5 (birdfall, cheetah, girl, monkeydog and parachute) of the videos for evaluation (since the ground-truth for the other one (penguin) is not useable). We use an optical flow magnitude based model selection method to infer the camera motion: for static cameras, a background subtraction cue is also used for moving object extraction; for all the results shown in this section, the static camera model was only selected (automatically) for the “birdfall” video. We compare our method with 4 state-of-the-art methods [14], [13], [20] and [6] shown in Table 1. Note that our method is a unsupervised method, and it outperforms all the other unsupervised methods except for the parachute video where it is a close second. Note that [20] and [6] are supervised methods which need an initial annotation for the first frame. The results in Table 1are the average per-frame pixel error rate compared to the ground-truth. The definition is [20]: error = XORF(f,GT), (11) where f is the segmentation labeling results of the method, GT is the ground-truth labeling of the video, and F is the (a) Birdfall (b) Cheetah (c) Girl (d) Monkeydog (e) Parachute Figure 7.

This is the main reason that the segmentation results of the proposed method are better than prior methods. 3.2. GaTech Segmentation Dataset We also evaluated the proposed method on GaTech video segmentation dataset. We show qualitative comparison of results between the proposed approach and the original bottom-up method for the dataset in Figure 9. As one can observe, our results could segment the true foreground object from the background. The method [9] doesn’t use an object model which induces over-segmentation (although the results are very good for the general segmentation problem). 3.3. Persons and Cars Segmentation Dataset We have built a new dataset for video object segmentation. The dataset is challenging: persons are in a variety of poses; cars have different speeds, and when they are slow, it is very hard to do motion segmentation. We generate ground truth for those videos. Figure 10 shows some sample results from this dataset, and Table 2 shows the quantitative (a) waterski (b) yunakim Figure 9.

This approach also uses innovative mechanisms to compute the ‘objectness’ of a region and to compute similarity between object proposals across frames. The proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the well-known SegTrack dataset.

</p><p>33 To this end, we use optical flow to track the evolution of object shape, and compute the difference between predicted and actual shape (along with appearance) to measure similarity of object proposals across frames. [sent-68, score-1.049]
</p><p>34 The ‘objectness’ is measured using appearance and a motion based criterion that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at the boundaries between objects proposals and the background. [sent-69, score-0.907]

</p><p>36 Note that, if the temporal order of object proposals locations (across frames) is not used ([13], then it can result in no proposals being associated with the prima666222779  ry object for many frames (please see Figure 1). [sent-71, score-1.283]

</p><p>61 Both appearance and motion are important to infer the objectness, so the scoring function for object proposals is defined as Sunary (r) = A(r) + M(r), in which r is any object proposal, A(r) is the appearance score and M(r) is the motion score. [sent-121, score-0.937]

<p>Author: Dong Zhang, Omar Javed, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract primary object segments in videos in the ‘object proposal’ domain. The extracted primary object regions are then used to build object models for optimized video segmentation. The proposed approach has several contributions: First, a novel layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based framework is presented for detection and segmentation of the primary object in video. We exploit the fact that, in general, objects are spatially cohesive and characterized by locally smooth motion trajectories, to extract the primary object from the set of all available proposals based on motion, appearance and predicted-shape similarity across frames. Second, the DAG is initialized with an enhanced object proposal set where motion based proposal predictions (from adjacent frames) are used to expand the set of object proposals for a particular frame. Last, the paper presents a motion scoring function for selection of object proposals that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at proposal boundaries to discriminate between moving objects and the background. The proposed approach is evaluated using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods. 1. Introduction & Related Work In this paper, our goal is to detect the primary object in videos and to delineate it from the background in allframes. Video object segmentation is a well-researched problem in the computer vision community and is a prerequisite for a variety of high-level vision applications, including content based video retrieval, video summarization, activity understanding and targeted content replacement. Both fully automatic methods and methods requiring manual initialization have been proposed for video object segmentation. In the latter class of approaches, [2, 15, 23] need annotations of object segments in key frames for initialization. Frame #38 #39 #61 #62 V ideo Frames Key-?fram e Object Regions [13] ?

The goal of the proposed work is to generate an enhanced set of object proposals and extract the segments related to the primary object from the video. tion results. However, most computer vision applications involve processing of large amounts of video data, which makes manual initialization cost prohibitive. Consequently, a large number of automatic methods have also been proposed for video object segmentation. A subset of these methods employs motion grouping ([19, 18, 4]) for object segmentation. Other methods ([10, 3, 21]) use appearance cues to segment each frame first and then use both appearance and motion constraints for a bottom-up final segmentation. Methods like [9, 3, 11, 22] present efficient optimization frameworks for spatiotemporal grouping of pixels for video segmentation. However, all of these automatic methods do not have an explicit model of how an object looks or moves, and therefore, the segments usually don’t correspond to a particular object but only to image regions that exhibit coherent appearance or motion. Recently, several methods ([7, 5, 1]) were proposed that provided an explicit notion of how a generic object looks like. Specifically, the method [7] could extract object-like regions or ‘object proposals’ from images. This work was built upon by Lee et al. [13] and Ma and Latecki [14] to employ object proposals for object video segmentation. Lee et al. [13] proposed to detect the primary object by collecting a pool of object proposals from the video, and then applying spectral graph clustering to obtain multiple binary inlier/outlier partitions. Each inlier cluster corresponds to a particular object’s regions. Both motion and appearance based cues are used to measure the ‘objectness’ of a proposal in the cluster. The cluster with the largest average ‘objectness’ is likely to contain the primary object in video. One shortcoming of this approach is that the clustering process ignores the order of the proposals in the video, and there- fore, cannot model the evolution of object’s shape and location with time. The work by Ma and Latecki [14] attempts Input Videos Figure 3. The Video Object Segmentation Framework to mitigate this issue by utilizing relationships between object proposals in adjacent frames. The object region selection problem is modeled as a constrained Maximum Weight Cliques problem in order to find the true object region from all the video frames simultaneously. However, this problem is NP-hard ([14]) and an approximate optimization technique is used to obtain the solution. The object proposal based segmentation approaches [13, 14] have two additional limitations compared to the proposed method. First, in both approaches, object proposal generation for a particular frame doesn’t directly depend on object proposals generated for adjacent frames. Second, both approaches do not actually predict the shape of the object in adjacent frames when computing region similarity, which degrades segmentation performance for fast moving objects. In this paper, we present an approach that though inspired from aforementioned approaches, attempts to remove their shortcomings. Note that, in general, an object’s shape and appearance varies slowly from frame to frame. Therefore, the intuition is that the object proposal sequence in a video with high ‘objectness’, and high similarity across frames is likely to be the primary object. To this end, we use optical flow to track the evolution of object shape, and compute the difference between predicted and actual shape (along with appearance) to measure similarity of object proposals across frames. The ‘objectness’ is measured using appearance and a motion based criterion that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at the boundaries between objects proposals and the background. Moreover, the primary object proposal selection problem is formulated as the longest path problem for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), for which (unlike [14]) an optimal solution exists in linear time. Note that, if the temporal order of object proposals locations (across frames) is not used ([13], then it can result in no proposals being associated with the prima666222779 ry object for many frames (please see Figure 1). The proposed method not only uses object proposals from a particular frame (please see Figure 2), but also expands the proposal set using predictions from proposals of neighboring frame. The combination of proposal expansion, and the predicted shape based similarity criteria results in temporally dense and spatially accurate primary object proposal extraction. We have evaluated the proposed approach using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods In Section 2, the proposed layered DAG based object selection approach is introduced and discussed in detail; In Section 3, both qualitative and quantitative experiments results for two publicly available datasets and some other challenging videos are shown; The paper is concluded in Section 4. 2. Layered DAG based Video Object Segmentation 2.1. The Framework The proposed framework consists of 3 stages (as shown in Figure 3): 1. Generation of object proposals per-frame and then expansion of the proposal set for each frame based on object proposals in adjacent frames. 2. Generation of a layered DAG from all the object proposals in the video. The longest path in the graph fulfills the goal of maximizing ob- jectness and similarity scores, and represents the most likely set of proposals denoting the primary object in the video. 3. The primary object proposals are used to build object and background models using Gaussian mixtures, and a graph-cuts based optimization method is used to obtain refined per-pixel segmentation. Since the proposed approach is centered around layered DAG framework for selection of primary object regions, we will start with its description. 2.2. Layered DAG Structure We want to extract object proposals with high objectness likelihood, high appearance similarity and smoothly varying shape from the set of all proposals obtained from the video. Also since we want to extract the primary object only, we want to extract at most a single proposal per frame. Keeping these objectives in mind, the layered DAG is formed as follows. Each object proposal is represented by two nodes: a ‘beginning node’ and an ‘ending node’ and there are two types of edges: unary edges and binary edges. The unary edges have weights which measure the objectness of a proposal. The details of the function for unary weight assignments (measuring objectness) are given in section 2.2. 1. All the beginning nodes in the same frame form a layer, so as the ending nodes. A directed unary edge is built from beginning node to ending node. Thus, each video frame is represented by two layers in the graph. DiFrame i-1 Frame i Frame i+1 s… … La2i-ye3rL2ai-y2erL2ayi-1erLa2yierL2ai+y1erL2ai+y2er… … t Figure 4. Layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure. Node “s” and “t” are source and sink nodes respectively, which have zero weights for edges with other nodes in the graph. The yellow nodes and the green nodes are “beginning nodes” and “ending nodes” respectively and they are paired such that each yellow-green pair represents an object proposal. All the beginning nodes in the same frame are arranged in a layer and the same as the ending nodes. The green edges are the unary edges and red edges are the binary edges. rected binary edges are built from any ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. The binary edges have weights which measure the appearance and shape similarity between the corresponding object proposals across frames. The binary weight assignment functions are introduced in Section 2.2.2. Figure 4 is an illustration of the graph structure. It shows frame i− 1, iand i 1 of the graph, with corresponding layers oif − −2i 1 1−,3 i, a2nid d− i2, + +2 i1 1− o1f, h2ie, 2gira+p 1h ,a wndi t2hi +co2rr. eNspooten tdhinagt, only 3s object proposals are s1h, o2wi,n 2 ifo+r 1e aacnhd layer f.or N simplic- + ity, however, there are usually hundreds of object proposals for each frame and the number of object proposals for different frames are not necessary the same. The yellow nodes are “beginning nodes”, the green nodes are “ending nodes”, the green edges are unary edges with weights indicating objectness and the red edges are binary edges with weights indicating appearance and shape similarity (note that the graph only shows some of the binary edges for simplicity). There is also a virtual source node s and a sink node t with 0 weighted edges (black edges) to the graph. Note that, it is not necessary to build binary edges from an ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. In practice, only building binary edges to the next three subsequent frames is enough for most of the videos. 2.2.1 Unary Edges Unary edges measure the objectness of the proposals. Both appearance and motion are important to infer the objectness, so the scoring function for object proposals is defined as Sunary (r) = A(r) + M(r), in which r is any object proposal, A(r) is the appearance score and M(r) is the motion score. We define M(r) as the average Frobenius norm of optical flow gradient around the boundary of object pro666232880 Figure 5. Optical Flow Gradient Magnitude Motion Scoring. In row 1, column 1 shows the original video frame, column 2 is one of the object proposals and column 3 shows dilated boundary of the object proposal. In row 2, column 1 shows the forward optical flow of the frame, column 2 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude map and column 3 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude response for the specific object proposal around the boundary. [Please Print in Color] posal r. The Frobenius norm of optical flow gradients is defined as: ??UX??F=?????uvxx uvy ?????F=?ux2+ u2y+ vx2+ vy2, in ?whic?h U =? (1) (u, v) is th??e forward optical flow of the frame, ux , vx and uy, vy are optical flow gradients in x and y directions respectively. The intuition behind this motion scoring function is that, the motions of foreground object and background are usually distinct, so boundary of moving objects usually implies discontinuity in motion. Therefore, ideally, the gradient of optical flow should have high magnitude around foreground object boundary (this phenomenon could be easily observed from Figure 5). In equation 1, we use the Frobenius norm to measure the optical flow gradient magnitude, the higher the value, the more likely the region is from a moving object. In practice, usually the maximum of optical flow gradient magnitude does not coincide exactly with the moving object boundary due to underlying approximation of optical flow calculation. Therefore, we dilate the object proposal boundary and get the average optical flow gradient magnitude as the motion score. Figure 5 is an illustration of this process. The appearance scoring function A(r) is measured by the objectness ([7]). 2.2.2 Binary Edges Binary edges measure the similarity between object proposals across frames. For measuring the similarity of regions, color, location, size and shape are the properties to be considered. We define the similarity between regions as the weight of binary edges as follows: Sbinary(rm, rn) = λ · Scolor(rm, rn) · Soverlap(rm, rn), (2) in which rm and rn are regions from frame m and n, λ is a constant value for adjusting the ratio between unary and binary edges, Soverlap is the overlap similarity between regions and Scolor is the color histogram similarity: Scolor(rm, rn) = hist(rm) · hist(rn)T, (3) in which hist(r) is the normalized color histogram for a region r. Soverlap(rm,rn) =||rrmm∩∪ wwaarrppmmnn((rrnn))||, (4) in which warpmn (rn) is the warped region from rn by optical flow to frame m. It is clear that Scolor encodes the color similarity between regions and Soverlap encodes the size and location similarity between regions. If two regions are close, and the sizes and shapes are similar, the value would be higher, and vice versa. Note that, unlike prior approaches [13, 14], we use optical flow to predict the region (i.e. encoding location and shape), and therefore we are better able to compute similarity for fast moving objects. 2.2.3 Dynamic Programming Solution Until now, we have built the layered DAG and the objective is clear: to find the highest weighted path in the DAG. Assume the graph contains 2F + 2 layers (F is the frame number), the source node is in layer 0 and the sink node is in layer 2F + 2. Let Nij denotes the jth node in ith layer and E(Nij , Nkl) denotes the edge from Nij to Nkl. Layer i has Mi nodes. Let P = (p1, p2 , ..., pm+1) = (N01, Nj1j2, ..., Njm−1jm, N(2n+2)1) be a path from source to sink node. Therefore, ?m Pmax= arg mPax?i=1E(pi,pi+1). (5) Pmax forms a Longest (simple) Path Problem for DAG. Let OPT(i, j) be the maximum path value for Nij from source node. The maximum path value satisfies the following recurrence for i≥ 1and j ≥ 1: OPT(i,j) = k=0...i−m1a,lx=1...Mk[OPT(k,l) + E(Nkl,Nij)]. (6) This problem could be solved by dynamic programming in linear time [12]. The computational complexity for the algorithm is O(n + m), in which n is the number of nodes 666322 919 and m is the number of edges. The most important parameter for the layered DAG is the ratio λ between unary edges and binary edges. However, in practice, the results are not sensitive to it, and in the experiments λ is simply set to be 1. 2.3. Per-pixel Video Object Segmentation Once the primary object proposals are obtained in a video, the results are further refined by a graph-based method to get per-pixel segmentation results. We define a spatiotemporal graph by connecting frames temporally with optical flow displacement. Each of the nodes in the graph is a pixel in a frame, and edges are set to be the 8-neighbors within one frame and the forward-backward 18 neighbors in adjacent frames. We define the energy function for labeling f = [f1, f2, ..., fn] of n pixels with prior knowledge of h: E(f,h) = ?Dhi(fi) + λ ?i∈S ? Vi,j(fi,fj), (7) (i,?j)∈N where S = {pi, ..., pn} is the set of n pixels in the video, N cwohnesriest Ss o =f neighboring pixels, ta ondf i,j ixnedlesx in nt thhee pixels. pi could be set to 0 or 1which represents background or foreground respectively. The unary term Dih defines the cost of labeling pixel iwith label fi which we get from the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for both color and location. Dih(fi) = −log(αUic(fi, h) + (1 − α)Uil(fi, h)), (8) where Uic(.) is the color-induced cost and Uil (.) is the location cost. For the binary term Vi,j (fi, fj), we follow the definitions in [17]: Vi,j(fi, fj) = [fi = fj]exp−β(Ci−Cj)2, (9) where [.] denotes the indicator function taking values 0 and 1, (Ci − Cj)2 is the Euclidean distance betwe?en two adjacent nodes in RGB space, and β = (2? (Ci − Cj)2)−1|(i,j)∈N ?We use −th Ce graph-cuts based minimization method in [8] to o?btain the optimal solution for equation 7, and thus get the final segmentation results. Next, we describe the method for object proposal generation that is used to initialize the video object segmentation process. 2.4. Object Proposal Generation & Expansion In order to achieve our goal of identifying image regions belonging to the primary object in the video, it is preferable (though not necessary) to have an object proposal corresponding to the actual object for each frame in which object is present. Using only appearance or optical flow based Figure 6. Object Proposal Expansion. For each optical flow warped object proposal in frame i− 1, we look for object proposals din o fbjreamcte p ir owpohsicahl ihnav fer high overlap erat liooosk kw fiotrh tohbej warped one. If some object proposals all have high overlap ratios with the warped one, they are merged into a new large object proposal. This process will produce the right object proposal if it is not discovered by [7] from frame i, but frame i− 1. cues to generate object proposals is usually not enough for this purpose. This phenomenon could be observed in the example shown in Figure 6. For frame iin this figure, hundreds of object proposals were generated using method in [7], however, no proposal is consistent with the true object, and the object is fragmented between different proposals. We assume that an object’s shape and location changes smoothly across frames and propose to enhance the set of object proposals for a frame by using the proposals generated for its adjacent frames. The object proposal expansion method works by the guidance of optical flow (see Figure 6). For the forward version of object proposal expansion, each object proposal rk in frame i− 1 is warped by the forward optical flow toi −fra1mine fir,a tmheen i a −ch 1ec isk wisa rmpaedde bify any proposal in frame i has a large overlap ratio with the rij 666333002 warped object proposal, i.e., o =|warpi−1,|ir(jir|ik−1) ∩ rij|. (10) The contiguous overlapped areas, for regions in i+1 with o greater than 0.5, are merged into a single region, and are used as additional proposals. Note that, the old original proposals are also kept, so this is an ‘expansion’ of the proposal set, and not a replacement. In practice, this process is carried out both forward and backward in time. Since it is an iterative process, even if suitable object proposals are missing in consecutive frames, they could potentially be produced by this expansion process. Figure 6 shows an example image sequence where the expansion process resulted in generation of a suitable proposal. 3. Experiments The proposed method was evaluated using two wellknown segmentation datasets: SegTrack dataset [20] and GaTech video segmentation dataset [9]. Quantitative comparisons are shown for SegTrack dataset since ground-truth is available for this dataset. Qualitative results are shown for GaTech video segmentation dataset. We also evaluated the proposed approach on additional challenging videos, for which we will share the ground-truth to aid future evaluations. 3.1. SegTrack Dataset We first evaluate our method on Segtrack dataset [20]. There are 6 videos in this dataset, and also a pixel-level segmentation ground-truth for each video is available. We follow the setup in the literature ([13, 14]), and use 5 (birdfall, cheetah, girl, monkeydog and parachute) of the videos for evaluation (since the ground-truth for the other one (penguin) is not useable). We use an optical flow magnitude based model selection method to infer the camera motion: for static cameras, a background subtraction cue is also used for moving object extraction; for all the results shown in this section, the static camera model was only selected (automatically) for the “birdfall” video. We compare our method with 4 state-of-the-art methods [14], [13], [20] and [6] shown in Table 1. Note that our method is a unsupervised method, and it outperforms all the other unsupervised methods except for the parachute video where it is a close second. Note that [20] and [6] are supervised methods which need an initial annotation for the first frame. The results in Table 1are the average per-frame pixel error rate compared to the ground-truth. The definition is [20]: error = XORF(f,GT), (11) where f is the segmentation labeling results of the method, GT is the ground-truth labeling of the video, and F is the (a) Birdfall (b) Cheetah (c) Girl (d) Monkeydog (e) Parachute Figure 7.

This is the main reason that the segmentation results of the proposed method are better than prior methods. 3.2. GaTech Segmentation Dataset We also evaluated the proposed method on GaTech video segmentation dataset. We show qualitative comparison of results between the proposed approach and the original bottom-up method for the dataset in Figure 9. As one can observe, our results could segment the true foreground object from the background. The method [9] doesn’t use an object model which induces over-segmentation (although the results are very good for the general segmentation problem). 3.3. Persons and Cars Segmentation Dataset We have built a new dataset for video object segmentation. The dataset is challenging: persons are in a variety of poses; cars have different speeds, and when they are slow, it is very hard to do motion segmentation. We generate ground truth for those videos. Figure 10 shows some sample results from this dataset, and Table 2 shows the quantitative (a) waterski (b) yunakim Figure 9.

This approach also uses innovative mechanisms to compute the ‘objectness’ of a region and to compute similarity between object proposals across frames. The proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the well-known SegTrack dataset. We also demonstrate good segmentation performance on additional challenging data sets. 666333224 (a) Surfing (b) Jumping (c) Skiing (d) Sliding (e) Big car (f) Small car Figure 10.

<p>Author: David Weiss, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose SCALPEL, a flexible method for object segmentation that integrates rich region-merging cues with mid- and high-level information about object layout, class, and scale into the segmentation process. Unlike competing approaches, SCALPEL uses a cascade of bottom-up segmentation models that is capable of learning to ignore boundaries early on, yet use them as a stopping criterion once the object has been mostly segmented. Furthermore, we show how such cascades can be learned efficiently. When paired with a novel method that generates better localized shapepriors than our competitors, our method leads to a concise, accurate set of segmentation proposals; these proposals are more accurate on the PASCAL VOC2010 dataset than state-of-the-art methods that use re-ranking to filter much larger bags of proposals. The code for our algorithm is available online.</p><p>3 0.19098105 <a title="455-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fully-Connected_Layered_Model_of_Foreground_and_Background_Flow.html">10 cvpr-2013-A Fully-Connected Layered Model of Foreground and Background Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Deqing Sun, Jonas Wulff, Erik B. Sudderth, Hanspeter Pfister, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Layered models allow scene segmentation and motion estimation to be formulated together and to inform one another. Traditional layered motion methods, however, employ fairly weak models of scene structure, relying on locally connected Ising/Potts models which have limited ability to capture long-range correlations in natural scenes. To address this, we formulate a fully-connected layered model that enables global reasoning about the complicated segmentations of real objects. Optimization with fully-connected graphical models is challenging, and our inference algorithm leverages recent work on efficient mean field updates for fully-connected conditional random fields. These methods can be implemented efficiently using high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. We combine these ideas with a layered flow model, and find that the long-range connections greatly improve segmentation into figure-ground layers when compared with locally connected MRF models. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the method can re- cover fine structures and large occlusion regions, with good flow accuracy and much lower computational cost than previous locally-connected layered models.</p><p>4 0.14362204 <a title="455-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>5 0.13890502 <a title="455-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Parthipan Siva, Chris Russell, Tao Xiang, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of object saliency as a sampling problem. This novel formulation allows us to learn, from a large corpus of unlabelled images, which patches of an image are of the greatest interest and most likely to correspond to an object. We then sample the object saliency map to propose object locations. We show that using only a single object location proposal per image, we are able to correctly select an object in over 42% of the images in the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, substantially outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that our object proposal can be used as a simple unsupervised approach to the weakly supervised annotation problem. Our simple unsupervised approach to annotating objects of interest in images achieves a higher annotation accuracy than most weakly supervised approaches.</p><p>6 0.13866077 <a title="455-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Pose_from_Flow_and_Flow_from_Pose.html">334 cvpr-2013-Pose from Flow and Flow from Pose</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong Zhang, Omar Javed, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract primary object segments in videos in the ‘object proposal’ domain. The extracted primary object regions are then used to build object models for optimized video segmentation. The proposed approach has several contributions: First, a novel layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based framework is presented for detection and segmentation of the primary object in video. We exploit the fact that, in general, objects are spatially cohesive and characterized by locally smooth motion trajectories, to extract the primary object from the set of all available proposals based on motion, appearance and predicted-shape similarity across frames. Second, the DAG is initialized with an enhanced object proposal set where motion based proposal predictions (from adjacent frames) are used to expand the set of object proposals for a particular frame. Last, the paper presents a motion scoring function for selection of object proposals that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at proposal boundaries to discriminate between moving objects and the background. The proposed approach is evaluated using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods. 1. Introduction & Related Work In this paper, our goal is to detect the primary object in videos and to delineate it from the background in allframes. Video object segmentation is a well-researched problem in the computer vision community and is a prerequisite for a variety of high-level vision applications, including content based video retrieval, video summarization, activity understanding and targeted content replacement. Both fully automatic methods and methods requiring manual initialization have been proposed for video object segmentation. In the latter class of approaches, [2, 15, 23] need annotations of object segments in key frames for initialization. Frame #38 #39 #61 #62 V ideo Frames Key-?fram e Object Regions [13] ?

The third row shows primary object proposals selected by the proposed method. Note that the proposed method was able to find primary object proposals in all frames. The results in row 2 and 3 are prior to per-pixel segmentation. In this paper we demonstrate that temporally dense extraction of primary object proposals results in significant improvement in object segmentation performance. Please see Table 1for quantitative results and comparisons to state of the art.[Please Print in Color] Optimization techniques employing motion and appearance constraints are then used to propagate the segments to all frames. Other methods ([16, 20]) only require accurate object region annotation for the first frame, then employ region tracking to segment the rest of frames into object and background regions. Note that, the aforementioned semi-automatic techniques generally give good segmenta666222668 Figure 2. Object proposals from a video frame employing the method in [7]. The left side image is one of the video frames. Note that the monkey is the object of interest in the frame. Images on the right show some of the top ranked object proposals from the frame. Most of the proposals do not correspond to an actual object. The goal of the proposed work is to generate an enhanced set of object proposals and extract the segments related to the primary object from the video. tion results. However, most computer vision applications involve processing of large amounts of video data, which makes manual initialization cost prohibitive. Consequently, a large number of automatic methods have also been proposed for video object segmentation. A subset of these methods employs motion grouping ([19, 18, 4]) for object segmentation. Other methods ([10, 3, 21]) use appearance cues to segment each frame first and then use both appearance and motion constraints for a bottom-up final segmentation. Methods like [9, 3, 11, 22] present efficient optimization frameworks for spatiotemporal grouping of pixels for video segmentation. However, all of these automatic methods do not have an explicit model of how an object looks or moves, and therefore, the segments usually don’t correspond to a particular object but only to image regions that exhibit coherent appearance or motion. Recently, several methods ([7, 5, 1]) were proposed that provided an explicit notion of how a generic object looks like. Specifically, the method [7] could extract object-like regions or ‘object proposals’ from images. This work was built upon by Lee et al. [13] and Ma and Latecki [14] to employ object proposals for object video segmentation. Lee et al. [13] proposed to detect the primary object by collecting a pool of object proposals from the video, and then applying spectral graph clustering to obtain multiple binary inlier/outlier partitions. Each inlier cluster corresponds to a particular object’s regions. Both motion and appearance based cues are used to measure the ‘objectness’ of a proposal in the cluster. The cluster with the largest average ‘objectness’ is likely to contain the primary object in video. One shortcoming of this approach is that the clustering process ignores the order of the proposals in the video, and there- fore, cannot model the evolution of object’s shape and location with time. The work by Ma and Latecki [14] attempts Input Videos Figure 3. The Video Object Segmentation Framework to mitigate this issue by utilizing relationships between object proposals in adjacent frames. The object region selection problem is modeled as a constrained Maximum Weight Cliques problem in order to find the true object region from all the video frames simultaneously. However, this problem is NP-hard ([14]) and an approximate optimization technique is used to obtain the solution. The object proposal based segmentation approaches [13, 14] have two additional limitations compared to the proposed method. First, in both approaches, object proposal generation for a particular frame doesn’t directly depend on object proposals generated for adjacent frames. Second, both approaches do not actually predict the shape of the object in adjacent frames when computing region similarity, which degrades segmentation performance for fast moving objects. In this paper, we present an approach that though inspired from aforementioned approaches, attempts to remove their shortcomings. Note that, in general, an object’s shape and appearance varies slowly from frame to frame. Therefore, the intuition is that the object proposal sequence in a video with high ‘objectness’, and high similarity across frames is likely to be the primary object. To this end, we use optical flow to track the evolution of object shape, and compute the difference between predicted and actual shape (along with appearance) to measure similarity of object proposals across frames. The ‘objectness’ is measured using appearance and a motion based criterion that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at the boundaries between objects proposals and the background. Moreover, the primary object proposal selection problem is formulated as the longest path problem for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), for which (unlike [14]) an optimal solution exists in linear time. Note that, if the temporal order of object proposals locations (across frames) is not used ([13], then it can result in no proposals being associated with the prima666222779 ry object for many frames (please see Figure 1). The proposed method not only uses object proposals from a particular frame (please see Figure 2), but also expands the proposal set using predictions from proposals of neighboring frame. The combination of proposal expansion, and the predicted shape based similarity criteria results in temporally dense and spatially accurate primary object proposal extraction. We have evaluated the proposed approach using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods In Section 2, the proposed layered DAG based object selection approach is introduced and discussed in detail; In Section 3, both qualitative and quantitative experiments results for two publicly available datasets and some other challenging videos are shown; The paper is concluded in Section 4. 2. Layered DAG based Video Object Segmentation 2.1. The Framework The proposed framework consists of 3 stages (as shown in Figure 3): 1. Generation of object proposals per-frame and then expansion of the proposal set for each frame based on object proposals in adjacent frames. 2. Generation of a layered DAG from all the object proposals in the video. The longest path in the graph fulfills the goal of maximizing ob- jectness and similarity scores, and represents the most likely set of proposals denoting the primary object in the video. 3. The primary object proposals are used to build object and background models using Gaussian mixtures, and a graph-cuts based optimization method is used to obtain refined per-pixel segmentation. Since the proposed approach is centered around layered DAG framework for selection of primary object regions, we will start with its description. 2.2. Layered DAG Structure We want to extract object proposals with high objectness likelihood, high appearance similarity and smoothly varying shape from the set of all proposals obtained from the video. Also since we want to extract the primary object only, we want to extract at most a single proposal per frame. Keeping these objectives in mind, the layered DAG is formed as follows. Each object proposal is represented by two nodes: a ‘beginning node’ and an ‘ending node’ and there are two types of edges: unary edges and binary edges. The unary edges have weights which measure the objectness of a proposal. The details of the function for unary weight assignments (measuring objectness) are given in section 2.2. 1. All the beginning nodes in the same frame form a layer, so as the ending nodes. A directed unary edge is built from beginning node to ending node. Thus, each video frame is represented by two layers in the graph. DiFrame i-1 Frame i Frame i+1 s… … La2i-ye3rL2ai-y2erL2ayi-1erLa2yierL2ai+y1erL2ai+y2er… … t Figure 4. Layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure. Node “s” and “t” are source and sink nodes respectively, which have zero weights for edges with other nodes in the graph. The yellow nodes and the green nodes are “beginning nodes” and “ending nodes” respectively and they are paired such that each yellow-green pair represents an object proposal. All the beginning nodes in the same frame are arranged in a layer and the same as the ending nodes. The green edges are the unary edges and red edges are the binary edges. rected binary edges are built from any ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. The binary edges have weights which measure the appearance and shape similarity between the corresponding object proposals across frames. The binary weight assignment functions are introduced in Section 2.2.2. Figure 4 is an illustration of the graph structure. It shows frame i− 1, iand i 1 of the graph, with corresponding layers oif − −2i 1 1−,3 i, a2nid d− i2, + +2 i1 1− o1f, h2ie, 2gira+p 1h ,a wndi t2hi +co2rr. eNspooten tdhinagt, only 3s object proposals are s1h, o2wi,n 2 ifo+r 1e aacnhd layer f.or N simplic- + ity, however, there are usually hundreds of object proposals for each frame and the number of object proposals for different frames are not necessary the same. The yellow nodes are “beginning nodes”, the green nodes are “ending nodes”, the green edges are unary edges with weights indicating objectness and the red edges are binary edges with weights indicating appearance and shape similarity (note that the graph only shows some of the binary edges for simplicity). There is also a virtual source node s and a sink node t with 0 weighted edges (black edges) to the graph. Note that, it is not necessary to build binary edges from an ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. In practice, only building binary edges to the next three subsequent frames is enough for most of the videos. 2.2.1 Unary Edges Unary edges measure the objectness of the proposals. Both appearance and motion are important to infer the objectness, so the scoring function for object proposals is defined as Sunary (r) = A(r) + M(r), in which r is any object proposal, A(r) is the appearance score and M(r) is the motion score. We define M(r) as the average Frobenius norm of optical flow gradient around the boundary of object pro666232880 Figure 5. Optical Flow Gradient Magnitude Motion Scoring. In row 1, column 1 shows the original video frame, column 2 is one of the object proposals and column 3 shows dilated boundary of the object proposal. In row 2, column 1 shows the forward optical flow of the frame, column 2 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude map and column 3 shows the optical flow gradient magnitude response for the specific object proposal around the boundary. [Please Print in Color] posal r. The Frobenius norm of optical flow gradients is defined as: ??UX??F=?????uvxx uvy ?????F=?ux2+ u2y+ vx2+ vy2, in ?whic?h U =? (1) (u, v) is th??e forward optical flow of the frame, ux , vx and uy, vy are optical flow gradients in x and y directions respectively. The intuition behind this motion scoring function is that, the motions of foreground object and background are usually distinct, so boundary of moving objects usually implies discontinuity in motion. Therefore, ideally, the gradient of optical flow should have high magnitude around foreground object boundary (this phenomenon could be easily observed from Figure 5). In equation 1, we use the Frobenius norm to measure the optical flow gradient magnitude, the higher the value, the more likely the region is from a moving object. In practice, usually the maximum of optical flow gradient magnitude does not coincide exactly with the moving object boundary due to underlying approximation of optical flow calculation. Therefore, we dilate the object proposal boundary and get the average optical flow gradient magnitude as the motion score. Figure 5 is an illustration of this process. The appearance scoring function A(r) is measured by the objectness ([7]). 2.2.2 Binary Edges Binary edges measure the similarity between object proposals across frames. For measuring the similarity of regions, color, location, size and shape are the properties to be considered. We define the similarity between regions as the weight of binary edges as follows: Sbinary(rm, rn) = λ · Scolor(rm, rn) · Soverlap(rm, rn), (2) in which rm and rn are regions from frame m and n, λ is a constant value for adjusting the ratio between unary and binary edges, Soverlap is the overlap similarity between regions and Scolor is the color histogram similarity: Scolor(rm, rn) = hist(rm) · hist(rn)T, (3) in which hist(r) is the normalized color histogram for a region r. Soverlap(rm,rn) =||rrmm∩∪ wwaarrppmmnn((rrnn))||, (4) in which warpmn (rn) is the warped region from rn by optical flow to frame m. It is clear that Scolor encodes the color similarity between regions and Soverlap encodes the size and location similarity between regions. If two regions are close, and the sizes and shapes are similar, the value would be higher, and vice versa. Note that, unlike prior approaches [13, 14], we use optical flow to predict the region (i.e. encoding location and shape), and therefore we are better able to compute similarity for fast moving objects. 2.2.3 Dynamic Programming Solution Until now, we have built the layered DAG and the objective is clear: to find the highest weighted path in the DAG. Assume the graph contains 2F + 2 layers (F is the frame number), the source node is in layer 0 and the sink node is in layer 2F + 2. Let Nij denotes the jth node in ith layer and E(Nij , Nkl) denotes the edge from Nij to Nkl. Layer i has Mi nodes. Let P = (p1, p2 , ..., pm+1) = (N01, Nj1j2, ..., Njm−1jm, N(2n+2)1) be a path from source to sink node. Therefore, ?m Pmax= arg mPax?i=1E(pi,pi+1). (5) Pmax forms a Longest (simple) Path Problem for DAG. Let OPT(i, j) be the maximum path value for Nij from source node. The maximum path value satisfies the following recurrence for i≥ 1and j ≥ 1: OPT(i,j) = k=0...i−m1a,lx=1...Mk[OPT(k,l) + E(Nkl,Nij)]. (6) This problem could be solved by dynamic programming in linear time [12]. The computational complexity for the algorithm is O(n + m), in which n is the number of nodes 666322 919 and m is the number of edges. The most important parameter for the layered DAG is the ratio λ between unary edges and binary edges. However, in practice, the results are not sensitive to it, and in the experiments λ is simply set to be 1. 2.3. Per-pixel Video Object Segmentation Once the primary object proposals are obtained in a video, the results are further refined by a graph-based method to get per-pixel segmentation results. We define a spatiotemporal graph by connecting frames temporally with optical flow displacement. Each of the nodes in the graph is a pixel in a frame, and edges are set to be the 8-neighbors within one frame and the forward-backward 18 neighbors in adjacent frames. We define the energy function for labeling f = [f1, f2, ..., fn] of n pixels with prior knowledge of h: E(f,h) = ?Dhi(fi) + λ ?i∈S ? Vi,j(fi,fj), (7) (i,?j)∈N where S = {pi, ..., pn} is the set of n pixels in the video, N cwohnesriest Ss o =f neighboring pixels, ta ondf i,j ixnedlesx in nt thhee pixels. pi could be set to 0 or 1which represents background or foreground respectively. The unary term Dih defines the cost of labeling pixel iwith label fi which we get from the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for both color and location. Dih(fi) = −log(αUic(fi, h) + (1 − α)Uil(fi, h)), (8) where Uic(.) is the color-induced cost and Uil (.) is the location cost. For the binary term Vi,j (fi, fj), we follow the definitions in [17]: Vi,j(fi, fj) = [fi = fj]exp−β(Ci−Cj)2, (9) where [.] denotes the indicator function taking values 0 and 1, (Ci − Cj)2 is the Euclidean distance betwe?en two adjacent nodes in RGB space, and β = (2? (Ci − Cj)2)−1|(i,j)∈N ?We use −th Ce graph-cuts based minimization method in [8] to o?btain the optimal solution for equation 7, and thus get the final segmentation results. Next, we describe the method for object proposal generation that is used to initialize the video object segmentation process. 2.4. Object Proposal Generation & Expansion In order to achieve our goal of identifying image regions belonging to the primary object in the video, it is preferable (though not necessary) to have an object proposal corresponding to the actual object for each frame in which object is present. Using only appearance or optical flow based Figure 6. Object Proposal Expansion. For each optical flow warped object proposal in frame i− 1, we look for object proposals din o fbjreamcte p ir owpohsicahl ihnav fer high overlap erat liooosk kw fiotrh tohbej warped one. If some object proposals all have high overlap ratios with the warped one, they are merged into a new large object proposal. This process will produce the right object proposal if it is not discovered by [7] from frame i, but frame i− 1. cues to generate object proposals is usually not enough for this purpose. This phenomenon could be observed in the example shown in Figure 6. For frame iin this figure, hundreds of object proposals were generated using method in [7], however, no proposal is consistent with the true object, and the object is fragmented between different proposals. We assume that an object’s shape and location changes smoothly across frames and propose to enhance the set of object proposals for a frame by using the proposals generated for its adjacent frames. The object proposal expansion method works by the guidance of optical flow (see Figure 6). For the forward version of object proposal expansion, each object proposal rk in frame i− 1 is warped by the forward optical flow toi −fra1mine fir,a tmheen i a −ch 1ec isk wisa rmpaedde bify any proposal in frame i has a large overlap ratio with the rij 666333002 warped object proposal, i.e., o =|warpi−1,|ir(jir|ik−1) ∩ rij|. (10) The contiguous overlapped areas, for regions in i+1 with o greater than 0.5, are merged into a single region, and are used as additional proposals. Note that, the old original proposals are also kept, so this is an ‘expansion’ of the proposal set, and not a replacement. In practice, this process is carried out both forward and backward in time. Since it is an iterative process, even if suitable object proposals are missing in consecutive frames, they could potentially be produced by this expansion process. Figure 6 shows an example image sequence where the expansion process resulted in generation of a suitable proposal. 3. Experiments The proposed method was evaluated using two wellknown segmentation datasets: SegTrack dataset [20] and GaTech video segmentation dataset [9]. Quantitative comparisons are shown for SegTrack dataset since ground-truth is available for this dataset. Qualitative results are shown for GaTech video segmentation dataset. We also evaluated the proposed approach on additional challenging videos, for which we will share the ground-truth to aid future evaluations. 3.1. SegTrack Dataset We first evaluate our method on Segtrack dataset [20]. There are 6 videos in this dataset, and also a pixel-level segmentation ground-truth for each video is available. We follow the setup in the literature ([13, 14]), and use 5 (birdfall, cheetah, girl, monkeydog and parachute) of the videos for evaluation (since the ground-truth for the other one (penguin) is not useable). We use an optical flow magnitude based model selection method to infer the camera motion: for static cameras, a background subtraction cue is also used for moving object extraction; for all the results shown in this section, the static camera model was only selected (automatically) for the “birdfall” video. We compare our method with 4 state-of-the-art methods [14], [13], [20] and [6] shown in Table 1. Note that our method is a unsupervised method, and it outperforms all the other unsupervised methods except for the parachute video where it is a close second. Note that [20] and [6] are supervised methods which need an initial annotation for the first frame. The results in Table 1are the average per-frame pixel error rate compared to the ground-truth. The definition is [20]: error = XORF(f,GT), (11) where f is the segmentation labeling results of the method, GT is the ground-truth labeling of the video, and F is the (a) Birdfall (b) Cheetah (c) Girl (d) Monkeydog (e) Parachute Figure 7.

This is the main reason that the segmentation results of the proposed method are better than prior methods. 3.2. GaTech Segmentation Dataset We also evaluated the proposed method on GaTech video segmentation dataset. We show qualitative comparison of results between the proposed approach and the original bottom-up method for the dataset in Figure 9. As one can observe, our results could segment the true foreground object from the background. The method [9] doesn’t use an object model which induces over-segmentation (although the results are very good for the general segmentation problem). 3.3. Persons and Cars Segmentation Dataset We have built a new dataset for video object segmentation. The dataset is challenging: persons are in a variety of poses; cars have different speeds, and when they are slow, it is very hard to do motion segmentation. We generate ground truth for those videos. Figure 10 shows some sample results from this dataset, and Table 2 shows the quantitative (a) waterski (b) yunakim Figure 9.

<p>Author: Deqing Sun, Jonas Wulff, Erik B. Sudderth, Hanspeter Pfister, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Layered models allow scene segmentation and motion estimation to be formulated together and to inform one another. Traditional layered motion methods, however, employ fairly weak models of scene structure, relying on locally connected Ising/Potts models which have limited ability to capture long-range correlations in natural scenes. To address this, we formulate a fully-connected layered model that enables global reasoning about the complicated segmentations of real objects. Optimization with fully-connected graphical models is challenging, and our inference algorithm leverages recent work on efficient mean field updates for fully-connected conditional random fields. These methods can be implemented efficiently using high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. We combine these ideas with a layered flow model, and find that the long-range connections greatly improve segmentation into figure-ground layers when compared with locally connected MRF models. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the method can re- cover fine structures and large occlusion regions, with good flow accuracy and much lower computational cost than previous locally-connected layered models.</p><p>3 0.72702235 <a title="455-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-class_Video_Co-segmentation_with_a_Generative_Multi-video_Model.html">294 cvpr-2013-Multi-class Video Co-segmentation with a Generative Multi-video Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei-Chen Chiu, Mario Fritz</p><p>Abstract: Video data provides a rich source of information that is available to us today in large quantities e.g. from online resources. Tasks like segmentation benefit greatly from the analysis of spatio-temporal motion patterns in videos and recent advances in video segmentation has shown great progress in exploiting these addition cues. However, observing a single video is often not enough to predict meaningful segmentations and inference across videos becomes necessary in order to predict segmentations that are consistent with objects classes. Therefore the task of video cosegmentation is being proposed, that aims at inferring segmentation from multiple videos. But current approaches are limited to only considering binary foreground/background -inf .mpg . de segmentation and multiple videos of the same object. This is a clear mismatch to the challenges that we are facing with videos from online resources or consumer videos. We propose to study multi-class video co-segmentation where the number of object classes is unknown as well as the number of instances in each frame and video. We achieve this by formulating a non-parametric bayesian model across videos sequences that is based on a new videos segmentation prior as well as a global appearance model that links segments of the same class. We present the first multi-class video co-segmentation evaluation. We show that our method is applicable to real video data from online resources and outperforms state-of-the-art video segmentation and image co-segmentation baselines.</p><p>4 0.72292215 <a title="455-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Video_Representation_with_Trajectory_Binary_Partition_Tree.html">203 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Video Representation with Trajectory Binary Partition Tree</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillem Palou, Philippe Salembier</p><p>Abstract: As early stage of video processing, we introduce an iterative trajectory merging algorithm that produces a regionbased and hierarchical representation of the video sequence, called the Trajectory Binary Partition Tree (BPT). From this representation, many analysis and graph cut techniques can be used to extract partitions or objects that are useful in the context of specific applications. In order to define trajectories and to create a precise merging algorithm, color and motion cues have to be used. Both types of informations are very useful to characterize objects but present strong differences of behavior in the spatial and the temporal dimensions. On the one hand, scenes and objects are rich in their spatial color distributions, but these distributions are rather stable over time. Object motion, on the other hand, presents simple structures and low spatial variability but may change from frame to frame. The proposed algorithm takes into account this key difference and relies on different models and associated metrics to deal with color and motion information. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing hierarchical video segmentation algorithms and provides more stable and precise regions.</p><p>5 0.70857263 <a title="455-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Geometric_Context_from_Videos.html">187 cvpr-2013-Geometric Context from Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Hussain Raza, Matthias Grundmann, Irfan Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. By examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 groundtruth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. To further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semisupervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. Our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.</p><p>6 0.67864615 <a title="455-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Arpit Jain, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: Junctions are strong cues for understanding the geometry of a scene. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting junctions and using them for recovering the spatial layout of an indoor scene. Junction detection has always been challenging due to missing and spurious lines. We work in a constrained Manhattan world setting where the junctions are formed by only line segments along the three principal orthogonal directions. Junctions can be classified into several categories based on the number and orientations of the incident line segments. We provide a simple and efficient voting scheme to detect and classify these junctions in real images. Indoor scenes are typically modeled as cuboids and we formulate the problem of the cuboid layout estimation as an inference problem in a conditional random field. Our formulation allows the incorporation of junction features and the training is done using structured prediction techniques. We outperform other single view geometry estimation methods on standard datasets.</p><p>2 0.88246804 <a title="455-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>3 0.87845176 <a title="455-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_Registration_of_Nonrigid_Surface_Using_Hierarchical_Statistical_Shape_Model.html">31 cvpr-2013-Accurate and Robust Registration of Nonrigid Surface Using Hierarchical Statistical Shape Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong Zhang, Omar Javed, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract primary object segments in videos in the ‘object proposal’ domain. The extracted primary object regions are then used to build object models for optimized video segmentation. The proposed approach has several contributions: First, a novel layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based framework is presented for detection and segmentation of the primary object in video. We exploit the fact that, in general, objects are spatially cohesive and characterized by locally smooth motion trajectories, to extract the primary object from the set of all available proposals based on motion, appearance and predicted-shape similarity across frames. Second, the DAG is initialized with an enhanced object proposal set where motion based proposal predictions (from adjacent frames) are used to expand the set of object proposals for a particular frame. Last, the paper presents a motion scoring function for selection of object proposals that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at proposal boundaries to discriminate between moving objects and the background. The proposed approach is evaluated using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods. 1. Introduction & Related Work In this paper, our goal is to detect the primary object in videos and to delineate it from the background in allframes. Video object segmentation is a well-researched problem in the computer vision community and is a prerequisite for a variety of high-level vision applications, including content based video retrieval, video summarization, activity understanding and targeted content replacement. Both fully automatic methods and methods requiring manual initialization have been proposed for video object segmentation. In the latter class of approaches, [2, 15, 23] need annotations of object segments in key frames for initialization. Frame #38 #39 #61 #62 V ideo Frames Key-?fram e Object Regions [13] ?

The second row shows key object proposals (in red boundaries) extracted by [13]. “?” indicates that no proposal related to the primary object was found by the method. The third row shows primary object proposals selected by the proposed method. Note that the proposed method was able to find primary object proposals in all frames. The results in row 2 and 3 are prior to per-pixel segmentation. In this paper we demonstrate that temporally dense extraction of primary object proposals results in significant improvement in object segmentation performance. Please see Table 1for quantitative results and comparisons to state of the art.[Please Print in Color] Optimization techniques employing motion and appearance constraints are then used to propagate the segments to all frames. Other methods ([16, 20]) only require accurate object region annotation for the first frame, then employ region tracking to segment the rest of frames into object and background regions. Note that, the aforementioned semi-automatic techniques generally give good segmenta666222668 Figure 2. Object proposals from a video frame employing the method in [7]. The left side image is one of the video frames. Note that the monkey is the object of interest in the frame. Images on the right show some of the top ranked object proposals from the frame. Most of the proposals do not correspond to an actual object. The goal of the proposed work is to generate an enhanced set of object proposals and extract the segments related to the primary object from the video. tion results. However, most computer vision applications involve processing of large amounts of video data, which makes manual initialization cost prohibitive. Consequently, a large number of automatic methods have also been proposed for video object segmentation. A subset of these methods employs motion grouping ([19, 18, 4]) for object segmentation. Other methods ([10, 3, 21]) use appearance cues to segment each frame first and then use both appearance and motion constraints for a bottom-up final segmentation. Methods like [9, 3, 11, 22] present efficient optimization frameworks for spatiotemporal grouping of pixels for video segmentation. However, all of these automatic methods do not have an explicit model of how an object looks or moves, and therefore, the segments usually don’t correspond to a particular object but only to image regions that exhibit coherent appearance or motion. Recently, several methods ([7, 5, 1]) were proposed that provided an explicit notion of how a generic object looks like. Specifically, the method [7] could extract object-like regions or ‘object proposals’ from images. This work was built upon by Lee et al. [13] and Ma and Latecki [14] to employ object proposals for object video segmentation. Lee et al. [13] proposed to detect the primary object by collecting a pool of object proposals from the video, and then applying spectral graph clustering to obtain multiple binary inlier/outlier partitions. Each inlier cluster corresponds to a particular object’s regions. Both motion and appearance based cues are used to measure the ‘objectness’ of a proposal in the cluster. The cluster with the largest average ‘objectness’ is likely to contain the primary object in video. One shortcoming of this approach is that the clustering process ignores the order of the proposals in the video, and there- fore, cannot model the evolution of object’s shape and location with time. The work by Ma and Latecki [14] attempts Input Videos Figure 3. The Video Object Segmentation Framework to mitigate this issue by utilizing relationships between object proposals in adjacent frames. The object region selection problem is modeled as a constrained Maximum Weight Cliques problem in order to find the true object region from all the video frames simultaneously. However, this problem is NP-hard ([14]) and an approximate optimization technique is used to obtain the solution. The object proposal based segmentation approaches [13, 14] have two additional limitations compared to the proposed method. First, in both approaches, object proposal generation for a particular frame doesn’t directly depend on object proposals generated for adjacent frames. Second, both approaches do not actually predict the shape of the object in adjacent frames when computing region similarity, which degrades segmentation performance for fast moving objects. In this paper, we present an approach that though inspired from aforementioned approaches, attempts to remove their shortcomings. Note that, in general, an object’s shape and appearance varies slowly from frame to frame. Therefore, the intuition is that the object proposal sequence in a video with high ‘objectness’, and high similarity across frames is likely to be the primary object. To this end, we use optical flow to track the evolution of object shape, and compute the difference between predicted and actual shape (along with appearance) to measure similarity of object proposals across frames. The ‘objectness’ is measured using appearance and a motion based criterion that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at the boundaries between objects proposals and the background. Moreover, the primary object proposal selection problem is formulated as the longest path problem for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), for which (unlike [14]) an optimal solution exists in linear time. Note that, if the temporal order of object proposals locations (across frames) is not used ([13], then it can result in no proposals being associated with the prima666222779 ry object for many frames (please see Figure 1). The proposed method not only uses object proposals from a particular frame (please see Figure 2), but also expands the proposal set using predictions from proposals of neighboring frame. The combination of proposal expansion, and the predicted shape based similarity criteria results in temporally dense and spatially accurate primary object proposal extraction. We have evaluated the proposed approach using several challenging benchmark videos and it outperforms both unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods In Section 2, the proposed layered DAG based object selection approach is introduced and discussed in detail; In Section 3, both qualitative and quantitative experiments results for two publicly available datasets and some other challenging videos are shown; The paper is concluded in Section 4. 2. Layered DAG based Video Object Segmentation 2.1. The Framework The proposed framework consists of 3 stages (as shown in Figure 3): 1. Generation of object proposals per-frame and then expansion of the proposal set for each frame based on object proposals in adjacent frames. 2. Generation of a layered DAG from all the object proposals in the video. The longest path in the graph fulfills the goal of maximizing ob- jectness and similarity scores, and represents the most likely set of proposals denoting the primary object in the video. 3. The primary object proposals are used to build object and background models using Gaussian mixtures, and a graph-cuts based optimization method is used to obtain refined per-pixel segmentation. Since the proposed approach is centered around layered DAG framework for selection of primary object regions, we will start with its description. 2.2. Layered DAG Structure We want to extract object proposals with high objectness likelihood, high appearance similarity and smoothly varying shape from the set of all proposals obtained from the video. Also since we want to extract the primary object only, we want to extract at most a single proposal per frame. Keeping these objectives in mind, the layered DAG is formed as follows. Each object proposal is represented by two nodes: a ‘beginning node’ and an ‘ending node’ and there are two types of edges: unary edges and binary edges. The unary edges have weights which measure the objectness of a proposal. The details of the function for unary weight assignments (measuring objectness) are given in section 2.2. 1. All the beginning nodes in the same frame form a layer, so as the ending nodes. A directed unary edge is built from beginning node to ending node. Thus, each video frame is represented by two layers in the graph. DiFrame i-1 Frame i Frame i+1 s… … La2i-ye3rL2ai-y2erL2ayi-1erLa2yierL2ai+y1erL2ai+y2er… … t Figure 4. Layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure. Node “s” and “t” are source and sink nodes respectively, which have zero weights for edges with other nodes in the graph. The yellow nodes and the green nodes are “beginning nodes” and “ending nodes” respectively and they are paired such that each yellow-green pair represents an object proposal. All the beginning nodes in the same frame are arranged in a layer and the same as the ending nodes. The green edges are the unary edges and red edges are the binary edges. rected binary edges are built from any ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. The binary edges have weights which measure the appearance and shape similarity between the corresponding object proposals across frames. The binary weight assignment functions are introduced in Section 2.2.2. Figure 4 is an illustration of the graph structure.

The yellow nodes are “beginning nodes”, the green nodes are “ending nodes”, the green edges are unary edges with weights indicating objectness and the red edges are binary edges with weights indicating appearance and shape similarity (note that the graph only shows some of the binary edges for simplicity). There is also a virtual source node s and a sink node t with 0 weighted edges (black edges) to the graph. Note that, it is not necessary to build binary edges from an ending node to all the beginning nodes in latter layers. In practice, only building binary edges to the next three subsequent frames is enough for most of the videos. 2.2.1 Unary Edges Unary edges measure the objectness of the proposals. Both appearance and motion are important to infer the objectness, so the scoring function for object proposals is defined as Sunary (r) = A(r) + M(r), in which r is any object proposal, A(r) is the appearance score and M(r) is the motion score. We define M(r) as the average Frobenius norm of optical flow gradient around the boundary of object pro666232880 Figure 5. Optical Flow Gradient Magnitude Motion Scoring.

The intuition behind this motion scoring function is that, the motions of foreground object and background are usually distinct, so boundary of moving objects usually implies discontinuity in motion. Therefore, ideally, the gradient of optical flow should have high magnitude around foreground object boundary (this phenomenon could be easily observed from Figure 5). In equation 1, we use the Frobenius norm to measure the optical flow gradient magnitude, the higher the value, the more likely the region is from a moving object. In practice, usually the maximum of optical flow gradient magnitude does not coincide exactly with the moving object boundary due to underlying approximation of optical flow calculation. Therefore, we dilate the object proposal boundary and get the average optical flow gradient magnitude as the motion score. Figure 5 is an illustration of this process. The appearance scoring function A(r) is measured by the objectness ([7]). 2.2.2 Binary Edges Binary edges measure the similarity between object proposals across frames. For measuring the similarity of regions, color, location, size and shape are the properties to be considered. We define the similarity between regions as the weight of binary edges as follows: Sbinary(rm, rn) = λ · Scolor(rm, rn) · Soverlap(rm, rn), (2) in which rm and rn are regions from frame m and n, λ is a constant value for adjusting the ratio between unary and binary edges, Soverlap is the overlap similarity between regions and Scolor is the color histogram similarity: Scolor(rm, rn) = hist(rm) · hist(rn)T, (3) in which hist(r) is the normalized color histogram for a region r. Soverlap(rm,rn) =||rrmm∩∪ wwaarrppmmnn((rrnn))||, (4) in which warpmn (rn) is the warped region from rn by optical flow to frame m. It is clear that Scolor encodes the color similarity between regions and Soverlap encodes the size and location similarity between regions. If two regions are close, and the sizes and shapes are similar, the value would be higher, and vice versa. Note that, unlike prior approaches [13, 14], we use optical flow to predict the region (i.e. encoding location and shape), and therefore we are better able to compute similarity for fast moving objects. 2.2.3 Dynamic Programming Solution Until now, we have built the layered DAG and the objective is clear: to find the highest weighted path in the DAG. Assume the graph contains 2F + 2 layers (F is the frame number), the source node is in layer 0 and the sink node is in layer 2F + 2. Let Nij denotes the jth node in ith layer and E(Nij , Nkl) denotes the edge from Nij to Nkl. Layer i has Mi nodes. Let P = (p1, p2 , ..., pm+1) = (N01, Nj1j2, ..., Njm−1jm, N(2n+2)1) be a path from source to sink node. Therefore, ?m Pmax= arg mPax?i=1E(pi,pi+1). (5) Pmax forms a Longest (simple) Path Problem for DAG. Let OPT(i, j) be the maximum path value for Nij from source node. The maximum path value satisfies the following recurrence for i≥ 1and j ≥ 1: OPT(i,j) = k=0...i−m1a,lx=1...Mk[OPT(k,l) + E(Nkl,Nij)]. (6) This problem could be solved by dynamic programming in linear time [12]. The computational complexity for the algorithm is O(n + m), in which n is the number of nodes 666322 919 and m is the number of edges. The most important parameter for the layered DAG is the ratio λ between unary edges and binary edges. However, in practice, the results are not sensitive to it, and in the experiments λ is simply set to be 1. 2.3. Per-pixel Video Object Segmentation Once the primary object proposals are obtained in a video, the results are further refined by a graph-based method to get per-pixel segmentation results. We define a spatiotemporal graph by connecting frames temporally with optical flow displacement. Each of the nodes in the graph is a pixel in a frame, and edges are set to be the 8-neighbors within one frame and the forward-backward 18 neighbors in adjacent frames. We define the energy function for labeling f = [f1, f2, ..., fn] of n pixels with prior knowledge of h: E(f,h) = ?Dhi(fi) + λ ?i∈S ? Vi,j(fi,fj), (7) (i,?j)∈N where S = {pi, ..., pn} is the set of n pixels in the video, N cwohnesriest Ss o =f neighboring pixels, ta ondf i,j ixnedlesx in nt thhee pixels. pi could be set to 0 or 1which represents background or foreground respectively. The unary term Dih defines the cost of labeling pixel iwith label fi which we get from the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for both color and location. Dih(fi) = −log(αUic(fi, h) + (1 − α)Uil(fi, h)), (8) where Uic(.) is the color-induced cost and Uil (.) is the location cost. For the binary term Vi,j (fi, fj), we follow the definitions in [17]: Vi,j(fi, fj) = [fi = fj]exp−β(Ci−Cj)2, (9) where [.] denotes the indicator function taking values 0 and 1, (Ci − Cj)2 is the Euclidean distance betwe?en two adjacent nodes in RGB space, and β = (2? (Ci − Cj)2)−1|(i,j)∈N ?We use −th Ce graph-cuts based minimization method in [8] to o?btain the optimal solution for equation 7, and thus get the final segmentation results. Next, we describe the method for object proposal generation that is used to initialize the video object segmentation process. 2.4. Object Proposal Generation & Expansion In order to achieve our goal of identifying image regions belonging to the primary object in the video, it is preferable (though not necessary) to have an object proposal corresponding to the actual object for each frame in which object is present. Using only appearance or optical flow based Figure 6. Object Proposal Expansion. For each optical flow warped object proposal in frame i− 1, we look for object proposals din o fbjreamcte p ir owpohsicahl ihnav fer high overlap erat liooosk kw fiotrh tohbej warped one. If some object proposals all have high overlap ratios with the warped one, they are merged into a new large object proposal. This process will produce the right object proposal if it is not discovered by [7] from frame i, but frame i− 1. cues to generate object proposals is usually not enough for this purpose. This phenomenon could be observed in the example shown in Figure 6. For frame iin this figure, hundreds of object proposals were generated using method in [7], however, no proposal is consistent with the true object, and the object is fragmented between different proposals. We assume that an object’s shape and location changes smoothly across frames and propose to enhance the set of object proposals for a frame by using the proposals generated for its adjacent frames. The object proposal expansion method works by the guidance of optical flow (see Figure 6). For the forward version of object proposal expansion, each object proposal rk in frame i− 1 is warped by the forward optical flow toi −fra1mine fir,a tmheen i a −ch 1ec isk wisa rmpaedde bify any proposal in frame i has a large overlap ratio with the rij 666333002 warped object proposal, i.e., o =|warpi−1,|ir(jir|ik−1) ∩ rij|. (10) The contiguous overlapped areas, for regions in i+1 with o greater than 0.5, are merged into a single region, and are used as additional proposals. Note that, the old original proposals are also kept, so this is an ‘expansion’ of the proposal set, and not a replacement. In practice, this process is carried out both forward and backward in time. Since it is an iterative process, even if suitable object proposals are missing in consecutive frames, they could potentially be produced by this expansion process. Figure 6 shows an example image sequence where the expansion process resulted in generation of a suitable proposal. 3. Experiments The proposed method was evaluated using two wellknown segmentation datasets: SegTrack dataset [20] and GaTech video segmentation dataset [9]. Quantitative comparisons are shown for SegTrack dataset since ground-truth is available for this dataset. Qualitative results are shown for GaTech video segmentation dataset. We also evaluated the proposed approach on additional challenging videos, for which we will share the ground-truth to aid future evaluations. 3.1. SegTrack Dataset We first evaluate our method on Segtrack dataset [20]. There are 6 videos in this dataset, and also a pixel-level segmentation ground-truth for each video is available. We follow the setup in the literature ([13, 14]), and use 5 (birdfall, cheetah, girl, monkeydog and parachute) of the videos for evaluation (since the ground-truth for the other one (penguin) is not useable). We use an optical flow magnitude based model selection method to infer the camera motion: for static cameras, a background subtraction cue is also used for moving object extraction; for all the results shown in this section, the static camera model was only selected (automatically) for the “birdfall” video. We compare our method with 4 state-of-the-art methods [14], [13], [20] and [6] shown in Table 1. Note that our method is a unsupervised method, and it outperforms all the other unsupervised methods except for the parachute video where it is a close second. Note that [20] and [6] are supervised methods which need an initial annotation for the first frame. The results in Table 1are the average per-frame pixel error rate compared to the ground-truth. The definition is [20]: error = XORF(f,GT), (11) where f is the segmentation labeling results of the method, GT is the ground-truth labeling of the video, and F is the (a) Birdfall (b) Cheetah (c) Girl (d) Monkeydog (e) Parachute Figure 7.

The figure shows consecutive frames (frame 38 to frame 43) from “monkeydog” video. The top 2 rows show the results of key-frame objec- t extraction method [13], and the bottom 2 rows show our object region selection results.

Numbers above are the frame indices.[Please Print in Color] primary object region from all the frames. This is the main reason that the segmentation results of the proposed method are better than prior methods. 3.2. GaTech Segmentation Dataset We also evaluated the proposed method on GaTech video segmentation dataset. We show qualitative comparison of results between the proposed approach and the original bottom-up method for the dataset in Figure 9. As one can observe, our results could segment the true foreground object from the background. The method [9] doesn’t use an object model which induces over-segmentation (although the results are very good for the general segmentation problem). 3.3. Persons and Cars Segmentation Dataset We have built a new dataset for video object segmentation. The dataset is challenging: persons are in a variety of poses; cars have different speeds, and when they are slow, it is very hard to do motion segmentation. We generate ground truth for those videos. Figure 10 shows some sample results from this dataset, and Table 2 shows the quantitative (a) waterski (b) yunakim Figure 9.

This approach also uses innovative mechanisms to compute the ‘objectness’ of a region and to compute similarity between object proposals across frames. The proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the well-known SegTrack dataset. We also demonstrate good segmentation performance on additional challenging data sets. 666333224 (a) Surfing (b) Jumping (c) Skiing (d) Sliding (e) Big car (f) Small car Figure 10.

Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>6 0.83704603 <a title="455-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

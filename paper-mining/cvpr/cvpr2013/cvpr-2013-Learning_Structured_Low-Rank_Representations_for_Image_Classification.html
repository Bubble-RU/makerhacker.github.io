<p>Author: Simon Hawe, Matthias Seibert, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques in computer vision, machine learning, and statistics rely on the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole, thus enforces basic dictionary proper- , ties such as mutual coherence explicitly during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods like K-SVD.</p><p>3 0.48926669 <a title="257-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Beta_Process_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_with_Application_to_Single_Image_Super-Resolution.html">58 cvpr-2013-Beta Process Joint Dictionary Learning for Coupled Feature Spaces with Application to Single Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Li He, Hairong Qi, Russell Zaretzki</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning overcomplete dictionaries for the coupled feature spaces, where the learned dictionaries also reflect the relationship between the two spaces. A Bayesian method using a beta process prior is applied to learn the over-complete dictionaries. Compared to previous couple feature spaces dictionary learning algorithms, our algorithm not only provides dictionaries that customized to each feature space, but also adds more consistent and accurate mapping between the two feature spaces. This is due to the unique property of the beta process model that the sparse representation can be decomposed to values and dictionary atom indicators. The proposed algorithm is able to learn sparse representations that correspond to the same dictionary atoms with the same sparsity but different values in coupled feature spaces, thus bringing consistent and accurate mapping between coupled feature spaces. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the number of dictionary atoms and their relative importance may be inferred non-parametrically.

<p>Author: Li Shen, Shuhui Wang, Gang Sun, Shuqiang Jiang, Qingming Huang</p><p>Abstract: For the task of visual categorization, the learning model is expected to be endowed with discriminative visual feature representation and flexibilities in processing many categories. Many existing approaches are designed based on a flat category structure, or rely on a set of pre-computed visual features, hence may not be appreciated for dealing with large numbers of categories. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method by taking advantage of hierarchical category correlation. For each internode of the hierarchical category structure, a discriminative dictionary and a set of classification models are learnt for visual categorization, and the dictionaries in different layers are learnt to exploit the discriminative visual properties of different granularity. Moreover, the dictionaries in lower levels also inherit the dictionary of ancestor nodes, so that categories in lower levels are described with multi-scale visual information using our dictionary learning approach. Experiments on ImageNet object data subset and SUN397 scene dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance on data with large numbers of classes compared with some state-of-the-art methods, and is more efficient in processing large numbers of categories.</p><p>5 0.44352445 <a title="257-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries.html">185 cvpr-2013-Generalized Domain-Adaptive Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Sumit Shekhar, Vishal M. Patel, Hien V. Nguyen, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Data-driven dictionaries have produced state-of-the-art results in various classification tasks. However, when the target data has a different distribution than the source data, the learned sparse representation may not be optimal. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to optimally represent both source and target by a common dictionary. Specifically, we describe a technique which jointly learns projections of data in the two domains, and a latent dictionary which can succinctly represent both the domains in the projected low-dimensional space. An efficient optimization technique is presented, which can be easily kernelized and extended to multiple domains. The algorithm is modified to learn a common discriminative dictionary, which can be further used for classification. The proposed approach does not require any explicit correspondence between the source and target domains, and shows good results even when there are only a few labels available in the target domain. Various recognition experiments show that the methodperforms onparor better than competitive stateof-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.38974008 <a title="257-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Block_and_Group_Regularized_Sparse_Modeling_for_Dictionary_Learning.html">66 cvpr-2013-Block and Group Regularized Sparse Modeling for Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Cewu Lu, Jiaping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: Online dictionary learning is particularly useful for processing large-scale and dynamic data in computer vision. It, however, faces the major difficulty to incorporate robust functions, rather than the square data fitting term, to handle outliers in training data. In thispaper, wepropose a new online framework enabling the use of ?1 sparse data fitting term in robust dictionary learning, notably enhancing the usability and practicality of this important technique.

<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Ajit Rajwade, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a dictionary learning framework that combines the proposed block/group (BGSC) or reconstructed block/group (R-BGSC) sparse coding schemes with the novel Intra-block Coherence Suppression Dictionary Learning (ICS-DL) algorithm. An important and distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that all dictionary blocks are trained simultaneously with respect to each data group while the intra-block coherence being explicitly minimized as an important objective. We provide both empirical evidence and heuristic support for this feature that can be considered as a direct consequence of incorporating both the group structure for the input data and the block structure for the dictionary in the learning process. The optimization problems for both the dictionary learning and sparse coding can be solved efficiently using block-gradient descent, and the details of the optimization algorithms are presented. We evaluate the proposed methods using well-known datasets, and favorable comparisons with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods demonstrate the viability and validity of the proposed framework.</p><p>6 0.85033506 <a title="257-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-level_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning_towards_Hierarchical_Visual_Categorization.html">296 cvpr-2013-Multi-level Discriminative Dictionary Learning towards Hierarchical Visual Categorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Sudipta N. Sinha, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets offeature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.</p><p>3 0.83375669 <a title="257-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph_Matching_with_Anchor_Nodes%3A_A_Learning_Approach.html">192 cvpr-2013-Graph Matching with Anchor Nodes: A Learning Approach</a></p>

Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods.</p><p>4 0.8265729 <a title="257-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Part_Discovery_from_Partial_Correspondence.html">325 cvpr-2013-Part Discovery from Partial Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Subhransu Maji, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of part discovery when partial correspondence between instances of a category are available. For visual categories that exhibit high diversity in structure such as buildings, our approach can be used to discover parts that are hard to name, but can be easily expressed as a correspondence between pairs of images. Parts naturally emerge from point-wise landmark matches across many instances within a category. We propose a learning framework for automatic discovery of parts in such weakly supervised settings, and show the utility of the rich part library learned in this way for three tasks: object detection, category-specific saliency estimation, and fine-grained image parsing.</p><p>5 0.82620299 <a title="257-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fusing_Robust_Face_Region_Descriptors_via_Multiple_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_in_the_Wild.html">182 cvpr-2013-Fusing Robust Face Region Descriptors via Multiple Metric Learning for Face Recognition in the Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhen Cui, Wen Li, Dong Xu, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many real-world face recognition scenarios, face images can hardly be aligned accurately due to complex appearance variations or low-quality images. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to extract robust face region descriptors. Specifically, we divide each image (resp. video) into several spatial blocks (resp. spatial-temporal volumes) and then represent each block (resp. volume) by sum-pooling the nonnegative sparse codes of position-free patches sampled within the block (resp. volume). Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) is further utilized to reduce the feature dimension, which leads to our Spatial Face Region Descriptor (SFRD) (resp. Spatial-Temporal Face Region Descriptor, STFRD) for images (resp. videos). Moreover, we develop a new distance method for face verification metric learning called Pairwise-constrained Multiple Metric Learning (PMML) to effectively integrate the face region descriptors of all blocks (resp. volumes) from an image (resp. a video). Our work achieves the state- of-the-art performances on two real-world datasets LFW and YouTube Faces (YTF) according to the restricted protocol.</p><p>6 0.82380378 <a title="257-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Instance_Constraints.html">387 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation with Instance Constraints</a></p>

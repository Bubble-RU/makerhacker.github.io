[sent-3, score-0.474]
</p><p>2 Given an SSM of a target surface, one can segment the target regions in given 3D images by registering the SSM to them. [sent-9, score-0.386]
</p><p>3 This paper assumes that 3D medical images are input and that the objective of the registration is to segment anatomical structures in the images. [sent-10, score-0.486]
</p><p>4 SSMs and their robust registration techniques are both required for accurately determining the boundaries of target organs against those nuisances. [sent-12, score-0.428]
</p><p>5 It should be reminded that each training surface is obtained by labeling the boundary of the target organ in a 3D medical image. [sent-24, score-0.443]
</p><p>6 The generalization ability measures the ability to describe any instance of the target shapes – not just those seen in the training set. [sent-28, score-0.416]
</p><p>7 When the number of the training data is small, the generalization ability is more seriously required for the SSMs. [sent-31, score-0.233]
</p><p>8 The original ASM represents the shape variety of a target surface with a subspace, which is spanned by a set of principal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, ΣX, of |l = 1, 2, · · · , M}. [sent-34, score-0.316]
</p><p>9 This exclusion improves the specificity and the compactness of the ASM but makes the generalization ability worse. [sent-37, score-0.357]
</p><p>10 When the number of the training data is small, this drawback of the lack of the generalization ability is serious, hence many methods have been proposed for improving the generalization ability[3][1 1][14]. [sent-38, score-0.353]
</p><p>11 described the goal ofthe hierarchical scheme as utilizing marginal distribution that can be estimated accurately[3]. [sent-41, score-0.177]
</p><p>12 Among these variables, the hierarchical scheme firstly examines smaller sets of highly correlated variables, and then, the joint distribution of a large number of variables is considered after smoothing, which makes the distribution more compact[3]. [sent-43, score-0.184]
</p><p>13 In the former strategy, one PCA-based SSM is constructed for representing the shape of each segment, and one more PCA-based SSM is constructed for representing the locations of all of the segments. [sent-47, score-0.189]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we employ this partitioning approach for making the SSM hierarchical, because this approach is appropriate for introducing a robust registration technique described below. [sent-48, score-0.302]
</p><p>15 Another approach for improving the generalization abil-  ity is to make the structure of the corresponding graphical model sparse[1 1]. [sent-49, score-0.317]
</p><p>16 A linear SSM can be represented by a Gaussian graphical model, and the marginal posterior probability distribution of X can be inferred on the graphical model by means of, for example, a belief propagation or of MCMC[10]. [sent-50, score-0.642]
</p><p>17 In the graph, each node represents xi, and two nodes are linked by an edge if the two corresponding points, xi and xj are conditionally dependent. [sent-51, score-0.248]
</p><p>18 It should be reminded that the structure of the Gaussian graphical model is determined by the precision matrix, which is the inverse of the covariance: Two points, xi and xj are conditionally dependent if and only if the (i, j) component of the precision matrix is not zero. [sent-52, score-0.534]
</p><p>19 Let the empirical covariance matrix obtained from the training data be denoted by ΣX, and let the corresponding precision matrix be denoted by ΛX = ΣX−. [sent-53, score-0.297]
</p><p>20 This is also one of the main reasons why the generalization ability of ASM is poor. [sent-56, score-0.207]
</p><p>21 proposed a graphical lasso, which is a method for estimating a precision matrix from the empirical covariance matrix using a sparsity regularization[6]. [sent-58, score-0.428]
</p><p>22 Using the graphical lasso, one can obtain a sparse Gaussian graphical model from the training set. [sent-59, score-0.42]
</p><p>23 It has been reported that, one can improve the registration accuracy by estimating the structure of the Gaussian graphical model of the SSM by means of the graphical lasso[1 1]. [sent-60, score-0.671]
</p><p>24 We represent the global SSM us-  ing a graphical model of which structure is determined by means of the graphical lasso, in the proposed method. [sent-61, score-0.394]
</p><p>25 Robust Registration Robust registration methods are needed for accurately registering SSMs to given medical images because of the nuisances mentioned above. [sent-64, score-0.499]
</p><p>26 Among them, some methods use a sparsity regularization techniques for the robust nonrigid registration[10] [15]. [sent-67, score-0.188]
</p><p>27 Let a target point in a given image corresponding to xi be denoted by yi, and let Y = [yT1, y2T, · ·· , yTN]T. [sent-68, score-0.287]
</p><p>28 Then, the minus log likelihood functions in many nonrobust non-rigid registration methods can be simply represented as follows: E? [sent-70, score-0.4]
</p><p>29 We employ PCA-based SSM for representing the shape of each segment because such the model has high ability for the specificity, as mentioned above. [sent-96, score-0.262]
</p><p>30 Representing the local shape of each segment by a PCA-based SSM, we introduce the sparsity regularization for registering each segment robustly. [sent-97, score-0.472]
</p><p>31 Likelihood of Point Location A set of candidate points of the boundary of the target organ should be firstly detected. [sent-100, score-0.31]
</p><p>32 The candidate points are detected based on the likelihood of xi: The likelihood function, L(xi) = p(I|xi), is designed so that the likelihood becomes high on pt(heI txrue boundary to be 222999777866  Figure 1. [sent-102, score-0.371]
</p><p>33 An example of registration error that exists even after all model points are located on the true boundary extracted from the image. [sent-103, score-0.414]
</p><p>34 In most of all methods of PDM registration, the likelihood of xi is determined based only on the local appearance, Ii, around xi: L(xi) = p(Ii |xi). [sent-105, score-0.209]
</p><p>35 Firstly, th|ex target points can be located on false boundaries in a given image, because one cannot distinguish between the true boundary and the false ones based only on the local appearances. [sent-107, score-0.233]
</p><p>36 Secondly, the continuity of the boundary in a given image is not evaluated, and hence there can exist large residuals between the registered surface and the true boundary in the image even when all points of the model are located on the true boundary, as shown in Fig. [sent-108, score-0.34]
</p><p>37 In this paper, we determine the likelihood based on the appearance around a line segment, sij, that connects two neighboring points, xi and xj . [sent-111, score-0.353]
</p><p>38 As the result, the likelihood is represented by a two-variable function, L(xi, xj) = p(Ii |xi)p(Ij |xj)p(Iij |xi, xj ), where Iij is the local appearance arou|xnd sij . [sent-112, score-0.283]
</p><p>39 |Txhe arguments of the likelihood are the pairwise variables, and the computation of the likelihood can be incorporated into the registration algorithms by representing the SSM using a pairwise graphical model[5]. [sent-113, score-0.68]
</p><p>40 Method In this section, the proposed hierarchical SSM is firstly described, and then the registration algorithm is explained. [sent-119, score-0.365]
</p><p>41 Construction of Hierarchical SSM In the proposed method, a target surface is partitioned  into K segments, a linear SSM is constructed for each of the segments, and the relationship between the shapes of the segments is represented by a Gaussian graphical model. [sent-122, score-0.545]
</p><p>42 Let the surface of a target organ manually labeled in Il be denoted by Sl . [sent-126, score-0.298]

</p><p>45 The former characteristic is needed for representing the statistical relationship between the model points and the shape parameters, and the  ×  latter one is a strength when the number of training samples is small. [sent-139, score-0.212]

</p><p>47 We introduce the graphical lasso for handling the problem of the over-fitting of empirical covariance matrix. [sent-162, score-0.376]
</p><p>48 In the graphical lasso, the precision matrix, Λ, is esti-  mated as follows: Λˆ = argmΛin{−logdet Λ + tr (ΣΘ)Λ) + λ? [sent-163, score-0.222]
</p><p>49 This Gaussian distribution is represented with a graphical model, of which edges correspond to the non-zero off diagonal components of Λˆ. [sent-168, score-0.277]
</p><p>50 It should be noted that this graphical model represents the conditional dependencies between the deformation modes of different segments, and that the structure of the graph should be sparse, if the shape parameters of two distantly-located segments are conditionally independent. [sent-169, score-0.478]
</p><p>51 Likelihood of Target Point Location For registering k-th segment, a target point is detected from the given image based on the likelihood, Lk = Lk ({xi |i ∈ Lk}). [sent-175, score-0.196]
</p><p>52 Incorporating the SSM in (9), we represent the simultaneous posterior distribution of the model points and the shape parameters as follows:  p({Xk}, {θk}|I)  ∝  ? [sent-206, score-0.252]

<p>Author: Jiayi Ma, Ji Zhao, Jinwen Tian, Zhuowen Tu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We present a new point matching algorithm for robust nonrigid registration. The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the transformation between two point sets. In the first step of the iteration, feature descriptors such as shape context are used to establish rough correspondence. In the second step, we estimate the transformation using a robust estimator called L2E. This is the main novelty of our approach and it enables us to deal with the noise and outliers which arise in the correspondence step. The transformation is specified in a functional space, more specifically a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply our method to nonrigid sparse image feature correspondence on 2D images and 3D surfaces.

<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling.</p><p>4 0.12194521 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Groupwise_Registration_via_Graph_Shrinkage_on_the_Image_Manifold.html">194 cvpr-2013-Groupwise Registration via Graph Shrinkage on the Image Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>5 0.10767381 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less_Non-rigid_Registration_of_Triangular_Surface_Meshes.html">97 cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less Non-rigid Registration of Triangular Surface Meshes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiayi Ma, Ji Zhao, Jinwen Tian, Zhuowen Tu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We present a new point matching algorithm for robust nonrigid registration. The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the transformation between two point sets. In the first step of the iteration, feature descriptors such as shape context are used to establish rough correspondence. In the second step, we estimate the transformation using a robust estimator called L2E. This is the main novelty of our approach and it enables us to deal with the noise and outliers which arise in the correspondence step. The transformation is specified in a functional space, more specifically a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply our method to nonrigid sparse image feature correspondence on 2D images and 3D surfaces. Our results quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods, particularly when there are a large number of outliers. Moreover, our method of robustly estimating transformations from correspondences is general and has many other applications.</p><p>5 0.7069478 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Templateless_Quasi-rigid_Shape_Modeling_with_Implicit_Loop-Closure.html">424 cvpr-2013-Templateless Quasi-rigid Shape Modeling with Implicit Loop-Closure</a></p>

<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Arpit Jain, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: Junctions are strong cues for understanding the geometry of a scene. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting junctions and using them for recovering the spatial layout of an indoor scene. Junction detection has always been challenging due to missing and spurious lines. We work in a constrained Manhattan world setting where the junctions are formed by only line segments along the three principal orthogonal directions. Junctions can be classified into several categories based on the number and orientations of the incident line segments. We provide a simple and efficient voting scheme to detect and classify these junctions in real images. Indoor scenes are typically modeled as cuboids and we formulate the problem of the cuboid layout estimation as an inference problem in a conditional random field. Our formulation allows the incorporation of junction features and the training is done using structured prediction techniques. We outperform other single view geometry estimation methods on standard datasets.</p><p>3 0.79490089 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>4 0.78241009 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>5 0.76477396 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Occlusion_Patterns_for_Object_Class_Detection.html">311 cvpr-2013-Occlusion Patterns for Object Class Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Bojan Pepikj, Michael Stark, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Despite the success of recent object class recognition systems, the long-standing problem of partial occlusion remains a major challenge, and a principled solution is yet to be found. In this paper we leave the beaten path of methods that treat occlusion as just another source of noise instead, we include the occluder itself into the modelling, by mining distinctive, reoccurring occlusion patterns from annotated training data. These patterns are then used as training data for dedicated detectors of varying sophistication. In particular, we evaluate and compare models that range from standard object class detectors to hierarchical, part-based representations of occluder/occludee pairs. In an extensive evaluation we derive insights that can aid further developments in tackling the occlusion challenge. –</p><p>6 0.76232189 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Estimation_of_Nonrigid_Transformation_for_Point_Set_Registration.html">360 cvpr-2013-Robust Estimation of Nonrigid Transformation for Point Set Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Detecting faces in uncontrolled environments continues to be a challenge to traditional face detection methods[24] due to the large variation in facial appearances, as well as occlusion and clutter. In order to overcome these challenges, we present a novel and robust exemplarbased face detector that integrates image retrieval and discriminative learning. A large database of faces with bounding rectangles and facial landmark locations is collected, and simple discriminative classifiers are learned from each of them. A voting-based method is then proposed to let these classifiers cast votes on the test image through an efficient image retrieval technique. As a result, faces can be very efficiently detected by selecting the modes from the voting maps, without resorting to exhaustive sliding window-style scanning. Moreover, due to the exemplar-based framework, our approach can detect faces under challenging conditions without explicitly modeling their variations. Evaluation on two public benchmark datasets shows that our new face detection approach is accurate and efficient, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. We further propose to use image retrieval for face validation (in order to remove false positives) and for face alignment/landmark localization. The same methodology can also be easily generalized to other facerelated tasks, such as attribute recognition, as well as general object detection.</p><p>3 0.23477182 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based_Face_Parsing.html">152 cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based Face Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon M. Smith, Li Zhang, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an exemplar-based face image segmentation algorithm. We take inspiration from previous works on image parsing for general scenes. Our approach assumes a database of exemplar face images, each of which is associated with a hand-labeled segmentation map. Given a test image, our algorithm first selects a subset of exemplar images from the database, Our algorithm then computes a nonrigid warp for each exemplar image to align it with the test image. Finally, we propagate labels from the exemplar images to the test image in a pixel-wise manner, using trained weights to modulate and combine label maps from different exemplars. We evaluate our method on two challenging datasets and compare with two face parsing algorithms and a general scene parsing algorithm. We also compare our segmentation results with contour-based face alignment results; that is, we first run the alignment algorithms to extract contour points and then derive segments from the contours. Our algorithm compares favorably with all previous works on all datasets evaluated.</p><p>4 0.21598153 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events.html">402 cvpr-2013-Social Role Discovery in Human Events</a></p>
<p>Author: Vignesh Ramanathan, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of recognizing social roles played by people in an event. Social roles are governed by human interactions, and form a fundamental component of human event description. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, where we are provided different videos belonging to an event class, without training role labels. Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.</p><p>5 0.17847937 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-agent_Event_Detection%3A_Localization_and_Role_Assignment.html">292 cvpr-2013-Multi-agent Event Detection: Localization and Role Assignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint estimation technique of event localization and role assignment when the target video event is described by a scenario. Specifically, to detect multi-agent events from video, our algorithm identifies agents involved in an event and assigns roles to the participating agents. Instead of iterating through all possible agent-role combinations, we formulate the joint optimization problem as two efficient subproblemsâ€”quadratic programming for role assignment followed by linear programming for event localization. Additionally, we reduce the computational complexity significantly by applying role-specific event detectors to each agent independently. We test the performance of our algorithm in natural videos, which contain multiple target events and nonparticipating agents.</p><p>6 0.17282413 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding_Children%27s_Social_Behavior.html">103 cvpr-2013-Decoding Children's Social Behavior</a></p>

Kim, Liliana Lo Presti, Jianming Zhang, Denis Lantsman, Jonathan Bidwell, Zhefan Ye</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new problem domain for activity recognition: the analysis of children â€™s social and communicative behaviors based on video and audio data. We specifically target interactions between children aged 1â€“2 years and an adult. Such interactions arise naturally in the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as autism. We introduce a new publicly-available dataset containing over 160 sessions of a 3â€“5 minute child-adult interaction. In each session, the adult examiner followed a semistructured play interaction protocol which was designed to elicit a broad range of social behaviors. We identify the key technical challenges in analyzing these behaviors, and describe methods for decoding the interactions. We present experimental results that demonstrate the potential of the dataset to drive interesting research questions, and show preliminary results for multi-modal activity recognition.</p><p>5 0.66289979 <a title="172-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Augmenting_Bag-of-Words%3A_Data-Driven_Discovery_of_Temporal_and_Structural_Information_for_Activity_Recognition.html">49 cvpr-2013-Augmenting Bag-of-Words: Data-Driven Discovery of Temporal and Structural Information for Activity Recognition</a></p>

Our approach specifically addresses the limitations of standard BoW approaches, which fail to represent the underlying temporal and causal information that is inherent in activity streams. In addition, we also propose the use ofrandomly sampled regular expressions to discover and encode patterns in activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experimental evaluations where we successfully recognize activities and detect anomalies in four complex datasets.</p><p>6 0.65646851 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_and_Discovering_Adversarial_Team_Behaviors_Using_Player_Roles.html">356 cvpr-2013-Representing and Discovering Adversarial Team Behaviors Using Player Roles</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Ask, Olof Enqvist, Fredrik Kahl</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with model fitting in the presence of noise and outliers. Previously it has been shown that the number of outliers can be minimized with polynomial complexity in the number of measurements. This paper improves on these results in two ways. First, it is shown that for a large class of problems, the statistically more desirable truncated L2-norm can be optimized with the same complexity. Then, with the same methodology, it is shown how to transform multi-model fitting into a purely combinatorial problemâ€”with worst-case complexity that is polynomial in the number of measurements, though exponential in the number of models. We apply our framework to a series of hard registration and stitching problems demonstrating that the approach is not only of theoretical interest. It gives a practical method for simultaneously dealing with measurement noise and large amounts of outliers for fitting problems with lowdimensional models.</p><p>3 0.89483988 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Rank-1_Tensor_Approximation.html">301 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Rank-1 Tensor Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinchu Shi, Haibin Ling, Junling Xing, Weiming Hu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we formulate multi-target tracking (MTT) as a rank-1 tensor approximation problem and propose an ?1 norm tensor power iteration solution. In particular, a high order tensor is constructed based on trajectories in the time window, with each tensor element as the affinity of the corresponding trajectory candidate. The local assignment variables are the ?1 normalized vectors, which are used to approximate the rank-1 tensor. Our approach provides a flexible and effective formulation where both pairwise and high-order association energies can be used expediently. We also show the close relation between our formulation and the multi-dimensional assignment (MDA) model. To solve the optimization in the rank-1 tensor approximation, we propose an algorithm that iteratively powers the intermediate solution followed by an ?1 normalization. Aside from effectively capturing high-order motion information, the proposed solver runs efficiently with proved convergence. The experimental validations are conducted on two challenging datasets and our method demonstrates promising performances on both.</p><p>4 0.89376152 <a title="172-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>5 0.88961393 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>6 0.88894439 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>

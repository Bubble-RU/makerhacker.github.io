<p>Author: Zihan Zhou, Hailin Jin, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Recently, a new image deformation technique called content-preserving warping (CPW) has been successfully employed to produce the state-of-the-art video stabilization results in many challenging cases. The key insight of CPW is that the true image deformation due to viewpoint change can be well approximated by a carefully constructed warp using a set of sparsely constructed 3D points only. However, since CPW solely relies on the tracked feature points to guide the warping, it works poorly in large textureless regions, such as ground and building interiors. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we present a hybrid approach for novel view synthesis, observing that the textureless regions often correspond to large planar surfaces in the scene. Particularly, given a jittery video, we first segment each frame into piecewise planar regions as well as regions labeled as non-planar using Markov random fields. Then, a new warp is computed by estimating a single homography for regions belong to the same plane, while in- heriting results from CPW in the non-planar regions. We demonstrate how the segmentation information can be efficiently obtained and seamlessly integrated into the stabilization framework. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>3 0.20025253 <a title="47-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Megastereo%3A_Constructing_High-Resolution_Stereo_Panoramas.html">283 cvpr-2013-Megastereo: Constructing High-Resolution Stereo Panoramas</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Richardt, Yael Pritch, Henning Zimmer, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung</p><p>Abstract: We present a solution for generating high-quality stereo panoramas at megapixel resolutions. While previous approaches introduced the basic principles, we show that those techniques do not generalise well to today’s high image resolutions and lead to disturbing visual artefacts. As our first contribution, we describe the necessary correction steps and a compact representation for the input images in order to achieve a highly accurate approximation to the required ray space. Our second contribution is a flow-based upsampling of the available input rays which effectively resolves known aliasing issues like stitching artefacts. The required rays are generated on the fly to perfectly match the desired output resolution, even for small numbers of input images. In addition, the upsampling is real-time and enables direct interactive control over the desired stereoscopic depth effect. In combination, our contributions allow the generation of stereoscopic panoramas at high output resolutions that are virtually free of artefacts such as seams, stereo discontinuities, vertical parallax and other mono-/stereoscopic shape distortions. Our process is robust, and other types of multiperspective panoramas, such as linear panoramas, can also benefit from our contributions. We show various comparisons and high-resolution results.</p><p>4 0.14458252 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Object_Reconstruction_with_Semantic_Priors.html">110 cvpr-2013-Dense Object Reconstruction with Semantic Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Sid Yingze Bao, Manmohan Chandraker, Yuanqing Lin, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present a dense reconstruction approach that overcomes the drawbacks of traditional multiview stereo by incorporating semantic information in the form of learned category-level shape priors and object detection. Given training data comprised of 3D scans and images of objects from various viewpoints, we learn a prior comprised of a mean shape and a set of weighted anchor points. The former captures the commonality of shapes across the category, while the latter encodes similarities between instances in the form of appearance and spatial consistency. We propose robust algorithms to match anchor points across instances that enable learning a mean shape for the category, even with large shape variations across instances. We model the shape of an object instance as a warped version of the category mean, along with instance-specific details. Given multiple images of an unseen instance, we collate information from 2D object detectors to align the structure from motion point cloud with the mean shape, which is subsequently warped and refined to approach the actual shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is general enough to learn semantic priors for different object categories, yet powerful enough to reconstruct individual shapes with large variations. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our framework can produce more accurate reconstructions than alternative state-of-the-art multiview stereo systems.</p><p>5 0.11763679 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressible_Motion_Fields.html">88 cvpr-2013-Compressible Motion Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Giuseppe Ottaviano, Pushmeet Kohli</p><p>Abstract: Traditional video compression methods obtain a compact representation for image frames by computing coarse motion fields defined on patches of pixels called blocks, in order to compensate for the motion in the scene across frames. This piecewise constant approximation makes the motion field efficiently encodable, but it introduces block artifacts in the warped image frame. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating dense motion fields that, while accurately predicting one frame from a given reference frame by warping it with the field, are also compressible. We introduce a representation for motion fields based on wavelet bases, and approximate the compressibility of their coefficients with a piecewise smooth surrogate function that yields an objective function similar to classical optical flow formulations. We then show how to quantize and encode such coefficients with adaptive precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by com- paring its performance with a state-of-the-art wavelet video encoder. Experimental results on a number of standard flow and video datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms both block-based and optical-flow-based motion compensation algorithms.</p><p>6 0.11138994 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimal_Geometric_Fitting_under_the_Truncated_L2-Norm.html">317 cvpr-2013-Optimal Geometric Fitting under the Truncated L2-Norm</a></p>

<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>4 0.55524099 <a title="47-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-FasT-Match%3A_Fast_Affine_Template_Matching.html">162 cvpr-2013-FasT-Match: Fast Affine Template Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Korman, Daniel Reichman, Gilad Tsur, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Fast-Match is a fast algorithm for approximate template matching under 2D affine transformations that minimizes the Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD) error measure. There is a huge number of transformations to consider but we prove that they can be sampled using a density that depends on the smoothness of the image. For each potential transformation, we approximate the SAD error using a sublinear algorithm that randomly examines only a small number of pixels. We further accelerate the algorithm using a branch-and-bound scheme. As images are known to be piecewise smooth, the result is a practical affine template matching algorithm with approximation guarantees, that takes a few seconds to run on a standard machine. We perform several experiments on three different datasets, and report very good results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first template matching algorithm which is guaranteed to handle arbitrary 2D affine transformations.</p><p>5 0.53980643 <a title="47-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Plane-Based_Content_Preserving_Warps_for_Video_Stabilization.html">333 cvpr-2013-Plane-Based Content Preserving Warps for Video Stabilization</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: Under unknown directional lighting, the uncalibrated Lambertian photometric stereo algorithm recovers the shape of a smooth surface up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We resolve this ambiguity from the halfvector symmetry, which is observed in many isotropic materials. Under this symmetry, a 2D BRDF slice with low-rank structure can be obtained from an image, if the surface normals and light directions are correctly recovered. In general, this structure is destroyed by the GBR ambiguity. As a result, we can resolve the ambiguity by restoring this structure. We develop a simple algorithm of auto-calibration from separable homogeneous specular reflection of real images. Compared with previous methods, this method takes a holistic approach to exploiting reflectance symmetry and produces superior results.</p><p>2 0.82575977 <a title="47-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Mirror_Surface_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image.html">286 cvpr-2013-Mirror Surface Reconstruction from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Liu, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing the shape of a smooth mirror surface from a single image. In particular, we consider the case where the camera is observing the reflection of a static reference target in the unknown mirror. We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82158464 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>
<p>Author: Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael S. Brown, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions oftheprojective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with significantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.</p><p>4 0.78255212 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.77922183 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Determining_Motion_Directly_from_Normal_Flows_Upon_the_Use_of_a_Spherical_Eye_Platform.html">124 cvpr-2013-Determining Motion Directly from Normal Flows Upon the Use of a Spherical Eye Platform</a></p>
<p>Author: Tak-Wai Hui, Ronald Chung</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of recovering camera motion from video data, which does not require the establishment of feature correspondences or computation of optical flows but from normal flows directly. We have designed an imaging system that has a wide field of view by fixating a number of cameras together to form an approximate spherical eye. With a substantially widened visual field, we discover that estimating the directions of translation and rotation components of the motion separately are possible and particularly efficient. In addition, the inherent ambiguities between translation and rotation also disappear. Magnitude of rotation is recovered subsequently. Experimental results on synthetic and real image data are provided. The results show that not only the accuracy of motion estimation is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methods that require explicit feature correspondences or optical flows, but also a faster computation time.</p><p>6 0.77901059 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Manhattan_Junction_Catalogue_for_Spatial_Reasoning_of_Indoor_Scenes.html">278 cvpr-2013-Manhattan Junction Catalogue for Spatial Reasoning of Indoor Scenes</a></p>

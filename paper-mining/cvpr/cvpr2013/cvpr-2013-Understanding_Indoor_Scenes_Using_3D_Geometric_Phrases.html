<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Indoor functional objects exhibit large view and appearance variations, thus are difficult to be recognized by the traditional appearance-based classification paradigm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essentialproperty to define an indoor object, e.g. “a chair to sit on ”; ii) The geometry (3D shape) ofan object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometryappearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, , functional groups, , functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate theproposed approach not only significantly widens the scope ofindoor sceneparsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance.</p><p>3 0.31002864 <a title="446-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Bayesian_Rooms_Using_Composite_3D_Object_Models.html">445 cvpr-2013-Understanding Bayesian Rooms Using Composite 3D Object Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Luca Del_Pero, Joshua Bowdish, Bonnie Kermgard, Emily Hartley, Kobus Barnard</p><p>Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Bayesian generative model for understanding indoor scenes. While it is common in this domain to approximate objects with 3D bounding boxes, we propose using strong representations with finer granularity. For example, we model a chair as a set of four legs, a seat and a backrest. We find that modeling detailed geometry improves recognition and reconstruction, and enables more refined use of appearance for scene understanding. We demonstrate this with a new likelihood function that re- wards 3D object hypotheses whose 2D projection is more uniform in color distribution. Such a measure would be confused by background pixels if we used a bounding box to represent a concave object like a chair. Complex objects are modeled using a set or re-usable 3D parts, and we show that this representation captures much of the variation among object instances with relatively few parameters. We also designed specific data-driven inference mechanismsfor eachpart that are shared by all objects containing that part, which helps make inference transparent to the modeler. Further, we show how to exploit contextual relationships to detect more objects, by, for example, proposing chairs around and underneath tables. We present results showing the benefits of each of these innovations. The performance of our approach often exceeds that of state-of-the-art methods on the two tasks of room layout estimation and object recognition, as evaluated on two bench mark data sets used in this domain. work. 1) Detailed geometric models, such as tables with legs and top (bottom left), provide better reconstructions than plain boxes (top right), when supported by image features such as geometric context [5] (top middle), or an approach to using color introduced here. 2) Non convex models allow for complex configurations, such as a chair under a table (bottom middle). 3) 3D contextual relationships, such as chairs being around a table, allow identifying objects supported by little image evidence, like the chair behind the table (bottom right).

<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Arpit Jain, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: Junctions are strong cues for understanding the geometry of a scene. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting junctions and using them for recovering the spatial layout of an indoor scene. Junction detection has always been challenging due to missing and spurious lines. We work in a constrained Manhattan world setting where the junctions are formed by only line segments along the three principal orthogonal directions. Junctions can be classified into several categories based on the number and orientations of the incident line segments. We provide a simple and efficient voting scheme to detect and classify these junctions in real images. Indoor scenes are typically modeled as cuboids and we formulate the problem of the cuboid layout estimation as an inference problem in a conditional random field. Our formulation allows the incorporation of junction features and the training is done using structured prediction techniques. We outperform other single view geometry estimation methods on standard datasets.</p><p>5 0.20308262 <a title="446-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Finding_Things%3A_Image_Parsing_with_Regions_and_Per-Exemplar_Detectors.html">173 cvpr-2013-Finding Things: Image Parsing with Regions and Per-Exemplar Detectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Tighe, Svetlana Lazebnik</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system for image parsing, or labeling each pixel in an image with its semantic category, aimed at achieving broad coverage across hundreds of object categories, many of them sparsely sampled. The system combines region-level features with per-exemplar sliding window detectors. Per-exemplar detectors are better suited for our parsing task than traditional bounding box detectors: they perform well on classes with little training data and high intra-class variation, and they allow object masks to be transferred into the test image for pixel-level segmentation. The proposed system achieves state-of-theart accuracy on three challenging datasets, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 labels.</p><p>6 0.16830847 <a title="446-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Linear_Approach_to_Matching_Cuboids_in_RGBD_Images.html">16 cvpr-2013-A Linear Approach to Matching Cuboids in RGBD Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Jiang, Hema Koppula, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: For scene understanding, one popular approach has been to model the object-object relationships. In this paper, we hypothesize that such relationships are only an artifact of certain hidden factors, such as humans. For example, the objects, monitor and keyboard, are strongly spatially correlated only because a human types on the keyboard while watching the monitor. Our goal is to learn this hidden human context (i.e., the human-object relationships), and also use it as a cue for labeling the scenes. We present Infinite Factored Topic Model (IFTM), where we consider a scene as being generated from two types of topics: human configurations and human-object relationships. This enables our algorithm to hallucinate the possible configurations of the humans in the scene parsimoniously. Given only a dataset of scenes containing objects but not humans, we show that our algorithm can recover the human object relationships. We then test our algorithm on the task ofattribute and object labeling in 3D scenes and show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.64364946 <a title="446-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Class-to-Image_Distance_with_Object_Matchings.html">247 cvpr-2013-Learning Class-to-Image Distance with Object Matchings</a></p>

<p>Author: Tak-Wai Hui, Ronald Chung</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of recovering camera motion from video data, which does not require the establishment of feature correspondences or computation of optical flows but from normal flows directly. We have designed an imaging system that has a wide field of view by fixating a number of cameras together to form an approximate spherical eye. With a substantially widened visual field, we discover that estimating the directions of translation and rotation components of the motion separately are possible and particularly efficient. In addition, the inherent ambiguities between translation and rotation also disappear. Magnitude of rotation is recovered subsequently. Experimental results on synthetic and real image data are provided. The results show that not only the accuracy of motion estimation is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methods that require explicit feature correspondences or optical flows, but also a faster computation time.</p><p>2 0.97909725 <a title="446-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Brain_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease%3A_A_Kernel_Learning_Approach_upon_Sparse_Gaussian_Bayesian_Network.html">129 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Brain Effective Connectivity Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease: A Kernel Learning Approach upon Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Luping Zhou, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Philip Ogunbona, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Analyzing brain networks from neuroimages is becoming a promising approach in identifying novel connectivitybased biomarkers for the Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this regard, brain “effective connectivity ” analysis, which studies the causal relationship among brain regions, is highly challenging and of many research opportunities. Most of the existing works in this field use generative methods. Despite their success in data representation and other important merits, generative methods are not necessarily discriminative, which may cause the ignorance of subtle but critical disease-induced changes. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that integrates the benefits of generative and discriminative methods to recover effective connectivity. In particular, we employ Fisher kernel to bridge the generative models of sparse Bayesian networks (SBN) and the discriminative classifiers of SVMs, and convert the SBN parameter learning to Fisher kernel learning via minimizing a generalization error bound of SVMs. Our method is able to simultaneously boost the discriminative power of both the generative SBN models and the SBN-induced SVM classifiers via Fisher kernel. The proposed method is tested on analyzing brain effective connectivity for AD from ADNI data, and demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art work.</p><p>3 0.9764812 <a title="446-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Measures_and_Meta-Measures_for_the_Supervised_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation.html">281 cvpr-2013-Measures and Meta-Measures for the Supervised Evaluation of Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jordi Pont-Tuset, Ferran Marques</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised evaluation of image segmentation algorithms. First, it surveys and structures the measures used to compare the segmentation results with a ground truth database; and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the goodness of these measures, it defines three quantitative meta-measures involving six state of the art segmentation methods. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation. We make the datasets and code of all the measures publicly available.</p><p>4 0.97192413 <a title="446-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Active_Learning_for_Image_Classification.html">34 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Active Learning for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Li, Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently active learning has attracted a lot of attention in computer vision field, as it is time and cost consuming to prepare a good set of labeled images for vision data analysis. Most existing active learning approaches employed in computer vision adopt most uncertainty measures as instance selection criteria. Although most uncertainty query selection strategies are very effective in many circumstances, they fail to take information in the large amount of unlabeled instances into account and are prone to querying outliers. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive active learning approach that combines an information density measure and a most uncertainty measure together to select critical instances to label for image classifications. Our experiments on two essential tasks of computer vision, object recognition and scene recognition, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.97160399 <a title="446-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Plane-Based_Content_Preserving_Warps_for_Video_Stabilization.html">333 cvpr-2013-Plane-Based Content Preserving Warps for Video Stabilization</a></p>
<p>Author: Zihan Zhou, Hailin Jin, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Recently, a new image deformation technique called content-preserving warping (CPW) has been successfully employed to produce the state-of-the-art video stabilization results in many challenging cases. The key insight of CPW is that the true image deformation due to viewpoint change can be well approximated by a carefully constructed warp using a set of sparsely constructed 3D points only. However, since CPW solely relies on the tracked feature points to guide the warping, it works poorly in large textureless regions, such as ground and building interiors. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we present a hybrid approach for novel view synthesis, observing that the textureless regions often correspond to large planar surfaces in the scene. Particularly, given a jittery video, we first segment each frame into piecewise planar regions as well as regions labeled as non-planar using Markov random fields. Then, a new warp is computed by estimating a single homography for regions belong to the same plane, while in- heriting results from CPW in the non-planar regions. We demonstrate how the segmentation information can be efficiently obtained and seamlessly integrated into the stabilization framework. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>6 0.97116452 <a title="446-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>

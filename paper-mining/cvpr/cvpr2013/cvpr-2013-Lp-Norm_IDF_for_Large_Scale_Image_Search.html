<p>Author: Akihiko Torii, Josef Sivic, Tomáš Pajdla, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Repeated structures such as building facades, fences or road markings often represent a significant challenge for place recognition. Repeated structures are notoriously hard for establishing correspondences using multi-view geometry.

In this work we show that repeated structures are not a nuisance but, when appropriately represented, theyform an importantdistinguishing feature for many places. We describe a representation of repeated structures suitable for scalable retrieval. It is based on robust detection of repeated image structures and a simple modification of weights in the bag-of-visual-word model. Place recognition results are shown on datasets of street-level imagery from Pittsburgh and San Francisco demonstrating significant gains in recognition performance compared to the standard bag-of-visual-words baseline and more recently proposed burstiness weighting.</p><p>3 0.076384075 <a title="275-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Query_Adaptive_Similarity_for_Large_Scale_Object_Retrieval.html">343 cvpr-2013-Query Adaptive Similarity for Large Scale Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Danfeng Qin, Christian Wengert, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Many recent object retrieval systems rely on local features for describing an image. The similarity between a pair of images is measured by aggregating the similarity between their corresponding local features. In this paper we present a probabilistic framework for modeling the feature to feature similarity measure. We then derive a query adaptive distance which is appropriate for global similarity evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a function to score the individual contributions into an image to image similarity within the probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that our method improves the retrieval accuracy significantly and consistently. Moreover, our result compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>4 0.075473912 <a title="275-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Bayesian_Approach_to_Multimodal_Visual_Dictionary_Learning.html">5 cvpr-2013-A Bayesian Approach to Multimodal Visual Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Go Irie, Dong Liu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, most existing visual dictionary learning methods rely on image descriptors alone or together with class labels. However, Web images are often associated with text data which may carry substantial information regarding image semantics, and may be exploited for visual dictionary learning. This paper explores this idea by leveraging relational information between image descriptors and textual words via co-clustering, in addition to information of image descriptors. Existing co-clustering methods are not optimal for this problem because they ignore the structure of image descriptors in the continuous space, which is crucial for capturing visual characteristics of images. We propose a novel Bayesian co-clustering model to jointly estimate the underlying distributions of the continuous image descriptors as well as the relationship between such distributions and the textual words through a unified Bayesian inference. Extensive experiments on image categorization and retrieval have validated the substantial value of the proposed joint modeling in improving visual dictionary learning, where our model shows superior performance over several recent methods.</p><p>5 0.063971803 <a title="275-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Topical_Video_Object_Discovery_from_Key_Frames_by_Modeling_Word_Co-occurrence_Prior.html">434 cvpr-2013-Topical Video Object Discovery from Key Frames by Modeling Word Co-occurrence Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Gangqiang Zhao, Junsong Yuan, Gang Hua</p><p>Abstract: A topical video object refers to an object that is frequently highlighted in a video. It could be, e.g., the product logo and the leading actor/actress in a TV commercial. We propose a topic model that incorporates a word co-occurrence prior for efficient discovery of topical video objects from a set of key frames. Previous work using topic models, such as Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA), for video object discovery often takes a bag-of-visual-words representation, which ignored important co-occurrence information among the local features. We show that such data driven co-occurrence information from bottom-up can conveniently be incorporated in LDA with a Gaussian Markov prior, which combines top down probabilistic topic modeling with bottom up priors in a unified model. Our experiments on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover different types of topical objects despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting changes, or even partial occlusions. The efficacy of the co-occurrence prior is clearly demonstrated when comparing with topic models without such priors.</p><p>6 0.063536637 <a title="275-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Leveraging_Structure_from_Motion_to_Learn_Discriminative_Codebooks_for_Scalable_Landmark_Classification.html">268 cvpr-2013-Leveraging Structure from Motion to Learn Discriminative Codebooks for Scalable Landmark Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Wang, Jianjia Zhang, Luping Zhou, Wanqing Li</p><p>Abstract: Distributional word clustering merges the words having similar probability distributions to attain reliable parameter estimation, compact classification models and even better classification performance. Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (AIB) is one of the typical word clustering algorithms and has been applied to both traditional text classification and recent image recognition. Although enjoying theoretical elegance, AIB has one main issue on its computational efficiency, especially when clustering a large number of words. Different from existing solutions to this issue, we analyze the characteristics of its objective function the loss of mutual information, and show that by merely using the ratio of word-class joint probabilities of each word, good candidate word pairs for merging can be easily identified. Based on this finding, we propose a fast approximate AIB algorithm and show that it can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AIB while well maintaining or even slightly increasing its classification performance. Experimental study on both text and image classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm can achieve more than 100 times speedup on large real data sets over the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>4 0.7438516 <a title="275-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-All_About_VLAD.html">38 cvpr-2013-All About VLAD</a></p>
<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this paper is large scale object instance retrieval, given a query image. A starting point of such systems is feature detection and description, for example using SIFT. The focus of this paper, however, is towards very large scale retrieval where, due to storage requirements, very compact image descriptors are required and no information about the original SIFT descriptors can be accessed directly at run time. We start from VLAD, the state-of-the art compact descriptor introduced by J´ egou et al. [8] for this purpose, and make three novel contributions: first, we show that a simple change to the normalization method significantly improves retrieval performance; second, we show that vocabulary adaptation can substantially alleviate problems caused when images are added to the dataset after initial vocabulary learning. These two methods set a new stateof-the-art over all benchmarks investigated here for both mid-dimensional (20k-D to 30k-D) and small (128-D) descriptors. Our third contribution is a multiple spatial VLAD representation, MultiVLAD, that allows the retrieval and local- ization of objects that only extend over a small part of an image (again without requiring use of the original image SIFT descriptors).</p><p>5 0.68808478 <a title="275-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-BFO_Meets_HOG%3A_Feature_Extraction_Based_on_Histograms_of_Oriented_p.d.f._Gradients_for_Image_Classification.html">53 cvpr-2013-BFO Meets HOG: Feature Extraction Based on Histograms of Oriented p.d.f. Gradients for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Takumi Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: Image classification methods have been significantly developed in the last decade. Most methods stem from bagof-features (BoF) approach and it is recently extended to a vector aggregation model, such as using Fisher kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method for image classification. Following the BoF approach, a plenty of local descriptors are first extracted in an image and the proposed method is built upon the probability density function (p.d.f) formed by those descriptors. Since the p.d.f essentially represents the image, we extract the features from the p.d.f by means of the gradients on the p.d.f. The gradients, especially their orientations, effectively characterize the shape of the p.d.f from the geometrical viewpoint. We construct the features by the histogram of the oriented p.d.f gradients via orientation coding followed by aggregation of the orientation codes. The proposed image features, imposing no specific assumption on the targets, are so general as to be applicable to any kinds of tasks regarding image classifications. In the experiments on object recog- nition and scene classification using various datasets, the proposed method exhibits superior performances compared to the other existing methods.</p><p>6 0.64238381 <a title="275-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-GRASP_Recurring_Patterns_from_a_Single_View.html">183 cvpr-2013-GRASP Recurring Patterns from a Single View</a></p>

<p>Author: Margret Keuper, Thorsten Schmidt, Maja Temerinac-Ott, Jan Padeken, Patrick Heun, Olaf Ronneberger, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: With volumetric data from widefield fluorescence microscopy, many emerging questions in biological and biomedical research are being investigated. Data can be recorded with high temporal resolution while the specimen is only exposed to a low amount of phototoxicity. These advantages come at the cost of strong recording blur caused by the infinitely extended point spread function (PSF). For widefield microscopy, its magnitude only decays with the square of the distance to the focal point and consists of an airy bessel pattern which is intricate to describe in the spatial domain. However, the Fourier transform of the incoherent PSF (denoted as Optical Transfer Function (OTF)) is well localized and smooth. In this paper, we present a blind -fre iburg .de Figure 1.

<p>Author: Thoma Papadhimitri, Paolo Favaro</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of reconstructing normals, albedo and lights of Lambertian surfaces in uncalibrated photometric stereo under the perspective projection model. Our analysis is based on establishing the integrability constraint. In the orthographicprojection case, it is well-known that when such constraint is imposed, a solution can be identified only up to 3 parameters, the so-called generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We show that in the perspective projection case the solution is unique. We also propose a closed-form solution which is simple, efficient and robust. We test our algorithm on synthetic data and publicly available real data. Our quantitative tests show that our method outperforms all prior work of uncalibrated photometric stereo under orthographic projection.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.74899089 <a title="275-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm_IDF_for_Large_Scale_Image_Search.html">275 cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm IDF for Large Scale Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Zheng, Shengjin Wang, Ziqiong Liu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is prevalently utilized in the Bag-of-Words based image search. The basic idea is to assign less weight to terms with high frequency, and vice versa. However, the estimation of visual word frequency is coarse and heuristic. Therefore, the effectiveness of the conventional IDF routine is marginal, and far from optimal. To tackle thisproblem, thispaper introduces a novel IDF expression by the use of Lp-norm pooling technique. . edu . cn qit i @ c s an . ut s a . edu ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Carefully designed, the proposed IDF takes into account the term frequency, document frequency, the complexity of images, as well as the codebook information. Optimizing the IDF function towards optimal balancing between TF and pIDF weights yields the so-called Lp-norm IDF (pIDF).

Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Oxford 5K, Paris 6K and Flickr 1M). We report a performance improvement of as large as 27.1% over the baseline approach.

<p>Author: Roni Mittelman, Honglak Lee, Benjamin Kuipers, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: The use of semantic attributes in computer vision problems has been gaining increased popularity in recent years. Attributes provide an intermediate feature representation in between low-level features and the class categories, leading to improved learning on novel categories from few examples. However, a major caveat is that learning semantic attributes is a laborious task, requiring a significant amount of time and human intervention to provide labels. In order to address this issue, we propose a weakly supervised approach to learn mid-level features, where only class-level supervision is provided during training. We develop a novel extension of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) by incorporating a Beta-Bernoulli process factor potential for hidden units. Unlike the standard RBM, our model uses the class labels to promote category-dependent sharing of learned features, which tends to improve the generalization performance. By using semantic attributes for which annotations are available, we show that we can find correspondences between the learned mid-level features and the labeled attributes. Therefore, the mid-level features have distinct semantic characterization which is similar to that given by the semantic attributes, even though their labeling was not provided during training. Our experimental results on object recognition tasks show significant performance gains, outperforming existing methods which rely on manually labeled semantic attributes.</p><p>5 0.7277562 <a title="275-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Maximum_Appearance_Search_for_Large-Scale_Object_Detection.html">144 cvpr-2013-Efficient Maximum Appearance Search for Large-Scale Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Chen, Zheng Song, Rogerio Feris, Ankur Datta, Liangliang Cao, Zhongyang Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, efficiency of large-scale object detection has arisen as an important topic due to the exponential growth in the size of benchmark object detection datasets. Most current object detection methods focus on improving accuracy of large-scale object detection with efficiency being an afterthought. In this paper, we present the Efficient Maximum Appearance Search (EMAS) model which is an order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art large-scale object detection approaches, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our EMAS model consists of representing an image as an ensemble of densely sampled feature points with the proposed Pointwise Fisher Vector encoding method, so that the learnt discriminative scoring function can be applied locally. Consequently, the object detection problem is transformed into searching an image sub-area for maximum local appearance probability, thereby making EMAS an order of magnitude faster than the traditional detection methods. In addition, the proposed model is also suitable for incorporating global context at a negligible extra computational cost. EMAS can also incorporate fusion of multiple features, which greatly improves its performance in detecting multiple object categories. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can perform detection of 1000 object classes in less than one minute per image on the Image Net ILSVRC2012 dataset and for 107 object classes in less than 5 seconds per image for the SUN09 dataset using a single CPU.</p><p>6 0.72667295 <a title="275-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Action_Recognition_by_Hierarchical_Sequence_Summarization.html">32 cvpr-2013-Action Recognition by Hierarchical Sequence Summarization</a></p>

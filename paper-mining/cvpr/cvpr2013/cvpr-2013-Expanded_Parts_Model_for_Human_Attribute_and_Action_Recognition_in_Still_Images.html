<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images). This approach also leads to state-ofthe-art performance on the zero-shot learning task on AwA.</p><p>3 0.23262645 <a title="153-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.22456214 <a title="153-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Endres, Kevin J. Shih, Johnston Jiaa, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to learn a diverse collection of discriminative parts from object bounding box annotations. Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>5 0.21744278 <a title="153-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_Videos_Using_Mid-level_Discriminative_Patches.html">355 cvpr-2013-Representing Videos Using Mid-level Discriminative Patches</a></p>
<p>Author: Arpit Jain, Abhinav Gupta, Mikel Rodriguez, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: How should a video be represented? We propose a new representation for videos based on mid-level discriminative spatio-temporal patches. These spatio-temporal patches might correspond to a primitive human action, a semantic object, or perhaps a random but informative spatiotemporal patch in the video. What defines these spatiotemporal patches is their discriminative and representative properties. We automatically mine these patches from hundreds of training videos and experimentally demonstrate that these patches establish correspondence across videos and align the videos for label transfer techniques. Furthermore, these patches can be used as a discriminative vocabulary for action classification where they demonstrate stateof-the-art performance on UCF50 and Olympics datasets.</p><p>6 0.18855101 <a title="153-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgia Gkioxari, Pablo Arbeláez, Lubomir Bourdev, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for human pose estimation in real-world cluttered scenes, and focus on the challenging problem of predicting the pose of both arms for each person in the image. For this purpose, we build on the notion of poselets [4] and train highly discriminative classifiers to differentiate among arm configurations, which we call armlets. We propose a rich representation which, in addition to standardHOGfeatures, integrates the information of strong contours, skin color and contextual cues in a principled manner. Unlike existing methods, we evaluate our approach on a large subset of images from the PASCAL VOC detection dataset, where critical visual phenomena, such as occlusion, truncation, multiple instances and clutter are the norm. Our approach outperforms Yang and Ramanan [26], the state-of-the-art technique, with an improvement from 29.0% to 37.5% PCP accuracy on the arm keypoint prediction task, on this new pose estimation dataset.</p><p>3 0.7320298 <a title="153-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fine-Grained_Crowdsourcing_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition.html">174 cvpr-2013-Fine-Grained Crowdsourcing for Fine-Grained Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Deng, Jonathan Krause, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition concerns categorization at sub-ordinate levels, where the distinction between object classes is highly local. Compared to basic level recognition, fine-grained categorization can be more challenging as there are in general less data and fewer discriminative features. This necessitates the use of stronger prior for feature selection. In this work, we include humans in the loop to help computers select discriminative features. We introduce a novel online game called “Bubbles ” that reveals discriminative features humans use. The player’s goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image. During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of circular regions ( “bubbles”), with a certain penalty. With proper setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality. We next propose the “BubbleBank” algorithm that uses the human selected bubbles to improve machine recognition performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields large improvements over the previous state of the art on challenging benchmarks.</p><p>4 0.72503239 <a title="153-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Physical_Connections%3A_Tree_Models_in_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">60 cvpr-2013-Beyond Physical Connections: Tree Models in Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>5 0.71415031 <a title="153-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_Structural_Alternatives_and_Sharing_into_Hierarchy_for_Multiclass_Object_Recognition_and_Detection.html">221 cvpr-2013-Incorporating Structural Alternatives and Sharing into Hierarchy for Multiclass Object Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin, Lichao Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a reconfigurable model to recognize and detect multiclass (or multiview) objects with large variation in appearance. Compared with well acknowledged hierarchical models, we study two advanced capabilities in hierarchy for object modeling: (i) “switch” variables(i.e. or-nodes) for specifying alternative compositions, and (ii) making local classifiers (i.e. leaf-nodes) shared among different classes. These capabilities enable us to account well for structural variabilities while preserving the model compact. Our model, in the form of an And-Or Graph, comprises four layers: a batch of leaf-nodes with collaborative edges in bottom for localizing object parts; the or-nodes over bottom to activate their children leaf-nodes; the andnodes to classify objects as a whole; one root-node on the top for switching multiclass classification, which is also an or-node. For model training, we present an EM-type algorithm, namely dynamical structural optimization (DSO), to iteratively determine the structural configuration, (e.g., leaf-node generation associated with their parent or-nodes and shared across other classes), along with optimizing multi-layer parameters. The proposed method is valid on challenging databases, e.g., PASCAL VOC2007and UIUCPeople, and it achieves state-of-the-arts performance.</p><p>6 0.71080977 <a title="153-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-MODEC%3A_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">277 cvpr-2013-MODEC: Multimodal Decomposable Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.</p><p>2 0.98349959 <a title="153-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Matting_with_Local_and_Nonlocal_Smooth_Priors.html">211 cvpr-2013-Image Matting with Local and Nonlocal Smooth Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowu Chen, Dongqing Zou, Steven Zhiying Zhou, Qinping Zhao, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the manifold preserving editing propagation [4] essentially introduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth priorfrom matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from color sampling in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method produces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>3 0.98043352 <a title="153-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Articulated objects represent an important class ofobjects in our everyday environment. Automatic detection of the type of articulated or otherwise restricted motion and extraction of the corresponding motion parameters are therefore of high value, e.g. in order to augment an otherwise static 3D reconstruction with dynamic semantics, such as rotation axes and allowable translation directions for certain rigid parts or objects. Hence, in this paper, a novel theory to analyse relative transformations between two motion-restricted parts will be presented. The analysis is based on linear subspaces spanned by relative transformations. Moreover, a signature for relative transformations will be introduced which uniquely specifies the type of restricted motion encoded in these relative transformations. This theoretic framework enables the derivation of novel algebraic constraints, such as low-rank constraints for subsequent rotations around two fixed axes for example. Lastly, given the type of restricted motion as predicted by the signature, the paper shows how to extract all the motion parameters with matrix manipulations from linear algebra. Our theory is verified on several real data sets, such as a rotating blackboard or a wheel rolling on the floor amongst others.</p><p>4 0.96980953 <a title="153-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Variational_Reconstruction_of_Non-rigid_Surfaces_from_Monocular_Video.html">113 cvpr-2013-Dense Variational Reconstruction of Non-rigid Surfaces from Monocular Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Ravi Garg, Anastasios Roussos, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers the first variational approach to the problem of dense 3D reconstruction of non-rigid surfaces from a monocular video sequence. We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>5 0.93131995 <a title="153-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Illumination_Estimation_Based_on_Bilayer_Sparse_Coding.html">210 cvpr-2013-Illumination Estimation Based on Bilayer Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Li, Weihua Xiong, Weiming Hu, Houwen Peng</p><p>Abstract: Computational color constancy is a very important topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers ’ attention. Recently, lots of research has shown the effects of using high level visual content cues for improving illumination estimation. However, nearly all the existing methods are essentially combinational strategies in which image ’s content analysis is only used to guide the combination or selection from a variety of individual illumination estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel bilayer sparse coding model for illumination estimation that considers image similarity in terms of both low level color distribution and high level image scene content simultaneously. For the purpose, the image ’s scene content information is integrated with its color distribution to obtain optimal illumination estimation model. The experimental results on real-world image sets show that our algorithm is superior to some prevailing illumination estimation methods, even better than some combinational methods.</p><p>6 0.90955508 <a title="153-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Thousand_Frames_in_Just_a_Few_Words%3A_Lingual_Description_of_Videos_through_Latent_Topics_and_Sparse_Object_Stitching.html">28 cvpr-2013-A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching</a></p>

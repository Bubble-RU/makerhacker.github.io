<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>3 0.24485286 <a title="286-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Template-Based_Isometric_Deformable_3D_Reconstruction_with_Sampling-Based_Focal_Length_Self-Calibration.html">423 cvpr-2013-Template-Based Isometric Deformable 3D Reconstruction with Sampling-Based Focal Length Self-Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that a surface deforming isometrically can be reconstructed from a single image and a template 3D shape. Methods from the literature solve this problem efficiently. However, they all assume that the camera model is calibrated, which drastically limits their applicability. We propose (i) a general variational framework that applies to (calibrated and uncalibrated) general camera models and (ii) self-calibrating 3D reconstruction algorithms for the weak-perspective and full-perspective camera models. In the former case, our algorithm returns the normal field and camera ’s scale factor. In the latter case, our algorithm returns the normal field, depth and camera ’s focal length. Our algorithms are the first to achieve deformable 3D reconstruction including camera self-calibration. They apply to much more general setups than existing methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms give results with the same level of accuracy as existing methods (which use the true focal length) on perspective images, and correctly find the normal field on affine images for which the existing methods fail.</p><p>4 0.24060975 <a title="286-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.21377499 <a title="286-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Object_Motion_Reveals_about_Shape_with_Unknown_BRDF_and_Lighting.html">465 cvpr-2013-What Object Motion Reveals about Shape with Unknown BRDF and Lighting</a></p>
<p>Author: Manmohan Chandraker, Dikpal Reddy, Yizhou Wang, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a theory that addresses the problem of determining shape from the (small or differential) motion of an object with unknown isotropic reflectance, under arbitrary unknown distant illumination, , for both orthographic and perpsective projection. Our theory imposes fundamental limits on the hardness of surface reconstruction, independent of the method involved. Under orthographic projection, we prove that three differential motions suffice to yield an invariant that relates shape to image derivatives, regardless of BRDF and illumination. Under perspective projection, we show that four differential motions suffice to yield depth and a linear constraint on the surface gradient, with unknown BRDF and lighting. Further, we delineate the topological classes up to which reconstruction may be achieved using the invariants. Finally, we derive a general stratification that relates hardness of shape recovery to scene complexity. Qualitatively, our invariants are homogeneous partial differential equations for simple lighting and inhomogeneous for complex illumination. Quantitatively, our framework shows that the minimal number of motions required to resolve shape is greater for more complex scenes. Prior works that assume brightness constancy, Lambertian BRDF or a known directional light source follow as special cases of our stratification. We illustrate with synthetic and real data how potential reconstruction methods may exploit our framework.</p><p>6 0.17490534 <a title="286-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated_Photometric_Stereo_for_Unknown_Isotropic_Reflectances.html">443 cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo for Unknown Isotropic Reflectances</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Kumar, Cyril Kwong</p><p>Abstract: In order to avail the benefits of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contactless 3D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results from the use of multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contactless 3D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3D finger surface features using Finger Surface Codes and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3D space to accurately match the recovered 3D minutiae. Multiple 2D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2D features for further improving 3D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3D fingerprint identification.</p><p>3 0.81871092 <a title="286-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Template-Based_Isometric_Deformable_3D_Reconstruction_with_Sampling-Based_Focal_Length_Self-Calibration.html">423 cvpr-2013-Template-Based Isometric Deformable 3D Reconstruction with Sampling-Based Focal Length Self-Calibration</a></p>

<p>Author: Abed Malti, Richard Hartley, Adrien Bartoli, Jae-Hak Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for template-based extensible surface reconstruction from a single view. We extend the method of isometric surface reconstruction and more recent work on conformal surface reconstruction. Our approach relies on the minimization of a proposed stretching energy formalized with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter of the surface. We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>5 0.78600883 <a title="286-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Visesh Chari, Peter Sturm</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of transparent refractive objects like a plastic bottle is challenging: they lack appearance related visual cues and merely reflect and refract light from the surrounding environment. Amongst several approaches to reconstruct such objects, the seminal work of Light-Path triangulation [17] is highly popular because of its general applicability and analysis of minimal scenarios. A lightpath is defined as the piece-wise linear path taken by a ray of light as it passes from source, through the object and into the camera. Transparent refractive objects not only affect the geometric configuration of light-paths but also their radiometric properties. In this paper, we describe a method that combines both geometric and radiometric information to do reconstruction. We show two major consequences of the addition of radiometric cues to the light-path setup. Firstly, we extend the case of scenarios in which reconstruction is plausible while reducing the minimal re- quirements for a unique reconstruction. This happens as a consequence of the fact that radiometric cues add an additional known variable to the already existing system of equations. Secondly, we present a simple algorithm for reconstruction, owing to the nature of the radiometric cue. We present several synthetic experiments to validate our theories, and show high quality reconstructions in challenging scenarios.</p><p>6 0.77786994 <a title="286-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: Under unknown directional lighting, the uncalibrated Lambertian photometric stereo algorithm recovers the shape of a smooth surface up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We resolve this ambiguity from the halfvector symmetry, which is observed in many isotropic materials. Under this symmetry, a 2D BRDF slice with low-rank structure can be obtained from an image, if the surface normals and light directions are correctly recovered. In general, this structure is destroyed by the GBR ambiguity. As a result, we can resolve the ambiguity by restoring this structure. We develop a simple algorithm of auto-calibration from separable homogeneous specular reflection of real images. Compared with previous methods, this method takes a holistic approach to exploiting reflectance symmetry and produces superior results.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76967734 <a title="286-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Mirror_Surface_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image.html">286 cvpr-2013-Mirror Surface Reconstruction from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Liu, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing the shape of a smooth mirror surface from a single image. In particular, we consider the case where the camera is observing the reflection of a static reference target in the unknown mirror. We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images.</p><p>3 0.74919158 <a title="286-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Manhattan_Junction_Catalogue_for_Spatial_Reasoning_of_Indoor_Scenes.html">278 cvpr-2013-Manhattan Junction Catalogue for Spatial Reasoning of Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Arpit Jain, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: Junctions are strong cues for understanding the geometry of a scene. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting junctions and using them for recovering the spatial layout of an indoor scene. Junction detection has always been challenging due to missing and spurious lines. We work in a constrained Manhattan world setting where the junctions are formed by only line segments along the three principal orthogonal directions. Junctions can be classified into several categories based on the number and orientations of the incident line segments. We provide a simple and efficient voting scheme to detect and classify these junctions in real images. Indoor scenes are typically modeled as cuboids and we formulate the problem of the cuboid layout estimation as an inference problem in a conditional random field. Our formulation allows the incorporation of junction features and the training is done using structured prediction techniques. We outperform other single view geometry estimation methods on standard datasets.</p><p>4 0.7424984 <a title="286-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>
<p>Author: Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael S. Brown, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions oftheprojective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with significantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.</p><p>5 0.71874332 <a title="286-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pattern-Driven_Colorization_of_3D_Surfaces.html">327 cvpr-2013-Pattern-Driven Colorization of 3D Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: George Leifman, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: Colorization refers to the process of adding color to black & white images or videos. This paper extends the term to handle surfaces in three dimensions. This is important for applications in which the colors of an object need to be restored and no relevant image exists for texturing it. We focus on surfaces with patterns and propose a novel algorithm for adding colors to these surfaces. The user needs only to scribble a few color strokes on one instance of each pattern, and the system proceeds to automatically colorize the whole surface. For this scheme to work, we address not only the problem of colorization, but also the problem of pattern detection on surfaces.</p><p>6 0.68142855 <a title="286-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Better_Exploiting_Motion_for_Better_Action_Recognition.html">59 cvpr-2013-Better Exploiting Motion for Better Action Recognition</a></p>

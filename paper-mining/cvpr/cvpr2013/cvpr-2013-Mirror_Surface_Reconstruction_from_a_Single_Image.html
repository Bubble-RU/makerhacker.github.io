</p><p>3 We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. [sent-10, score-0.392]
</p><p>4 In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. [sent-11, score-1.296]
</p><p>5 Introduction In this paper, we tackle the problem of mirror surface reconstruction from a single image. [sent-16, score-0.873]
</p><p>6 Traditional 3D recon-  struction methods typically perform poorly on mirror objects, since the information captured by the camera comes from the objects’ surroundings rather than from the objects themselves. [sent-17, score-0.616]
</p><p>7 Methods specifically designed to handle mirror surfaces have been introduced, but usually exploit motion and thus do not apply to the single image scenario [16, 8, 13, 20]. [sent-18, score-0.644]
</p><p>8 However, existing approaches do not offer theoretical guarantees of the uniqueness of the reconstructed surface. [sent-20, score-0.277]
</p><p>9 Here, we introduce an approach to reconstructing a mirror surface from a single image with a provably unique solution. [sent-21, score-0.887]
</p><p>10 Furthermore, we assume that reflection correspondences between 3D points on the reference plane and 2D image locations are given. [sent-25, score-0.572]
</p><p>11 With dense correspondences, a differential geometry analysis reveals that, for a smooth mirror surface without inter-reflections, reconstruction reduces to solving an initial value problem (IVP) with two partial differential equations (PDEs). [sent-26, score-1.22]
</p><p>12 We derive a theoretical proof of uniqueness of the solution to this IVP. [sent-27, score-0.392]
</p><p>13 Furthermore, studying the order of integration of the two PDEs yields a generally unique solution for the starting point of the IVP. [sent-28, score-0.231]
</p><p>14 This therefore implies uniqueness of the mirror surface reconstruction. [sent-29, score-0.984]
</p><p>15 To address the more realistic scenario where only sparse reflection correspondences are available, we parametrize the depths of points on the mirror surface as a uniform cubic B-spline. [sent-30, score-1.248]
</p><p>16 We then formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem that minimizes the 3D error between the points on the reference plane and the image correspondences backprojected to the reference plane via the mirror. [sent-31, score-0.709]

</p><p>18 We demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstruction method from both dense and sparse correspondences on synthetic and real images, such as those depicted in Fig. [sent-36, score-0.327]
</p><p>19 Related Work Most existing methods that tackle mirror surface reconstruction exploit temporal information, such as the motion of the camera [13, 20], or that of the environment [8, 16]. [sent-39, score-0.914]
</p><p>20 Within this class of methods, shape from specular flow has become a popular approach [14, 1, 5, 19]. [sent-40, score-0.189]
</p><p>21 As an alternative, shape recovery can be performed by exploiting multiple reference planes with known pose relative to the camera. [sent-41, score-0.255]
</p><p>22 This can be achieved either by utilizing multiple views of the object with a reference plane fixed relative to the camera [3, 12, 2], or with a static camera, but a moving reference plane [4, 11]. [sent-42, score-0.521]
</p><p>23 In [10], it was shown that the surface shape can be recovered from a single viewpoint when two 3D reference points on the light path are known, which is similar to using a moving reference plane. [sent-43, score-0.56]
</p><p>24 In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing a smooth mirror surface from a single image, and therefore cannot exploit motion. [sent-44, score-0.878]
</p><p>25 In [9], a method to recover the shape ofthe human cornea from a fixed camera and a static reference plane with known pose was introduced. [sent-46, score-0.372]
</p><p>26 However, the approach in [9] requires the 3D location of one point on the surface to be known. [sent-48, score-0.253]
</p><p>27 Here, we provide a theoretical proof of uniqueness of the mirror shape that does not require knowing the position of any surface point. [sent-50, score-1.174]
</p><p>28 A differential geometry analysis of surface patches was proposed in [17]. [sent-51, score-0.34]
</p><p>29 While the reconstruction in [17] was limited to local patches, it was extended to modeling a global surface shape in [15]. [sent-52, score-0.353]
</p><p>30 While we also base our analysis on differential geometry, our formulation naturally extends to the entire mirror surface without requiring stitching patches together. [sent-54, score-0.888]
</p><p>31 In [18], the shape of the surface was recovered by iteratively estimating the normal at a point from its depth, and the depth of a neighboring point from this normal. [sent-55, score-0.439]
</p><p>32 Our analytical formulation allows us to establish a theoretical proof of uniqueness of the solution of both the IVP that corresponds to the iterative procedure described above and the starting depth required to solve this IVP. [sent-58, score-0.522]
</p><p>33 era centred at O is observing a mirror surface P that reflects a reference plane Q in the image I. [sent-67, score-1.064]
</p><p>34 A point m on Q is reflected to the image point v on I the 3D mirror point p on P. [sent-68, score-0.724]
</p><p>35 We refer via to m and v as reflection correspondences. [sent-69, score-0.182]
</p><p>36 R and T denote the pose of the reference plane w. [sent-72, score-0.276]
</p><p>37 We focus on a rectangular region of interest (ROI) Ix Iy 2 in which the mirror P is visible, non-tangentially. [sent-95, score-0.575]
</p><p>38 (x m,ye)et ∈s t Ihe ×m iIrror simply (not tangentially) at a point p(x, y) = s(x, y)v, where s(x, y) is referred to as the depth of the mirror at this point. [sent-97, score-0.671]
</p><p>39 The function s(x, y) therefore determines the shape of the mirror, and finding this function is equivalent to finding the shape of the part of the mirror that lies within the ROI. [sent-98, score-0.685]
</p><p>40 Differential Geometry Analysis In this section, we present our approach to mirror surface reconstruction given dense reflection correspondences, as well as our proof of uniqueness of a solution. [sent-101, score-1.362]
</p><p>41 Our analysis of the reconstruction problem relies on the normal n to the mirror at p. [sent-102, score-0.689]
</p><p>42 Let m be a point on the reference plane  2Ix and Iy  are  closed  sets. [sent-104, score-0.274]
</p><p>43 Based on via the geometry of reflection, n bisects the angle between the incident ray i = v/| |v| | and the reflected ray l = (m sinvc)id/e| |nmt r−aysv i| |= . [sent-106, score-0.234]
</p><p>44 This will certainly be true if the mirror is smooth, and with no occluding contours. [sent-117, score-0.575]
</p><p>45 Under this assumption, the normal to the surface can also be expressed as n = ∂p/∂x ∂p/∂y. [sent-118, score-0.254]
</p><p>46 (4)  Suppose that the reflection correspondence m is known for each point in the ROI (either by dense matching, or modeling) and can therefore be written as a function m(x, y). [sent-138, score-0.254]
</p><p>47 Assuming that m(x, y) is known for points in Ix Iy, both fx and fy are ultimately functions of x, y and s only. [sent-144, score-0.189]
</p><p>48 Uniqueness Results  ××  The goal of this section is to state certain uniqueness results for the mirror shape, based on the formulation of the problem as the IVP (5). [sent-148, score-0.765]
</p><p>49 We therefore concentrate on the uniqueness of the solution, which would imply that the true shape of the mirror is the only solution to the IVP. [sent-153, score-0.887]
</p><p>50 Suppose that for each point (x, y) in a region of interest Ix Iy in an image, the corresponding ray meets a mirror non-tangentially. [sent-156, score-0.689]
</p><p>51 2, this result will be seen to follow from a standard uniqueness result in Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), namely the Picard Lindel¨ of Theorem [6]. [sent-159, score-0.19]
</p><p>52 However, studying the order of integration of the PDEs in the IVP reveals that, for generic  ×  mirror shapes, there is a single valid in Section 4. [sent-163, score-0.652]
</p><p>53 Existence and uniqueness of solutions to ODEs are much simpler problems than for PDEs. [sent-172, score-0.222]
</p><p>54 In particular, the Picard Lindel¨ of Theorem gives the required existence and uniqueness conditions. [sent-173, score-0.19]
</p><p>55 nis( nonzero, by the assumption that rays meet the mirror non-tangentially, | ? [sent-209, score-0.611]
</p><p>56 The previous discussion shows that, by holding y0 fixed, one can propagate in the x direction, to find a unique solution s(x, y0) that satisfies Eq. [sent-226, score-0.186]
</p><p>57 Therefore, the entire visible mirror surface can be reconstructed uniquely given the depth of one starting point. [sent-232, score-0.958]
</p><p>58 Computing a Starting Depth Although guaranteed to be unique (if it exists), the solution derived in the previous section relies on knowing the depth of one point. [sent-246, score-0.17]
</p><p>59 In this section, we show that not all depths s0 give a valid solution, and more specifically, that the valid depth of a starting point can be obtained uniquely. [sent-248, score-0.195]
</p><p>60 , the mirror is a C2 continuous surface), and if s(x, y) satisfies the PDEs in Eqs. [sent-263, score-0.653]
</p><p>61 Therefore, for generic surfaces, there exists a single valid s0, which, combined with the proof of uniqueness of the solution to the IVP, implies that the mirror surface can be reconstructed uniquely. [sent-316, score-1.217]
</p><p>62 To conclude, this gives us two ways of computing the shape of the mirror: We can solve the polynomial equation at one image point, and then solve the two PDEs of the IVP (5) sequentially, or we can solve the polynomial equation at each image point. [sent-317, score-0.271]
</p><p>63 Note that both methods require dense reflection correspondences, both for integration purposes and to compute accurate partial derivatives of the reflection correspondences. [sent-318, score-0.508]
</p><p>64 Shape Recovery from Sparse Measurements While the previous section describes two possible ways of reconstructing the mirror surface, the solution to the polynomial equation, as well as the integration of the PDEs strongly rely on dense and noise-free correspondences. [sent-320, score-0.855]
</p><p>65 In a more realistic scenario, reflection correspondences will be sparse and noisy. [sent-321, score-0.325]
</p><p>66 We first present our surface parametrization, and then describe our reconstruction framework. [sent-323, score-0.298]
</p><p>67 Surface Representation In the formulation of Section 4, we directly modeled the surface in terms of the depth of image points. [sent-326, score-0.281]
</p><p>68 Since our proof of uniqueness relies on the surface being C2 continu-  ××  ous, we can make use of other parametrizations that encode such a smoothness. [sent-327, score-0.488]
</p><p>69 This implicitly satisfies the geometric constraint that surface points lie on their respective visual rays. [sent-329, score-0.333]

</p><p>84 Recall that we have 3 possible ways of reconstructing the surface: With dense correspondences, we can either solve a degree 2 polynomial equation for each pixel, or solve this equation for a single pixel and solve the IVP (5). [sent-440, score-0.231]

<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>3 0.22701675 <a title="286-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>4 0.17057049 <a title="286-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Template-Based_Isometric_Deformable_3D_Reconstruction_with_Sampling-Based_Focal_Length_Self-Calibration.html">423 cvpr-2013-Template-Based Isometric Deformable 3D Reconstruction with Sampling-Based Focal Length Self-Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that a surface deforming isometrically can be reconstructed from a single image and a template 3D shape. Methods from the literature solve this problem efficiently. However, they all assume that the camera model is calibrated, which drastically limits their applicability. We propose (i) a general variational framework that applies to (calibrated and uncalibrated) general camera models and (ii) self-calibrating 3D reconstruction algorithms for the weak-perspective and full-perspective camera models. In the former case, our algorithm returns the normal field and camera ’s scale factor. In the latter case, our algorithm returns the normal field, depth and camera ’s focal length. Our algorithms are the first to achieve deformable 3D reconstruction including camera self-calibration. They apply to much more general setups than existing methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms give results with the same level of accuracy as existing methods (which use the true focal length) on perspective images, and correctly find the normal field on affine images for which the existing methods fail.</p><p>5 0.16800538 <a title="286-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Specular_Reflection_Separation_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior.html">410 cvpr-2013-Specular Reflection Separation Using Dark Channel Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Hyeongwoo Kim, Hailin Jin, Sunil Hadap, Inso Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to separate specular reflection from a single image. Separating an image into diffuse and specular components is an ill-posed problem due to lack of observations. Existing methods rely on a specularfree image to detect and estimate specularity, which however may confuse diffuse pixels with the same hue but a different saturation value as specular pixels. Our method is based on a novel observation that for most natural images the dark channel can provide an approximate specular-free image. We also propose a maximum a posteriori formulation which robustly recovers the specular reflection and chromaticity despite of the hue-saturation ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real and synthetic examples. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-theart methods in separating specular reflection.</p><p>6 0.15996383 <a title="286-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Object_Motion_Reveals_about_Shape_with_Unknown_BRDF_and_Lighting.html">465 cvpr-2013-What Object Motion Reveals about Shape with Unknown BRDF and Lighting</a></p>

<p>Author: Miaomiao Liu, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing the shape of a smooth mirror surface from a single image. In particular, we consider the case where the camera is observing the reflection of a static reference target in the unknown mirror. We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images.</p><p>2 0.87186635 <a title="286-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>3 0.73796237 <a title="286-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Specular_Reflection_Separation_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior.html">410 cvpr-2013-Specular Reflection Separation Using Dark Channel Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.65564162 <a title="286-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Visesh Chari, Peter Sturm</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of transparent refractive objects like a plastic bottle is challenging: they lack appearance related visual cues and merely reflect and refract light from the surrounding environment. Amongst several approaches to reconstruct such objects, the seminal work of Light-Path triangulation [17] is highly popular because of its general applicability and analysis of minimal scenarios. A lightpath is defined as the piece-wise linear path taken by a ray of light as it passes from source, through the object and into the camera. Transparent refractive objects not only affect the geometric configuration of light-paths but also their radiometric properties. In this paper, we describe a method that combines both geometric and radiometric information to do reconstruction. We show two major consequences of the addition of radiometric cues to the light-path setup. Firstly, we extend the case of scenarios in which reconstruction is plausible while reducing the minimal re- quirements for a unique reconstruction. This happens as a consequence of the fact that radiometric cues add an additional known variable to the already existing system of equations. Secondly, we present a simple algorithm for reconstruction, owing to the nature of the radiometric cue. We present several synthetic experiments to validate our theories, and show high quality reconstructions in challenging scenarios.</p><p>6 0.6433602 <a title="286-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>

We propose a holistic conditional random field model for semantic parsing which reasons jointly about which objects are present in the scene, their spatial extent as well as semantic segmentation, and employs text as well as image information as input. We automatically parse the sentences and extract objects and their relationships, and incorporate them into the model, both via potentials as well as by re-ranking candidate detections.

<p>Author: Feng Lu, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: We propose an uncalibrated photometric stereo method that works with general and unknown isotropic reflectances. Our method uses a pixel intensity profile, which is a sequence of radiance intensities recorded at a pixel across multi-illuminance images. We show that for general isotropic materials, the geodesic distance between intensity profiles is linearly related to the angular difference of their surface normals, and that the intensity distribution of an intensity profile conveys information about the reflectance properties, when the intensity profile is obtained under uniformly distributed directional lightings. Based on these observations, we show that surface normals can be estimated up to a convex/concave ambiguity. A solution method based on matrix decomposition with missing data is developed for a reliable estimation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our method are performed using both synthetic and real-world scenes.</p><p>5 0.71352398 <a title="286-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Real-Time_Tracking_of_Multiple_Objects_by_Volumetric_Mass_Densities.html">365 cvpr-2013-Robust Real-Time Tracking of Multiple Objects by Volumetric Mass Densities</a></p>
<p>Author: Horst Possegger, Sabine Sternig, Thomas Mauthner, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: Combining foreground images from multiple views by projecting them onto a common ground-plane has been recently applied within many multi-object tracking approaches. These planar projections introduce severe artifacts and constrain most approaches to objects moving on a common 2D ground-plane. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of an occupancy volume exploiting the full geometry and the objects ’ center of mass and develop an efficient algorithm for 3D object tracking. Individual objects are tracked using the local mass density scores within a particle filter based approach, constrained by a Voronoi partitioning between nearby trackers. Our method benefits from the geometric knowledge given by the occupancy volume to robustly extract features and train classifiers on-demand, when volumetric information becomes unreliable. We evaluate our approach on several challenging real-world scenarios including the public APIDIS dataset. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-theart methods, while achieving real-time performance. – –</p><p>6 0.71273279 <a title="286-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Reconstructing_Gas_Flows_Using_Light-Path_Approximation.html">349 cvpr-2013-Reconstructing Gas Flows Using Light-Path Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>3 0.40791297 <a title="249-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast%2C_Accurate_Detection_of_100%2C000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine.html">163 cvpr-2013-Fast, Accurate Detection of 100,000 Object Classes on a Single Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Dean, Mark A. Ruzon, Mark Segal, Jonathon Shlens, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Jay Yagnik</p><p>Abstract: Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an object’s appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times— four orders of magnitude— when compared withperforming the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.</p><p>4 0.40392739 <a title="249-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Inductive_Hashing_on_Manifolds.html">223 cvpr-2013-Inductive Hashing on Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van_den_Hengel, Zhenmin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original highdimensional data. The complexity of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, havepreviously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE [29] outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths.</p><p>5 0.37992519 <a title="249-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Binary_Code_Ranking_with_Weighted_Hamming_Distance.html">63 cvpr-2013-Binary Code Ranking with Weighted Hamming Distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Jinhu Tang, Ke Lu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Binary hashing has been widely used for efficient similarity search due to its query and storage efficiency. In most existing binary hashing methods, the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient, however, in practice, there are often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level weights to different hash bits, the returned binary codes are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p><p>6 0.36636564 <a title="249-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-K-Means_Hashing%3A_An_Affinity-Preserving_Quantization_Method_for_Learning_Binary_Compact_Codes.html">236 cvpr-2013-K-Means Hashing: An Affinity-Preserving Quantization Method for Learning Binary Compact Codes</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision there has been increasing interest in learning hashing codes whose Hamming distance approximates the data similarity. The hashing functions play roles in both quantizing the vector space and generating similarity-preserving codes. Most existing hashing methods use hyper-planes (or kernelized hyper-planes) to quantize and encode. In this paper, we present a hashing method adopting the k-means quantization. We propose a novel Affinity-Preserving K-means algorithm which simultaneously performs k-means clustering and learns the binary indices of the quantized cells. The distance between the cells is approximated by the Hamming distance of the cell indices. We further generalize our algorithm to a product space for learning longer codes. Experiments show our method, named as K-means Hashing (KMH), outperforms various state-of-the-art hashing encoding methods.</p><p>6 0.58597553 <a title="249-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Object_Tracking%3A_A_Benchmark.html">314 cvpr-2013-Online Object Tracking: A Benchmark</a></p>

<p>Author: Antony Lam, Imari Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral reflectance data allows for highly accurate spectral relighting under arbitrary illumination, which is invaluable to applications ranging from archiving cultural e-heritage to consumer product design. Past methods for capturing the spectral reflectance of scenes has proven successful in relighting but they all share a common assumption. All the methods do not consider the effects of fluorescence despite fluorescence being found in many everyday objects. In this paper, we describe the very different ways that reflectance and fluorescence interact with illuminants and show the need to explicitly consider fluorescence in the relighting problem. We then propose a robust method based on well established theories of reflectance and fluorescence for imaging each of these components. Finally, we show that we can relight real scenes of reflective-fluorescent surfaces with much higher accuracy in comparison to only considering the reflective component.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79968017 <a title="249-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Compact_Binary_Codes_for_Visual_Tracking.html">249 cvpr-2013-Learning Compact Binary Codes for Visual Tracking</a></p>

Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>3 0.79180765 <a title="249-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.78873432 <a title="249-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Patch_Match_Filter%3A_Efficient_Edge-Aware_Filtering_Meets_Randomized_Search_for_Fast_Correspondence_Field_Estimation.html">326 cvpr-2013-Patch Match Filter: Efficient Edge-Aware Filtering Meets Randomized Search for Fast Correspondence Field Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiangbo Lu, Hongsheng Yang, Dongbo Min, Minh N. Do</p><p>Abstract: Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient edge-aware filters have provided a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the label space size. When the label space is huge, which is often the case for (subpixelaccurate) stereo and optical flow estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable. Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). For the very first time, we explore effective and efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into compact superpixels, we also propose superpixelbased novel search strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. Focusing on dense correspondence field estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF’s applications in stereo and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve state-of-the-art correspondence accuracy but run much faster than other competing methods, often giving over 10-times speedup for large label space cases.</p><p>5 0.78021252 <a title="249-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Efficient_and_Exact_MAP-Inference_for_Large_Scale_Discrete_Computer_Vision_Problems_via_Combinatorial_Optimization.html">436 cvpr-2013-Towards Efficient and Exact MAP-Inference for Large Scale Discrete Computer Vision Problems via Combinatorial Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>6 0.77908611 <a title="249-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Motion blur frequently occurs in dense 3D reconstruction using a single moving camera, and it degrades the quality of the 3D reconstruction. To handle motion blur caused by rapid camera shakes, we propose a blur-aware depth reconstruction method, which utilizes a pixel correspondence that is obtained by considering the effect of motion blur. Motion blur is dependent on 3D geometry, thus parameterizing blurred appearance of images with scene depth given camera motion is possible and a depth map can be accurately estimated from the blur-considered pixel correspondence. The estimated depth is then converted intopixel-wise blur kernels, and non-uniform motion blur is easily removed with low computational cost. The obtained blur kernel is depth-dependent, thus it effectively addresses scene-depth variation, which is a challenging problem in conventional non-uniform deblurring methods.</p><p>3 0.044146195 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Visesh Chari, Peter Sturm</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of transparent refractive objects like a plastic bottle is challenging: they lack appearance related visual cues and merely reflect and refract light from the surrounding environment. Amongst several approaches to reconstruct such objects, the seminal work of Light-Path triangulation [17] is highly popular because of its general applicability and analysis of minimal scenarios. A lightpath is defined as the piece-wise linear path taken by a ray of light as it passes from source, through the object and into the camera. Transparent refractive objects not only affect the geometric configuration of light-paths but also their radiometric properties. In this paper, we describe a method that combines both geometric and radiometric information to do reconstruction. We show two major consequences of the addition of radiometric cues to the light-path setup. Firstly, we extend the case of scenarios in which reconstruction is plausible while reducing the minimal re- quirements for a unique reconstruction. This happens as a consequence of the fact that radiometric cues add an additional known variable to the already existing system of equations. Secondly, we present a simple algorithm for reconstruction, owing to the nature of the radiometric cue. We present several synthetic experiments to validate our theories, and show high quality reconstructions in challenging scenarios.</p><p>4 0.03939322 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Estimate_and_Remove_Non-uniform_Image_Blur.html">265 cvpr-2013-Learning to Estimate and Remove Non-uniform Image Blur</a></p>
<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al. [5].</p><p>5 0.035642054 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Underwater_Camera_Calibration_Using_Wavelength_Triangulation.html">447 cvpr-2013-Underwater Camera Calibration Using Wavelength Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy Yau, Minglun Gong, Yee-Hong Yang</p><p>Abstract: In underwater imagery, the image formation process includes refractions that occur when light passes from water into the camera housing, typically through a flat glass port. We extend the existing work on physical refraction models by considering the dispersion of light, and derive new constraints on the model parameters for use in calibration. This leads to a novel calibration method that achieves improved accuracy compared to existing work. We describe how to construct a novel calibration device for our method and evaluate the accuracy of the method through synthetic and real experiments.</p><p>6 0.034905013 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Weak_Stabilization_for_Motion_Feature_Extraction.html">158 cvpr-2013-Exploring Weak Stabilization for Motion Feature Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Kazuki Maeno, Hajime Nagahara, Atsushi Shimada, Rin-Ichiro Taniguchi</p><p>Abstract: Current object-recognition algorithms use local features, such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and speeded-up robust features (SURF), for visually learning to recognize objects. These approaches though cannot apply to transparent objects made of glass or plastic, as such objects take on the visual features of background objects, and the appearance ofsuch objects dramatically varies with changes in scene background. Indeed, in transmitting light, transparent objects have the unique characteristic of distorting the background by refraction. In this paper, we use a single-shot light?eld image as an input and model the distortion of the light ?eld caused by the refractive property of a transparent object. We propose a new feature, called the light ?eld distortion (LFD) feature, for identifying a transparent object. The proposal incorporates this LFD feature into the bag-of-features approach for recognizing transparent objects. We evaluated its performance in laboratory and real settings.</p><p>3 0.60832 <a title="37-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Enhancement_of_People_Wearing_Polarized_Glasses%3A_Darkening_Reversal_and_Reflection_Reduction.html">454 cvpr-2013-Video Enhancement of People Wearing Polarized Glasses: Darkening Reversal and Reflection Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Mao Ye, Cha Zhang, Ruigang Yang</p><p>Abstract: With the wide-spread of consumer 3D-TV technology, stereoscopic videoconferencing systems are emerging. However, the special glasses participants wear to see 3D can create distracting images. This paper presents a computational framework to reduce undesirable artifacts in the eye regions caused by these 3D glasses. More specifically, we add polarized filters to the stereo camera so that partial images of reflection can be captured. A novel Bayesian model is then developed to describe the imaging process of the eye regions including darkening and reflection, and infer the eye regions based on Classification ExpectationMaximization (EM). The recovered eye regions under the glasses are brighter and with little reflections, leading to a more nature videoconferencing experience. Qualitative evaluations and user studies are conducted to demonstrate the substantial improvement our approach can achieve.</p><p>4 0.6018728 <a title="37-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Reconstructing_Gas_Flows_Using_Light-Path_Approximation.html">349 cvpr-2013-Reconstructing Gas Flows Using Light-Path Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Ji, Jinwei Ye, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transparent gas flows are difficult to reconstruct: the refractive index field (RIF) within the gas volume is uneven and rapidly evolving, and correspondence matching under distortions is challenging. We present a novel computational imaging solution by exploiting the light field probe (LFProbe). A LF-probe resembles a view-dependent pattern where each pixel on the pattern maps to a unique ray. By . ude l. edu observing the LF-probe through the gas flow, we acquire a dense set of ray-ray correspondences and then reconstruct their light paths. To recover the RIF, we use Fermat’s Principle to correlate each light path with the RIF via a Partial Differential Equation (PDE). We then develop an iterative optimization scheme to solve for all light-path PDEs in conjunction. Specifically, we initialize the light paths by fitting Hermite splines to ray-ray correspondences, discretize their PDEs onto voxels, and solve a large, over-determined PDE system for the RIF. The RIF can then be used to refine the light paths. Finally, we alternate the RIF and light-path estimations to improve the reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our approach can reliably reconstruct small to medium scale gas flows. In particular, when the flow is acquired by a small number of cameras, the use of ray-ray correspondences can greatly improve the reconstruction.</p><p>5 0.59431821 <a title="37-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>

Experimental results using various real videos show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>2 0.62840426 <a title="37-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Jointly_Aligning_and_Segmenting_Multiple_Web_Photo_Streams_for_the_Inference_of_Collective_Photo_Storylines.html">235 cvpr-2013-Jointly Aligning and Segmenting Multiple Web Photo Streams for the Inference of Collective Photo Storylines</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunhee Kim, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: With an explosion of popularity of online photo sharing, we can trivially collect a huge number of photo streams for any interesting topics such as scuba diving as an outdoor recreational activity class. Obviously, the retrieved photo streams are neither aligned nor calibrated since they are taken in different temporal, spatial, and personal perspectives. However, at the same time, they are likely to share common storylines that consist of sequences of events and activities frequently recurred within the topic. In this paper, as a first technical step to detect such collective storylines, we propose an approach to jointly aligning and segmenting uncalibrated multiple photo streams. The alignment task discovers the matched images between different photo streams, and the image segmentation task parses each image into multiple meaningful regions to facilitate the image understanding. We close a loop between the two tasks so that solving one task helps enhance the performance of the other in a mutually rewarding way. To this end, we design a scalable message-passing based optimization framework to jointly achieve both tasks for the whole input image set at once. With evaluation on the new Flickr dataset of 15 outdoor activities that consist of 1.5 millions of images of 13 thousands of photo streams, our empirical results show that the proposed algorithms are more successful than other candidate methods for both tasks.</p><p>3 0.59579772 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Patch_Match_Filter%3A_Efficient_Edge-Aware_Filtering_Meets_Randomized_Search_for_Fast_Correspondence_Field_Estimation.html">326 cvpr-2013-Patch Match Filter: Efficient Edge-Aware Filtering Meets Randomized Search for Fast Correspondence Field Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiangbo Lu, Hongsheng Yang, Dongbo Min, Minh N. Do</p><p>Abstract: Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient edge-aware filters have provided a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the label space size. When the label space is huge, which is often the case for (subpixelaccurate) stereo and optical flow estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable. Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). For the very first time, we explore effective and efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into compact superpixels, we also propose superpixelbased novel search strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. Focusing on dense correspondence field estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF’s applications in stereo and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve state-of-the-art correspondence accuracy but run much faster than other competing methods, often giving over 10-times speedup for large label space cases.</p><p>4 0.58043271 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Video_Representation_Using_Temporal_Superpixels.html">29 cvpr-2013-A Video Representation Using Temporal Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Chang, Donglai Wei, John W. Fisher_III</p><p>Abstract: We develop a generative probabilistic model for temporally consistent superpixels in video sequences. In contrast to supervoxel methods, object parts in different frames are tracked by the same temporal superpixel. We explicitly model flow between frames with a bilateral Gaussian process and use this information to propagate superpixels in an online fashion. We consider four novel metrics to quantify performance of a temporal superpixel representation and demonstrate superior performance when compared to supervoxel methods.</p><p>5 0.5255847 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>6 0.52424067 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_Model-Based_Rigid_Object_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_Combining_Dense_and_Sparse_Visual_Cues.html">345 cvpr-2013-Real-Time Model-Based Rigid Object Pose Estimation and Tracking Combining Dense and Sparse Visual Cues</a></p>

In this paper we propose an effective representation, Multi-Order Contextual co-Occurrence (MOCO), to implicitly model the high level context using solely detection responses from a baseline object detector. The so-called (1st-order) context feature is computed as a set of randomized binary comparisons on the response map of the baseline object detector.

<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of detecting pedestrians who appear in groups and have interaction. A new approach is proposed for single-pedestrian detection aided by multi-pedestrian detection. A mixture model of multi-pedestrian detectors is designed to capture the unique visual cues which are formed by nearby multiple pedestrians but cannot be captured by single-pedestrian detectors. A probabilistic framework is proposed to model the relationship between the configurations estimated by single- and multi-pedestrian detectors, and to refine the single-pedestrian detection result with multi-pedestrian detection. It can integrate with any single-pedestrian detector without significantly increasing the computation load. 15 state-of-the-art single-pedestrian detection approaches are investigated on three widely used public datasets: Caltech, TUD-Brussels andETH. Experimental results show that our framework significantly improves all these approaches. The average improvement is 9% on the Caltech-Test dataset, 11% on the TUD-Brussels dataset and 17% on the ETH dataset in terms of average miss rate. The lowest average miss rate is reduced from 48% to 43% on the Caltech-Test dataset, from 55% to 50% on the TUD-Brussels dataset and from 51% to 41% on the ETH dataset.</p><p>3 0.16637219 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Multi-resolution_Pedestrian_Detection_in_Traffic_Scenes.html">363 cvpr-2013-Robust Multi-resolution Pedestrian Detection in Traffic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Junjie Yan, Xucong Zhang, Zhen Lei, Shengcai Liao, Stan Z. Li</p><p>Abstract: The serious performance decline with decreasing resolution is the major bottleneck for current pedestrian detection techniques [14, 23]. In this paper, we take pedestrian detection in different resolutions as different but related problems, and propose a Multi-Task model to jointly consider their commonness and differences. The model contains resolution aware transformations to map pedestrians in different resolutions to a common space, where a shared detector is constructed to distinguish pedestrians from background. For model learning, we present a coordinate descent procedure to learn the resolution aware transformations and deformable part model (DPM) based detector iteratively. In traffic scenes, there are many false positives located around vehicles, therefore, we further build a context model to suppress them according to the pedestrian-vehicle relationship. The context model can be learned automatically even when the vehicle annotations are not available. Our method reduces the mean miss rate to 60% for pedestrians taller than 30 pixels on the Caltech Pedestrian Benchmark, which noticeably outperforms previous state-of-the-art (71%).</p><p>4 0.11931797 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Context-Aware_Modeling_and_Recognition_of_Activities_in_Video.html">94 cvpr-2013-Context-Aware Modeling and Recognition of Activities in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingying Zhu, Nandita M. Nayak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, rather than modeling activities in videos individually, we propose a hierarchical framework that jointly models and recognizes related activities using motion and various context features. This is motivated from the observations that the activities related in space and time rarely occur independently and can serve as the context for each other. Given a video, action segments are automatically detected using motion segmentation based on a nonlinear dynamical model. We aim to merge these segments into activities of interest and generate optimum labels for the activities. Towards this goal, we utilize a structural model in a max-margin framework that jointly models the underlying activities which are related in space and time. The model explicitly learns the duration, motion and context patterns for each activity class, as well as the spatio-temporal relationships for groups of them. The learned model is then used to optimally label the activities in the testing videos using a greedy search method. We show promising results on the VIRAT Ground Dataset demonstrating the benefit of joint modeling and recognizing activities in a wide-area scene.</p><p>5 0.11813765 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Weak_Stabilization_for_Motion_Feature_Extraction.html">158 cvpr-2013-Exploring Weak Stabilization for Motion Feature Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Dennis Park, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r</p><p>Abstract: We describe novel but simple motion features for the problem of detecting objects in video sequences. Previous approaches either compute optical flow or temporal differences on video frame pairs with various assumptions about stabilization. We describe a combined approach that uses coarse-scale flow and fine-scale temporal difference features. Our approach performs weak motion stabilization by factoring out camera motion and coarse object motion while preserving nonrigid motions that serve as useful cues for recognition. We show results for pedestrian detection and human pose estimation in video sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results in both. In particular, given a fixed detection rate our method achieves a five-fold reduction in false positives over prior art on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark. Finally, we perform extensive diagnostic experiments to reveal what aspects of our system are crucial for good performance. Proper stabilization, long time-scale features, and proper normalization are all critical.</p><p>6 0.11406569 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Detector_Adaptation_for_Object_Detection_in_a_Video.html">142 cvpr-2013-Efficient Detector Adaptation for Object Detection in a Video</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Levi, Shai Silberstein, Aharon Bar-Hillel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a new part-based object detection algorithm with hundreds of parts performing realtime detection. Part-based models are currently state-ofthe-art for object detection due to their ability to represent large appearance variations. However, due to their high computational demands such methods are limited to several parts only and are too slow for practical real-time implementation. Our algorithm is an accelerated version of the ‚ÄúFeature Synthesis ‚Äù (FS) method [1], which uses multiple object parts for detection and is among state-of-theart methods on human detection benchmarks, but also suffers from a high computational cost. The proposed Accelerated Feature Synthesis (AFS) uses several strategies for reducing the number of locations searched for each part. The first strategy uses a novel algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search which we developed, termed ‚ÄúKDFerns ‚Äù, to compare each image location to only a subset of the model parts. Candidate part locations for a specific part are further reduced using spatial inhibition, and using an object-level ‚Äúcoarse-to-fine ‚Äù strategy. In our empirical evaluation on pedestrian detection benchmarks, AFS main- √ó tains almost fully the accuracy performance of the original FS, while running more than 4 faster than existing partbased methods which use only several parts. AFS is to our best knowledge the first part-based object detection method achieving real-time running performance: nearly 10 frames per-second on 640 480 images on a regular CPU.</p><p>5 0.82716197 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Seeking_the_Strongest_Rigid_Detector.html">383 cvpr-2013-Seeking the Strongest Rigid Detector</a></p>
<p>Author: Rodrigo Benenson, Markus Mathias, Tinne Tuytelaars, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The current state of the art solutions for object detection describe each class by a set of models trained on discovered sub-classes (so called ‚Äúcomponents ‚Äù), with each model itself composed of collections of interrelated parts (deformable models). These detectors build upon the now classic Histogram of Oriented Gradients+linear SVM combo. In this paper we revisit some of the core assumptions in HOG+SVM and show that by properly designing the feature pooling, feature selection, preprocessing, and training methods, it is possible to reach top quality, at least for pedestrian detections, using a single rigid component. We provide experiments for a large design space, that give insights into the design of classifiers, as well as relevant information for practitioners. Our best detector is fully feed-forward, has a single unified architecture, uses only histograms of oriented gradients and colour information in monocular static images, and improves over 23 other methods on the INRIA, ETHand Caltech-USA datasets, reducing the average miss-rate over HOG+SVM by more than 30%.</p><p>6 0.80728406 <a title="122-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimized_Pedestrian_Detection_for_Multiple_and_Occluded_People.html">318 cvpr-2013-Optimized Pedestrian Detection for Multiple and Occluded People</a></p>

<p>Author: Xavier Boix, Michael Gygli, Gemma Roig, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The representation of local image patches is crucial for the good performance and efficiency of many vision tasks. Patch descriptors have been designed to generalize towards diverse variations, depending on the application, as well as the desired compromise between accuracy and efficiency. We present a novel formulation of patch description, that serves such issues well. Sparse quantization lies at its heart. This allows for efficient encodings, leading to powerful, novel binary descriptors, yet also to the generalization of existing descriptors like SIFTorBRIEF. We demonstrate the capabilities of our formulation for both keypoint matching and image classification. Our binary descriptors achieve state-of-the-art results for two keypoint matching benchmarks, namely those by Brown [6] and Mikolajczyk [18]. For image classification, we propose new descriptors that perform similar to SIFT on Caltech101 [10] and PASCAL VOC07 [9].</p><p>2 0.89362627 <a title="122-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Fast_and_Accurate_Segmentation.html">437 cvpr-2013-Towards Fast and Accurate Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Camillo Jose Taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we explore approaches to accelerating segmentation and edge detection algorithms based on the gPb framework. The paper characterizes the performance of a simple but effective edge detection scheme which can be computed rapidly and offers performance that is competitive with the pB detector. The paper also describes an approach for computing a reduced order normalized cut that captures the essential features of the original problem but can be computed in less than half a second on a standard computing platform.</p><p>3 0.85904443 <a title="122-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Segment_Annotation_in_Weakly_Labeled_Video.html">133 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Segment Annotation in Weakly Labeled Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Rahul Sukthankar, Jay Yagnik, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: The ubiquitous availability of Internet video offers the vision community the exciting opportunity to directly learn localized visual concepts from real-world imagery. Unfortunately, most such attempts are doomed because traditional approaches are ill-suited, both in terms of their computational characteristics and their inability to robustly contend with the label noise that plagues uncurated Internet content. We present CRANE, a weakly supervised algorithm that is specifically designed to learn under such conditions. First, we exploit the asymmetric availability of real-world training data, where small numbers of positive videos tagged with the concept are supplemented with large quantities of unreliable negative data. Second, we ensure that CRANE is robust to label noise, both in terms of tagged videos that fail to contain the concept as well as occasional negative videos that do. Finally, CRANE is highly parallelizable, making it practical to deploy at large scale without sacrificing the quality of the learned solution. Although CRANE is general, this paper focuses on segment annotation, where we show state-of-the-art pixel-level segmentation results on two datasets, one of which includes a training set of spatiotemporal segments from more than 20,000 videos.</p><p>4 0.85584033 <a title="122-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-POOF%3A_Part-Based_One-vs.-One_Features_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization%2C_Face_Verification%2C_and_Attribute_Estimation.html">323 cvpr-2013-POOF: Part-Based One-vs.-One Features for Fine-Grained Categorization, Face Verification, and Attribute Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Berg, Peter N. Belhumeur</p><p>Abstract: From a set ofimages in aparticular domain, labeled with part locations and class, we present a method to automatically learn a large and diverse set of highly discriminative intermediate features that we call Part-based One-vs-One Features (POOFs). Each of these features specializes in discrimination between two particular classes based on the appearance at a particular part. We demonstrate the particular usefulness of these features for fine-grained visual categorization with new state-of-the-art results on bird species identification using the Caltech UCSD Birds (CUB) dataset and parity with the best existing results in face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the particular advantage of POOFs when training data is scarce.</p><p>5 0.85011899 <a title="122-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Video_Representation_with_Trajectory_Binary_Partition_Tree.html">203 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Video Representation with Trajectory Binary Partition Tree</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillem Palou, Philippe Salembier</p><p>Abstract: As early stage of video processing, we introduce an iterative trajectory merging algorithm that produces a regionbased and hierarchical representation of the video sequence, called the Trajectory Binary Partition Tree (BPT). From this representation, many analysis and graph cut techniques can be used to extract partitions or objects that are useful in the context of specific applications. In order to define trajectories and to create a precise merging algorithm, color and motion cues have to be used. Both types of informations are very useful to characterize objects but present strong differences of behavior in the spatial and the temporal dimensions. On the one hand, scenes and objects are rich in their spatial color distributions, but these distributions are rather stable over time. Object motion, on the other hand, presents simple structures and low spatial variability but may change from frame to frame. The proposed algorithm takes into account this key difference and relies on different models and associated metrics to deal with color and motion information. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing hierarchical video segmentation algorithms and provides more stable and precise regions.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.84968519 <a title="122-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detection_Evolution_with_Multi-order_Contextual_Co-occurrence.html">122 cvpr-2013-Detection Evolution with Multi-order Contextual Co-occurrence</a></p>

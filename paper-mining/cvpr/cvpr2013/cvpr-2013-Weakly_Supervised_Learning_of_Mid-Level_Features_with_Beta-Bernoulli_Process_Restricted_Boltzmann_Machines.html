<p>Author: Yujia Li, Daniel Tarlow, Richard Zemel</p><p>Abstract: When modeling structured outputs such as image segmentations, prediction can be improved by accurately modeling structure present in the labels. A key challenge is developing tractable models that are able to capture complex high level structure like shape. In this work, we study the learning of a general class of pattern-like high order potential, which we call Compositional High Order Pattern Potentials (CHOPPs). We show that CHOPPs include the linear deviation pattern potentials of Rother et al. [26] and also Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs); we also establish the near equivalence of these two models. Experimentally, we show that performance is affected significantly by the degree of variability present in the datasets, and we define a quantitative variability measure to aid in studying this. We then improve CHOPPs performance in high variability datasets with two primary contributions: (a) developing a loss-sensitive joint learning procedure, so that internal pattern parameters can be learned in conjunction with other model potentials to minimize expected loss;and (b) learning an image-dependent mapping that encourages or inhibits patterns depending on image features. We also explore varying how multiple patterns are composed, and learning convolutional patterns. Quantitative results on challenging highly variable datasets show that the joint learning and image-dependent high order potentials can improve performance.</p><p>3 0.43754175 <a title="462-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Multiple_Non-linear_Sub-spaces_Using_K-RBMs.html">253 cvpr-2013-Learning Multiple Non-linear Sub-spaces Using K-RBMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Siddhartha Chandra, Shailesh Kumar, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the nature of data is the key to building good representations. In domains such as natural images, the data comes from very complex distributions which are hard to capture. Feature learning intends to discover or best approximate these underlying distributions and use their knowledge to weed out irrelevant information, preserving most of the relevant information. Feature learning can thus be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we describe a feature learning scheme for natural images. We hypothesize that image patches do not all come from the same distribution, they lie in multiple nonlinear subspaces. We propose a framework that uses K Restricted Boltzmann Machines (K-RBMS) to learn multiple non-linear subspaces in the raw image space. Projections of the image patches into these subspaces gives us features, which we use to build image representations. Our algorithm solves the coupled problem of finding the right non-linear subspaces in the input space and associating image patches with those subspaces in an iterative EM like algorithm to minimize the overall reconstruction error. Extensive empirical results over several popular image classification datasets show that representations based on our framework outperform the traditional feature representations such as the SIFT based Bag-of-Words (BoW) and convolutional deep belief networks.</p><p>4 0.29398555 <a title="462-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Augmenting_CRFs_with_Boltzmann_Machine_Shape_Priors_for_Image_Labeling.html">50 cvpr-2013-Augmenting CRFs with Boltzmann Machine Shape Priors for Image Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Kae, Kihyuk Sohn, Honglak Lee, Erik Learned-Miller</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random fields (CRFs) provide powerful tools for building models to label image segments. They are particularly well-suited to modeling local interactions among adjacent regions (e.g., superpixels). However, CRFs are limited in dealing with complex, global (long-range) interactions between regions. Complementary to this, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) can be used to model global shapes produced by segmentation models. In this work, we present a new model that uses the combined power of these two network types to build a state-of-the-art labeler. Although the CRF is a good baseline labeler, we show how an RBM can be added to the architecture to provide a global shape bias that complements the local modeling provided by the CRF. We demonstrate its labeling performance for the parts of complex face images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set. This hybrid model produces results that are both quantitatively and qualitatively better than the CRF alone. In addition to high-quality labeling results, we demonstrate that the hidden units in the RBM portion of our model can be interpreted as face attributes that have been learned without any attribute-level supervision.</p><p>5 0.23715101 <a title="462-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Facial_Feature_Tracking_Under_Varying_Facial_Expressions_and_Face_Poses_Based_on_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">161 cvpr-2013-Facial Feature Tracking Under Varying Facial Expressions and Face Poses Based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Wu, Zuoguan Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, sincefaces may have varyingfacial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.</p><p>6 0.21121758 <a title="462-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Designing_Category-Level_Attributes_for_Discriminative_Visual_Recognition.html">116 cvpr-2013-Designing Category-Level Attributes for Discriminative Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Margret Keuper, Thorsten Schmidt, Maja Temerinac-Ott, Jan Padeken, Patrick Heun, Olaf Ronneberger, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: With volumetric data from widefield fluorescence microscopy, many emerging questions in biological and biomedical research are being investigated. Data can be recorded with high temporal resolution while the specimen is only exposed to a low amount of phototoxicity. These advantages come at the cost of strong recording blur caused by the infinitely extended point spread function (PSF). For widefield microscopy, its magnitude only decays with the square of the distance to the focal point and consists of an airy bessel pattern which is intricate to describe in the spatial domain. However, the Fourier transform of the incoherent PSF (denoted as Optical Transfer Function (OTF)) is well localized and smooth. In this paper, we present a blind -fre iburg .de Figure 1.

<p>Author: Thoma Papadhimitri, Paolo Favaro</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of reconstructing normals, albedo and lights of Lambertian surfaces in uncalibrated photometric stereo under the perspective projection model. Our analysis is based on establishing the integrability constraint. In the orthographicprojection case, it is well-known that when such constraint is imposed, a solution can be identified only up to 3 parameters, the so-called generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We show that in the perspective projection case the solution is unique. We also propose a closed-form solution which is simple, efficient and robust. We test our algorithm on synthetic data and publicly available real data. Our quantitative tests show that our method outperforms all prior work of uncalibrated photometric stereo under orthographic projection.</p><p>3 0.70791274 <a title="462-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm_IDF_for_Large_Scale_Image_Search.html">275 cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm IDF for Large Scale Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Zheng, Shengjin Wang, Ziqiong Liu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is prevalently utilized in the Bag-of-Words based image search. The basic idea is to assign less weight to terms with high frequency, and vice versa. However, the estimation of visual word frequency is coarse and heuristic. Therefore, the effectiveness of the conventional IDF routine is marginal, and far from optimal. To tackle thisproblem, thispaper introduces a novel IDF expression by the use of Lp-norm pooling technique. . edu . cn qit i @ c s an . ut s a . edu ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Carefully designed, the proposed IDF takes into account the term frequency, document frequency, the complexity of images, as well as the codebook information.

Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Oxford 5K, Paris 6K and Flickr 1M).

<p>Author: Roni Mittelman, Honglak Lee, Benjamin Kuipers, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: The use of semantic attributes in computer vision problems has been gaining increased popularity in recent years. Attributes provide an intermediate feature representation in between low-level features and the class categories, leading to improved learning on novel categories from few examples. However, a major caveat is that learning semantic attributes is a laborious task, requiring a significant amount of time and human intervention to provide labels. In order to address this issue, we propose a weakly supervised approach to learn mid-level features, where only class-level supervision is provided during training. We develop a novel extension of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) by incorporating a Beta-Bernoulli process factor potential for hidden units. Unlike the standard RBM, our model uses the class labels to promote category-dependent sharing of learned features, which tends to improve the generalization performance. By using semantic attributes for which annotations are available, we show that we can find correspondences between the learned mid-level features and the labeled attributes. Therefore, the mid-level features have distinct semantic characterization which is similar to that given by the semantic attributes, even though their labeling was not provided during training. Our experimental results on object recognition tasks show significant performance gains, outperforming existing methods which rely on manually labeled semantic attributes.</p><p>5 0.68831819 <a title="462-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Action_Recognition_by_Hierarchical_Sequence_Summarization.html">32 cvpr-2013-Action Recognition by Hierarchical Sequence Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yale Song, Louis-Philippe Morency, Randall Davis</p><p>Abstract: Recent progress has shown that learning from hierarchical feature representations leads to improvements in various computer vision tasks. Motivated by the observation that human activity data contains information at various temporal resolutions, we present a hierarchical sequence summarization approach for action recognition that learns multiple layers of discriminative feature representations at different temporal granularities. We build up a hierarchy dynamically and recursively by alternating sequence learning and sequence summarization. For sequence learning we use CRFs with latent variables to learn hidden spatiotemporal dynamics; for sequence summarization we group observations that have similar semantic meaning in the latent space. For each layer we learn an abstract feature representation through non-linear gate functions. This procedure is repeated to obtain a hierarchical sequence summary representation. We develop an efficient learning method to train our model and show that its complexity grows sublinearly with the size of the hierarchy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, achieving the best published results on the ArmGesture and Canal9 datasets.</p><p>6 0.68484449 <a title="462-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Maximum_Appearance_Search_for_Large-Scale_Object_Detection.html">144 cvpr-2013-Efficient Maximum Appearance Search for Large-Scale Object Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim Matthews, Mark S. Nixon, Mahesan Niranjan</p><p>Abstract: We argue for the importance of explicit semantic modelling in human-centred texture analysis tasks such as retrieval, annotation, synthesis, and zero-shot learning. To this end, low-level attributes are selected and used to define a semantic space for texture. 319 texture classes varying in illumination and rotation are positioned within this semantic space using a pairwise relative comparison procedure. Low-level visual features used by existing texture descriptors are then assessed in terms of their correspondence to the semantic space. Textures with strong presence ofattributes connoting randomness and complexity are shown to be poorly modelled by existing descriptors. In a retrieval experiment semantic descriptors are shown to outperform visual descriptors. Semantic modelling of texture is thus shown to provide considerable value in both feature selection and in analysis tasks.</p><p>3 0.064279705 <a title="391-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Statistical_Textural_Distinctiveness_for_Salient_Region_Detection_in_Natural_Images.html">411 cvpr-2013-Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scharfenberger, Alexander Wong, Khalil Fergani, John S. Zelek, David A. Clausi</p><p>Abstract: A novel statistical textural distinctiveness approach for robustly detecting salient regions in natural images is proposed. Rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations are extracted and used to learn a set of representative texture atoms for defining a sparse texture model for the image. Based on the learnt sparse texture model, a weighted graphical model is constructed to characterize the statistical textural distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs. Finally, the saliency of each pixel in the image is computed based on the probability of occurrence of the representative texture atoms, their respective statistical textural distinctiveness based on the constructed graphical model, and general visual attentive constraints. Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>4 0.064072333 <a title="391-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Discriminative_Illumination_and_Filters_for_Raw_Material_Classification_with_Optimal_Projections_of_Bidirectional_Texture_Functions.html">251 cvpr-2013-Learning Discriminative Illumination and Filters for Raw Material Classification with Optimal Projections of Bidirectional Texture Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Liu, Geifei Yang, Jinwei Gu</p><p>Abstract: We present a computational imaging method for raw material classification using features of Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Texture is an intrinsic feature for many materials, such as wood, fabric, and granite. At appropriate scales, even “uniform” materials will also exhibit texture features that can be helpful for recognition, such as paper, metal, and ceramic. To cope with the high-dimensionality of BTFs, in this paper, we proposed to learn discriminative illumination patterns and texture filters, with which we can directly measure optimal projections of BTFs for classification. We also studied the effects of texture rotation and scale variation for material classification. We built an LED-based multispectral dome, with which we have acquired a BTF database of a variety of materials and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for material classification.</p><p>5 0.062796332 <a title="391-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Tung, Takashi Matsuyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to characterize deformable surface using intrinsic property dynamics. 3D dynamic surfaces representing humans in motion can be obtained using multiple view stereo reconstruction methods or depth cameras. Nowadays these technologies have become capable to capture surface variations in real-time, and give details such as clothing wrinkles and deformations. Assuming repetitive patterns in the deformations, we propose to model complex surface variations using sets of linear dynamical systems (LDS) where observations across time are given by surface intrinsic properties such as local curvatures. We introduce an approach based on bags of dynamical systems, where each surface feature to be represented in the codebook is modeled by a set of LDS equipped with timing structure. Experiments are performed on datasets of real-world dynamical surfaces and show compelling results for description, classification and segmentation.</p><p>6 0.059150506 <a title="391-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Video_Object_Cut_in_Highly_Dynamic_Scenes.html">148 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Video Object Cut in Highly Dynamic Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>3 0.64271903 <a title="391-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Contactless%2C_Low-Cost_and_Accurate_3D_Fingerprint_Identification.html">435 cvpr-2013-Towards Contactless, Low-Cost and Accurate 3D Fingerprint Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ajay Kumar, Cyril Kwong</p><p>Abstract: In order to avail the benefits of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contactless 3D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results from the use of multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contactless 3D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3D finger surface features using Finger Surface Codes and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3D space to accurately match the recovered 3D minutiae. Multiple 2D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2D features for further improving 3D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3D fingerprint identification.</p><p>4 0.62273788 <a title="391-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Axially_Symmetric_3D_Pots_Configuration_System_Using_Axis_of_Symmetry_and_Break_Curve.html">52 cvpr-2013-Axially Symmetric 3D Pots Configuration System Using Axis of Symmetry and Break Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Kilho Son, Eduardo B. Almeida, David B. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Thispaper introduces a novel approachfor reassembling pot sherds found at archaeological excavation sites, for the purpose ofreconstructing claypots that had been made on a wheel. These pots and the sherds into which they have broken are axially symmetric. The reassembly process can be viewed as 3D puzzle solving or generalized cylinder learning from broken fragments. The estimation exploits both local and semi-global geometric structure, thus making it a fundamental problem of geometry estimation from noisy fragments in computer vision and pattern recognition. The data used are densely digitized 3D laser scans of each fragment’s outer surface. The proposed reassembly system is automatic and functions when the pile of available fragments is from one or multiple pots, and even when pieces are missing from any pot. The geometric structure used are curves on the pot along which the surface had broken and the silhouette of a pot with respect to an axis, called axisprofile curve (APC). For reassembling multiple pots with or without missing pieces, our algorithm estimates the APC from each fragment, then reassembles into configurations the ones having distinctive APC. Further growth of configurations is based on adding remaining fragments such that their APC and break curves are consistent with those of a configuration. The method is novel, more robust and handles the largest numbers of fragments to date.</p><p>5 0.6103422 <a title="391-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Analytic_Bilinear_Appearance_Subspace_Construction_for_Modeling_Image_Irradiance_under_Natural_Illumination_and_Non-Lambertian_Reflectance.html">42 cvpr-2013-Analytic Bilinear Appearance Subspace Construction for Modeling Image Irradiance under Natural Illumination and Non-Lambertian Reflectance</a></p>

In this paper, we propose an analytic formulation for low-dimensional subspace construction in which shading cues lie while preserving the natural structure of an image sample.

This opens the possibility of measuring and recognizing highly detailed surface texxtures. The GelSight sensor, when pressed against a surfacce, delivers a height map. This can be treated as an image, aand processed using the tools of visual texture analysis. WWe have devised a simple yet effective texture recognitioon system based on local binary patterns, and enhanced it by the use of a multi-scale pyramid and a Hellinger ddistance metric. We built a database with 40 classes of taactile textures using materials such as fabric, wood, and sanndpaper. Our system can correctly categorize materials fromm this database with high accuracy. This suggests that the GGelSight sensor can be useful for material recognition by roobots.</p><p>3 0.50277162 <a title="391-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>4 0.50059021 <a title="391-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Relative_Volume_Constraints_for_Single_View_3D_Reconstruction.html">354 cvpr-2013-Relative Volume Constraints for Single View 3D Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Eno Töppe, Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of relative volume constraints in order to account for insufficient information in the reconstruction of 3D objects from a single image. The key idea is to formulate a variational reconstruction approach with shape priors in form of relative depth profiles or volume ratios relating object parts. Such shape priors can easily be derived either from a user sketch or from the object’s shading profile in the image. They can handle textured or shadowed object regions by propagating information. We propose a convex relaxation of the constrained optimization problem which can be solved optimally in a few seconds on graphics hardware. In contrast to existing single view reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithm provides substantially more flexibility to recover shape details such as self-occlusions, dents and holes, which are not visible in the object silhouette.</p><p>5 0.49879715 <a title="391-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojie Guo, Xiaochun Cao, Xiaowu Chen, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Given an area of interest in a video sequence, one may want to manipulate or edit the area, e.g. remove occlusions from or replace with an advertisement on it. Such a task involves three main challenges including temporal consistency, spatial pose, and visual realism. The proposed method effectively seeks an optimal solution to simultaneously deal with temporal alignment, pose rectification, as well as precise recovery of the occlusion. To make our method applicable to long video sequences, we propose a batch alignment method for automatically aligning and rectifying a small number of initial frames, and then show how to align the remaining frames incrementally to the aligned base images. From the error residual of the robust alignment process, we automatically construct a trimap of the region for each frame, which is used as the input to alpha matting methods to extract the occluding foreground. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the accurate and robust performance of our method.</p><p>6 0.49738783 <a title="391-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Stereo_Pairs_from_Anaglyphs.html">352 cvpr-2013-Recovering Stereo Pairs from Anaglyphs</a></p>

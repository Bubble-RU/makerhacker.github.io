In this paper, we regard saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, uses the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score, and finally fuses the saliency scores across multiple levels, yielding the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we show our approach, which integrates the regional contrast, regional property and regional backgroundness descriptors together to form the master saliency map, is able to produce superior saliency maps to existing algorithms most of which combine saliency maps heuristically computed from different types of features. The other is that we introduce a new regional feature vector, backgroundness, to characterize the background, which can be regarded as a counterpart of the objectness descriptor [2]. The performance evaluation on several popular benchmark data sets validates that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.63806874 <a title="374-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking.html">375 cvpr-2013-Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing bottom-up methods measure the foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead of considering the contrast between the salient objects and their surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in a different way. We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with superpixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We also create a more difficult bench- mark database containing 5,172 images to test the proposed saliency model and make this database publicly available with this paper for further studies in the saliency field.</p><p>4 0.59869617 <a title="374-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-PISA%3A_Pixelwise_Image_Saliency_by_Aggregating_Complementary_Appearance_Contrast_Measures_with_Spatial_Priors.html">322 cvpr-2013-PISA: Pixelwise Image Saliency by Aggregating Complementary Appearance Contrast Measures with Spatial Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or post– relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISA’s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>5 0.57540029 <a title="374-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>6 0.53245014 <a title="374-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Scharfenberger, Alexander Wong, Khalil Fergani, John S. Zelek, David A. Clausi</p><p>Abstract: A novel statistical textural distinctiveness approach for robustly detecting salient regions in natural images is proposed. Rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations are extracted and used to learn a set of representative texture atoms for defining a sparse texture model for the image. Based on the learnt sparse texture model, a weighted graphical model is constructed to characterize the statistical textural distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs. Finally, the saliency of each pixel in the image is computed based on the probability of occurrence of the representative texture atoms, their respective statistical textural distinctiveness based on the constructed graphical model, and general visual attentive constraints. Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>6 0.85535073 <a title="374-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>

First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>2 0.86345756 <a title="374-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-CLAM%3A_Coupled_Localization_and_Mapping_with_Efficient_Outlier_Handling.html">74 cvpr-2013-CLAM: Coupled Localization and Mapping with Efficient Outlier Handling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>3 0.84055436 <a title="374-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>4 0.8302477 <a title="374-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>5 0.81754941 <a title="374-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-FrameBreak%3A_Dramatic_Image_Extrapolation_by_Guided_Shift-Maps.html">177 cvpr-2013-FrameBreak: Dramatic Image Extrapolation by Guided Shift-Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>6 0.79284114 <a title="374-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>

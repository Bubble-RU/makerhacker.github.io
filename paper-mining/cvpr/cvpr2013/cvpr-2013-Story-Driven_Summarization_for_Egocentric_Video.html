<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Raffay Hamid, Chih-Jen Lin, Neel Sundaresan</p><p>Abstract: Given the enormous growth in user-generated videos, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to navigate them efficiently. As these videos are generally of poor quality, summarization methods designed for well-produced videos do not generalize to them. To address this challenge, we propose to use web-images as a prior to facilitate summarization of user-generated videos. Our main intuition is that people tend to take pictures of objects to capture them in a maximally informative way. Such images could therefore be used as prior information to summarize videos containing a similar set of objects. In this work, we apply our novel insight to develop a summarization algorithm that uses the web-image based prior information in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, to automatically evaluate summarization algorithms on a large scale, we propose a framework that relies on multiple summaries obtained through crowdsourcing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation framework by comparing its performance to that ofmultiple human evaluators. Finally, wepresent resultsfor our framework tested on hundreds of user-generated videos.</p><p>3 0.095402449 <a title="413-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level_Hand_Detection_in_Ego-centric_Videos.html">332 cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level Hand Detection in Ego-centric Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: We address the task of pixel-level hand detection in the context of ego-centric cameras. Extracting hand regions in ego-centric videos is a critical step for understanding handobject manipulation and analyzing hand-eye coordination. However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.</p><p>4 0.07976611 <a title="413-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Key-Framing%3A_A_Model_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">336 cvpr-2013-Poselet Key-Framing: A Model for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new model for recognizing human actions. An action is modeled as a very sparse sequence of temporally local discriminative keyframes collections of partial key-poses of the actor(s), depicting key states in the action sequence. We cast the learning of keyframes in a max-margin discriminative framework, where we treat keyframes as latent variables. This allows us to (jointly) learn a set of most discriminative keyframes while also learning the local temporal context between them. Keyframes are encoded using a spatially-localizable poselet-like representation with HoG and BoW components learned from weak annotations; we rely on structured SVM formulation to align our components and minefor hard negatives to boost localization performance. This results in a model that supports spatio-temporal localization and is insensitive to dropped frames or partial observations. We show classification performance that is competitive with the state of the art on the benchmark UT-Interaction dataset and illustrate that our model outperforms prior methods in an on-line streaming setting.</p><p>5 0.074772805 <a title="413-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-First-Person_Activity_Recognition%3A_What_Are_They_Doing_to_Me%3F.html">175 cvpr-2013-First-Person Activity Recognition: What Are They Doing to Me?</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael S. Ryoo, Larry Matthies</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of recognizing interaction-level human activities from a first-person viewpoint. The goal is to enable an observer (e.g., a robot or a wearable camera) to understand ‘what activity others are performing to it’ from continuous video inputs. These include friendly interactions such as ‘a person hugging the observer’ as well as hostile interactions like ‘punching the observer’ or ‘throwing objects to the observer’, whose videos involve a large amount of camera ego-motion caused by physical interactions. The paper investigates multichannel kernels to integrate global and local motion information, and presents a new activity learning/recognition methodology that explicitly considers temporal structures displayed in first-person activity videos. In our experiments, we not only show classification results with segmented videos, but also confirm that our new approach is able to detect activities from continuous videos reliably.</p><p>6 0.073733099 <a title="413-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Actions_through_State_Changes.html">287 cvpr-2013-Modeling Actions through State Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Gangqiang Zhao, Junsong Yuan, Gang Hua</p><p>Abstract: A topical video object refers to an object that is frequently highlighted in a video. It could be, e.g., the product logo and the leading actor/actress in a TV commercial. We propose a topic model that incorporates a word co-occurrence prior for efficient discovery of topical video objects from a set of key frames. Previous work using topic models, such as Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA), for video object discovery often takes a bag-of-visual-words representation, which ignored important co-occurrence information among the local features. We show that such data driven co-occurrence information from bottom-up can conveniently be incorporated in LDA with a Gaussian Markov prior, which combines top down probabilistic topic modeling with bottom up priors in a unified model. Our experiments on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover different types of topical objects despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting changes, or even partial occlusions. The efficacy of the co-occurrence prior is clearly demonstrated when comparing with topic models without such priors.</p><p>4 0.74304742 <a title="413-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Dominant_and_Anomalous_Behavior_Detection_in_Videos.html">313 cvpr-2013-Online Dominant and Anomalous Behavior Detection in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrsan Javan Roshtkhari, Martin D. Levine</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for video parsing and simultaneous online learning of dominant and anomalous behaviors in surveillance videos. Dominant behaviors are those occurring frequently in videos and hence, usually do not attract much attention. They can be characterized by different complexities in space and time, ranging from a scene background to human activities. In contrast, an anomalous behavior is defined as having a low likelihood of occurrence. We do not employ any models of the entities in the scene in order to detect these two kinds of behaviors. In this paper, video events are learnt at each pixel without supervision using densely constructed spatio-temporal video volumes. Furthermore, the volumes are organized into large contextual graphs. These compositions are employed to construct a hierarchical codebook model for the dominant behaviors. By decomposing spatio-temporal contextual information into unique spatial and temporal contexts, the proposed framework learns the models of the dominant spatial and temporal events. Thus, it is ultimately capable of simultaneously modeling high-level behaviors as well as low-level spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal pixel level changes.</p><p>5 0.74304533 <a title="413-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Thousand_Frames_in_Just_a_Few_Words%3A_Lingual_Description_of_Videos_through_Latent_Topics_and_Sparse_Object_Stitching.html">28 cvpr-2013-A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradipto Das, Chenliang Xu, Richard F. Doell, Jason J. Corso</p><p>Abstract: The problem of describing images through natural language has gained importance in the computer vision community. Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level.</p><p>6 0.72645736 <a title="413-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-class_Video_Co-segmentation_with_a_Generative_Multi-video_Model.html">294 cvpr-2013-Multi-class Video Co-segmentation with a Generative Multi-video Model</a></p>

We apply our approach to over 12 hours of daily activity video taken from 23 unique camera wearers, and systematically evaluate its quality compared to multiple baselines with 34 human subjects.</p><p>2 0.75509524 <a title="413-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Recognizing_Activities_via_Bag_of_Words_for_Attribute_Dynamics.html">348 cvpr-2013-Recognizing Activities via Bag of Words for Attribute Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Weixin Li, Qian Yu, Harpreet Sawhney, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel video representation for activity recognition that models video dynamics with attributes of activities. A video sequence is decomposed into short-term segments, which are characterized by the dynamics of their attributes. These segments are modeled by a dictionary of attribute dynamics templates, which are implemented by a recently introduced generative model, the binary dynamic system (BDS). We propose methods for learning a dictionary of BDSs from a training corpus, and for quantizing attribute sequences extracted from videos into these BDS codewords. This procedure produces a representation of the video as a histogram of BDS codewords, which is denoted the bag-of-words for attribute dynamics (BoWAD). An extensive experimental evaluation reveals that this representation outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in temporal structure modeling for complex ac- tivity recognition.</p><p>3 0.75326329 <a title="413-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Key-Framing%3A_A_Model_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">336 cvpr-2013-Poselet Key-Framing: A Model for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new model for recognizing human actions. An action is modeled as a very sparse sequence of temporally local discriminative keyframes collections of partial key-poses of the actor(s), depicting key states in the action sequence. We cast the learning of keyframes in a max-margin discriminative framework, where we treat keyframes as latent variables. This allows us to (jointly) learn a set of most discriminative keyframes while also learning the local temporal context between them. Keyframes are encoded using a spatially-localizable poselet-like representation with HoG and BoW components learned from weak annotations; we rely on structured SVM formulation to align our components and minefor hard negatives to boost localization performance. This results in a model that supports spatio-temporal localization and is insensitive to dropped frames or partial observations. We show classification performance that is competitive with the state of the art on the benchmark UT-Interaction dataset and illustrate that our model outperforms prior methods in an on-line streaming setting.</p><p>4 0.7306872 <a title="413-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Finding_Group_Interactions_in_Social_Clutter.html">172 cvpr-2013-Finding Group Interactions in Social Clutter</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruonan Li, Parker Porfilio, Todd Zickler</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding distinctive social interactions involving groups of agents embedded in larger social gatherings. Given a pre-defined gallery of short exemplar interaction videos, and a long input video of a large gathering (with approximately-tracked agents), we identify within the gathering small sub-groups of agents exhibiting social interactions that resemble those in the exemplars. The participants of each detected group interaction are localized in space; the extent of their interaction is localized in time; and when the gallery ofexemplars is annotated with group-interaction categories, each detected interaction is classified into one of the pre-defined categories. Our approach represents group behaviors by dichotomous collections of descriptors for (a) individual actions, and (b) pairwise interactions; and it includes efficient algorithms for optimally distinguishing participants from by-standers in every temporal unit and for temporally localizing the extent of the group interaction. Most importantly, the method is generic and can be applied whenever numerous interacting agents can be approximately tracked over time. We evaluate the approach using three different video collections, two that involve humans and one that involves mice.</p><p>5 0.70133191 <a title="413-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Weak_Stabilization_for_Motion_Feature_Extraction.html">158 cvpr-2013-Exploring Weak Stabilization for Motion Feature Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Dennis Park, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár</p><p>Abstract: We describe novel but simple motion features for the problem of detecting objects in video sequences. Previous approaches either compute optical flow or temporal differences on video frame pairs with various assumptions about stabilization. We describe a combined approach that uses coarse-scale flow and fine-scale temporal difference features. Our approach performs weak motion stabilization by factoring out camera motion and coarse object motion while preserving nonrigid motions that serve as useful cues for recognition. We show results for pedestrian detection and human pose estimation in video sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results in both. In particular, given a fixed detection rate our method achieves a five-fold reduction in false positives over prior art on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark. Finally, we perform extensive diagnostic experiments to reveal what aspects of our system are crucial for good performance. Proper stabilization, long time-scale features, and proper normalization are all critical.</p><p>6 0.70130223 <a title="413-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Better_Exploiting_Motion_for_Better_Action_Recognition.html">59 cvpr-2013-Better Exploiting Motion for Better Action Recognition</a></p>

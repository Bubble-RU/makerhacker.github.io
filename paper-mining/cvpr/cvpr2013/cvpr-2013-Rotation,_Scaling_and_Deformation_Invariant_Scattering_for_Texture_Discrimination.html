</p><p>4 Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. [sent-4, score-0.915]
</p><p>5 Hierarchical cascade of invariants [2, 3] have been studied to build affine invariant image representations. [sent-9, score-0.648]
</p><p>6 Learning is not necessary to build affine invariants with a hierarchical cascade, but its mathematical and algorithmic implementation raises difficulties. [sent-11, score-0.434]
</p><p>7 How can we factorize affine invariants into simpler invariants computed over smaller subgroups ? [sent-12, score-0.755]
</p><p>8 How to compute stable and informative invariants over any given group ? [sent-13, score-0.416]
</p><p>9 This paper shows that stable and informative affine invariant representations can be obtained with a scattering operator defined on the translation, rotation and scaling groups. [sent-14, score-1.147]
</p><p>10 It is implemented by a deep convolution network with wavelets filters and modulus non-linearities. [sent-15, score-0.51]
</p><p>11 Section 2 shows that within image patches, translations and rotation invariants must be computed together to retain  joint information on spatial positions and orientations. [sent-17, score-0.537]
</p><p>12 A joint scattering invariant on the roto-translation group requires to build a wavelet transform on this non-commutative group, which involves a different type of convolution described in Section 3. [sent-18, score-1.196]
</p><p>13 A scaling invariant may however be computed separately with a scale-space averaging across image patches. [sent-19, score-0.306]
</p><p>14 Thanks to wavelet localizations, scattering transforms computes invariants which are stable to deformations [9]. [sent-21, score-1.428]
</p><p>15 It results that small shearing and deformations are linearized in the scattering domain. [sent-22, score-0.861]
</p><p>16 Section 6 shows that scattering representations give state-of-the-art texture classification results on KTH-TIPS [17], UIUC [18] and UMD [19] databases. [sent-26, score-0.694]
</p><p>17 1analyzes the construction of affine invariants as a a cascade of separable or joint invariants on smaller groups. [sent-33, score-0.97]
</p><p>18 The hierarchical architecture of affine invariant scattering representations is described in Section 2. [sent-34, score-0.948]
</p><p>19 Separable Versus Joint Invariants  The affine group can be written as a product of the translation, rotation, scaling and shearing groups. [sent-38, score-0.321]
</p><p>20 Affine invariant representations can be computed as a separable product of invariants on each of these smaller subgroups. [sent-39, score-0.593]
</p><p>21 However, we show that such separable invariant products may lose important information. [sent-40, score-0.309]
</p><p>22 This is why two-dimensional translation invariant representations are not computed by cascading invariants to horizontal and vertical translations. [sent-71, score-0.575]
</p><p>23 A separa-  ble product of translation and rotation invariant operators can represent the relative positions of the vertical patterns, and the relative positions of the horizontal patterns, up to global translations. [sent-74, score-0.398]
</p><p>24 Such a separable invariant thus can not discriminate the two textures of Figure 1. [sent-77, score-0.311]
</p><p>25 Figure 1: The left and right textures are not discriminated by a separable invariant along rotations and translations, but can be discriminated by a joint roto-translation invariant. [sent-78, score-0.426]
</p><p>26 Computing a joint invariant between rotations and translations also means taking into account the joint relative positions and orientations of image structures, so that  the textures of Figure 1 can be discriminated. [sent-80, score-0.471]
</p><p>27 Section 3 introduces a roto-translation scattering operator, which is computed by cascading wavelet transforms on the rototranslation group. [sent-81, score-0.966]
</p><p>28 Calculating joint invariants on large non-commutative groups may however become very complex. [sent-82, score-0.366]
</p><p>29 As a result of this strong correlation across scales, one can use a separable invariant along scales, with little loss of discriminative information. [sent-87, score-0.272]
</p><p>30 Hierarchical Architecture We now explain how to build an affine invariant representation, with a hierarchical architecture. [sent-90, score-0.271]
</p><p>31 We separate variabilities of potentially large amplitudes such as translations, rotations and scaling, from smaller amplitude variabilities, but which may belong to much higher dimensional groups such as shearing and general diffeomorphisms. [sent-91, score-0.255]
</p><p>32 Most image representations build localized invariants over small image patches, for example with SIFT descriptors [15]. [sent-94, score-0.321]
</p><p>33 These invariant coefficients are then ag-  gregated into more invariant global image descriptors, for example with bag of words [10] or multiple layers of deep neural network [4, 5]. [sent-95, score-0.429]
</p><p>34 We follow a similar strategy by first computing invariants over image patches and then aggregating them at the global image scale. [sent-96, score-0.361]
</p><p>35 Figure 2: An affine invariant scattering is computed by applying a roto-translation scattering on image patches, a logarithmic non-linearity and a global space-scale averaging. [sent-100, score-1.579]
</p><p>36 Invariants to small shearing and deformations are computed with linear projectors optimized by a supervised classifier. [sent-101, score-0.276]
</p><p>37 This is done by calculating a scattering invariant on the joint roto-translation group. [sent-103, score-0.843]
</p><p>38 A logarithmic non-linearity is first applied to invariant scattering coefficients to linearize their power law behavior across scales. [sent-105, score-0.894]
</p><p>39 A scattering transform was proved to be stable to deformations [9]. [sent-108, score-0.818]
</p><p>40 Indeed, it is computed with a cascade of wavelet trans1 1 12 2 23 3 324 2  forms which are stable to deformations, because wavelets are both regular and localized. [sent-109, score-0.46]
</p><p>41 A small image deformation thus produces a small modification of it scattering representation. [sent-110, score-0.667]
</p><p>42 The stability of scattering transforms to deformations guarantees that small shearing and deformations can be approximated by a linear operator in the space of scattering coefficients. [sent-111, score-1.724]
</p><p>43 Enforcing invariance to all deformations would remove too much information because deformations involve too many degrees of freedom. [sent-113, score-0.283]
</p><p>44 Since invariants are implemented by a linear projector, their optimization involves the optimization of a linear operator. [sent-115, score-0.349]

</p><p>46 Invariant-Covariant Wavelet Cascade A scattering operator [9] computes an invariant image representation relatively to the action of a group, by applying a cascade of invariant and covariant operators calculated with wavelet convolutions and modulus operators. [sent-122, score-1.715]

</p><p>56 These high frequencies are recovered by convolution with high pass wavelet filters. [sent-184, score-0.358]

<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ‚Äôs local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>3 0.11405347 <a title="369-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressible_Motion_Fields.html">88 cvpr-2013-Compressible Motion Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Giuseppe Ottaviano, Pushmeet Kohli</p><p>Abstract: Traditional video compression methods obtain a compact representation for image frames by computing coarse motion fields defined on patches of pixels called blocks, in order to compensate for the motion in the scene across frames. This piecewise constant approximation makes the motion field efficiently encodable, but it introduces block artifacts in the warped image frame. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating dense motion fields that, while accurately predicting one frame from a given reference frame by warping it with the field, are also compressible. We introduce a representation for motion fields based on wavelet bases, and approximate the compressibility of their coefficients with a piecewise smooth surrogate function that yields an objective function similar to classical optical flow formulations. We then show how to quantize and encode such coefficients with adaptive precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by com- paring its performance with a state-of-the-art wavelet video encoder. Experimental results on a number of standard flow and video datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms both block-based and optical-flow-based motion compensation algorithms.</p><p>4 0.11221683 <a title="369-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Rigamonti, Amos Sironi, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: Learning filters to produce sparse image representations in terms of overcomplete dictionaries has emerged as a powerful way to create image features for many different purposes.

<p>Author: Simon Korman, Daniel Reichman, Gilad Tsur, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Fast-Match is a fast algorithm for approximate template matching under 2D affine transformations that minimizes the Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD) error measure. There is a huge number of transformations to consider but we prove that they can be sampled using a density that depends on the smoothness of the image. For each potential transformation, we approximate the SAD error using a sublinear algorithm that randomly examines only a small number of pixels. We further accelerate the algorithm using a branch-and-bound scheme. As images are known to be piecewise smooth, the result is a practical affine template matching algorithm with approximation guarantees, that takes a few seconds to run on a standard machine. We perform several experiments on three different datasets, and report very good results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first template matching algorithm which is guaranteed to handle arbitrary 2D affine transformations.</p><p>6 0.066149361 <a title="369-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>

<p>Author: Hilton Bristow, Anders Eriksson, Simon Lucey</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method in learning and vision for a variety of classification, reconstruction and coding tasks. The canonical approach intrinsically assumes independence between observations during learning. For many natural signals however, sparse coding is applied to sub-elements (i.e. patches) of the signal, where such an assumption is invalid. Convolutional sparse coding explicitly models local interactions through the convolution operator, however the resulting optimization problem is considerably more complex than traditional sparse coding. In this paper, we draw upon ideas from signal processing and Augmented Lagrange Methods (ALMs) to produce a fast algorithm with globally optimal subproblems and super-linear convergence.</p><p>3 0.68082899 <a title="369-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ‚Äôs local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>5 0.62741464 <a title="369-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Sensing_and_Recognizing_Surface_Textures_Using_a_GelSight_Sensor.html">391 cvpr-2013-Sensing and Recognizing Surface Textures Using a GelSight Sensor</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Li, Edward H. Adelson</p><p>Abstract: Sensing surface textures by touch is a valuable capability for robots. Until recently it wwas difficult to build a compliant sensor with high sennsitivity and high resolution. The GelSight sensor is coompliant and offers sensitivity and resolution exceeding that of the human fingertips. This opens the possibility of measuring and recognizing highly detailed surface texxtures. The GelSight sensor, when pressed against a surfacce, delivers a height map. This can be treated as an image, aand processed using the tools of visual texture analysis. WWe have devised a simple yet effective texture recognitioon system based on local binary patterns, and enhanced it by the use of a multi-scale pyramid and a Hellinger ddistance metric. We built a database with 40 classes of taactile textures using materials such as fabric, wood, and sanndpaper. Our system can correctly categorize materials fromm this database with high accuracy. This suggests that the GGelSight sensor can be useful for material recognition by roobots.</p><p>6 0.60603213 <a title="369-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_Based_on_Filter_Learning.html">346 cvpr-2013-Real-Time No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Filter Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Asma Rejeb Sfar, Nozha Boujemaa, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We study fine-grained categorization, the task of distinguishing among (sub)categories of the same generic object class (e.g., birds), focusing on determining botanical species (leaves and orchids) from scanned images. The strategy is to focus attention around several vantage points, which is the approach taken by botanists, but using features dedicated to the individual categories. Our implementation of the strategy is based on vantage feature frames, a novel object representation consisting of two components: a set of coordinate systems centered at the most discriminating local viewpoints for the generic object class and a set of category-dependentfeatures computed in these frames. The features are pooled over frames to build the classifier. Categorization then proceeds from coarse-grained (finding the frames) to fine-grained (finding the category), and hence the vantage feature frames must be both detectable and discriminating. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the art algorithms, in particular those using more distributed representations, on standard databases of leaves.</p><p>3 0.72255242 <a title="369-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Liu, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao, Zicheng Liu, Luming Zhang, Chun Chen, Jiajun Bu</p><p>Abstract: Node splitting is an important issue in Random Forest but robust splitting requires a large number of training samples. Existing solutions fail to properly partition the feature space if there are insufficient training data. In this paper, we present semi-supervised splitting to overcome this limitation by splitting nodes with the guidance of both labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, we derive a nonparametric algorithm to obtain an accurate quality measure of splitting by incorporating abundant unlabeled data. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we project the data points from the original high-dimensional feature space onto a low-dimensional subspace before estimation. A unified optimization framework is proposed to select a coupled pair of subspace and separating hyperplane such that the smoothness of the subspace and the quality of the splitting are guaranteed simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised algorithms for typical computer vision applications such as object categorization and image segmen- tation. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p><p>5 0.69081742 <a title="369-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>6 0.68906754 <a title="369-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>3 0.22714859 <a title="337-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding%2C_Calibration_and_Rectification_for_Lenselet-Based_Plenoptic_Cameras.html">102 cvpr-2013-Decoding, Calibration and Rectification for Lenselet-Based Plenoptic Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>4 0.1498334 <a title="337-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Globally_Consistent_Multi-label_Assignment_on_the_Ray_Space_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">188 cvpr-2013-Globally Consistent Multi-label Assignment on the Ray Space of 4D Light Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Sven Wanner, Christoph Straehle, Bastian Goldluecke</p><p>Abstract: Wepresent thefirst variationalframeworkfor multi-label segmentation on the ray space of 4D light fields. For traditional segmentation of single images, , features need to be extractedfrom the 2Dprojection ofa three-dimensional scene. The associated loss of geometry information can cause severe problems, for example if different objects have a very similar visual appearance. In this work, we show that using a light field instead of an image not only enables to train classifiers which can overcome many of these problems, but also provides an optimal data structure for label optimization by implicitly providing scene geometry information. It is thus possible to consistently optimize label assignment over all views simultaneously. As a further contribution, we make all light fields available online with complete depth and segmentation ground truth data where available, and thus establish the first benchmark data set for light field analysis to facilitate competitive further development of algorithms.</p><p>5 0.11922015 <a title="337-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>6 0.11555879 <a title="337-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-The_Variational_Structure_of_Disparity_and_Regularization_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">431 cvpr-2013-The Variational Structure of Disparity and Regularization of 4D Light Fields</a></p>

We extend the existing work on physical refraction models by considering the dispersion of light, and derive new constraints on the model parameters for use in calibration.

<p>Author: Weiming Li, Haitao Wang, Mingcai Zhou, Shandong Wang, Shaohui Jiao, Xing Mei, Tao Hong, Hoyoung Lee, Jiyeun Kim</p><p>Abstract: Integral imaging display (IID) is a promising technology to provide realistic 3D image without glasses. To achieve a large screen IID with a reasonable fabrication cost, a potential solution is a tiled-lens-array IID (TLA-IID). However, TLA-IIDs are subject to 3D image artifacts when there are even slight misalignments between the lens arrays. This work aims at compensating these artifacts by calibrating the lens array poses with a camera and including them in a ray model used for rendering the 3D image. Since the lens arrays are transparent, this task is challenging for traditional calibration methods. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration method based on defining a set of principle observation rays that pass lens centers of the TLA and the camera ’s optical center. The method is able to determine the lens array poses with only one camera at an arbitrary unknown position without using any additional markers. The principle observation rays are automatically extracted using a structured light based method from a dense correspondence map between the displayed and captured . pixels. . com, Experiments show that lens array misalignments xme i nlpr . ia . ac . cn @ can be estimated with a standard deviation smaller than 0.4 pixels.

<p>Author: Wei Li, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach for matching images observed in different camera views with complex cross-view transforms and apply it to person reidentification. It jointly partitions the image spaces of two camera views into different configurations according to the similarity of cross-view transforms. The visual features of an image pair from different views are first locally aligned by being projected to a common feature space and then matched with softly assigned metrics which are locally optimized. The features optimal for recognizing identities are different from those for clustering cross-view transforms. They are jointly learned by utilizing sparsityinducing norm and information theoretical regularization. . cuhk . edu .hk (a) Camera view A (b) Camera view B This approach can be generalized to the settings where test images are from new camera views, not the same as those in the training set.

<p>Author: Tak-Wai Hui, Ronald Chung</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of recovering camera motion from video data, which does not require the establishment of feature correspondences or computation of optical flows but from normal flows directly. We have designed an imaging system that has a wide field of view by fixating a number of cameras together to form an approximate spherical eye. With a substantially widened visual field, we discover that estimating the directions of translation and rotation components of the motion separately are possible and particularly efficient. In addition, the inherent ambiguities between translation and rotation also disappear. Magnitude of rotation is recovered subsequently. Experimental results on synthetic and real image data are provided. The results show that not only the accuracy of motion estimation is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methods that require explicit feature correspondences or optical flows, but also a faster computation time.</p><p>4 0.53962034 <a title="337-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.53920829 <a title="337-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Information_Consensus_for_Distributed_Multi-target_Tracking.html">224 cvpr-2013-Information Consensus for Distributed Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed T. Kamal, Jay A. Farrell, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: Due to their high fault-tolerance, ease of installation and scalability to large networks, distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community, especially in computer vision. Multitarget tracking in a camera network is one of the fundamental problems in this domain. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors. Since most cameras are directional sensors, it is often the case that neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same target. Such sensors that do not have information about a target are termed as “naive ” with respect to that target. In this paper, we propose consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms in a camera network that are designed to address this issue of naivety. The estimation errors in tracking and data association, as well as the effect of naivety, are jointly addressed leading to the development of an informationweighted consensus algorithm, which we term as the Multitarget Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm. The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mecha- nism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter. Experimental analysis is provided to support the theoretical results.</p><p>6 0.53792417 <a title="337-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Brain_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease%3A_A_Kernel_Learning_Approach_upon_Sparse_Gaussian_Bayesian_Network.html">129 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Brain Effective Connectivity Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease: A Kernel Learning Approach upon Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Network</a></p>

</p><p>5 Introduction The problem domain of jigsaw puzzles is widely known to almost every human being from childhood. [sent-14, score-0.605]
</p><p>6 Given n different non-overlapping pieces of an image, the player has to reconstruct the original image, taking advantage of both the shape and chromatic information of each piece. [sent-15, score-0.375]
</p><p>7 [10] have noted, the jigsaw puzzle problem may and should be researched for the sole reason that it stirs pure interest. [sent-19, score-0.773]
</p><p>8 (a)(b)  (c)(d) Figure 1: Jigsaw puzzles before and after reassembly using our genetic algorithm-based solver. [sent-25, score-0.354]
</p><p>9 We believe these puzzles, of 10,375 (a-b) and 22,834 pieces (c-d), to be the largest automatically solved to date. [sent-26, score-0.375]
</p><p>10 [4] presented a probabilistic puzzle solver that could handle up to 432 pieces, given some a priori knowledge of the puzzle. [sent-29, score-0.568]
</p><p>11 [17] introduced that year, for the first time, a fully automated square jigsaw puzzle solver that could handle puzzles of up to 3,000 pieces. [sent-33, score-1.174]
</p><p>12 Gallagher [9] has advanced this even further by considering a more general variant of the problem, where neither piece orientation nor puzzle dimensions are known. [sent-34, score-0.866]
</p><p>13 In its most basic form, every puzzle solver requires an estimation function to evaluate the compatibility of adjacent pieces and a strategy for placing the pieces (as accurately as possible). [sent-35, score-1.388]
</p><p>14 Interestingly, despite the availability of puzzle solvers for 3,000- and 9,000-piece puzzles, there exists no image set, for the purpose of benchmark testing, containing puzzles with more then 805 pieces. [sent-46, score-0.834]
</p><p>15 We assume that similarly to the case of the smaller images, the accuracy of current solvers on some large puzzles could be greatly increased by using more sophisticated algorithms. [sent-49, score-0.332]
</p><p>16 In this paper we harness the powerful technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) [11] as a strategy for piece placement. [sent-50, score-0.445]
</p><p>17 First and foremost, we present a significantly more accurate solver of the original jigsaw variant with known piece orientation and puzzle dimensions. [sent-54, score-1.243]
</p><p>18 Our solver compromises neither speed nor size as it outperforms state-ofthe-art solvers, successfully tackling up to 22,834-piece size puzzles (more than twice the number of pieces ever attempted/reported) within a reasonable time frame. [sent-55, score-0.77]
</p><p>19 Also, we share all of our results (on this benchmark and other public datasets) for future testing and comparative evaluation of jigsaw puzzle solvers. [sent-58, score-0.793]
</p><p>20 Finally, we provide for the first time an effective GA-based puzzle solver, which should benefit research regarding the area of evolutionary computation (EC), in general, and the jigsaw puzzle problem, in particular. [sent-59, score-1.255]
</p><p>21 As to the jigsaw puzzle problem, our proposed framework could prove useful for solving more advanced variants, such as puzzles with missing pieces, unknown piece orientation, and more. [sent-61, score-1.465]
</p><p>22 The success of a GA is mainly dependent on choosing an appropriate chromosome representation, crossover operator, and fitness function. [sent-80, score-0.542]
</p><p>23 The chromosome representation and crossover operator must allow the merge of two good solutions to an even better solution. [sent-81, score-0.498]
</p><p>24 GA-based puzzle solver  A basic GA framework for solving the jigsaw puzzle problem is given by the pseudocode of Algorithm 1. [sent-84, score-1.37]
</p><p>25 In our case, a chromosome is an arrangement, or placement, of all the jigsaw puzzle pieces. [sent-86, score-0.983]
</p><p>26 In every generation the entire population is evaluated using a fitness function (described below), and a new population is (re)produced by the selection of and crossover application to chromosome pairs. [sent-88, score-0.795]
</p><p>27 The probability of selecting a certain chromosome by the method is directly proportionate to the value of its fitness function, as required. [sent-90, score-0.382]
</p><p>28 The fitness function The fitness function (described below) is evaluated for all chromosomes for the purpose of selection. [sent-96, score-0.422]
</p><p>29 In our GA, each chromosome represents a complete solution to the jigsaw puzzle problem (see Subsection 3. [sent-97, score-1.017]
</p><p>30 The problem variant at hand assumes no knowledge whatsoever of the original image and thus, the correctness of the absolute location of puzzle pieces cannot be estimated in a simple manner. [sent-101, score-0.878]
</p><p>31 We refer to a measure which predicts the likelihood of two pieces to be adjacent in the original image as compatibility. [sent-103, score-0.395]

</p><p>33 The dissimilarity measure relies on the premise that adjacent jigsaw pieces in the original image tend to share similar colors along their abutting edges, and thus, the sum (over all neighboring pixels) of squared color differences (over all color bands) should be minimal. [sent-111, score-0.726]

[sent-112, score-0.469]
</p><p>35 Since every chromosome in every generation must be evaluated, a fitness function must be relatively computationally-inexpensive. [sent-123, score-0.436]
</p><p>36 ××  Finally, the fitness function of a given chromosome is the sum of pairwise dissimilarities over all neighboring pieces (whose configuration is represented by the chromosome). [sent-126, score-0.733]

</p><p>39 (A piece is assigned a number according to its initial location in the given puzzle. [sent-155, score-0.384]
</p><p>40 A naive crossover operator with respect to the given representation will create a new child chromosome at random, such that each entry of the resulting matrix is the correspond-  ing cell of the first or second parent. [sent-160, score-0.536]
</p><p>41 This approach yields usually a child chromosome with duplicate and/or missing puzzle pieces, which makes of course an invalid solution to the problem. [sent-161, score-0.775]
</p><p>42 Recall, crossover is applied to two chromosomes selected due to their high fitness values, where the fitness function used is an overall pairwise compatibility measure of adjacent puzzle pieces. [sent-164, score-1.137]
</p><p>43 At best, the function rewards a correct placement of neighboring pieces next to each other, but it has no way of identifying the correct absolute location of a piece. [sent-165, score-0.529]
</p><p>44 Since the population starts out from a random piece placement and then gradually improves, it is reasonable to assume that over the generations some correctly assembled puzzle segments will emerge. [sent-166, score-1.106]

[sent-171, score-0.591]
</p><p>46 Note the detection of parts of the tower in both parents, which are then shifted and merged to the complete tower; shifting of images during kernel growing is due to piece position independence. [sent-172, score-0.45]
</p><p>47 two complete (different) arrangements of all puzzle pieces, the crossover operator constructs a child chromosome in a kernel-growing fashion, using both parents as ”consultants”. [sent-184, score-1.172]
</p><p>48 The operator starts with a single piece and gradually joins other pieces at available boundaries. [sent-185, score-0.854]
</p><p>49 New pieces may be joined only adjacently to existing pieces, so that the emerging image is always contiguous. [sent-186, score-0.375]
</p><p>50 The operator keeps adding pieces from a bank of available pieces until there are no more pieces left. [sent-187, score-1.203]
</p><p>51 Hence, every piece will appear exactly once in the resulting  image. [sent-188, score-0.405]
</p><p>52 Thus, by using every piece exactly once inside of a frame of the correct size, the operator is guaranteed of achieving a valid image. [sent-190, score-0.527]
</p><p>53 A key trait of the kernel-growing technique is the fact that the final absolute location of every piece is determined only once the kernel reaches its final size and the child chromosome is complete. [sent-192, score-0.748]
</p><p>54 Until that point, all pieces might be shifted, depending the kernel’s growth vector. [sent-193, score-0.398]
</p><p>55 The first piece, for example, might eventually be located at the lowerleft corner of the image, should the kernel grow only to the up and to the right, after this piece was assigned. [sent-194, score-0.407]
</p><p>56 Instead, the same first piece might ultimately be located at the center of the image, upper-right corner, or any other location. [sent-195, score-0.407]
</p><p>57 This change in the absolute location of each piece is illustrated in Figure 2, especially between phase (f) and phase (g) of the kernel-growing process, as all pieces are shifted to the right due to insertion of new pieces on the left. [sent-196, score-1.277]
</p><p>58 Now remains the question of which piece to select from the available pieces bank and where to locate it in the child. [sent-198, score-0.759]
</p><p>59 a partial image, we can mark all the boundaries where a new piece might be placed. [sent-201, score-0.407]
</p><p>60 A piece boundary is denoted by a pair (xi, R), consisting of the piece number and a spatial relation. [sent-202, score-0.788]
</p><p>61 First, given all existing boundaries, the operator checks whether there exists a piece boundary  for which both parents agree on a piece xj (meaning, both contain this piece in the spatial direction R of xi). [sent-204, score-1.487]
</p><p>62 If such a piece exists, then it is placed in the correct location. [sent-205, score-0.428]
</p><p>63 If the parents agree on two or more boundaries, one of them is chosen at random and the respective piece is assigned. [sent-206, score-0.558]
</p><p>64 Obviously, an already used piece cannot be (re)assigned, so any such piece is ignored as if the parents did not agree on that particular boundary. [sent-207, score-0.942]
</p><p>65 If there is no agreement between the parents on any piece at any boundary, the second phase begins. [sent-208, score-0.567]
</p><p>66 [17]; two pieces are said to be best-buddies if each piece considers the other as its most compatible piece. [sent-210, score-0.796]
</p><p>67 The pieces 111777667088  xi  and  xj  are said to best-buddies if  ∀xk ∈ Pieces, C(xi,  , R1) ≥ C(xi, xk , R1) and ∀xp ∈ Pieces, C(xj , xi , R2) ≥ C(xj , xp, R2) xj  (3)  where Pieces is the set of all given image pieces and R1 and R2 are ”complementary” spatial relations (e. [sent-211, score-0.902]
</p><p>68 In the second phase the operator checks whether one of the parents contains a piece xj in spatial relation R of xi which is also a best-buddy of xi in that relation. [sent-214, score-0.78]
</p><p>69 As before, if multiple best-buddy pieces are available, one is chosen at random. [sent-216, score-0.375]
</p><p>70 If a best-buddy piece is found but was already assigned, it is ignored and the search continues for  other best-buddy pieces. [sent-217, score-0.384]
</p><p>71 Finally, if no best-buddy piece exists, the operator randomly selects a boundary and assigns it the most compatible piece available. [sent-218, score-0.903]
</p><p>72 To introduce mutation in the first and last phase the operator places, with low probability, an available piece at random, instead of the most compatible relevant piece available. [sent-219, score-0.969]
</p><p>73 In summary, the operator uses repeatedly a three-phase procedure of piece selection and assignment, placing first agreed pieces, followed by best-buddy pieces and finally by the most compatible piece available (i. [sent-220, score-1.331]
</p><p>74 The procedure returns to the first phase after every piece assignment due to the prospective creation of new boundaries. [sent-224, score-0.449]
</p><p>75 –  Algorithm 2 Crossover operator simplified 1: If any available boundary meets the criterion of Phase 1 (both parents agree on a piece), place the piece there and goto (1); otherwise continue. [sent-226, score-0.724]
</p><p>76 2: If any available boundary meets the criterion of Phase 2 (one parent contains a best-buddy piece), place the piece there and goto (1); otherwise continue. [sent-227, score-0.514]
</p><p>77 3: Randomly choose a boundary, place the most compatible available piece there and goto (1). [sent-228, score-0.467]
</p><p>78 Here, since position independence of pieces is encouraged, the trait of interest is captured by a piece’s set of neighbors. [sent-232, score-0.438]
</p><p>79 Correct puzzle segments correspond to a correct placement of pieces next to each other. [sent-233, score-0.969]
</p><p>80 The notion that piece xi is in spatial relation R to piece xj is key to solving the jigsaw problem. [sent-234, score-1.164]
</p><p>81 Taking into account the random nature of the first generation, the procedure must actively seek the better traits of piece relations. [sent-236, score-0.426]
</p><p>82 Since a kernel-growing algorithm is used, some agreed pieces might ”prematurely” serve as most compatible pieces at another boundary and be subsequently disqualified for later use. [sent-240, score-0.872]
</p><p>83 Another option might be to just choose the most compatible piece in a greedy manner, or check if a best-buddy piece is available. [sent-243, score-0.853]
</p><p>84 Since piece placement in parents might be random and since even best-buddy pieces might not capture the correct match, we combine the two. [sent-244, score-1.033]
</p><p>85 The fact that two pieces are both best-buddies and are adjacent at a parent is a good indication for the validity of this match. [sent-245, score-0.437]
</p><p>86 The direct method has been repeatedly denounced [17] as being both less accurate and less meaningful due to its inability to cope with slightly shifted puzzle solutions. [sent-254, score-0.562]
</p><p>87 Note that a piece arrangement scoring 100% according to one of the methods is, by defi-  ×  nition, the full reconstruction of the original image and will also achieve a score of 100% when measured by the other method. [sent-256, score-0.402]

</p><p>89 The rest of the population is generated by the crossover operator described earlier with a mutation rate of 5%. [sent-266, score-0.395]
</p><p>90 Our solver gains a significant improvement of up to 21% (for the 540-piece puzzle set); for some puzzles, the improvement was even 30%. [sent-281, score-0.568]

<p>Author: Kilho Son, Eduardo B. Almeida, David B. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Thispaper introduces a novel approachfor reassembling pot sherds found at archaeological excavation sites, for the purpose ofreconstructing claypots that had been made on a wheel. These pots and the sherds into which they have broken are axially symmetric. The reassembly process can be viewed as 3D puzzle solving or generalized cylinder learning from broken fragments. The estimation exploits both local and semi-global geometric structure, thus making it a fundamental problem of geometry estimation from noisy fragments in computer vision and pattern recognition. The data used are densely digitized 3D laser scans of each fragment’s outer surface. The proposed reassembly system is automatic and functions when the pile of available fragments is from one or multiple pots, and even when pieces are missing from any pot. The geometric structure used are curves on the pot along which the surface had broken and the silhouette of a pot with respect to an axis, called axisprofile curve (APC). For reassembling multiple pots with or without missing pieces, our algorithm estimates the APC from each fragment, then reassembles into configurations the ones having distinctive APC.

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>4 0.048271894 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Bringing_Semantics_into_Focus_Using_Visual_Abstraction.html">73 cvpr-2013-Bringing Semantics into Focus Using Visual Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.</p><p>5 0.047022946 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Boundary_Detection_Benchmarking%3A_Beyond_F-Measures.html">72 cvpr-2013-Boundary Detection Benchmarking: Beyond F-Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Alan Yuille, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: For an ill-posed problem like boundary detection, human labeled datasets play a critical role. Compared with the active research on finding a better boundary detector to refresh the performance record, there is surprisingly little discussion on the boundary detection benchmark itself. The goal of this paper is to identify the potential pitfalls of today’s most popular boundary benchmark, BSDS 300. In the paper, we first introduce a psychophysical experiment to show that many of the “weak” boundary labels are unreliable and may contaminate the benchmark. Then we analyze the computation of f-measure and point out that the current benchmarking protocol encourages an algorithm to bias towards those problematic “weak” boundary labels. With this evidence, we focus on a new problem of detecting strong boundaries as one alternative. Finally, we assess the performances of 9 major algorithms on different ways of utilizing the dataset, suggesting new directions for improvements.</p><p>6 0.040577885 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Kilho Son, Eduardo B. Almeida, David B. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Thispaper introduces a novel approachfor reassembling pot sherds found at archaeological excavation sites, for the purpose ofreconstructing claypots that had been made on a wheel. These pots and the sherds into which they have broken are axially symmetric. The reassembly process can be viewed as 3D puzzle solving or generalized cylinder learning from broken fragments. The estimation exploits both local and semi-global geometric structure, thus making it a fundamental problem of geometry estimation from noisy fragments in computer vision and pattern recognition. The data used are densely digitized 3D laser scans of each fragment’s outer surface. The proposed reassembly system is automatic and functions when the pile of available fragments is from one or multiple pots, and even when pieces are missing from any pot. The geometric structure used are curves on the pot along which the surface had broken and the silhouette of a pot with respect to an axis, called axisprofile curve (APC). For reassembling multiple pots with or without missing pieces, our algorithm estimates the APC from each fragment, then reassembles into configurations the ones having distinctive APC. Further growth of configurations is based on adding remaining fragments such that their APC and break curves are consistent with those of a configuration. The method is novel, more robust and handles the largest numbers of fragments to date.</p><p>4 0.55593085 <a title="11-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph_Transduction_Learning_with_Connectivity_Constraints_with_Application_to_Multiple_Foreground_Cosegmentation.html">193 cvpr-2013-Graph Transduction Learning with Connectivity Constraints with Application to Multiple Foreground Cosegmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianyang Ma, Longin Jan Latecki</p><p>Abstract: The proposed approach is based on standard graph transduction, semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Its key novelty is the integration of global connectivity constraints into this framework. Although connectivity leads to higher order constraints and their number is an exponential, finding the most violated connectivity constraint can be done efficiently in polynomial time. Moreover, each such constraint can be represented as a linear inequality. Based on this fact, we design a cutting-plane algorithm to solve the integrated problem. It iterates between solving a convex quadraticproblem of labelpropagation with linear inequality constraints, and finding the most violated constraint. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a realistic and very challenging problem of cosegmentation of multiple foreground objects in photo collections in which the foreground objects are not present in all photos. The obtained results not only demonstrate performance boost induced by the connectivity constraints, but also show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.54241633 <a title="11-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Boundary_Detection_Benchmarking%3A_Beyond_F-Measures.html">72 cvpr-2013-Boundary Detection Benchmarking: Beyond F-Measures</a></p>

<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>3 0.62778616 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Li, Darren Cosker, Matthew Brown, Rui Tang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel non-rigid optical flow algorithm for dense image correspondence and non-rigid registration. The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs. We express this wholly within the optical flow optimization, and show its application in a novel coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all trials on the Garg et al. dataset, and top tier performance on the Middlebury evaluation.</p><p>4 0.61583561 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-scale_Curve_Detection_on_Surfaces.html">298 cvpr-2013-Multi-scale Curve Detection on Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>5 0.61578298 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Segmentation-Aware_Descriptors.html">112 cvpr-2013-Dense Segmentation-Aware Descriptors</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Trulls, Iasonas Kokkinos, Alberto Sanfeliu, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: In this work we exploit segmentation to construct appearance descriptors that can robustly deal with occlusion and background changes. For this, we downplay measurements coming from areas that are unlikely to belong to the same region as the descriptor’s center, as suggested by soft segmentation masks. Our treatment is applicable to any image point, i.e. dense, and its computational overhead is in the order of a few seconds. We integrate this idea with Dense SIFT, and also with Dense Scale and Rotation Invariant Descriptors (SID), delivering descriptors that are densely computable, invariant to scaling and rotation, and robust to background changes. We apply our approach to standard benchmarks on large displacement motion estimation using SIFT-flow and widebaseline stereo, systematically demonstrating that the introduction of segmentation yields clear improvements.</p><p>6 0.56722414 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Visual_Place_Recognition_with_Repetitive_Structures.html">456 cvpr-2013-Visual Place Recognition with Repetitive Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Vittal Premachandran, Ramakrishna Kakarala</p><p>Abstract: Propagating similarity information along the data manifold requires careful selection of local neighborhood. Selecting a “good” neighborhood in an unsupervised setting, given an affinity graph, has been a difficult task. The most common way to select a local neighborhood has been to use the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) selection criterion. However, it has the tendency to include noisy edges. In this paper, we propose a way to select a robust neighborhood using the consensus of multiple rounds of k-NNs. We explain how using consensus information can give better control over neighborhood selection. We also explain in detail the problems with another recently proposed neighborhood selection criteria, i.e., Dominant Neighbors, and show that our method is immune to those problems. Finally, we show the results from experiments in which we compare our method to other neighborhood selection approaches. The results corroborate our claims that consensus ofk-NNs does indeed help in selecting more robust and stable localities.</p><p>4 0.11269543 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sanja Fidler, Jian Yao, Raquel Urtasun, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Recent trends in semantic image segmentation have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in aiding semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we “plug-in ” human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model (CRF) on the MSRC dataset. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much “head room ” there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset.</p><p>5 0.10466062 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Winding_Number_for_Region-Boundary_Consistent_Salient_Contour_Extraction.html">468 cvpr-2013-Winding Number for Region-Boundary Consistent Salient Contour Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yansheng Ming, Hongdong Li, Xuming He</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to extract salient closed contours from an image. For this vision task, both region segmentation cues (e.g. color/texture homogeneity) and boundary detection cues (e.g. local contrast, edge continuity and contour closure) play important and complementary roles. In this paper we show how to combine both cues in a unified framework. The main focus is given to how to maintain the consistency (compatibility) between the region cues and the boundary cues. To this ends, we introduce the use of winding number–a well-known concept in topology–as a powerful mathematical device. By this device, the region-boundary consistency is represented as a set of simple linear relationships. Our method is applied to the figure-ground segmentation problem. The experiments show clearly improved results.</p><p>6 0.09691672 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jia Xu, Maxwell D. Collins, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of interactive segmentation and contour completion for multiple objects. The form of constraints our model incorporates are those coming from user scribbles (interior or exterior constraints) as well as information regarding the topology of the 2-D space after partitioning (number of closed contours desired). We discuss how concepts from discrete calculus and a simple identity using the Euler characteristic of a planar graph can be utilized to derive a practical algorithm for this problem. We also present specialized branch and bound methods for the case of single contour completion under such constraints. On an extensive dataset of ∼ 1000 images, our experimOenn tasn suggest vthea dt a assmetal ol fa m∼ou 1n0t0 of ismidaeg knowledge can give strong improvements over fully unsupervised contour completion methods.

<p>Author: Jordi Pont-Tuset, Ferran Marques</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised evaluation of image segmentation algorithms. First, it surveys and structures the measures used to compare the segmentation results with a ground truth database; and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the goodness of these measures, it defines three quantitative meta-measures involving six state of the art segmentation methods. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation. We make the datasets and code of all the measures publicly available.</p><p>6 0.72777587 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Color_Boundary_Detection_with_Color-Opponent_Mechanisms.html">140 cvpr-2013-Efficient Color Boundary Detection with Color-Opponent Mechanisms</a></p>

<p>Author: Shmuel Asafi, Daniel Cohen-Or</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to constrained clustering which treats the constraints as features. Our method augments the original feature space with additional dimensions, each of which derived from a given Cannot-link constraints. The specified Cannot-link pair gets extreme coordinates values, and the rest of the points get coordinate values that express their spatial influence from the specified constrained pair. After augmenting all the new features, a standard unconstrained clustering algorithm can be performed, like k-means or spectral clustering. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for active semi-supervised learning applied to image segmentation and compare it to alternative methods. We also evaluate the performance of our method on the four most commonly evaluated datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.</p><p>2 0.79053438 <a title="72-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Detect_Partially_Overlapping_Instances.html">264 cvpr-2013-Learning to Detect Partially Overlapping Instances</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Arteta, Victor Lempitsky, J. Alison Noble, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this work is to detect all instances of a class (such as cells or people) in an image. The instances may be partially overlapping and clustered, and hence quite challenging for traditional detectors, which aim at localizing individual instances. Our approach is to propose a set of candidate regions, and then select regions based on optimizing a global classification score, subject to the constraint that the selected regions are non-overlapping. Our novel contribution is to extend standard object detection by introducing separate classes for tuples of objects into the detection process. For example, our detector can pick a region containing two or three object instances, while assigning such region an appropriate label. We show that this formulation can be learned within the structured output SVM framework, and that the inference in such model can be accomplished using dynamic programming on a tree structured region graph. Furthermore, the learning only requires weak annotations – a dot on each instance. The improvement resulting from the addition of the capability to detect tuples of objects is demonstrated on quite disparate data sets: fluorescence microscopy images and UCSD pedestrians.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78876227 <a title="72-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Boundary_Detection_Benchmarking%3A_Beyond_F-Measures.html">72 cvpr-2013-Boundary Detection Benchmarking: Beyond F-Measures</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Wang, Rongrong Ji, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understanding the semantics of point clouds in a wide variety of applications. However, point cloud labeling remains an open problem, due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient 3D point labels towards training effective classifiers. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the existing massive 2D semantic labeled datasets from decadelong community efforts, such as ImageNet and LabelMe, and a novel “cross-domain ” label propagation approach. Our proposed method consists of two major novel components, Exemplar SVM based label propagation, which effectively addresses the cross-domain issue, and a graphical model based contextual refinement incorporating 3D constraints. Most importantly, the entire process does not require any training data from the target scenes, also with good scalability towards large scale applications. We evaluate our approach on the well-known Cornell Point Cloud Dataset, achieving much greater efficiency and comparable accuracy even without any 3D training data. Our approach shows further major gains in accuracy when the training data from the target scenes is used, outperforming state-ofthe-art approaches with far better efficiency.</p><p>5 0.7632972 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>6 0.76059318 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Rigid_Motion_Segmentation_via_Incrementally-Complex_Local_Models.html">170 cvpr-2013-Fast Rigid Motion Segmentation via Incrementally-Complex Local Models</a></p>

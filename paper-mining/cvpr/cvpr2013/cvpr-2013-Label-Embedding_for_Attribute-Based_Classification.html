<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images). This approach also leads to state-ofthe-art performance on the zero-shot learning task on AwA.</p><p>3 0.30953598 <a title="241-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Complex_Event_Detection_via_Multi-source_Video_Attributes.html">85 cvpr-2013-Complex Event Detection via Multi-source Video Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.30116352 <a title="241-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>5 0.29130465 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>6 0.28561363 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Catherine Wah, Serge Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in computer vision has addressed zero-shot learning or unseen class detection, which involves categorizing objects without observing any training examples. However, these problems assume that attributes or defining characteristics of these unobserved classes are known, leveraging this information at test time to detect an unseen class. We address the more realistic problem of detecting categories that do not appear in the dataset in any form. We denote such a category as an unfamiliar class; it is neither observed at train time, nor do we possess any knowledge regarding its relationships to attributes. This problem is one that has received limited attention within the computer vision community. In this work, we propose a novel ap. ucs d .edu Unfamiliar? or?not?

<p>Author: Babak Saleh, Ali Farhadi, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: When describing images, humans tend not to talk about the obvious, but rather mention what they find interesting. We argue that abnormalities and deviations from typicalities are among the most important components that form what is worth mentioning. In this paper we introduce the abnormality detection as a recognition problem and show how to model typicalities and, consequently, meaningful deviations from prototypical properties of categories. Our model can recognize abnormalities and report the main reasons of any recognized abnormality. We also show that abnormality predictions can help image categorization. We introduce the abnormality detection dataset and show interesting results on how to reason about abnormalities.</p><p>6 0.8734507 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Zijia Lin, Guiguang Ding, Mingqing Hu, Jianmin Wang, Xiaojun Ye</p><p>Abstract: Though widely utilized for facilitating image management, user-provided image tags are usually incomplete and insufficient to describe the whole semantic content of corresponding images, resulting in performance degradations in tag-dependent applications and thus necessitating effective tag completion methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme denoted as LSR for automatic image tag completion via image-specific and tag-specific Linear Sparse Reconstructions. Given an incomplete initial tagging matrix with each row representing an image and each column representing a tag, LSR optimally reconstructs each image (i.e. row) and each tag (i.e. column) with remaining ones under constraints of sparsity, considering imageimage similarity, image-tag association and tag-tag concurrence. Then both image-specific and tag-specific reconstruction values are normalized and merged for selecting missing related tags. Extensive experiments conducted on both benchmark dataset and web images well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LSR.</p><p>2 0.84916049 <a title="241-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-In_Defense_of_3D-Label_Stereo.html">219 cvpr-2013-In Defense of 3D-Label Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: It is commonly believed that higher order smoothness should be modeled using higher order interactions. For example, 2nd order derivatives for deformable (active) contours are represented by triple cliques. Similarly, the 2nd order regularization methods in stereo predominantly use MRF models with scalar (1D) disparity labels and triple clique interactions. In this paper we advocate a largely overlooked alternative approach to stereo where 2nd order surface smoothness is represented by pairwise interactions with 3D-labels, e.g. tangent planes. This general paradigm has been criticized due to perceived computational complexity of optimization in higher-dimensional label space. Contrary to popular beliefs, we demonstrate that representing 2nd order surface smoothness with 3D labels leads to simpler optimization problems with (nearly) submodular pairwise interactions. Our theoretical and experimental re- sults demonstrate advantages over state-of-the-art methods for 2nd order smoothness stereo. 1</p><p>3 0.83652633 <a title="241-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Megastereo%3A_Constructing_High-Resolution_Stereo_Panoramas.html">283 cvpr-2013-Megastereo: Constructing High-Resolution Stereo Panoramas</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Richardt, Yael Pritch, Henning Zimmer, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung</p><p>Abstract: We present a solution for generating high-quality stereo panoramas at megapixel resolutions. While previous approaches introduced the basic principles, we show that those techniques do not generalise well to today’s high image resolutions and lead to disturbing visual artefacts. As our first contribution, we describe the necessary correction steps and a compact representation for the input images in order to achieve a highly accurate approximation to the required ray space. Our second contribution is a flow-based upsampling of the available input rays which effectively resolves known aliasing issues like stitching artefacts. The required rays are generated on the fly to perfectly match the desired output resolution, even for small numbers of input images. In addition, the upsampling is real-time and enables direct interactive control over the desired stereoscopic depth effect. In combination, our contributions allow the generation of stereoscopic panoramas at high output resolutions that are virtually free of artefacts such as seams, stereo discontinuities, vertical parallax and other mono-/stereoscopic shape distortions. Our process is robust, and other types of multiperspective panoramas, such as linear panoramas, can also benefit from our contributions. We show various comparisons and high-resolution results.</p><p>4 0.82125914 <a title="241-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Boundary_Cues_for_3D_Object_Shape_Recovery.html">71 cvpr-2013-Boundary Cues for 3D Object Shape Recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Karsch, Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Jonathan T. Barron, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: Early work in computer vision considered a host of geometric cues for both shape reconstruction [11] and recognition [14]. However, since then, the vision community has focused heavily on shading cues for reconstruction [1], and moved towards data-driven approaches for recognition [6]. In this paper, we reconsider these perhaps overlooked “boundary” cues (such as self occlusions and folds in a surface), as well as many other established constraints for shape reconstruction. In a variety of user studies and quantitative tasks, we evaluate how well these cues inform shape reconstruction (relative to each other) in terms of both shape quality and shape recognition. Our findings suggest many new directions for future research in shape reconstruction, such as automatic boundary cue detection and relaxing assumptions in shape from shading (e.g. orthographic projection, Lambertian surfaces).</p><p>5 0.82098842 <a title="241-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-In_Defense_of_Sparsity_Based_Face_Recognition.html">220 cvpr-2013-In Defense of Sparsity Based Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu, Jun Guo</p><p>Abstract: The success of sparse representation based classification (SRC) has largely boosted the research of sparsity based face recognition in recent years. A prevailing view is that the sparsity based face recognition performs well only when the training images have been carefully controlled and the number of samples per class is sufficiently large. This paper challenges the prevailing view by proposing a “prototype plus variation ” representation model for sparsity based face recognition. Based on the new model, a Superposed SRC (SSRC), in which the dictionary is assembled by the class centroids and the sample-to-centroid differences, leads to a substantial improvement on SRC. The experiments results on AR, FERET and FRGC databases validate that, if the proposed prototype plus variation representation model is applied, sparse coding plays a crucial role in face recognition, and performs well even when the dictionary bases are collected under uncontrolled conditions and only a single sample per classes is available.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.80438489 <a title="241-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding_for_Attribute-Based_Classification.html">241 cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding for Attribute-Based Classification</a></p>

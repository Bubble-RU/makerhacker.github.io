</p><p>3 In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. [sent-8, score-0.485]
</p><p>4 Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. [sent-9, score-0.368]
</p><p>5 Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. [sent-10, score-0.474]
</p><p>6 Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods. [sent-11, score-0.856]
</p><p>7 Introduction The exact and approximate graph matching problem is of great interest in computer vision due to its numerous applications in areas such as 2D and 3D image registration, object recognition and biomedical identification, and object tracking in video sequences. [sent-13, score-0.323]
</p><p>8 Algorithms that can take advantage of this information to infer the correspondences for the rest of the graph nodes are highly desirable. [sent-16, score-0.476]
</p><p>9 This problem setup, however, is different from our setting where we only have two graphs with partially known correspondences; in a sense, these known correspondences constitute our “training data”. [sent-18, score-0.279]
</p><p>10 In this work we provide a method for effectively incor-  porating known correspondences into the commonly used integer quadratic program formulation of graph matching. [sent-20, score-0.373]
</p><p>11 Specifically, our main contribution is to devise a new first order compatibility term between two nodes of different graphs. [sent-21, score-0.431]
</p><p>12 Our method uses the recently proposed oneparameter family of node signatures called Laplacian Family Signatures (LFS) [11], which provide a feature vector (signature) for each node based solely on the node’s structural position within the graph. [sent-22, score-0.661]
</p><p>13 Since graph matching is performed using the dissimilarity/distance between these signatures, we derive the distance between the generic signatures. [sent-24, score-0.35]
</p><p>14 As a result of this manipulation, we find that the entire process of computing and comparing these generic signatures can be encoded into a single proximity matrix. [sent-25, score-0.483]
</p><p>15 We then introduce an algorithm to learn this proximity matrix from the knowledge of provided correct correspondences. [sent-26, score-0.26]
</p><p>16 This is done by requiring anchor nodes in one graph to correspond near to their known partners in the other and to be far from non-correspondences, which can be set up as a max-margin problem [28]. [sent-27, score-0.718]
</p><p>17 First, our max-margin formulation makes an effective use of the scarce training data: even a small number of known correspondences (two anchor correspondences are used in all of our experiments) leads to a large number of constraints  on the proximity matrix. [sent-29, score-0.707]
</p><p>18 Second, our formulation results in learning a proximity matrix that is relatively small (tens 222999000644  by tens in the examples shown) which allows us to reliably learn it without over-fitting. [sent-30, score-0.279]
</p><p>19 Our goal is to find an approximate matching between these two graphs based solely on their structural properties (e. [sent-36, score-0.364]
</p><p>20 be the subsets of nodes tNhaatm are k lenotw Un ⊂to V be a nind correspondence; we will refer to these as anchor node sets for G and G? [sent-42, score-0.692]
</p><p>21 We follow the commonly used integer quadratic program (IQP) formulation for the graph matching problem based on two kinds of compatibility terms. [sent-44, score-0.622]
</p><p>22 The first order compatibility d(i, a) encodes similarity of a node i ∈ V in graph G tboi a yn do(dei, a ∈ e nVco? [sent-45, score-0.519]
</p><p>23 de Fro compatibility eds( ii,, j,a, bV) measures ∈the V compatibility of matching the node pair (i, j) to node pair (a, b). [sent-50, score-0.836]
</p><p>24 Our main goal in this paper is to incorporate the knowl-  edge of the anchor correspondences into the first order compatibility term which will be expressed as follows: d(i, a)  = cBdB(i, a) + capdap(i, a),  where cB and cap are some weights. [sent-51, score-0.654]
</p><p>25 The first term dB (i, a) is based on our formulation of LFS proximity matrix and is presented in Section 3. [sent-52, score-0.259]
</p><p>26 The construction of the second term dap(i, a) which involves the heat kernel is explained in Section 3. [sent-54, score-0.449]
</p><p>27 The matching scheme incorporating both the first order and second order compatibility functions is presented in Section 4. [sent-56, score-0.343]
</p><p>28 Related Work Our family of signatures are closely related to nodebased signatures on graphs, different forms of which has already been considered, e. [sent-59, score-0.605]
</p><p>29 al [24] proposed the heat kernel signature (HKS) for application of shape matching in geometry processing. [sent-63, score-0.706]
</p><p>30 Their signature is based on the simulated heat diffusion process on manifold. [sent-64, score-0.546]
</p><p>31 Among the pioneering work is Umeyama’s [25] weighted graph matching algorithm from a  decomposition of adjacency matrices. [sent-70, score-0.461]
</p><p>32 [20] used the steady state of the Markov transition matrix to order the nodes and match using edit distances. [sent-74, score-0.304]
</p><p>33 Later in [21], the same authors proposed to use the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix to serialize the graph nodes for matching. [sent-75, score-0.591]
</p><p>34 al [19] considered using the Fiedler vector together with the proximity to the perimeter of the graph to partition the graph into disconnected components for a hierarchical matching. [sent-77, score-0.533]
</p><p>35 [4] constructed a reweighed random walk similar to personalized PageRank on the association graph with the addition of an absorbing node, and used the quasi-stationary distribution to find a matching. [sent-80, score-0.246]
</p><p>36 [6] simulated a quantum walk on the auxiliary graph and used the particle probability of each auxiliary node as the cost of assignment for a bipartite matching. [sent-83, score-0.457]
</p><p>37 Anchor Based Compatibility In this section we discuss the construction and computation of two kinds of first order compatibility terms that take advantage of known correspondences between anchor nodes. [sent-105, score-0.625]
</p><p>38 The Laplacian Family Signatures (LFS) for a node u ∈ V iTs a one-parameter family onaft sutrreusct (LurFalS n) fodore descriptors that is defined by  φk}|kV= |1  su(t) =  ? [sent-126, score-0.208]
</p><p>39 Special h(t; λk) of different forms will result in the heat kernel signature (HKS) [24] when h(t; λk) = exp(−tλk), the wave kernel signature (WKS) [1] when h(t; λk) = or the wavelet signature if h(t; λk) a)d =mit esx some special behavior as described in [10]. [sent-129, score-0.938]
</p><p>40 These signatures describe a given node’s structural relationship to its neighborhood. [sent-130, score-0.304]
</p><p>41 For example, HKS has an interpretation in terms of a simulated heat diffusion process: for each node, this signature captures the amount of heat left at the node at various times (here t) assuming that a unit amount is put on the node initially (t = 0). [sent-131, score-1.189]
</p><p>42 These signatures are naturally intrinsic, namely if two graphs are isomorphic, then the signatures of corresponding nodes are the same; the signatures are also stable under small perturbations [11]. [sent-132, score-1.272]
</p><p>43 exp(−(t−lo2gσ2 λk)2),  The above discussion suggests using these signatures as node attributes to design first order compatibility terms for if the signatures of two nodes from the two graphs are very different, then these vertices are less likely to be in correspondence. [sent-133, score-1.282]
</p><p>44 However, such an approach does not take into account the given anchor correspondences, because the form of the function h(t; λk) is explicitly provided beforehand. [sent-134, score-0.336]

</p><p>48 1  Learning the Proximity Matrix  Here we explain how to learn the proximity matrix B from the knowledge of anchor nodes. [sent-263, score-0.566]
</p><p>49 A good proximity matrix B should move closer node pairs that correspond, and move away nodes that are non-matches. [sent-264, score-0.586]
</p><p>50 In our graph matching setting, Ω(k, j) could be the shortest distance over the graph, or the heat kernel as described in Section 3. [sent-312, score-0.743]
</p><p>51 2 (we used heat kernel in our experiments as it has been shown to be more robust than the adjacency matrix [11] and, hence, shortest distance). [sent-313, score-0.605]
</p><p>52 Heat Kernel with Anchor Nodes In this subsection we introduce the second term appear-  ing in our first order compatibility measure. [sent-371, score-0.224]
</p><p>53 This term is based on the heat diffusion process on graph G. [sent-372, score-0.581]
</p><p>54 Specifically, consider the graph heat kernel kt (u, v), which measures the amount of heat transferred from node u to node v after time t, assuming a unit amount was placed at u in the beginning (t = 0). [sent-373, score-1.299]
</p><p>55 The heat kernel has the following representation in terms of the eigen-decomposition of the graph Laplacian: kt(u,v) = ? [sent-374, score-0.595]
</p><p>56 k  We use the heat kernel value of anchor nodes at a given node as another first order constraint. [sent-377, score-1.112]
</p><p>57 Namely, for any node v of graph G define the heat kernel distance to anchor nodes as  daHp(v)  = ? [sent-378, score-1.287]

</p><p>60 Moreover, the heat kernel is naturally intrinsic (if two graphs are isomorphic, their corresponding heat kernels are the same) and it is stable under small perturbations [11]. [sent-403, score-0.976]
</p><p>61 Matching Scheme Here we formulate the graph matching as an integer quadratic program (IQP). [sent-405, score-0.427]

</p><p>65 (a, b) | , and this gives a measure of how compatible matching nodes iand a is with matching j and b. [sent-430, score-0.503]
</p><p>66 As has been discussed in [11], the heat kernel can be thought of as a noise tolerant  ×  approximation of the adjacency matrix, and is stable under small perturbations. [sent-431, score-0.558]
</p><p>67 Thus, our second order proximity term can be thought as a generalization of the commonly used adjacency-based second order term. [sent-432, score-0.212]
</p><p>68 Combining all this information, we construct a compatibility matrix W ∈ R(|V |−|U|)(|V? [sent-433, score-0.242]
</p><p>69 In our experiments, we selected a recently proposed algorithm, reweighed random walk matching (RRWM) [4]. [sent-459, score-0.219]
</p><p>70 Experiments We tested our approach on three different datasets: 1) synthetically generated random graphs; 2) CMU Hotel sequence for large baseline matching; and 3) pose house sequence from [18] for large rotation angle matching. [sent-463, score-0.225]
</p><p>71 Synthetic Random Graphs In this section, following the experimental protocol of [4], we synthetically generated random graphs and performed a comparative study. [sent-466, score-0.213]

</p><p>75 CMU Hotel Sequence In this experiment, we test our descriptors on the CMU Hotel sequence, which is widely used in performance evaluation of graph matching algorithms as a wide baseline dataset. [sent-484, score-0.323]

</p><p>77 As can be seen the matching performance was improved when heat kernel is used in lieu of the adjacency matrix, because the noise tolerance property of the former smoothes out the effect of deformation noise. [sent-496, score-0.706]
</p><p>78 With the addon effect of proximity matrix B and dap(i, a), furthermore, the matching performance was much improved. [sent-497, score-0.378]
</p><p>79 2 (b,c) showes an example of the matching between the 20th and the 90th frame of the sequence (yellow lines are correct matches and red lines are wrong matches). [sent-499, score-0.357]
</p><p>80 In the second part of this experiment, we select to test the influence of the number of anchor nodes on the average matching rate. [sent-501, score-0.691]
</p><p>81 We intentionally drop off the term dap to reduce the side effect, i. [sent-502, score-0.253]
</p><p>82 We increase the number of anchor nodes and compare the matching performance in otherwise the same setting. [sent-505, score-0.691]

</p><p>84 However, the marginal performance gain seems to have a drop-off with the increase of the number of anchor nodes, since the matching rate gap between |U| = 10 and |U| = 5 sisi nmceuc thhe es mmaaltclehri tnhga nra tthea gta abpet bweetwenee e| nU | U =| =5 a 1n0d a| nUd| =U |2 .

</p><p>88 It can been seen that extreme pan angles gave poor results while mid range pan angles yield matches with much higher accuracy while matching accuracy was not much influenced by the difference in tilt angles. [sent-521, score-0.434]

Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching.

<p>Author: Sid Yingze Bao, Manmohan Chandraker, Yuanqing Lin, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present a dense reconstruction approach that overcomes the drawbacks of traditional multiview stereo by incorporating semantic information in the form of learned category-level shape priors and object detection. Given training data comprised of 3D scans and images of objects from various viewpoints, we learn a prior comprised of a mean shape and a set of weighted anchor points. The former captures the commonality of shapes across the category, while the latter encodes similarities between instances in the form of appearance and spatial consistency. We propose robust algorithms to match anchor points across instances that enable learning a mean shape for the category, even with large shape variations across instances. We model the shape of an object instance as a warped version of the category mean, along with instance-specific details. Given multiple images of an unseen instance, we collate information from 2D object detectors to align the structure from motion point cloud with the mean shape, which is subsequently warped and refined to approach the actual shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is general enough to learn semantic priors for different object categories, yet powerful enough to reconstruct individual shapes with large variations.

Dense matching methods typically enforce both appearance agreement between matched pixels as well as geometric smoothness between neighboring pixels. Whereas the prevailing approaches operate at the pixel level, we propose a pyramid graph model that simultaneously regularizes match consistency at multiple spatial extents—ranging from an entire image, to coarse grid cells, to every single pixel. This novel regularization substantially improves pixel-level matching in the face of challenging image variations, while the “deformable ” aspect of our model overcomes the strict rigidity of traditional spatial pyramids.

<p>Author: Quanshi Zhang, Xuan Song, Xiaowei Shao, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Huijing Zhao</p><p>Abstract: An object model base that covers a large number of object categories is of great value for many computer vision tasks. As artifacts are usually designed to have various textures, their structure is the primary distinguishing feature between different categories. Thus, how to encode this structural information and how to start the model learning with a minimum of human labeling become two key challenges for the construction of the model base. We design a graphical model that uses object edges to represent object structures, and this paper aims to incrementally learn this category model from one labeled object and a number of casually captured scenes. However, the incremental model learning may be biased due to the limited human labeling. Therefore, we propose a new strategy that uses the depth information in RGBD images to guide the model learning for object detection in ordinary RGB images. In experiments, the proposed method achieves superior performance as good as the supervised methods that require the labeling of all target objects.</p><p>5 0.12483762 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>6 0.12320176 <a title="192-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>

Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching.

<p>Author: Feng Zhou, Fernando De_la_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching (GM) is a fundamental problem in computer science, and it has been successfully applied to many problems in computer vision. Although widely used, existing GM algorithms cannot incorporate global consistence among nodes, which is a natural constraint in computer vision problems. This paper proposes deformable graph matching (DGM), an extension of GM for matching graphs subject to global rigid and non-rigid geometric constraints. The key idea of this work is a new factorization of the pair-wise affinity matrix. This factorization decouples the affinity matrix into the local structure of each graph and the pair-wise affinity edges. Besides the ability to incorporate global geometric transformations, this factorization offers three more benefits. First, there is no need to compute the costly (in space and time) pair-wise affinity matrix. Second, it provides a unified view of many GM methods and extends the standard iterative closest point algorithm. Third, it allows to use the path-following optimization algorithm that leads to improved optimization strategies and matching performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real databases illustrate how DGM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for GM.

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>4 0.71446085 <a title="192-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Consensus_of_k-NNs_for_Robust_Neighborhood_Selection_on_Graph-Based_Manifolds.html">91 cvpr-2013-Consensus of k-NNs for Robust Neighborhood Selection on Graph-Based Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Vittal Premachandran, Ramakrishna Kakarala</p><p>Abstract: Propagating similarity information along the data manifold requires careful selection of local neighborhood. Selecting a “good” neighborhood in an unsupervised setting, given an affinity graph, has been a difficult task. The most common way to select a local neighborhood has been to use the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) selection criterion. However, it has the tendency to include noisy edges. In this paper, we propose a way to select a robust neighborhood using the consensus of multiple rounds of k-NNs. We explain how using consensus information can give better control over neighborhood selection. We also explain in detail the problems with another recently proposed neighborhood selection criteria, i.e., Dominant Neighbors, and show that our method is immune to those problems. Finally, we show the results from experiments in which we compare our method to other neighborhood selection approaches. The results corroborate our claims that consensus ofk-NNs does indeed help in selecting more robust and stable localities.</p><p>5 0.70393062 <a title="192-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>

<p>Author: Austin Abrams, Kylia Miskell, Robert Pless</p><p>Abstract: Shadows encode a powerful geometric cue: if one pixel casts a shadow onto another, then the two pixels are colinear with the lighting direction. Given many images over many lighting directions, this constraint can be leveraged to recover the depth of a scene from a single viewpoint. For outdoor scenes with solar illumination, we term this the episolar constraint, which provides a convex optimization to solve for the sparse depth of a scene from shadow correspondences, a method to reduce the search space when finding shadow correspondences, and a method to geometrically calibrate a camera using shadow constraints. Our method constructs a dense network of nonlocal constraints which complements recent work on outdoor photometric stereo and cloud based cues for 3D. We demonstrate results across a variety of time-lapse sequences from webcams “in . wu st l. edu (b)(c) the wild.”</p><p>3 0.76129174 <a title="192-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_by_Associating_Ambiguously_Labeled_Images.html">261 cvpr-2013-Learning by Associating Ambiguously Labeled Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Zinan Zeng, Shijie Xiao, Kui Jia, Tsung-Han Chan, Shenghua Gao, Dong Xu, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of learning classifiers from ambiguously labeled images. For instance, in the collection of new images, each image contains some samples of interest (e.g., human faces), and its associated caption has labels with the true ones included, while the samplelabel association is unknown. The task is to learn classifiers from these ambiguously labeled images and generalize to new images. An essential consideration here is how to make use of the information embedded in the relations between samples and labels, both within each image and across the image set. To this end, we propose a novel framework to address this problem. Our framework is motivated by the observation that samples from the same class repetitively appear in the collection of ambiguously labeled training images, while they are just ambiguously labeled in each image. If we can identify samples of the same class from each image and associate them across the image set, the matrix formed by the samples from the same class would be ideally low-rank. By leveraging such a low-rank assump- tion, we can simultaneously optimize a partial permutation matrix (PPM) for each image, which is formulated in order to exploit all information between samples and labels in a principled way. The obtained PPMs can be readily used to assign labels to samples in training images, and then a standard SVM classifier can be trained and used for unseen data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p><p>4 0.74869204 <a title="192-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Sub-categorization.html">134 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Sub-categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Minh Hoai, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this work is to learn sub-categories. Rather than casting this as a problem of unsupervised clustering, we investigate a weakly supervised approach using both positive and negative samples of the category. We make the following contributions: (i) we introduce a new model for discriminative sub-categorization which determines cluster membership for positive samples whilst simultaneously learning a max-margin classifier to separate each cluster from the negative samples; (ii) we show that this model does not suffer from the degenerate cluster problem that afflicts several competing methods (e.g., Latent SVM and Max-Margin Clustering); (iii) we show that the method is able to discover interpretable sub-categories in various datasets. The model is evaluated experimentally over various datasets, and itsperformance advantages over k-means and Latent SVM are demonstrated. We also stress test the model and show its resilience in discovering sub-categories as the parameters are varied.</p><p>5 0.74444246 <a title="192-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Visual_Proxemics%3A_Recognizing_Human_Interactions_in_3D_from_a_Single_Image.html">4 cvpr-2013-3D Visual Proxemics: Recognizing Human Interactions in 3D from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Ishani Chakraborty, Hui Cheng, Omar Javed</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified framework for detecting and classifying people interactions in unconstrained user generated images. 1 Unlike previous approaches that directly map people/face locations in 2D image space into features for classification, we first estimate camera viewpoint and people positions in 3D space and then extract spatial configuration features from explicit 3D people positions. This approach has several advantages. First, it can accurately estimate relative distances and orientations between people in 3D. Second, it encodes spatial arrangements of people into a richer set of shape descriptors than afforded in 2D. Our 3D shape descriptors are invariant to camera pose variations often seen in web images and videos. The proposed approach also estimates camera pose and uses it to capture the intent of the photo. To achieve accurate 3D people layout estimation, we develop an algorithm that robustly fuses semantic constraints about human interpositions into a linear camera model. This enables our model to handle large variations in people size, heights (e.g. age) and poses. An accurate 3D layout also allows us to construct features informed by Proxemics that improves our semantic classification. To characterize the human interaction space, we introduce visual proxemes; a set of prototypical patterns that represent commonly occurring social interactions in events. We train a discriminative classifier that classifies 3D arrangements of people into visual proxemes and quantitatively evaluate the performance on a large, challenging dataset.</p><p>6 0.73196542 <a title="192-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-stage_Feature_Learning.html">328 cvpr-2013-Pedestrian Detection with Unsupervised Multi-stage Feature Learning</a></p>

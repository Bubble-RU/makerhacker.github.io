<p>Author: Lili Tao, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on a non-linear manifold learning technique is proposed to recover 3D nonrigid structures from 2D image sequences captured by a single camera. Most ofthe existing approaches assume that 3D shapes can be accurately modelled in a linear subspace. These techniques perform well when the deformations are relatively small or simple, but fail when more complex deformations need to be recovered. The non-linear deformations are often observed in highly flexible objects for which the use of the linear model is impractical. A specific type of shape variations might be governed by only a small number of parameters, therefore can be wellrepresented in a low dimensional manifold. We learn a nonlinear shape prior using diffusion maps method. The key contribution in this paper is the introduction of the shape prior that constrain the reconstructed shapes to lie in the learned manifold. The proposed methodology has been validated quantitatively and qualitatively on 2D points sequences projected from the 3D motion capture data and real 2D video sequences. The comparisons oftheproposed man- ifold based method against several state-of-the-art techniques are shown on different types of deformable objects.</p><p>3 0.31035572 <a title="113-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Procrustean_Normal_Distribution_for_Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion.html">341 cvpr-2013-Procrustean Normal Distribution for Non-rigid Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Minsik Lee, Jungchan Cho, Chong-Ho Choi, Songhwai Oh</p><p>Abstract: Non-rigid structure from motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which is yet to be solved satisfactorily. The main difficulty of the problem lies in choosing the right constraints for the solution. In this paper, we propose new constraints that are more effective for non-rigid shape recovery. Unlike the other proposals which have mainly focused on restricting the deformation space using rank constraints, our proposal constrains the motion parameters so that the 3D shapes are most closely aligned to each other, which makes the rank constraints unnecessary. Based on these constraints, we define a new class ofprobability distribution called the Procrustean normal distribution and propose a new NRSfM algorithm, EM-PND. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, and it works well even if there is no temporal dependence between the observed samples.</p><p>4 0.19065873 <a title="113-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Articulated objects represent an important class ofobjects in our everyday environment. Automatic detection of the type of articulated or otherwise restricted motion and extraction of the corresponding motion parameters are therefore of high value, e.g. in order to augment an otherwise static 3D reconstruction with dynamic semantics, such as rotation axes and allowable translation directions for certain rigid parts or objects. Hence, in this paper, a novel theory to analyse relative transformations between two motion-restricted parts will be presented. The analysis is based on linear subspaces spanned by relative transformations. Moreover, a signature for relative transformations will be introduced which uniquely specifies the type of restricted motion encoded in these relative transformations. This theoretic framework enables the derivation of novel algebraic constraints, such as low-rank constraints for subsequent rotations around two fixed axes for example. Lastly, given the type of restricted motion as predicted by the signature, the paper shows how to extract all the motion parameters with matrix manipulations from linear algebra. Our theory is verified on several real data sets, such as a rotating blackboard or a wheel rolling on the floor amongst others.</p><p>5 0.18743029 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Rigid_Motion_Segmentation_via_Incrementally-Complex_Local_Models.html">170 cvpr-2013-Fast Rigid Motion Segmentation via Incrementally-Complex Local Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Fernando Flores-Mangas, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: The problem of rigid motion segmentation of trajectory data under orthography has been long solved for nondegenerate motions in the absence of noise. But because real trajectory data often incorporates noise, outliers, motion degeneracies and motion dependencies, recently proposed motion segmentation methods resort to non-trivial representations to achieve state of the art segmentation accuracies, at the expense of a large computational cost. This paperproposes a method that dramatically reduces this cost (by two or three orders of magnitude) with minimal accuracy loss (from 98.8% achieved by the state of the art, to 96.2% achieved by our method on the standardHopkins 155 dataset). Computational efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Subsets of motion models with the best balance between prediction accuracy and model complexity are chosen from a pool of candidates, which are then used for segmentation. 1. Rigid Motion Segmentation Rigid motion segmentation (MS) consists on separating regions, features, or trajectories from a video sequence into spatio-temporally coherent subsets that correspond to independent, rigidly-moving objects in the scene (Figure 1.b or 1.f). The problem currently receives renewed attention, partly because of the extensive amount of video sources and applications that benefit from MS to perform higher level computer vision tasks, but also because the state of the art is reaching functional maturity. Motion Segmentation methods are widely diverse, but most capture only a small subset of constraints or algebraic properties from those that govern the image formation process of moving objects and their corresponding trajectories, such as the rank limit theorem [9, 10], the linear independence constraint (between trajectories from independent motions) [2, 13], the epipolar constraint [7], and the reduced rank property [11, 15, 13].

Wˆf (rif (cif methods [11, 6, 8] balance model complexity with modeling accuracy and have been successful at incorporating more of these aspects into a single formulation. For instance, in [8] most model parameters are estimated automatically from the data, including the number of independent motions and their complexity, as well as the segmentation labels (including outliers). However, because of the large number of necessary motion hypotheses that need to be instantiated, as well as the varying and potentially very large number of 222222555977 model parameters that must be estimated, the flexibility offered by this method comes at a large computational cost. Current state of the art methods follow the trend of using sparse low-dimensional subspaces to represent trajectory data. This representation is then fed into a clustering algorithm to obtain a segmentation result. A prime example of this type of method is Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [3] in which each trajectory is represented as a sparse linear combination of a few other basis trajectories. The assumption is that the basis trajectories must belong to the same rigid motion as the reconstructed trajectory (or else, the reconstruction would be impossible). When the assumption is true, the sparse mixing coefficients can be interpreted as the connectivity weights of a graph (or a similarity matrix), which is then (spectral) clustered to obtain a segmentation result. At the time of publication, SSC produced segmentation results three times more accurate than the best predecessor. The practical downside, however, is the inherently large computational cost of finding the optimal sparse representation, which is at least cubic on the number of trajectories. The work of [14] also falls within the class of subspace separation algorithms. Their approach is based on clustering the principal angles (CPA) of the local subspaces associated to each trajectory and its nearest neighbors. The clustering re-weights a traditional metric of subspace affinity between principal angles. Re-weighted affinities are then used for segmentation. The approach produces segmentation results with accuracies similar to those of SSC, but the computational cost is close to 10 times bigger than SSC’s. In this work we argue that competitive segmentation results are possible using a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. The proposed method is approximately 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than [3] and [14] respectively, currently considered the state of the art. 1.1. Affine Motion Projective Geometry is often used to model the image motion of trajectories from rigid objects between pairs of frames. However, alternative geometric relationships that facilitate parameter computation have also been proven useful for this purpose. For instance, in perspective projection, general image motion from rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of two elements: a 2D homography, and parallax residual displacements [5]. The homography describes the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the parallax residuals account for relative depths, that are unaccounted for by the planar surface model. Under orthography, in contrast, image motion of rigid objects can be modeled via the composition of a 2D affine transformation plus epipolar residual displacements. The 2D affine transformation models the motion of an arbitrary plane, and the epipolar residuals account for relative depths. Crucially, these two components can be computed separately and incrementally, which enables an explicit mechanism to deal with motion degeneracy. In the context of 3D motion, a motion is degenerate when the trajectories originate from a planar (or linear) object, or when neither the camera nor the imaged object exercise all of their degrees of freedom, such as when the object only translates, or when the camera only rotates. These are common situations in real world video sequences. The incremental nature of the decompositions described above, facilitate the transition between degenerate motions and nondegenerate ones. Planar Model Under orthography, the projection of trajectories from a planar surface can be modeled with the affine transformation: ⎣⎡xy1c ⎦⎤=?0D? 1t?⎡⎣yx1w ⎦⎤= A2wD→c⎣⎡yx1w ⎦⎤, (1) where D ∈ R2×2 is an invertible matrix, and t ∈ R2 is a threarnesl Datio ∈n v Rector.

For simplicity we refer to as and consequently A2sD is the identity matrix. A2s→Df A2fD 222222556088 3D Model In order to upgrade a planar (degenerate) model into a full 3D one, relative depth must be accounted using the epipolar residual displacements. This means extending Eq. 1 with a direction vector, scaled by the corresponding relative depth of each point, as in: ⎣⎡xy1c ⎦⎤=?0?D? t1? ⎡⎣xy1w ⎦⎤+ δzw⎣⎡a 0213 ⎦⎤. The depth δzw is relative to the arbitrary plane tion is modeled by A2D; a point that lies on would have δzw = 0.

Deter- mining the motion and structure parameters of a 3D model from point correspondences can be done using the classical matrix factorization approach [10], but besides being sensitive to noise and outliers, the common scenario where the solution becomes degenerate makes the approach difficult to use in real-world applications. Appropriately accommodating and dealing with the degenerate cases is one of the key features of our work. 2. Overview of the Method The proposed motion segmentation algorithm has three stages.

The problem is framed as an objective function that must be minimized. The objective function is the negative loglikelihood over prediction accuracy, regularized by model complexity (number of model parameters) and modeling overlap (trajectories explained by multiple models). Notice that after this stage, the segmentation that results from the optimal model combination could be reported as a segmentation result (§5). ioTnhe r tshuilrtd ( stage incorporates the results from a set of model combinations that are closest to the optimal. Segmentation results are aggregated into an affinity matrix, which is then passed to a spectral clustering algorithm to produce the final segmentation result.

The input to our model instantiation algorithm is a spatially-local, randomly drawn subset of trajectory data Wˆ[2F×I] ⊆ W[2F×P] (§3.1). In turn, at each RANSAC trial, the algorithm draw(§s3 uniformly d,i asttr eibaucthed R, A rNanSdoAmC subsets of three control trajectories (C[2F×3] ⊂ Wˆ[2F×I]).

The residuals are determined by the differences between the predictions made by a hypothesized model Af, and the observations at each frame ?r?1f?=? w˜1?f?− Af? w˜1?s?. (11) 3D likelihoods. The negative log-likelihood term for the 3D case is based on the the 2DAPE decomposition. The 2D affinities Af and residuals rf are reused, but to account for the effect of relative depth, an epipolar line segment ef is robustly fit to the residual data at each frame (please see supplementary material for details on the segment fitting algorithm). The 2DAPE does not constrain relative depths to remain constant across frames, but only requires trajectories to be close to the epipolar line. So, if the unitary vector ef indicates the orthogonal direction to ef, then the negativ⊥e log-likelihood term for the 3D case is estimated with: L3D( wˆfi| Af,σf) = −2log⎜⎝⎛√21πσfexp⎪⎨⎪⎧−?r2if(?σfe)f⊥2?2⎪⎬⎪⎫⎞⎟⎠, ⎠(12,) which is also a zero-mean 2D Norma⎩l distribution ⎭computed as the product of two identical, separable, singlevariate, normal distributions, evaluated at the distance from the residual to the epipolar line. The first one corresponds to the actual deviation in the direction of ef , which is analyti- cally computed using rif?ef. The seco⊥nd one corresponds to an estimate of the deviat⊥ion in the perpendicular direction (ef), which cannot be determined using the 2DAPE decomposition model, but can be approximated to be equal to rif ? ef, which is a plausible estimate under the isotropic noise as⊥sumption. Note that Eq. 7 does not evaluate the quality of a model using the number of inliers, as it is typical for RANSAC. Instead, we found that better motion models resulted from Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation × Algorithm 1: Motion model instantiation Input:b Traasejec frtoamrye d bata W[2F×P], number of RANSAC trials K, arbitrary Output: Parameters of the motion model M = {B , σn , ω} // determine the training set c ← rand( 1, P) ; r ← rand(rmin , rmax ) // random center and radius I] ← t ra j e ct oriesWithinDis k (W, r,c) // support subset X ← homoCoords(Wˆb) // points at base frame for K RANSAC trials do Wˆ[2F Wˆ return M = {B} optimizing over the accuracy ofthe model predictions for an (estimated) inlier subset, which also means that the effect of outliers is explicitly uncounted.

Figures 1.d and 1.e show a model’s control points and its corresponding (class-labeled) residuals, respectively. A pseudocode description of the motion instantiation algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. Details on how to determine Wˆ, as well as B, σ, and ω follow. 3.1. Local Coherence The subset of trajectories Wˆ given to RANSAC to generate a model M is constrained to a spatially local region. The probability ofchoosing an uncontaminated set of 3 control trajectories, necessary to compute a 2D affine model, from a dataset with a ratio r of inliers, after k trials is: p = 1 − (1 − r3)k. This means that the number of trials pne =ede 1d −to (fi1n d− a subset of 3 inliers with probability p is k =lloogg((11 − − r p3)). (13) A common assumption is that trajectories from the same underlying motion are locally coherent. Hence, a compact region is likely to increase r, exponentially reducing 222222666200 Figure 2: Predictions (red) from a 2D affine model with standard Gaussian noise (green) on one of the control points (black). Noiseless model predictions in blue. All four scenarios have identical noise. The magnitude of the extrapolation error changes with the distance between the control points. k, and with it, RANSAC’s computation time by a proportional amount. The trade-off that results from drawing model control points from a small region, however, is extrapolation error. A motion model is extrapolated when utilized to make predictions for trajectories outside the region defined by the control points. The magnitude of modeling error depends on the magnitude of the noise affecting the control points, and although hard to characterize in general, extrapolation error can be expected to grow with the distance from the prediction to the control points, and inversely with the distance between the control points themselves. Figure 2 shows a series of synthetic scenarios where one of the control points is affected by zero mean Gaussian noise of small magnitude. Identical noise is added to the same trajectory in all four scenarios. The figure illustrates the relation between the distance between the control points and the magnitude of the extrapolation errors. Our goal is to maximize the region size while limiting the number of outliers. Without any prior knowledge regarding the scale of the objects in the scene, determining a fixed size for the support region is unlikely to work in general. Instead, the issue is avoided by randomly sampling disk-shaped regions of varying sizes and locations to construct a diverse set of support subsets. Each support subset is then determined by Wˆ = {wi | (xbi − ox)2 + (ybi − oy)2 < r2}, (14) where (ox , oy) are the coordinates of the center of a disk of radius r. To promote uniform image coverage, the disk is centered at a randomly chosen trajectory (ox , oy) = (xbi, yib) with uniformly distributed i ∼ U(1, P) and base frame b) w∼i h U u(1n,i fFor)m. yTo d asltrloibwu efodr idi ∼ffer Ue(n1t, region ds bizaesse, tfhraem read bius ∼ r is( ,cFho)s.en T ofro amllo a u fnoirfo dirmffe rdeinsttr riebugtiioonn r ∼s, tUh(erm raidni,u ursm rax i)s.

Characterizing the Residual Distribution At each RANSAC iteration, residuals rf are computed using the 2D affine model Af that results from the constraints provided by the control trajectories C.

(17) But because σf is generally unknown, the threshold (τ) is estimated from the residual data. To do so, let be the vector of residual magnitudes where rˆi ≤ ˆ ri+1 . Now, let r˜ = median ( rˆi+1 −ˆ r i). The threshold i≤s trˆ h en defined as r τ = min{ rˆi | (ri+1 − ri) > λr˜ r}, (18) which corresponds to the smallest residual magnitude before a salient magnitude gap. Our experiments showed this test to be efficient and effective. Figure 1.e shows classlabeled residuals. Notice the presence of a (low density) gap between the residuals from the trajectories explained by the correct model (in red, close to the origin), and the rest. 4.2. Magnitude of the Noise, 2D Model r2fD Let contain only the residuals of the inlier trajectories (those where = 1), and let USV? be the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix bif ofˆ r2fD: USV?= svd??1bpf( rˆ2fD)? rˆ2fD?.(19) Then the magnitude of the n?oise corresponds to the largest singular value σ2 = s1, because if the underlying geometry is in fact planar, then the only unaccounted displacements captured by the residuals are due to noise. Model capacity can also be determined from S, as explained next. 4.3. Model Capacity The ratio of largest over smallest singular values (s1/s2) determines when upgrading to a 3D model is beneficial. When the underlying geometry is actually non-planar, the residuals from a planar model should distribute along a line (the epipolar line), reflecting that their relative depth is being unaccounted for. This produces a covariance matrix with a large ratio s1/s2 ? 1. If on the other hand, if s1/s2 ≈ 1, then there is no in 1d.ic Iafti oonn tohfe unexplained relative depth, tihn wnh thicehr case, fitting a olinne o tfo u spherically distributed residuals will only increase the model complexity without explaining the residual variance much better. A small spherical residual covariance strongly suggests a planar underlying geometry. 4.4. 3D Inlier Detection When the residual distribution is elongated (s1/s2 ? 1), a line segment is robustly fit to the (potentially con?tam 1i)-, nated) set of residuals. The segment must go through the origin and its parameters are computed using a Hough transform. Further details about this algorithm can be found in the supplementary material. Inlier detection The resulting line segment is used to determine 3D model inliers. Trajectory ibecomes an inlier at frame f if it satisfies two conditions. First, the projection of rif onto the line must lie within the segment limits (β ≤ ≤ γ). Second, the normalized distance to the rif?ef (ef?rif line must be below a threshold ≤ σ2λd). Notice that the threshold depends on the smalle≤st singular value from Eq. 19 to (roughly) account for the presence of noise in the direction perpendicular to the epipolar (ef). 4.5. Magnitude of the Noise, 3D Model let rˆf3D Similarly to the 2D case, contain the residual data from the corresponding 3D inlier trajectories. An estimate for the magnitude of the noise that reflects the use of a 3D model can be obtained from the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix of r3fD (as in Eq. 19). In this case, the largest singular value s1 captures the spread of residuals along the epipolar line, so its magnitude is mainly related to the magnitude of the displacements due to relative depth. However, s2 captures deviations from the epipolar line, which in a rigid 3D object can only be attributed to noise, making σ2 = s2 a reasonable estimate for its magnitude. Optimal model parameters When both 2D and 3D models are instantiated, the one with the smallest penalized negative log-likelihood (7) becomes the winning model for the current RANSAC run. The same penalized negative loglikelihood metric is used to determine the better model from across all RANSAC iterations.

Details follow. Prediction Accuracy In order to determine how well a model M predicts an arbitrary trajectory w, the affine transformations estimated by RANSAC could be re-used. However, the inherent noise in the control points, and the potentially short distance between them, often render this approach impractical, particularly when w is spatially distant from the control points (see §3. 1).

The orthonormal basis S of a ω = 2D (or 3D) motion model can be determined by the 2 (or 3) left singular vectors of WB. Using S as the model’s motion matrices, prediction accuracy can be computed using: E(w, M) = ??SS?w − w??2 , (22) which is the sum of squared?? Euclidean d??eviations from the predictions (SS?w), to the observed data (w). Our experiments indicated that, although sensitive to outliers, these model predictions are much more robust to noise.

A spectral clustering method is applied on F to produce the method’s final segmentation result. 7. Experiments Evaluation was made through three experimental setups. Hopkins 155 The Hopkins 155 (H155) dataset has been the standard evaluation metric for the problem of motion segmentation of trajectory data since 2007. It consists of checkerboard, traffic and articulated sequences with either 2 or 3 motions. Data was automatically tracked, but tracking errors were manually corrected; further details are available in [12]. The use of a standard dataset enables direct comparison of accuracy and run-time performance. Table 1 shows the relevant figures for the two most competitive algorithms that we are aware of. The data indicates that our algorithm has run-times that are close to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art methods, with minimal accuracy loss. Computation times are measured in the same (or very similar) hardware architectures. Like in CPA, our implementation uses a single set of parameters for all the experiments, but as others had pointed out [14], it remains unclear whether the same is true for the results reported in the original SSC paper. 222222666533 Figure 4: Accuracy error-bars across artificial H155 datasets with controlled levels of Gaussian noise. Artificial Noise The second experimental setup complements an unexplored dimension in the H155 dataset: noise. The goal is to determine the effects of noise of different magnitudes towards the segmentation accuracy of our method, in comparison with the state of the art. We noted that H155 contains structured long-tailed noise, but for the purpose of this experiment we required a noise-free dataset as a baseline. To generate such a dataset, ground-truth labels were used to compute a rank 3 reconstruction of (mean-subtracted) trajectories for each segment. Then, multiple versions of H155 were computed by contaminating the noise-free dataset with Gaussian noise of magnitudes σn ∈ {0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8}. Our method, as well as SSC a∈nd { 0C.0PA1, were run on t2h,e4s,e8 }n.oi Ose-ucro mnterothlloedd, datasets; results are shown in Figure 4. The error bars on SSC and Ours indicate one standard deviation, computed over 20 runs. The plot for CPA is generated with only one run for each dataset (running time: 11.95 days). The graph indicates that our method only compromises accuracy for large levels of noise, while still being around 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the most competitive algorithms. KLT Tracking The last experimental setup evaluates the applicability of the algorithm in real world conditions using raw tracks from an off-the-shelf implementation [1] of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm. Several sequences were tracked and the resulting trajectories classified by our method. Figure 5 shows qualitatively good motion segmentation results for four sequences. Challenges include very small relative motions, tracking noise, and a large presence of outliers. 8. Conclusions We introduced a computationally efficient motion segmentation algorithm for trajectory data. Efficiency comes from the use of a simple but powerful representation of motion that explicitly incorporates mechanisms to deal with noise, outliers and motion degeneracies. Run-time comparisons indicate that our method is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, with only a small loss in accuracy.

The method was also found to be useful for motion segmentation of real-world, raw trajectory data. References [1] ht tp : / /www . ce s . c l emn s on . edu / ˜stb / k lt . 8 [2] J. P.

<p>Author: Ravi Garg, Anastasios Roussos, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers the first variational approach to the problem of dense 3D reconstruction of non-rigid surfaces from a monocular video sequence. We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>2 0.85678214 <a title="113-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Lili Tao, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on a non-linear manifold learning technique is proposed to recover 3D nonrigid structures from 2D image sequences captured by a single camera. Most ofthe existing approaches assume that 3D shapes can be accurately modelled in a linear subspace. These techniques perform well when the deformations are relatively small or simple, but fail when more complex deformations need to be recovered. The non-linear deformations are often observed in highly flexible objects for which the use of the linear model is impractical. A specific type of shape variations might be governed by only a small number of parameters, therefore can be wellrepresented in a low dimensional manifold. We learn a nonlinear shape prior using diffusion maps method. The key contribution in this paper is the introduction of the shape prior that constrain the reconstructed shapes to lie in the learned manifold. The proposed methodology has been validated quantitatively and qualitatively on 2D points sequences projected from the 3D motion capture data and real 2D video sequences. The comparisons oftheproposed man- ifold based method against several state-of-the-art techniques are shown on different types of deformable objects.</p><p>3 0.84097749 <a title="113-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Procrustean_Normal_Distribution_for_Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion.html">341 cvpr-2013-Procrustean Normal Distribution for Non-rigid Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Minsik Lee, Jungchan Cho, Chong-Ho Choi, Songhwai Oh</p><p>Abstract: Non-rigid structure from motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which is yet to be solved satisfactorily. The main difficulty of the problem lies in choosing the right constraints for the solution. In this paper, we propose new constraints that are more effective for non-rigid shape recovery. Unlike the other proposals which have mainly focused on restricting the deformation space using rank constraints, our proposal constrains the motion parameters so that the 3D shapes are most closely aligned to each other, which makes the rank constraints unnecessary. Based on these constraints, we define a new class ofprobability distribution called the Procrustean normal distribution and propose a new NRSfM algorithm, EM-PND. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, and it works well even if there is no temporal dependence between the observed samples.</p><p>4 0.69538695 <a title="113-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Object_Reconstruction_with_Semantic_Priors.html">110 cvpr-2013-Dense Object Reconstruction with Semantic Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Sid Yingze Bao, Manmohan Chandraker, Yuanqing Lin, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present a dense reconstruction approach that overcomes the drawbacks of traditional multiview stereo by incorporating semantic information in the form of learned category-level shape priors and object detection. Given training data comprised of 3D scans and images of objects from various viewpoints, we learn a prior comprised of a mean shape and a set of weighted anchor points. The former captures the commonality of shapes across the category, while the latter encodes similarities between instances in the form of appearance and spatial consistency. We propose robust algorithms to match anchor points across instances that enable learning a mean shape for the category, even with large shape variations across instances. We model the shape of an object instance as a warped version of the category mean, along with instance-specific details. Given multiple images of an unseen instance, we collate information from 2D object detectors to align the structure from motion point cloud with the mean shape, which is subsequently warped and refined to approach the actual shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is general enough to learn semantic priors for different object categories, yet powerful enough to reconstruct individual shapes with large variations. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our framework can produce more accurate reconstructions than alternative state-of-the-art multiview stereo systems.</p><p>5 0.65655297 <a title="113-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Templateless_Quasi-rigid_Shape_Modeling_with_Implicit_Loop-Closure.html">424 cvpr-2013-Templateless Quasi-rigid Shape Modeling with Implicit Loop-Closure</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph.

<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.</p><p>2 0.95527577 <a title="113-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Matting_with_Local_and_Nonlocal_Smooth_Priors.html">211 cvpr-2013-Image Matting with Local and Nonlocal Smooth Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowu Chen, Dongqing Zou, Steven Zhiying Zhou, Qinping Zhao, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the manifold preserving editing propagation [4] essentially introduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth priorfrom matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from color sampling in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method produces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>3 0.95234931 <a title="113-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Articulated objects represent an important class ofobjects in our everyday environment. Automatic detection of the type of articulated or otherwise restricted motion and extraction of the corresponding motion parameters are therefore of high value, e.g. in order to augment an otherwise static 3D reconstruction with dynamic semantics, such as rotation axes and allowable translation directions for certain rigid parts or objects. Hence, in this paper, a novel theory to analyse relative transformations between two motion-restricted parts will be presented. The analysis is based on linear subspaces spanned by relative transformations. Moreover, a signature for relative transformations will be introduced which uniquely specifies the type of restricted motion encoded in these relative transformations. This theoretic framework enables the derivation of novel algebraic constraints, such as low-rank constraints for subsequent rotations around two fixed axes for example. Lastly, given the type of restricted motion as predicted by the signature, the paper shows how to extract all the motion parameters with matrix manipulations from linear algebra. Our theory is verified on several real data sets, such as a rotating blackboard or a wheel rolling on the floor amongst others.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.94679886 <a title="113-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Variational_Reconstruction_of_Non-rigid_Surfaces_from_Monocular_Video.html">113 cvpr-2013-Dense Variational Reconstruction of Non-rigid Surfaces from Monocular Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Ravi Garg, Anastasios Roussos, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers the first variational approach to the problem of dense 3D reconstruction of non-rigid surfaces from a monocular video sequence. We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>5 0.86818886 <a title="113-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Illumination_Estimation_Based_on_Bilayer_Sparse_Coding.html">210 cvpr-2013-Illumination Estimation Based on Bilayer Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Li, Weihua Xiong, Weiming Hu, Houwen Peng</p><p>Abstract: Computational color constancy is a very important topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers ’ attention. Recently, lots of research has shown the effects of using high level visual content cues for improving illumination estimation. However, nearly all the existing methods are essentially combinational strategies in which image ’s content analysis is only used to guide the combination or selection from a variety of individual illumination estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel bilayer sparse coding model for illumination estimation that considers image similarity in terms of both low level color distribution and high level image scene content simultaneously. For the purpose, the image ’s scene content information is integrated with its color distribution to obtain optimal illumination estimation model. The experimental results on real-world image sets show that our algorithm is superior to some prevailing illumination estimation methods, even better than some combinational methods.</p><p>6 0.83740658 <a title="113-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Thousand_Frames_in_Just_a_Few_Words%3A_Lingual_Description_of_Videos_through_Latent_Topics_and_Sparse_Object_Stitching.html">28 cvpr-2013-A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching</a></p>

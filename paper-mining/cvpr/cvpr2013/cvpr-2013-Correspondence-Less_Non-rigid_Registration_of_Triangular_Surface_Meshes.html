</p><p>6 Introduction A wide range of application areas, such as registration of 3D laser scans [22] or volumetric medical images [16], requires the alignment of deformable objects [11, 19]. [sent-14, score-0.498]
</p><p>7 From this point of view, registration techniques can be classified into two main categories: physical model-based and parametric or functional representation [10]. [sent-16, score-0.279]
</p><p>8 A broadly used class of such parametric models are splines, in particular thin plate splines (TPS) [2, 24]. [sent-18, score-0.311]
</p><p>9 TPS models are quite useful whenever a parametric free-form registration is required but the underlying physical model of the object deformation is unknown or too complex. [sent-19, score-0.337]
</p><p>10 The aligning transformation is then found by maximizing similarity between the objects, which usually yields a complex non-linear optimization procedure. [sent-24, score-0.165]
</p><p>11 While point-based registration has the advantage of tolerating rather high occlusions, they are typically inefficient for large point sets. [sent-31, score-0.23]
</p><p>12 In many cases, however, the goal is the accurate alignment of whole volumetric objects of several megavoxels (e. [sent-32, score-0.178]
</p><p>13 These approaches could handle large scope of deformations, but usually they do not use classical parametric transformation models. [sent-37, score-0.134]
</p><p>14 While elastic registration of planar shapes has been addressed by many researchers [1, 8], the extension of 2D methods for 3D object registration is far from trivial. [sent-38, score-0.506]
</p><p>15 Herein, we propose a general TPS framework for aligning 3D deformable objects. [sent-39, score-0.118]
</p><p>16 The basic idea of the method is inspired by [8]: an overdetermined system of nonlinear equations is constructed by integrating a set of nonlinear functions over the object volumes, which is then solved in the least squares sense. [sent-40, score-0.321]
</p><p>17 However, the procedure we develop here to construct the equations is substantially different: in [8], the integrals are evaluated in terms of 2D pix-  els, which is relatively straightforward to extend to 3D vox222222777533  els. [sent-41, score-0.362]
</p><p>18 In this paper, we will show that complexity can be drastically reduced when the input objects are represented as triangular surface meshes. [sent-43, score-0.593]
</p><p>19 The performance and robustness of the proposed approach has been quantitatively evaluated on a synthetic dataset, and it has also been successfully applied to the alignment of segmented lung CT images. [sent-47, score-0.301]
</p><p>20 Thin plate spline registration framework Thin plate splines (TPS) [2, 24] are commonly used as parametric models for elastic deformations using radial basis functions. [sent-49, score-0.688]
</p><p>21 Thus in classical correspondence based approaches, control points are placed at extracted point matches, and the deformation at other positions is interpolated by the TPS. [sent-66, score-0.137]
</p><p>22 However, we are interested in solving the TPS registration problem without correspondences. [sent-68, score-0.23]
</p><p>23 Obviously, a finer grid would allow a more refined approximation of the deformation field at the price of an  increased number of free parameters. [sent-73, score-0.115]
</p><p>24 When objects are represented as a set of foreground voxels, the generation of the transformed volume would be computationally expensive. [sent-75, score-0.125]
</p><p>25 [8] proposed attoi use integral transformation  ∫ℱ표y푑y =∫ℱ푡휑(x)∣퐽휑(x)∣푑x,  (5)  which involves the Jacobian determinant of 휑, composed of the partial derivatives of the transformation. [sent-77, score-0.12]

</p><p>29 Computing the integrals over meshes In the following, we will propose an efficient computational scheme for the integrals in (6). [sent-88, score-0.635]
</p><p>30 For that purpose, let us denote the triangular surface meshes of the template and observation objects by 푇△ and 푂△ and the volumes enclosed by these meshes by and 퐹표△, respectively. [sent-89, score-0.971]
</p><p>31 Since ℱ푡 ≈ and ℱ표 ≈ 퐹표△, the integrals nfrootmed ( b4y) can . [sent-91, score-0.255]

</p><p>33 each triangle 표 = (퐴, 퐵, 퐶), let us create a tetrahedron 풯표 = (퐴, 퐵, 퐶, 0) defined by the vertices ofthe corresponding triangle 표 and the origin 0. [sent-95, score-0.509]
</p><p>34 Thus for all triangle, we generate a tetrahedron with the fourth vertex shared by all of these tetrahedrons (see Fig. [sent-96, score-0.422]
</p><p>35 Although the choice of the fourth vertex is arbitrary, setting it to the origin will greatly simplify our computations. [sent-98, score-0.11]

</p><p>38 The volumes of the tetrahedrons generated by the two marked triangles has different signs, caused by the different vertex order. [sent-115, score-0.293]
</p><p>39 In general, we cannot compute the integrals in a straightforward way for an arbitrary function. [sent-117, score-0.284]
</p><p>40 However, it is possible to derive a similar closed form formula for the integrals as before, when 휔푖 are polynomials. [sent-118, score-0.255]
</p><p>41 The integral over a tetrahedron 풯표 can then be written as e[13 i]n  ∫풯표푦푚1푖푦2푛푖푦3표푖푑y = 6(∣푚v푖ol+(풯 푛표)푖∣푚+ 표푖! [sent-128, score-0.248]

</p><p>45 Numerical implementation As we presented in the previous section the equations of (6) are only approximately valid, due to the discrete representation of triangular surfaces. [sent-140, score-0.45]
</p><p>46 Since the system is solved by minimizing the algebraic error, proper normalization is critical for numerical stability. [sent-145, score-0.134]
</p><p>47 Furthermore, after normalization the origin becomes the centroid of the objects, therefore the fourth point of each tetrahedron, described in the previous section, will be the centroid of the objects, which also increases numerical stability. [sent-151, score-0.126]
</p><p>48 The range of the 휔푖 functions should also be normalized into [−1, 1] in order to ensure a balanced contribution of the equations t]o i nth oer algebraic error. [sent-152, score-0.117]

</p><p>64 In the first experiment, we evaluated the sensitivity of the mesh-based algorithm (see Algorithm 1) with respect to the mesh resolution. [sent-209, score-0.202]
</p><p>65 For that purpose, the triangular mesh extractor algorithms from CGAL library [21] were used where the resolution of the triangular mesh can be controlled by the maximal radius 푟 ofthe corresponding Delaunay sphere. [sent-210, score-1.184]
</p><p>66 Using our synthetic dataset, triangular meshes has been created for 푟 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 6, 10}. [sent-211, score-0.538]
</p><p>67 Obviously, trheeresolution of the triangular mesh affects the computation 222222777977  time. [sent-215, score-0.574]
</p><p>68 On the other hand, the computational time can be significantly reduced by decreasing 푟 at the price of a slightly lower registration accuracy. [sent-216, score-0.258]
</p><p>69 In Table 1, we compared the registration quality and computing times of the naive voxel-based extension of [8]  and the proposed mesh-based algorithm for 푟 = 5. [sent-226, score-0.259]
</p><p>70 While the registration errors are of similar magnitude, the computing times show an almost 20 times speed-up for the meshbased algorithm. [sent-227, score-0.23]
</p><p>71 This is not surprising, as the mesh-based algorithm works only with triangle vertices whose number is less than 9000, whereas the voxel-based method has to deal with several hundred thousand voxels. [sent-228, score-0.159]
</p><p>72 This is due to the way these numerical schemes approximate the continuous integrals in (24). [sent-231, score-0.31]
</p><p>73 In the voxelbased case, approximation error is due to 1) the discretization error on the object’s surface (inner voxels are not producing such errors) and 2) the Jacobian is implicitly assumed to be constant within each voxel (including the inner ones! [sent-232, score-0.32]
</p><p>74 However, the mesh-based algorithm computes the exact (continuous) integrals over each tetrahedron, therefore the only source of the approximation error is the difference between the true object surface and its approximating triangular mesh. [sent-234, score-0.806]
</p><p>75 Considering that  a 훿 < 10% corresponds to a visually good alignment, our approach is quite robust up to as high as 20% surface error. [sent-239, score-0.15]

</p><p>84 Due to respiratory motion, the lung is subject to a nonlinear deformation between suchfollow-ups, hence it is hard to automatically find correspondences. [sent-266, score-0.323]
</p><p>85 We successfully applied the proposed approach to align 3D lung CT scans. [sent-268, score-0.206]
</p><p>86 Since the triangular mesh basedapproach is more accurate and faster, the input voxel volumes were first transformed into a triangular mesh using 푟 = 5, and then the TPS parameters were recovered by Algorithm 1. [sent-269, score-1.302]

</p><p>89 In many medical image registration problem, one is looking for a smooth deformation, thus a diffeomorphic solution is needed. [sent-280, score-0.415]
</p><p>90 It is a well known fact, that thin plate splines may not be diffeomorphic without further regularization. [sent-281, score-0.371]
</p><p>91 In out approach, using the bending energy minimization provided sufficient constraint to obtain diffeomorphic solutions. [sent-283, score-0.189]

The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs.

<p>Author: Jiayi Ma, Ji Zhao, Jinwen Tian, Zhuowen Tu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We present a new point matching algorithm for robust nonrigid registration. The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the transformation between two point sets. In the first step of the iteration, feature descriptors such as shape context are used to establish rough correspondence. In the second step, we estimate the transformation using a robust estimator called L2E. This is the main novelty of our approach and it enables us to deal with the noise and outliers which arise in the correspondence step. The transformation is specified in a functional space, more specifically a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply our method to nonrigid sparse image feature correspondence on 2D images and 3D surfaces. Our results quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods, particularly when there are a large number of outliers. Moreover, our method of robustly estimating transformations from correspondences is general and has many other applications.</p><p>4 0.17439385 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>5 0.1712435 <a title="97-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Templateless_Quasi-rigid_Shape_Modeling_with_Implicit_Loop-Closure.html">424 cvpr-2013-Templateless Quasi-rigid Shape Modeling with Implicit Loop-Closure</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling.</p><p>6 0.1649957 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Mesh_Based_Semantic_Modelling_for_Indoor_and_Outdoor_Scenes.html">284 cvpr-2013-Mesh Based Semantic Modelling for Indoor and Outdoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>3 0.82758963 <a title="97-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>5 0.67686009 <a title="97-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Computation_of_Shortest_Path-Concavity_for_3D_Meshes.html">141 cvpr-2013-Efficient Computation of Shortest Path-Concavity for 3D Meshes</a></p>
<p>Author: Henrik Zimmer, Marcel Campen, Leif Kobbelt</p><p>Abstract: In the context of shape segmentation and retrieval object-wide distributions of measures are needed to accurately evaluate and compare local regions ofshapes. Lien et al. [16] proposed two point-wise concavity measures in the context of Approximate Convex Decompositions of polygons measuring the distance from a point to the polygon ’s convex hull: an accurate Shortest Path-Concavity (SPC) measure and a Straight Line-Concavity (SLC) approximation of the same. While both are practicable on 2D shapes, the exponential costs of SPC in 3D makes it inhibitively expensive for a generalization to meshes [14]. In this paper we propose an efficient and straight forward approximation of the Shortest Path-Concavity measure to 3D meshes. Our approximation is based on discretizing the space between mesh and convex hull, thereby reducing the continuous Shortest Path search to an efficiently solvable graph problem. Our approach works outof-the-box on complex mesh topologies and requires no complicated handling of genus. Besides presenting a rigorous evaluation of our method on a variety of input meshes, we also define an SPC-based Shape Descriptor and show its superior retrieval and runtime performance compared with the recently presented results on the Convexity Distribution by Lian et al. [12].</p><p>6 0.67670727 <a title="97-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Monocular_Template-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Extensible_Surfaces_with_Local_Linear_Elasticity.html">289 cvpr-2013-Monocular Template-Based 3D Reconstruction of Extensible Surfaces with Local Linear Elasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Alan Yuille, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are interested in how semantic segmentation can help object detection. Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model “blends ” between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM [14]. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector [12] on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM [14] in 19 out of 20 classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC’10 test by 4%.</p><p>3 0.69568902 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Lu Zhang, Laurens van_der_Maaten</p><p>Abstract: Model-free trackers can track arbitrary objects based on a single (bounding-box) annotation of the object. Whilst the performance of model-free trackers has recently improved significantly, simultaneously tracking multiple objects with similar appearance remains very hard. In this paper, we propose a new multi-object model-free tracker (based on tracking-by-detection) that resolves this problem by incorporating spatial constraints between the objects. The spatial constraints are learned along with the object detectors using an online structured SVM algorithm. The experimental evaluation ofour structure-preserving object tracker (SPOT) reveals significant performance improvements in multi-object tracking. We also show that SPOT can improve the performance of single-object trackers by simultaneously tracking different parts of the object.</p><p>5 0.68878472 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Minimum_Uncertainty_Gap_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">285 cvpr-2013-Minimum Uncertainty Gap for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junseok Kwon, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel tracking algorithm that robustly tracks the target by finding the state which minimizes uncertainty of the likelihood at current state. The uncertainty of the likelihood is estimated by obtaining the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood. By minimizing the gap between the two bounds, our method finds the confident and reliable state of the target. In the paper, the state that gives the Minimum Uncertainty Gap (MUG) between likelihood bounds is shown to be more reliable than the state which gives the maximum likelihood only, especially when there are severe illumination changes, occlusions, and pose variations. A rigorous derivation of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood for the visual tracking problem is provided to address this issue. Additionally, an efficient inference algorithm using Interacting Markov Chain Monte Carlo is presented to find the best state that maximizes the average of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood and minimizes the gap between two bounds simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully tracks the target in realistic videos and outperforms conventional tracking methods.</p><p>6 0.68769789 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Object_Tracking%3A_A_Benchmark.html">314 cvpr-2013-Online Object Tracking: A Benchmark</a></p>

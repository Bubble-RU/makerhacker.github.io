Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices.

</p><p>4 (Bottom) Surface alignment of two different brain surfaces, color coding refers to a wavelet kernel field: similar colors in the two surfaces are potentially similar regions. [sent-26, score-0.804]
</p><p>5 Interestingly, even before the core ideas were formalized under this name, wavelet type methods were already being adopted to extract multi resolution image information by early pioneers of computer vision, see Koenderink [12], Marr [15], Witkin [22], and Rosenfeld [16]. [sent-28, score-0.582]
</p><p>6 The considerable success notwithstanding, the reader will notice that in the last decade of vision research, there are only few instances of wavelets and scale-space theory adopted in problems outside of the classical applications identified above. [sent-30, score-0.38]
</p><p>7 Part of the reason may be that the standard definition of a wavelet expansion is in Euclidean space: which means that for images, wavelets are defined on a uniformly sampled lattice. [sent-35, score-0.86]
</p><p>8 The main goal of this work is to develop multi-resolution methods for shape analysis with an eye on two specific problems of interest: shape segmentation and surface alignment. [sent-37, score-0.44]
</p><p>9 The first problem of 3-D mesh segmentation deals with parsing the shape into perceptually meaningful regions and serves a key role in computer animation, texture mapping, morphing, and shape retrieval. [sent-38, score-0.747]
</p><p>10 The second problem of 3-D surface alignment seeks the alignment ofa pair ofhighly convoluted surfaces (e. [sent-42, score-0.49]
</p><p>11 Unfortunately, writing a wavelet representation for the input datum for these problems is problematic, since traditionally wavelets are limited to the Euclidean setting. [sent-48, score-0.901]
</p><p>12 Readers familiar with wavelets will instantly recognize that the bottleneck here is to come up with analogs of dilation and translation on the graph. [sent-50, score-0.451]
</p><p>13 Successfully defining all wavelet properties on the graph will enable a truly multi-resolutional analysis, and open the doors for extending wavelet theory to a range of 3-D shape analysis problems. [sent-51, score-1.195]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we adapt an interesting set of recent results from harmonic analysis [8, 5] to derive efficient multiresolution algorithms for shape analysis problems in computer vision. [sent-52, score-0.238]
</p><p>15 Briefly, instead of analyzing the structure in the original shape mesh, we approach these problems using spectral graph theory (i. [sent-53, score-0.216]
</p><p>16 The spectral graph domain serves as an analog of the frequency domain in the Fourier transform. [sent-56, score-0.327]
</p><p>17 When combined with a few additional steps, the formalization allows obtaining the Wavelet transform of the shape of interest, and analyzing its characteristics at different bandwidths. [sent-57, score-0.205]
</p><p>18 These are the essential objects which allow obtaining perceptually based 3-D mesh segmentation and landmark-less registration of brain surfaces. [sent-59, score-0.642]
</p><p>19 However, while the Fourier transform is localized in frequency only, wavelets can be localized in both time and frequency [14]. [sent-63, score-0.687]
</p><p>20 The classic construction of wavelets is defined by a mother wavelet function ψ and a scaling function φ. [sent-64, score-0.921]
</p><p>21 Here, the mother wavelet ψ on x is a function of two parameters, the scale s and translation a:  ψs,a(x) =a1ψ(x −s a). [sent-65, score-0.569]
</p><p>22 (1)  The mother wavelet ψs,a (x), serves as a local support in the original domain [18] in the form of a localized oscillating function with finite duration. [sent-66, score-0.717]
</p><p>23 Various scales form bases that can be used to approximate a signal using wavelet ex-  pansion, and it is occasionally convenient to think of ψ as a band-pass filter. [sent-67, score-0.685]
</p><p>24 Using ψ, the wavelet transform of a signal f(x) is defined as the inner product of the wavelet and signal and can be represented as  Wf(s,a) = ? [sent-68, score-1.255]
</p><p>25 f(x)ψ∗(x −s a)dx,  (2)  where Wf (s, a) is the wavelet coefficient at scale s and at location a, and the function ψ∗ represents the complex conjugate of ψ. [sent-71, score-0.54]
</p><p>26 onstant, dΨω is the Fourier transform of the wavelet [18], and ω denotes the frequency domain. [sent-76, score-0.645]
</p><p>27 While short basis functions correspond to high frequency components and are useful to isolate signal discontinuities, longer basis functions correspond to lower frequencies. [sent-78, score-0.232]
</p><p>28 In fact, wavelets transforms have an infinite set of possible basis functions unlike the single set of basis functions (sine and cosine) in the Fourier transform. [sent-79, score-0.428]
</p><p>29 Note that the results above are not directly applicable to non-uniform graph topologies such as those encountered in shape meshes and surfaces. [sent-80, score-0.301]
</p><p>30 The solution in [8] relies on the graph Fourier transform to derive a spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT). [sent-84, score-0.837]
</p><p>31 This formalization is shown to preserve the localization properties at fine scales as well as other wavelets specific properties [11]. [sent-85, score-0.436]
</p><p>32 For a function f(n) defined on a vertex n of a graph, writing down f(sn) for a scaling parameter s is not meaningful due to the irregularity of the domain. [sent-90, score-0.225]
</p><p>33 Given a mesh with N vertices, the graph Laplacian is computed as L = D − A, where A and D are the graph adjacency masat Lrix = =an Dd degree wmhaetrriex. [sent-98, score-0.391]
</p><p>34 =0  (5)  Using these transforms, we construct spectral graph wavelets by applying band-pass filters at multiple scales and localizing it with an impulse function. [sent-112, score-0.533]
</p><p>35 This is important: since the transformed impulse function in the frequency domain is equivalent to a unit function, the wavelet ψ localized by a delta function at vertex n can now be defined as, N? [sent-113, score-0.874]
</p><p>36 With this in hand, the wavelet coefficients of a given function f(n) is given by the inner product of wavelets and the given function as well as the wavelet transform operator, N? [sent-118, score-1.476]
</p><p>37 l=0  The coefficients obtained from the transformation yield a set of wavelet coefficients at each vertex n for each scale s. [sent-122, score-0.734]
</p><p>38 We further define Wavelet Kernel Descriptor (WKD) on vertex n as the self-effect of the wavelet localized on itself, and normalized at each resolution in the following manner. [sent-123, score-0.756]
</p><p>39 Intuitively, WKD represents the process of hitting the vertex with a ‘hammer’ (an impulse function) and computing the impact on the vertex as a function of its topology viewed at multiple resolutions. [sent-125, score-0.422]
</p><p>40 Interest Point detection on Shapes WKD is a smooth function over the surface and encodes the behavior of the signal at various bandwidths via the resolution/scale parameter. [sent-133, score-0.325]
</p><p>41 Perceptually, those regions of a surface that ‘stand out’ are interpreted as key (or interest) points. [sent-134, score-0.228]
</p><p>42 We define the Wavelet Range (WR) as a set of vertices that are inside the influence of a wavelet centered at a certain vertex (i. [sent-138, score-0.724]
</p><p>43 Varying the scale s controls the width of WR by changing the dilation of the wavelet localized at a vertex n. [sent-141, score-0.769]
</p><p>44 It starts from a random seed center and finds the index of the maximum MWKD within the range of a wavelet effect defined on that point, and sets it as a new WR center. [sent-145, score-0.508]
</p><p>45 Starting from a moderately large r random seed points, it finds an arbitrary number of extremas – these extremas are the interest points. [sent-147, score-0.239]
</p><p>46 Results: Representative examples of WKD and MWKD field are shown for a dog mesh in Fig. [sent-151, score-0.269]
</p><p>47 We see that for each distinct resolution, key points correspond to different regions of the mesh lower parts ofthe leg, ears, and tip ofthe tail. [sent-156, score-0.299]

</p><p>50 Interestingly, a wavelet based algorithm inherits all diffusion specific properties (e. [sent-168, score-0.548]
</p><p>51 , [5] articulates how wavelets directly tie to diffusion via a random walk based argument), and further provides native multi-resolution behavior via the key-points. [sent-170, score-0.463]
</p><p>52 Of course, one can adopt more sophisticated schemes, but our purpose here is to underscore how even a scheme like this performs well if 222111444200  Figure 3 : Giraffe shape mesh segmentation with different parameters. [sent-179, score-0.467]

</p><p>54 Other types of wavelets can also be applied in the same manner and provide similar results, as long as they behave as a band-pass filter in the frequency domain. [sent-183, score-0.422]
</p><p>55 Results: Our algorithm was applied to and evaluated on various existing 3D shape mesh datasets: non-rigid world [1], benchmark [3], deformation transfer for triangle meshes data [20], LIRIS/EPFL general purpose data [13], and SHREC [2]. [sent-184, score-0.548]
</p><p>56 3, we show the performance of the algorithm as a function of the resolution parameter s keeping the shape mesh fixed (by varying s for  WR, we indirectly adjust the number of keypoints). [sent-188, score-0.399]

</p><p>58 As we move to finer segmentations, the model captures topological regions for perceptually meaningful sub-parts of each chess piece. [sent-201, score-0.264]

</p><p>61 We see that while our error summaries are not the best overall, the quality of segmentations given by our algorithm is highly competitive (among the best three) with the top shape segmentation methods available today. [sent-227, score-0.235]
</p><p>62 This behavior underscore the utility of a wavelet based model since the segmentation is driven by the multi-resolution encoding rather than a powerful clustering scheme. [sent-228, score-0.657]

</p><p>65 Wavelets based Alignment of 3-D Surfaces Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of multi-resolution wavelet based methods for deriving novel algorithms for alignment of a pair of 3-D surfaces. [sent-247, score-0.614]
</p><p>66 For example, weighted Spherical Harmonics can be used to represent the convoluted brain surface and the function defined on it, see [19, 7, 4]. [sent-250, score-0.369]
</p><p>67 Our goal here is to evaluate whether the framework developed in this paper can yield algorithms that avoid the sphere mapping step altogether, and perform direct alignment of the given surfaces accurately. [sent-253, score-0.201]
</p><p>68 We will define the wavelet basis on a surface manifold M (i. [sent-254, score-0.794]
</p><p>69 But wavelets are localized in both space and frequency, and wavelets with local support gives a solution to problems caused by the infinite support of Fourier bases. [sent-280, score-0.768]
</p><p>70 =0  Observe that convolution is the same as the spectral graph wavelet transformation described before. [sent-290, score-0.606]
</p><p>71 The following result proves that the solution to (12) can be obtained using these wavelet bases. [sent-291, score-0.508]
</p><p>72 The theorem shows that the objective function is minimized when the coefficient βl is the wavelet coefficient of vi. [sent-349, score-0.606]
</p><p>73 Further, we can force one manifold to have the same topological structure as another by resampling the wavelet coefficients from the second manifold and reconstructing it. [sent-350, score-0.689]
</p><p>74 Finally, vertex-wise matching can be obtained simply by solving for the minimum of the difference of a set of wavelet coefficients, which is exactly WD defined in Section 3. [sent-351, score-0.508]
</p><p>75 We next show our results for vertex matching and surface alignment which ensures that the two surfaces have identical mesh topology. [sent-355, score-0.782]
</p><p>76 Results: In order to evaluate the ideas above, we obtained a set of brain surface data that were affinely normalized. [sent-356, score-0.357]
</p><p>77 The first surface is the template surface and the second surface is a floating brain surface. [sent-358, score-0.837]
</p><p>78 When applied to a population of subjects, one may choose one individual’s brain surface as the template  (or atlas) and deform all other surfaces to it. [sent-359, score-0.492]
</p><p>79 Here, each surface consists of 6146 and 6555 vertices respectively and corresponds to a distinct cortical shape. [sent-362, score-0.358]

</p><p>84 Note that each surface has different mesh topologies, therefore preregistration surfaces have different eigenfunctions — Fig. [sent-368, score-0.611]
</p><p>85 After finding correspondences, we transform the floating surface to have the same topology as the template. [sent-370, score-0.397]
</p><p>86 The wavelet coefficients on each vertex in a subject/floating surface are sampled (using the correspondences) and the surface is reconstructed using the wavelet bases of the template surface. [sent-371, score-1.725]

<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>2 0.25505257 <a title="297-tfidf-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>

The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs. We express this wholly within the optical flow optimization, and show its application in a novel coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all trials on the Garg et al. dataset, and top tier performance on the Middlebury evaluation.</p><p>3 0.24364087 <a title="297-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressible_Motion_Fields.html">88 cvpr-2013-Compressible Motion Fields</a></p>

In this paper, we address the problem of estimating dense motion fields that, while accurately predicting one frame from a given reference frame by warping it with the field, are also compressible. We introduce a representation for motion fields based on wavelet bases, and approximate the compressibility of their coefficients with a piecewise smooth surrogate function that yields an objective function similar to classical optical flow formulations. We then show how to quantize and encode such coefficients with adaptive precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by com- paring its performance with a state-of-the-art wavelet video encoder. Experimental results on a number of standard flow and video datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms both block-based and optical-flow-based motion compensation algorithms.</p><p>4 0.19883727 <a title="297-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Mesh_Based_Semantic_Modelling_for_Indoor_and_Outdoor_Scenes.html">284 cvpr-2013-Mesh Based Semantic Modelling for Indoor and Outdoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien P.C. Valentin, Sunando Sengupta, Jonathan Warrell, Ali Shahrokni, Philip H.S. Torr</p><p>Abstract: Semantic reconstruction of a scene is important for a variety of applications such as 3D modelling, object recognition and autonomous robotic navigation. However, most object labelling methods work in the image domain and fail to capture the information present in 3D space. In this work we propose a principled way to generate object labelling in 3D. Our method builds a triangulated meshed representation of the scene from multiple depth estimates. We then define a CRF over this mesh, which is able to capture the consistency of geometric properties of the objects present in the scene. In this framework, we are able to generate object hypotheses by combining information from multiple sources: geometric properties (from the 3D mesh), and appearance properties (from images). We demonstrate the robustness of our framework in both indoor and outdoor scenes. For indoor scenes we created an augmented version of the NYU indoor scene dataset (RGB-D images) with object labelled meshes for training and evaluation. For outdoor scenes, we created ground truth object labellings for the KITTI odometry dataset (stereo image sequence). We observe a signifi- cant speed-up in the inference stage by performing labelling on the mesh, and additionally achieve higher accuracies.</p><p>5 0.18672435 <a title="297-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>

A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain.

<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks).

<p>Author: Zsolt Sánta, Zoltan Kato</p><p>Abstract: A novel correspondence-less approach is proposed to find a thin plate spline map between a pair of deformable 3D objects represented by triangular surface meshes. The proposed method works without landmark extraction and feature correspondences. The aligning transformation is found simply by solving a system of nonlinear equations. Each equation is generated by integrating a nonlinear function over the object’s domains. We derive recursive formulas for the efficient computation of these integrals. Based on a series of comparative tests on a large synthetic dataset, our triangular mesh-based algorithm outperforms state of the art methods both in terms of computing time and accuracy. The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the registration of 3D lung CT volumes.</p><p>3 0.80699009 <a title="297-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>4 0.8055014 <a title="297-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Area_Preserving_Brain_Mapping.html">44 cvpr-2013-Area Preserving Brain Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>5 0.79085749 <a title="297-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Computation_of_Shortest_Path-Concavity_for_3D_Meshes.html">141 cvpr-2013-Efficient Computation of Shortest Path-Concavity for 3D Meshes</a></p>
<p>Author: Henrik Zimmer, Marcel Campen, Leif Kobbelt</p><p>Abstract: In the context of shape segmentation and retrieval object-wide distributions of measures are needed to accurately evaluate and compare local regions ofshapes. Lien et al. [16] proposed two point-wise concavity measures in the context of Approximate Convex Decompositions of polygons measuring the distance from a point to the polygon ’s convex hull: an accurate Shortest Path-Concavity (SPC) measure and a Straight Line-Concavity (SLC) approximation of the same. While both are practicable on 2D shapes, the exponential costs of SPC in 3D makes it inhibitively expensive for a generalization to meshes [14]. In this paper we propose an efficient and straight forward approximation of the Shortest Path-Concavity measure to 3D meshes. Our approximation is based on discretizing the space between mesh and convex hull, thereby reducing the continuous Shortest Path search to an efficiently solvable graph problem. Our approach works outof-the-box on complex mesh topologies and requires no complicated handling of genus. Besides presenting a rigorous evaluation of our method on a variety of input meshes, we also define an SPC-based Shape Descriptor and show its superior retrieval and runtime performance compared with the recently presented results on the Convexity Distribution by Lian et al. [12].</p><p>6 0.73578447 <a title="297-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuichi Takeda, Shinsaku Hiura, Kosuke Sato</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel depth measurement method by fusing depth from defocus (DFD) and stereo. One of the problems of passive stereo method is the difficulty of finding correct correspondence between images when an object has a repetitive pattern or edges parallel to the epipolar line. On the other hand, the accuracy of DFD method is inherently limited by the effective diameter of the lens. Therefore, we propose the fusion of stereo method and DFD by giving different focus distances for left and right cameras of a stereo camera with coded apertures. Two types of depth cues, defocus and disparity, are naturally integrated by the magnification and phase shift of a single point spread function (PSF) per camera. In this paper we give the proof of the proportional relationship between the diameter of defocus and disparity which makes the calibration easy. We also show the outstanding performance of our method which has both advantages of two depth cues through simulation and actual experiments.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84878159 <a title="297-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>

<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.</p><p>4 0.82372016 <a title="297-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Cross-View_Action_Recognition_via_a_Continuous_Virtual_Path.html">98 cvpr-2013-Cross-View Action Recognition via a Continuous Virtual Path</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhong Zhang, Chunheng Wang, Baihua Xiao, Wen Zhou, Shuang Liu, Cunzhao Shi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for cross-view action recognition via a continuous virtual path which connects the source view and the target view. Each point on this virtual path is a virtual view which is obtained by a linear transformation of the action descriptor. All the virtual views are concatenated into an infinite-dimensional feature to characterize continuous changes from the source to the target view. However, these infinite-dimensional features cannot be used directly. Thus, we propose a virtual view kernel to compute the value of similarity between two infinite-dimensional features, which can be readily used to construct any kernelized classifiers. In addition, there are a lot of unlabeled samples from the target view, which can be utilized to improve the performance of classifiers. Thus, we present a constraint strategy to explore the information contained in the unlabeled samples. The rationality behind the constraint is that any action video belongs to only one class. Our method is verified on the IXMAS dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.80685741 <a title="297-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Color_Descriptors.html">130 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Color Descriptors</a></p>
<p>Author: Rahat Khan, Joost van_de_Weijer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Damien Muselet, Christophe Ducottet, Cecile Barat</p><p>Abstract: Color description is a challenging task because of large variations in RGB values which occur due to scene accidental events, such as shadows, shading, specularities, illuminant color changes, and changes in viewing geometry. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed by capturing the variations in physics-basedmodels, and deriving invariants for the undesired variations. The drawback of this approach is that sets of distinguishable colors in the original color space are mapped to the same value in the photometric invariant space. This results in a drop of discriminative power of the color description. In this paper we take an information theoretic approach to color description. We cluster color values together based on their discriminative power in a classification problem. The clustering has the explicit objective to minimize the drop of mutual information of the final representation. We show that such a color description automatically learns a certain degree of photometric invariance. We also show that a universal color representation, which is based on other data sets than the one at hand, can obtain competing performance. Experiments show that the proposed descriptor outperforms existing photometric invariants. Furthermore, we show that combined with shape description these color descriptors obtain excellent results on four challenging datasets, namely, PASCAL VOC 2007, Flowers-102, Stanford dogs-120 and Birds-200.</p><p>6 0.79280305 <a title="297-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Diffusion_Processes_for_Retrieval_Revisited.html">126 cvpr-2013-Diffusion Processes for Retrieval Revisited</a></p>

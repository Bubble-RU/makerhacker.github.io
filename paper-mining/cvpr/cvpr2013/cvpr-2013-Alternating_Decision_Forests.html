<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Ben Glocker, Christopher Zach, Shahram Izadi, Antonio Criminisi, Andrew Fitzgibbon</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel’s correspondence to 3D points in the scene ’s world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.</p><p>3 0.21863583 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-GeoF%3A_Geodesic_Forests_for_Learning_Coupled_Predictors.html">186 cvpr-2013-GeoF: Geodesic Forests for Learning Coupled Predictors</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Kontschieder, Pushmeet Kohli, Jamie Shotton, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Conventional decision forest based methods for image labelling tasks like object segmentation make predictions for each variable (pixel) independently [3, 5, 8]. This prevents them from enforcing dependencies between variables and translates into locally inconsistent pixel labellings. Random field models, instead, encourage spatial consistency of labels at increased computational expense. This paper presents a new and efficient forest based model that achieves spatially consistent semantic image segmentation by encoding variable dependencies directly in the feature space the forests operate on. Such correlations are captured via new long-range, soft connectivity features, computed via generalized geodesic distance transforms. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of the successful Semantic Texton Forest, Auto-Context, and Entangled Forest models. A second contribution is to show the connection between the typical Conditional Random Field (CRF) energy and the forest training objective. This analysis yields a new objective for training decision forests that encourages more accurate structured prediction. Our GeoF model is validated quantitatively on the task of semantic image segmentation, on four challenging and very diverse image datasets. GeoF outperforms both stateof-the-art forest models and the conventional pairwise CRF.</p><p>4 0.17439948 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Node_Splitting_for_Random_Forest_Construction.html">390 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Node Splitting for Random Forest Construction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Liu, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao, Zicheng Liu, Luming Zhang, Chun Chen, Jiajun Bu</p><p>Abstract: Node splitting is an important issue in Random Forest but robust splitting requires a large number of training samples. Existing solutions fail to properly partition the feature space if there are insufficient training data. In this paper, we present semi-supervised splitting to overcome this limitation by splitting nodes with the guidance of both labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, we derive a nonparametric algorithm to obtain an accurate quality measure of splitting by incorporating abundant unlabeled data. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we project the data points from the original high-dimensional feature space onto a low-dimensional subspace before estimation. A unified optimization framework is proposed to select a coupled pair of subspace and separating hyperplane such that the smoothness of the subspace and the quality of the splitting are guaranteed simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised algorithms for typical computer vision applications such as object categorization and image segmen- tation. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p><p>5 0.13216792 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Label_Trees_for_Efficient_Large_Scale_Image_Classification.html">340 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Label Trees for Efficient Large Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Liu, Fereshteh Sadeghi, Marshall Tappen, Ohad Shamir, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale recognition problems with thousands of classes pose a particular challenge because applying the classifier requires more computation as the number of classes grows. The label tree model integrates classification with the traversal of the tree so that complexity grows logarithmically. In this paper, we show how the parameters of the label tree can be found using maximum likelihood estimation. This new probabilistic learning technique produces a label tree with significantly improved recognition accuracy.</p><p>6 0.12868653 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>

<p>Author: Raphael Sznitman, Carlos Becker, François Fleuret, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: Cascade-style approaches to implementing ensemble classifiers can deliver significant speed-ups at test time. While highly effective, they remain challenging to tune and their overall performance depends on the availability of large validation sets to estimate rejection thresholds. These characteristics are often prohibitive and thus limit their applicability. We introduce an alternative approach to speeding-up classifier evaluation which overcomes these limitations. It involves maintaining a probability estimate of the class label at each intermediary response and stopping when the corresponding uncertainty becomes small enough. As a result, the evaluation terminates early based on the sequence of responses observed. Furthermore, it does so independently of the type of ensemble classifier used or the way it was trained. We show through extensive experimentation that our method provides 2 to 10 fold speed-ups, over existing state-of-the-art methods, at almost no loss in accuracy on a number of object classification tasks.</p><p>6 0.55702794 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Leveraging_Structure_from_Motion_to_Learn_Discriminative_Codebooks_for_Scalable_Landmark_Classification.html">268 cvpr-2013-Leveraging Structure from Motion to Learn Discriminative Codebooks for Scalable Landmark Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Ismail Ben Ayed, Lena Gorelick, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Several recent studies demonstrated that higher order (non-linear) functionals can yield outstanding performances in the contexts of segmentation, co-segmentation and tracking. In general, higher order functionals result in difficult problems that are not amenable to standard optimizers, and most of the existing works investigated particular forms of such functionals. In this study, we derive general bounds for a broad class of higher order functionals. By introducing auxiliary variables and invoking the Jensen ’s inequality as well as some convexity arguments, we prove that these bounds are auxiliary functionals for various non-linear terms, which include but are not limited to several affinity measures on the distributions or moments of segment appearance and shape, as well as soft constraints on segment volume. From these general-form bounds, we state various non-linear problems as the optimization of auxiliary functionals by graph cuts. The proposed bound optimizers are derivative-free, and consistently yield very steep functional decreases, thereby converging within a few graph cuts. We report several experiments on color and medical data, along with quantitative comparisons to stateof-the-art methods. The results demonstrate competitive performances of the proposed algorithms in regard to accuracy and convergence speed, and confirm their potential in various vision and medical applications.</p><p>3 0.7035051 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Sifre, Stéphane Mallat</p><p>Abstract: An affine invariant representation is constructed with a cascade of invariants, which preserves information for classification. A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained over texture databases with uncontrolled viewing conditions.</p><p>4 0.70127648 <a title="39-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploiting_the_Power_of_Stereo_Confidences.html">155 cvpr-2013-Exploiting the Power of Stereo Confidences</a></p>
<p>Author: David Pfeiffer, Stefan Gehrig, Nicolai Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Applications based on stereo vision are becoming increasingly common, ranging from gaming over robotics to driver assistance. While stereo algorithms have been investigated heavily both on the pixel and the application level, far less attention has been dedicated to the use of stereo confidence cues. Mostly, a threshold is applied to the confidence values for further processing, which is essentially a sparsified disparity map. This is straightforward but it does not take full advantage of the available information. In this paper, we make full use of the stereo confidence cues by propagating all confidence values along with the measured disparities in a Bayesian manner. Before using this information, a mapping from confidence values to disparity outlier probability rate is performed based on gathered disparity statistics from labeled video data. We present an extension of the so called Stixel World, a generic 3D intermediate representation that can serve as input for many of the applications mentioned above. This scheme is modified to directly exploit stereo confidence cues in the underlying sensor model during a maximum a poste- riori estimation process. The effectiveness of this step is verified in an in-depth evaluation on a large real-world traffic data base of which parts are made publicly available. We show that using stereo confidence cues allows both reducing the number of false object detections by a factor of six while keeping the detection rate at a near constant level.</p><p>5 0.70017338 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Patch_Match_Filter%3A_Efficient_Edge-Aware_Filtering_Meets_Randomized_Search_for_Fast_Correspondence_Field_Estimation.html">326 cvpr-2013-Patch Match Filter: Efficient Edge-Aware Filtering Meets Randomized Search for Fast Correspondence Field Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiangbo Lu, Hongsheng Yang, Dongbo Min, Minh N. Do</p><p>Abstract: Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient edge-aware filters have provided a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the label space size. When the label space is huge, which is often the case for (subpixelaccurate) stereo and optical flow estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable. Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). For the very first time, we explore effective and efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into compact superpixels, we also propose superpixelbased novel search strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. Focusing on dense correspondence field estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF’s applications in stereo and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve state-of-the-art correspondence accuracy but run much faster than other competing methods, often giving over 10-times speedup for large label space cases.</p><p>6 0.69977838 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Learning_for_Confidence_Measures_in_Stereo_Vision.html">147 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Learning for Confidence Measures in Stereo Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenbin Li, Darren Cosker, Matthew Brown, Rui Tang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel non-rigid optical flow algorithm for dense image correspondence and non-rigid registration. The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs. We express this wholly within the optical flow optimization, and show its application in a novel coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach.

<p>Author: Julien P.C. Valentin, Sunando Sengupta, Jonathan Warrell, Ali Shahrokni, Philip H.S. Torr</p><p>Abstract: Semantic reconstruction of a scene is important for a variety of applications such as 3D modelling, object recognition and autonomous robotic navigation. However, most object labelling methods work in the image domain and fail to capture the information present in 3D space. In this work we propose a principled way to generate object labelling in 3D. Our method builds a triangulated meshed representation of the scene from multiple depth estimates. We then define a CRF over this mesh, which is able to capture the consistency of geometric properties of the objects present in the scene. In this framework, we are able to generate object hypotheses by combining information from multiple sources: geometric properties (from the 3D mesh), and appearance properties (from images). We demonstrate the robustness of our framework in both indoor and outdoor scenes. For indoor scenes we created an augmented version of the NYU indoor scene dataset (RGB-D images) with object labelled meshes for training and evaluation. For outdoor scenes, we created ground truth object labellings for the KITTI odometry dataset (stereo image sequence). We observe a signifi- cant speed-up in the inference stage by performing labelling on the mesh, and additionally achieve higher accuracies.</p><p>4 0.15251639 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less_Non-rigid_Registration_of_Triangular_Surface_Meshes.html">97 cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less Non-rigid Registration of Triangular Surface Meshes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zsolt Sánta, Zoltan Kato</p><p>Abstract: A novel correspondence-less approach is proposed to find a thin plate spline map between a pair of deformable 3D objects represented by triangular surface meshes. The proposed method works without landmark extraction and feature correspondences. The aligning transformation is found simply by solving a system of nonlinear equations. Each equation is generated by integrating a nonlinear function over the object’s domains. We derive recursive formulas for the efficient computation of these integrals. Based on a series of comparative tests on a large synthetic dataset, our triangular mesh-based algorithm outperforms state of the art methods both in terms of computing time and accuracy. The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the registration of 3D lung CT volumes.</p><p>5 0.1415728 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>6 0.088973008 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Iterated_L1_Algorithm_for_Non-smooth_Non-convex_Optimization_in_Computer_Vision.html">41 cvpr-2013-An Iterated L1 Algorithm for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization in Computer Vision</a></p>

In this paper we propose an efficient and straight forward approximation of the Shortest Path-Concavity measure to 3D meshes. Our approximation is based on discretizing the space between mesh and convex hull, thereby reducing the continuous Shortest Path search to an efficiently solvable graph problem. Our approach works outof-the-box on complex mesh topologies and requires no complicated handling of genus. Besides presenting a rigorous evaluation of our method on a variety of input meshes, we also define an SPC-based Shape Descriptor and show its superior retrieval and runtime performance compared with the recently presented results on the Convexity Distribution by Lian et al. [12].</p><p>2 0.65121603 <a title="141-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Max-Margin_Riffled_Independence_Model_for_Image_Tag_Ranking.html">18 cvpr-2013-A Max-Margin Riffled Independence Model for Image Tag Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Tian Lan, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose Max-Margin Riffled Independence Model (MMRIM), a new method for image tag ranking modeling the structured preferences among tags. The goal is to predict a ranked tag list for a given image, where tags are ordered by their importance or relevance to the image content. Our model integrates the max-margin formalism with riffled independence factorizations proposed in [10], which naturally allows for structured learning and efficient ranking. Experimental results on the SUN Attribute and LabelMe datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with baseline tag ranking methods. We also apply the predicted rank list of tags to several higher-level computer vision applications in image understanding and retrieval, and demonstrate that MMRIM significantly improves the accuracy of these applications.</p><p>3 0.53553808 <a title="141-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Methods_on_the_Riemannian_Manifold_of_Symmetric_Positive_Definite_Matrices.html">238 cvpr-2013-Kernel Methods on the Riemannian Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>4 0.52761871 <a title="141-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Understanding_from_Experts%27_Eyes_by_Modeling_Perceptual_Skill_of_Diagnostic_Reasoning_Processes.html">214 cvpr-2013-Image Understanding from Experts' Eyes by Modeling Perceptual Skill of Diagnostic Reasoning Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Li, Pengcheng Shi, Anne R. Haake</p><p>Abstract: Eliciting and representing experts ’ remarkable perceptual capability of locating, identifying and categorizing objects in images specific to their domains of expertise will benefit image understanding in terms of transferring human domain knowledge and perceptual expertise into image-based computational procedures. In this paper, we present a hierarchical probabilistic framework to summarize the stereotypical and idiosyncratic eye movement patterns shared within 11 board-certified dermatologists while they are examining and diagnosing medical images. Each inferred eye movement pattern characterizes the similar temporal and spatial properties of its corresponding seg. edu anne .haake @ rit . edu , ments of the experts ’ eye movement sequences. We further discover a subset of distinctive eye movement patterns which are commonly exhibited across multiple images. Based on the combinations of the exhibitions of these eye movement patterns, we are able to categorize the images from the perspective of experts’ viewing strategies. In each category, images share similar lesion distributions and configurations. The performance of our approach shows that modeling physicians ’ diagnostic viewing behaviors informs about medical images’ understanding to correct diagnosis.</p><p>5 0.49716666 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichiro Yamaguchi, David McAllester, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing optical flow in monocular video taken from a moving vehicle. In this setting, the vast majority of image flow is due to the vehicle ’s ego-motion. We propose to take advantage of this fact and estimate flow along the epipolar lines of the egomotion. Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.</p><p>6 0.49350876 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up_Segmentation_for_Top-Down_Detection.html">70 cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up Segmentation for Top-Down Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Kae, Kihyuk Sohn, Honglak Lee, Erik Learned-Miller</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random fields (CRFs) provide powerful tools for building models to label image segments. They are particularly well-suited to modeling local interactions among adjacent regions (e.g., superpixels). However, CRFs are limited in dealing with complex, global (long-range) interactions between regions. Complementary to this, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) can be used to model global shapes produced by segmentation models. In this work, we present a new model that uses the combined power of these two network types to build a state-of-the-art labeler. Although the CRF is a good baseline labeler, we show how an RBM can be added to the architecture to provide a global shape bias that complements the local modeling provided by the CRF. We demonstrate its labeling performance for the parts of complex face images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set. This hybrid model produces results that are both quantitatively and qualitatively better than the CRF alone. In addition to high-quality labeling results, we demonstrate that the hidden units in the RBM portion of our model can be interpreted as face attributes that have been learned without any attribute-level supervision.</p><p>3 0.20894049 <a title="467-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based_Face_Parsing.html">152 cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based Face Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon M. Smith, Li Zhang, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an exemplar-based face image segmentation algorithm. We take inspiration from previous works on image parsing for general scenes. Our approach assumes a database of exemplar face images, each of which is associated with a hand-labeled segmentation map. Given a test image, our algorithm first selects a subset of exemplar images from the database, Our algorithm then computes a nonrigid warp for each exemplar image to align it with the test image. Finally, we propagate labels from the exemplar images to the test image in a pixel-wise manner, using trained weights to modulate and combine label maps from different exemplars. We evaluate our method on two challenging datasets and compare with two face parsing algorithms and a general scene parsing algorithm. We also compare our segmentation results with contour-based face alignment results; that is, we first run the alignment algorithms to extract contour points and then derive segments from the contours. Our algorithm compares favorably with all previous works on all datasets evaluated.</p><p>4 0.076415025 <a title="467-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Expanded_Parts_Model_for_Human_Attribute_and_Action_Recognition_in_Still_Images.html">153 cvpr-2013-Expanded Parts Model for Human Attribute and Action Recognition in Still Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Gaurav Sharma, Frédéric Jurie, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for recognizing human attributes (e.g. wearing a suit, sitting, short hair) and actions (e.g. running, riding a horse) in still images. The proposed model relies on a collection of part templates which are learnt discriminatively to explain specific scale-space locations in the images (in human centric coordinates). It avoids the limitations of highly structured models, which consist of a few (i.e. a mixture of) ‘average ’ templates. To learn our model, we propose an algorithm which automatically mines out parts and learns corresponding discriminative templates with their respective locations from a large number of candidate parts. We validate the method on recent challenging datasets: (i) Willow 7 actions [7], (ii) 27 Human Attributes (HAT) [25], and (iii) Stanford 40 actions [37]. We obtain convincing qualitative and state-of-the-art quantitative results on the three datasets.</p><p>5 0.071333952 <a title="467-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Shape_from_Silhouette_Probability_Maps%3A_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects_in_the_Presence_of_Silhouette_Extraction_and_Calibration_Error.html">395 cvpr-2013-Shape from Silhouette Probability Maps: Reconstruction of Thin Objects in the Presence of Silhouette Extraction and Calibration Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Amy Tabb</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the shape ofthin, texture-less objects such as leafless trees when there is noise or deterministic error in the silhouette extraction step or there are small errors in camera calibration. Traditional intersection-based techniques such as the visual hull are not robust to error because they penalize false negative and false positive error unequally. We provide a voxel-based formalism that penalizes false negative and positive error equally, by casting the reconstruction problem as a pseudo-Boolean minimization problem, where voxels are the variables of a pseudo-Boolean function and are labeled occupied or empty. Since the pseudo-Boolean minimization problem is NP-Hard for nonsubmodular functions, we developed an algorithm for an approximate solution using local minimum search. Our algorithm treats input binary probability maps (in other words, silhouettes) or continuously-valued probability maps identically, and places no constraints on camera placement. The algorithm was tested on three different leafless trees and one metal object where the number of voxels is 54.4 million (voxel sides measure 3.6 mm). Results show that our . usda .gov (a)Orignalimage(b)SilhoueteProbabiltyMap approach reconstructs the complicated branching structure of thin, texture-less objects in the presence of error where intersection-based approaches currently fail. 1</p><p>6 0.066776998 <a title="467-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_the_Visual_Comprehension_of_Point_Sets.html">218 cvpr-2013-Improving the Visual Comprehension of Point Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that a surface deforming isometrically can be reconstructed from a single image and a template 3D shape. Methods from the literature solve this problem efficiently. However, they all assume that the camera model is calibrated, which drastically limits their applicability. We propose (i) a general variational framework that applies to (calibrated and uncalibrated) general camera models and (ii) self-calibrating 3D reconstruction algorithms for the weak-perspective and full-perspective camera models. In the former case, our algorithm returns the normal field and camera ’s scale factor. In the latter case, our algorithm returns the normal field, depth and camera ’s focal length. Our algorithms are the first to achieve deformable 3D reconstruction including camera self-calibration. They apply to much more general setups than existing methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms give results with the same level of accuracy as existing methods (which use the true focal length) on perspective images, and correctly find the normal field on affine images for which the existing methods fail.</p><p>4 0.47563571 <a title="467-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Monocular_Template-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Extensible_Surfaces_with_Local_Linear_Elasticity.html">289 cvpr-2013-Monocular Template-Based 3D Reconstruction of Extensible Surfaces with Local Linear Elasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Abed Malti, Richard Hartley, Adrien Bartoli, Jae-Hak Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for template-based extensible surface reconstruction from a single view. We extend the method of isometric surface reconstruction and more recent work on conformal surface reconstruction. Our approach relies on the minimization of a proposed stretching energy formalized with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter of the surface. We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>5 0.44148636 <a title="467-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Relative_Volume_Constraints_for_Single_View_3D_Reconstruction.html">354 cvpr-2013-Relative Volume Constraints for Single View 3D Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Eno Töppe, Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of relative volume constraints in order to account for insufficient information in the reconstruction of 3D objects from a single image. The key idea is to formulate a variational reconstruction approach with shape priors in form of relative depth profiles or volume ratios relating object parts. Such shape priors can easily be derived either from a user sketch or from the object’s shading profile in the image. They can handle textured or shadowed object regions by propagating information. We propose a convex relaxation of the constrained optimization problem which can be solved optimally in a few seconds on graphics hardware. In contrast to existing single view reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithm provides substantially more flexibility to recover shape details such as self-occlusions, dents and holes, which are not visible in the object silhouette.</p><p>6 0.43240717 <a title="467-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>

<p>Author: Mao Ye, Cha Zhang, Ruigang Yang</p><p>Abstract: With the wide-spread of consumer 3D-TV technology, stereoscopic videoconferencing systems are emerging. However, the special glasses participants wear to see 3D can create distracting images. This paper presents a computational framework to reduce undesirable artifacts in the eye regions caused by these 3D glasses. More specifically, we add polarized filters to the stereo camera so that partial images of reflection can be captured. A novel Bayesian model is then developed to describe the imaging process of the eye regions including darkening and reflection, and infer the eye regions based on Classification ExpectationMaximization (EM). The recovered eye regions under the glasses are brighter and with little reflections, leading to a more nature videoconferencing experience. Qualitative evaluations and user studies are conducted to demonstrate the substantial improvement our approach can achieve.</p><p>3 0.63436407 <a title="467-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fine-Grained_Crowdsourcing_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition.html">174 cvpr-2013-Fine-Grained Crowdsourcing for Fine-Grained Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Deng, Jonathan Krause, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition concerns categorization at sub-ordinate levels, where the distinction between object classes is highly local. Compared to basic level recognition, fine-grained categorization can be more challenging as there are in general less data and fewer discriminative features. This necessitates the use of stronger prior for feature selection. In this work, we include humans in the loop to help computers select discriminative features. We introduce a novel online game called “Bubbles ” that reveals discriminative features humans use. The player’s goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image. During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of circular regions ( “bubbles”), with a certain penalty. With proper setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality. We next propose the “BubbleBank” algorithm that uses the human selected bubbles to improve machine recognition performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields large improvements over the previous state of the art on challenging benchmarks.</p><p>4 0.56293482 <a title="467-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Visual_Proxemics%3A_Recognizing_Human_Interactions_in_3D_from_a_Single_Image.html">4 cvpr-2013-3D Visual Proxemics: Recognizing Human Interactions in 3D from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Ishani Chakraborty, Hui Cheng, Omar Javed</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified framework for detecting and classifying people interactions in unconstrained user generated images. 1 Unlike previous approaches that directly map people/face locations in 2D image space into features for classification, we first estimate camera viewpoint and people positions in 3D space and then extract spatial configuration features from explicit 3D people positions. This approach has several advantages. First, it can accurately estimate relative distances and orientations between people in 3D. Second, it encodes spatial arrangements of people into a richer set of shape descriptors than afforded in 2D. Our 3D shape descriptors are invariant to camera pose variations often seen in web images and videos. The proposed approach also estimates camera pose and uses it to capture the intent of the photo. To achieve accurate 3D people layout estimation, we develop an algorithm that robustly fuses semantic constraints about human interpositions into a linear camera model. This enables our model to handle large variations in people size, heights (e.g. age) and poses. An accurate 3D layout also allows us to construct features informed by Proxemics that improves our semantic classification. To characterize the human interaction space, we introduce visual proxemes; a set of prototypical patterns that represent commonly occurring social interactions in events. We train a discriminative classifier that classifies 3D arrangements of people into visual proxemes and quantitatively evaluate the performance on a large, challenging dataset.</p><p>5 0.55355632 <a title="467-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>6 0.53402489 <a title="467-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-source_Multi-scale_Counting_in_Extremely_Dense_Crowd_Images.html">299 cvpr-2013-Multi-source Multi-scale Counting in Extremely Dense Crowd Images</a></p>

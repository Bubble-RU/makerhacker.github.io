<p>Author: Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: Under unknown directional lighting, the uncalibrated Lambertian photometric stereo algorithm recovers the shape of a smooth surface up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We resolve this ambiguity from the halfvector symmetry, which is observed in many isotropic materials. Under this symmetry, a 2D BRDF slice with low-rank structure can be obtained from an image, if the surface normals and light directions are correctly recovered. In general, this structure is destroyed by the GBR ambiguity. As a result, we can resolve the ambiguity by restoring this structure. We develop a simple algorithm of auto-calibration from separable homogeneous specular reflection of real images. Compared with previous methods, this method takes a holistic approach to exploiting reflectance symmetry and produces superior results.</p><p>3 0.41944399 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Object_Motion_Reveals_about_Shape_with_Unknown_BRDF_and_Lighting.html">465 cvpr-2013-What Object Motion Reveals about Shape with Unknown BRDF and Lighting</a></p>
<p>Author: Manmohan Chandraker, Dikpal Reddy, Yizhou Wang, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a theory that addresses the problem of determining shape from the (small or differential) motion of an object with unknown isotropic reflectance, under arbitrary unknown distant illumination, , for both orthographic and perpsective projection. Our theory imposes fundamental limits on the hardness of surface reconstruction, independent of the method involved. Under orthographic projection, we prove that three differential motions suffice to yield an invariant that relates shape to image derivatives, regardless of BRDF and illumination. Under perspective projection, we show that four differential motions suffice to yield depth and a linear constraint on the surface gradient, with unknown BRDF and lighting. Further, we delineate the topological classes up to which reconstruction may be achieved using the invariants. Finally, we derive a general stratification that relates hardness of shape recovery to scene complexity. Qualitatively, our invariants are homogeneous partial differential equations for simple lighting and inhomogeneous for complex illumination. Quantitatively, our framework shows that the minimal number of motions required to resolve shape is greater for more complex scenes. Prior works that assume brightness constancy, Lambertian BRDF or a known directional light source follow as special cases of our stratification. We illustrate with synthetic and real data how potential reconstruction methods may exploit our framework.</p><p>4 0.3035557 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenglong Zhou, Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to capture both 3D shape and spatially varying reflectance with a multi-view photometric stereo technique that works for general isotropic materials. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera and a handheld light source. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction (BRDF) is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. According to our experiments, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.3 millimeters. The captured reflectance has relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9%.</p><p>5 0.21627802 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Discriminative_Illumination_and_Filters_for_Raw_Material_Classification_with_Optimal_Projections_of_Bidirectional_Texture_Functions.html">251 cvpr-2013-Learning Discriminative Illumination and Filters for Raw Material Classification with Optimal Projections of Bidirectional Texture Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Liu, Geifei Yang, Jinwei Gu</p><p>Abstract: We present a computational imaging method for raw material classification using features of Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Texture is an intrinsic feature for many materials, such as wood, fabric, and granite. At appropriate scales, even “uniform” materials will also exhibit texture features that can be helpful for recognition, such as paper, metal, and ceramic. To cope with the high-dimensionality of BTFs, in this paper, we proposed to learn discriminative illumination patterns and texture filters, with which we can directly measure optimal projections of BTFs for classification. We also studied the effects of texture rotation and scale variation for material classification. We built an LED-based multispectral dome, with which we have acquired a BTF database of a variety of materials and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for material classification.</p><p>6 0.15793027 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Analytic_Bilinear_Appearance_Subspace_Construction_for_Modeling_Image_Irradiance_under_Natural_Illumination_and_Non-Lambertian_Reflectance.html">42 cvpr-2013-Analytic Bilinear Appearance Subspace Construction for Modeling Image Irradiance under Natural Illumination and Non-Lambertian Reflectance</a></p>

<p>Author: Shireen Y. Elhabian, Aly A. Farag</p><p>Abstract: Conventional subspace construction approaches suffer from the need of “large-enough ” image ensemble rendering numerical methods intractable. In this paper, we propose an analytic formulation for low-dimensional subspace construction in which shading cues lie while preserving the natural structure of an image sample. Using the frequencyspace representation of the image irradiance equation, the process of finding such subspace is cast as establishing a relation between its principal components and that of a deterministic set of basis functions, termed as irradiance harmonics. Representing images as matrices further lessen the number of parameters to be estimated to define a bilinear projection which maps the image sample to a lowerdimensional bilinear subspace. Results show significant impact on dimensionality reduction with minimal loss of information as well as robustness against noise.</p><p>6 0.53470969 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Discriminative_Illumination_and_Filters_for_Raw_Material_Classification_with_Optimal_Projections_of_Bidirectional_Texture_Functions.html">251 cvpr-2013-Learning Discriminative Illumination and Filters for Raw Material Classification with Optimal Projections of Bidirectional Texture Functions</a></p>

This is in contrast to earlier approaches that usually assume a tree topology for the networks. At the heart of our method is an Integer Programming formulation that allows us to find the global optimum of an objective function designed to allow cycles but penalize spurious junctions and early terminations.

<p>Author: Masaki Saito, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inference of marginal densities based on MRF models. The optimization algorithmsfor continuous variables are only applicable to a limited number of problems, whereas those for discrete variables are versatile. Thus, it is quite common to convert the continuous variables into discrete ones for the problems that ideally should be solved in the continuous domain, such as stereo matching and optical flow estimation. In this paper, we show a novel formulation for this continuous-discrete conversion. The key idea is to estimate the marginal densities in the continuous domain by approximating them with mixtures of rectangular densities. Based on this formulation, we derive a mean field (MF) algorithm and a belief propagation (BP) algorithm. These algorithms can correctly handle the case where the variable space is discretized in a non-uniform manner. By intentionally using such a non-uniform discretization, a higher balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of marginal density estimates could be achieved. We present a method for actually doing this, which dynamically discretizes the variable space in a coarse-to-fine manner in the course of the computation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>4 0.71716046 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Shape_from_Silhouette_Probability_Maps%3A_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects_in_the_Presence_of_Silhouette_Extraction_and_Calibration_Error.html">395 cvpr-2013-Shape from Silhouette Probability Maps: Reconstruction of Thin Objects in the Presence of Silhouette Extraction and Calibration Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Amy Tabb</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the shape ofthin, texture-less objects such as leafless trees when there is noise or deterministic error in the silhouette extraction step or there are small errors in camera calibration. Traditional intersection-based techniques such as the visual hull are not robust to error because they penalize false negative and false positive error unequally. We provide a voxel-based formalism that penalizes false negative and positive error equally, by casting the reconstruction problem as a pseudo-Boolean minimization problem, where voxels are the variables of a pseudo-Boolean function and are labeled occupied or empty. Since the pseudo-Boolean minimization problem is NP-Hard for nonsubmodular functions, we developed an algorithm for an approximate solution using local minimum search. Our algorithm treats input binary probability maps (in other words, silhouettes) or continuously-valued probability maps identically, and places no constraints on camera placement. The algorithm was tested on three different leafless trees and one metal object where the number of voxels is 54.4 million (voxel sides measure 3.6 mm). Results show that our . usda .gov (a)Orignalimage(b)SilhoueteProbabiltyMap approach reconstructs the complicated branching structure of thin, texture-less objects in the presence of error where intersection-based approaches currently fail. 1</p><p>5 0.66515493 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-The_SVM-Minus_Similarity_Score_for_Video_Face_Recognition.html">430 cvpr-2013-The SVM-Minus Similarity Score for Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Noga Levy</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained videos requires specialized tools beyond those developed for still images: the fact that the confounding factors change state during the video sequence presents a unique challenge, but also an opportunity to eliminate spurious similarities. Luckily, a major source of confusion in visual similarity of faces is the 3D head orientation, for which image analysis tools provide an accurate estimation. The method we propose belongs to a family of classifierbased similarity scores. We present an effective way to discount pose induced similarities within such a framework, which is based on a newly introduced classifier called SVMminus. The presented method is shown to outperform existing techniques on the most challenging and realistic publicly available video face recognition benchmark, both by itself, and in concert with other methods.</p><p>6 0.6250385 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Sub-categorization.html">134 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Sub-categorization</a></p>

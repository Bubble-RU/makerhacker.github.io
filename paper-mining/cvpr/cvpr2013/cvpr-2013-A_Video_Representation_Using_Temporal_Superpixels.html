<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>3 0.32900128 <a title="29-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Label_Propagation_from_ImageNet_to_3D_Point_Clouds.html">242 cvpr-2013-Label Propagation from ImageNet to 3D Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Wang, Rongrong Ji, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understanding the semantics of point clouds in a wide variety of applications. However, point cloud labeling remains an open problem, due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient 3D point labels towards training effective classifiers. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the existing massive 2D semantic labeled datasets from decadelong community efforts, such as ImageNet and LabelMe, and a novel “cross-domain ” label propagation approach. Our proposed method consists of two major novel components, Exemplar SVM based label propagation, which effectively addresses the cross-domain issue, and a graphical model based contextual refinement incorporating 3D constraints. Most importantly, the entire process does not require any training data from the target scenes, also with good scalability towards large scale applications. We evaluate our approach on the well-known Cornell Point Cloud Dataset, achieving much greater efficiency and comparable accuracy even without any 3D training data. Our approach shows further major gains in accuracy when the training data from the target scenes is used, outperforming state-ofthe-art approaches with far better efficiency.</p><p>4 0.32353228 <a title="29-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Voxel_Cloud_Connectivity_Segmentation_-_Supervoxels_for_Point_Clouds.html">458 cvpr-2013-Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation - Supervoxels for Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremie Papon, Alexey Abramov, Markus Schoeler, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised over-segmentation of an image into regions of perceptually similar pixels, known as superpixels, is a widely used preprocessing step in segmentation algorithms. Superpixel methods reduce the number of regions that must be considered later by more computationally expensive algorithms, with a minimal loss of information. Nevertheless, as some information is inevitably lost, it is vital that superpixels not cross object boundaries, as such errors will propagate through later steps. Existing methods make use of projected color or depth information, but do not consider three dimensional geometric relationships between observed data points which can be used to prevent superpixels from crossing regions of empty space. We propose a novel over-segmentation algorithm which uses voxel relationships to produce over-segmentations which are fully consistent with the spatial geometry of the scene in three dimensional, rather than projective, space. Enforcing the constraint that segmented regions must have spatial connectivity prevents label flow across semantic object boundaries which might otherwise be violated. Additionally, as the algorithm works directly in 3D space, observations from several calibrated RGB+D cameras can be segmented jointly. Experiments on a large data set of human annotated RGB+D images demonstrate a significant reduction in occurrence of clusters crossing object boundaries, while maintaining speeds comparable to state-of-the-art 2D methods.</p><p>5 0.27751437 <a title="29-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonparametric_Scene_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Feature_Relevance_and_Semantic_Context.html">309 cvpr-2013-Nonparametric Scene Parsing with Adaptive Feature Relevance and Semantic Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Gautam Singh, Jana Kosecka</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a nonparametric approach to semantic parsing using small patches and simple gradient, color and location features. We learn the relevance of individual feature channels at test time using a locally adaptive distance metric. To further improve the accuracy of the nonparametric approach, we examine the importance of the retrieval set used to compute the nearest neighbours using a novel semantic descriptor to retrieve better candidates. The approach is validated by experiments on several datasets used for semantic parsing demonstrating the superiority of the method compared to the state of art approaches.</p><p>6 0.27069956 <a title="29-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Region_Grouping_via_Internal_Patch_Statistics.html">366 cvpr-2013-Robust Region Grouping via Internal Patch Statistics</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaobai Liu, Liang Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient multi-scale low-rank representation for image segmentation. Our method begins with partitioning the input images into a set of superpixels, followed by seeking the optimal superpixel-pair affinity matrix, both of which are performed at multiple scales of the input images. Since low-level superpixel features are usually corrupted by image noises, we propose to infer the low-rank refined affinity matrix. The inference is guided by two observations on natural images. First, looking into a single image, local small-size image patterns tend to recur frequently within the same semantic region, but may not appear in semantically different regions. We call this internal image statistics as replication prior, and quantitatively justify it on real image databases. Second, the affinity matrices at different scales should be consistently solved, which leads to the cross-scale consistency constraint. We formulate these two purposes with one unified formulation and develop an efficient optimization procedure. Our experiments demonstrate the presented method can substantially improve segmentation accuracy.</p><p>3 0.72044784 <a title="29-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Graphlet_Cut%3A_Exploiting_Spatial_Structure_Cue_for_Weakly_Supervised_Image_Segmentation.html">339 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Graphlet Cut: Exploiting Spatial Structure Cue for Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Luming Zhang, Mingli Song, Zicheng Liu, Xiao Liu, Jiajun Bu, Chun Chen</p><p>Abstract: Weakly supervised image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision field. In this paper, we present a new weakly supervised image segmentation algorithm by learning the distribution of spatially structured superpixel sets from image-level labels. Specifically, we first extract graphlets from each image where a graphlet is a smallsized graph consisting of superpixels as its nodes and it encapsulates the spatial structure of those superpixels. Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transform graphlets of different sizes into equal-length feature vectors. Thereafter, we use GMM to learn the distribution of the post-embedding graphlets. Finally, we propose a novel image segmentation algorithm, called graphlet cut, that leverages the learned graphlet distribution in measuring the homogeneity of a set of spatially structured superpixels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised image segmentation methods, and its performance is comparable to those of the fully supervised segmentation models.</p><p>4 0.72028214 <a title="29-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Voxel_Cloud_Connectivity_Segmentation_-_Supervoxels_for_Point_Clouds.html">458 cvpr-2013-Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation - Supervoxels for Point Clouds</a></p>

<p>Author: Shaodi You, Robby T. Tan, Rei Kawakami, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p><p>Abstract: Raindrops adhered to a windscreen or window glass can significantly degrade the visibility of a scene. Detecting and removing raindrops will, therefore, benefit many computer vision applications, particularly outdoor surveillance systems and intelligent vehicle systems. In this paper, a method that automatically detects and removes adherent raindrops is introduced. The core idea is to exploit the local spatiotemporal derivatives ofraindrops. First, it detects raindrops based on the motion and the intensity temporal derivatives of the input video. Second, relying on an analysis that some areas of a raindrop completely occludes the scene, yet the remaining areas occludes only partially, the method removes the two types of areas separately. For partially occluding areas, it restores them by retrieving as much as possible information of the scene, namely, by solving a blending function on the detected partially occluding areas using the temporal intensity change. For completely occluding areas, it recovers them by using a video completion technique. Experimental results using various real videos show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>2 0.7891404 <a title="29-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Patch_Match_Filter%3A_Efficient_Edge-Aware_Filtering_Meets_Randomized_Search_for_Fast_Correspondence_Field_Estimation.html">326 cvpr-2013-Patch Match Filter: Efficient Edge-Aware Filtering Meets Randomized Search for Fast Correspondence Field Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiangbo Lu, Hongsheng Yang, Dongbo Min, Minh N. Do</p><p>Abstract: Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient edge-aware filters have provided a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the label space size. When the label space is huge, which is often the case for (subpixelaccurate) stereo and optical flow estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable. Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). For the very first time, we explore effective and efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into compact superpixels, we also propose superpixelbased novel search strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. Focusing on dense correspondence field estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF’s applications in stereo and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve state-of-the-art correspondence accuracy but run much faster than other competing methods, often giving over 10-times speedup for large label space cases.</p><p>3 0.77858198 <a title="29-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Jointly_Aligning_and_Segmenting_Multiple_Web_Photo_Streams_for_the_Inference_of_Collective_Photo_Storylines.html">235 cvpr-2013-Jointly Aligning and Segmenting Multiple Web Photo Streams for the Inference of Collective Photo Storylines</a></p>

Xing</p><p>Abstract: With an explosion of popularity of online photo sharing, we can trivially collect a huge number of photo streams for any interesting topics such as scuba diving as an outdoor recreational activity class. Obviously, the retrieved photo streams are neither aligned nor calibrated since they are taken in different temporal, spatial, and personal perspectives. However, at the same time, they are likely to share common storylines that consist of sequences of events and activities frequently recurred within the topic. In this paper, as a first technical step to detect such collective storylines, we propose an approach to jointly aligning and segmenting uncalibrated multiple photo streams. The alignment task discovers the matched images between different photo streams, and the image segmentation task parses each image into multiple meaningful regions to facilitate the image understanding. We close a loop between the two tasks so that solving one task helps enhance the performance of the other in a mutually rewarding way. To this end, we design a scalable message-passing based optimization framework to jointly achieve both tasks for the whole input image set at once. With evaluation on the new Flickr dataset of 15 outdoor activities that consist of 1.5 millions of images of 13 thousands of photo streams, our empirical results show that the proposed algorithms are more successful than other candidate methods for both tasks.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.7777077 <a title="29-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Video_Representation_Using_Temporal_Superpixels.html">29 cvpr-2013-A Video Representation Using Temporal Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Chang, Donglai Wei, John W. Fisher_III</p><p>Abstract: We develop a generative probabilistic model for temporally consistent superpixels in video sequences. In contrast to supervoxel methods, object parts in different frames are tracked by the same temporal superpixel. We explicitly model flow between frames with a bilateral Gaussian process and use this information to propagate superpixels in an online fashion. We consider four novel metrics to quantify performance of a temporal superpixel representation and demonstrate superior performance when compared to supervoxel methods.</p><p>5 0.77161902 <a title="29-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Hofmann, Daniel Wolf, Gerhard Rigoll</p><p>Abstract: We generalize the network flow formulation for multiobject tracking to multi-camera setups. In the past, reconstruction of multi-camera data was done as a separate extension. In this work, we present a combined maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation, which jointly models multicamera reconstruction as well as global temporal data association. A flow graph is constructed, which tracks objects in 3D world space. The multi-camera reconstruction can be efficiently incorporated as additional constraints on the flow graph without making the graph unnecessarily large. The final graph is efficiently solved using binary linear programming. On the PETS 2009 dataset we achieve results that significantly exceed the current state of the art.</p><p>6 0.76565784 <a title="29-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Gauging_Association_Patterns_of_Chromosome_Territories_via_Chromatic_Median.html">184 cvpr-2013-Gauging Association Patterns of Chromosome Territories via Chromatic Median</a></p>

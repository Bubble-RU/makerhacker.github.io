</p><p>9 To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel supervised learning framework that finds a low-dimensional but highly discriminative binary descriptor. [sent-24, score-0.172]
</p><p>10 1, for each dimension we learn a hash function of the same form as an AdaBoost strong classifier, that is the sign  of a linear combination of non-linear weak learners. [sent-26, score-0.3]
</p><p>11 It is more general and powerful than those used in standard binary descriptors, which often rely on simple thresholded linear projections [30]. [sent-27, score-0.196]
</p><p>12 The resulting binary descriptor which we refer to as BinBoost1 significantly outperforms its binary competitors. [sent-29, score-0.435]
</p><p>13 Furthermore, with as few as 64 bits it exhibits a comparable accuracy to state-of-theart floating point or quantized descriptors at a fraction of the storage and matching cost. [sent-30, score-0.478]
</p><p>14 Nevertheless, it is more complex to optimize, and we show how to efficiently optimize our hash functions using boosting. [sent-31, score-0.158]
</p><p>15 As weak learners, we use gradient-based image features that are directly applied to the raw intensity image patches, which frees us from any intermediate representation and lets us automatically learn the image gradient pooling configuration of the final descriptor. [sent-32, score-0.334]
</p><p>16 In Section 3 we describe our method: we first show how we construct our set of weak learners and how we find the Hamming embedding minimizing the exponential loss function. [sent-35, score-0.398]
</p><p>17 We then explain how we use this approach to build our binary local feature descriptor and in Section 4 we compare it against the state of the art methods. [sent-36, score-0.31]
</p><p>18 Related Work Many recent techniques form binary descriptors based  on simple pixel intensity comparisons [4, 15, 22]. [sent-38, score-0.289]
</p><p>19 Similarly, [37] develops a binary edge descriptor based on a histogram of normalized gradients. [sent-40, score-0.31]
</p><p>20 Although more efficient, these hand-designed descriptors are generally not compact and not as accurate as their floating point equivalents. [sent-41, score-0.292]
</p><p>21 Machine learning has been applied to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of image descriptor matching. [sent-42, score-0.207]
</p><p>22 supervised hashing methods learn compact binary descriptors whose Hamming distance is correlated with the similarity in the original input space [9, 14, 23, 36, 35]. [sent-44, score-0.391]
</p><p>23 Semantic hashing [23] trains a multi-layer neural network to learn representative, compact binary codes. [sent-45, score-0.264]
</p><p>24 In [34, 9], iterative and sequential optimization strategies that find projections with minimal quantization error are explored. [sent-48, score-0.166]
</p><p>25 While these approaches have proven highly effective for finding compact binary codes, they rely on a pre-defined distance or similarity measure and in many cases are limited to the accuracy of the origi-  nal input space. [sent-49, score-0.25]
</p><p>26 [10], however, they are less applicable to local descriptor matching where the appropriate choice of kernel function is less well understood. [sent-58, score-0.185]
</p><p>27 Recent descriptor learning methods have emphasized the importance of learning not only the optimal weighting, but also the optimal shape or pooling configuration of the underlying representation [3, 26, 29]. [sent-59, score-0.374]
</p><p>28 To make learning  tractable, however, a limited set of pooling configurations was considered and restricted to circular, symmetrically arranged pooling regions centered about the patch. [sent-62, score-0.22]
</p><p>29 As shown in our experiments, our binary descriptor achieves a similar accuracy to these methods at a fraction of the matching cost. [sent-63, score-0.336]
</p><p>30 Jointly optimizing over descriptor weighting and shape poses a difficult problem due to the potentially large number of pooling configurations one might encounter. [sent-64, score-0.334]
</p><p>31 As a result and unlike kernel methods, boosting is an efficient way to find a non-linear transformation of the input that is naturally parameterized over both the descriptor shape and weighting. [sent-69, score-0.254]
</p><p>32 In [29], we proposed a descriptor we call Low-dimensional Boosted Gradient Map (L-BGM), whose similarity measure models the correlation between weak learners resulting in a compact description. [sent-72, score-0.654]
</p><p>33 Although highly accurate, L-BGM computes a floating point descriptor and therefore its matching time is costly. [sent-74, score-0.304]
</p><p>34 In this paper, we introduce a boosted binary descriptor that relies on the same image gradient-based features as [29]. [sent-75, score-0.389]
</p><p>35 We define a sequential learning method similar to [16, 34] except, unlike these methods, our boosting approach learns both the optimal shape and weighting of the features associated with each bit. [sent-77, score-0.215]
</p><p>36 Our descriptor can also be seen as a two layer neural network [23], since each coordinate of the descriptor is computed from a linear combination of pooled image features. [sent-78, score-0.37]
</p><p>37 As shown in our experiments, this results in a highly accurate and compact binary descriptor. [sent-79, score-0.221]
</p><p>38 Unlike hand-designed representations, we get similar performance to SIFT with as few as 8 bits, and do significantly better with increasing bit length, our final performance rivaling that of the leading binary and floating point descriptors. [sent-80, score-0.312]
</p><p>39 The BinBoost Descriptor  In this section, we first describe our BinBoost descriptor and show how to train it efficiently. [sent-82, score-0.216]

</p><p>42 hd,K(x)]T are K weak learners weighted by the vector bd = [bd,1 . [sent-98, score-0.512]
</p><p>43 Our problem formulation is similar to [25] in the sense that [25] also learned a descriptor CSSC(x) by minimizing its exponential loss with Adaboost. [sent-104, score-0.185]
</p><p>44 Expression (1), however, is more complex than the one used in [25], which considered functions of the simpler form CdSSC(x) = bdhd(x), with bd a scalar and hd a single weak learner. [sent-105, score-0.434]
</p><p>45 Let {(xn, yn, ln)}nN=1 be a set of N labeled training pairs tsu {c(hx that ln =) +1 if image patches xn and yn correspond to the same physical point, and ln = âˆ’1 otherwise. [sent-109, score-0.237]
</p><p>46 (2) aims at reducing the Hamming distances between descriptors of patches from positive pairs (ln = +1) while increasing the Hamming distances between descriptors of patches from negative pairs (ln = âˆ’1). [sent-124, score-0.428]
</p><p>47 First the cd functions are not weighted, because for efficiency reasons we want to use the regular Hamming distances between descriptors instead of the weighted one. [sent-127, score-0.291]
</p><p>48 Second, and more importantly, the cd functions are much more complex than the ones that are usually used, since  they are a product of two strong classifiers. [sent-128, score-0.164]
</p><p>49 The resulting optimization is discontinuous and highly non-convex and in practice the space of all possible weak learners h is discrete and prohibitively large. [sent-129, score-0.423]
</p><p>50 Greedy optimization In this section we present a greedy algorithm for jointly optimizing over the weak classifiers ofeach bit, hd and their associated weights bd. [sent-133, score-0.345]
</p><p>51 Using this fact, at iteration d, the optimal bd and hd can be taken as ? [sent-138, score-0.307]
</p><p>52 The sign function in cd is non-differentiable, and Eq. [sent-147, score-0.193]
</p><p>53 The sign function in the expression of Cd makes bd defined only up to a scale factor, and given an estimate for hd(x), we solve for bd by looking for mbadxbTdMbd, s. [sent-171, score-0.281]
</p><p>54 (7) defines a standard eigenvalue problem and the optimal weights bd can therefore be found in closed-form as the eigenvector of M associated with its largest eigenvalue. [sent-181, score-0.164]
</p><p>55 Weak learners In our implementation, we rely on weak learners that consider the orientations of intensity gradients over image regions [1, 29]. [sent-196, score-0.738]

</p><p>59 Increasing the number of weak learners K from K = 128 to K = 256 provides only a minor improvementâ€”at greatly increased computational costâ€”and, hence, we choose for our final descriptor K = 128. [sent-221, score-0.583]

</p><p>61 BinBoost has only three main parameters that provide a clear  trade-off between the performance and complexity of the final descriptor: the number of orientation bins used by the weak learner, the number of weak learners, and the final dimensionality of the descriptor.

</p><p>62 Number of orientation bins q defines the granularity of the gradient-based weak learners. [sent-230, score-0.284]

</p><p>74 Moreover, since BinBoost can be efficiently implemented using integral images, the computation time of our descriptor is comparable with that of SIFT using Vedaldiâ€™s implementationâ€” approximately 1ms per descriptor on a Macbook Pro with an Intel i7 2. [sent-268, score-0.37]
</p><p>75 The performance improvement of BinBoost with respect to the recent binary descriptors, such as LDAHash or BRIEF, is even greater, BinBoost achieving a 95% error rate that is almost a factor of 3 lower than that obtained with these methods. [sent-270, score-0.173]

<p>Author: Lei Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Jinhu Tang, Ke Lu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Binary hashing has been widely used for efficient similarity search due to its query and storage efficiency. In most existing binary hashing methods, the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient, however, in practice, there are often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary codes of hashing methods.

<p>Author: Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision there has been increasing interest in learning hashing codes whose Hamming distance approximates the data similarity. The hashing functions play roles in both quantizing the vector space and generating similarity-preserving codes. Most existing hashing methods use hyper-planes (or kernelized hyper-planes) to quantize and encode. In this paper, we present a hashing method adopting the k-means quantization. We propose a novel Affinity-Preserving K-means algorithm which simultaneously performs k-means clustering and learns the binary indices of the quantized cells. The distance between the cells is approximated by the Hamming distance of the cell indices. We further generalize our algorithm to a product space for learning longer codes.

<p>Author: Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van_den_Hengel, Zhenmin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original highdimensional data. The complexity of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, havepreviously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE [29] outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths.</p><p>5 0.12132993 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast%2C_Accurate_Detection_of_100%2C000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine.html">163 cvpr-2013-Fast, Accurate Detection of 100,000 Object Classes on a Single Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Dean, Mark A. Ruzon, Mark Segal, Jonathon Shlens, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Jay Yagnik</p><p>Abstract: Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an objectâ€™s appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 timesâ€” four orders of magnitudeâ€” when compared withperforming the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.</p><p>6 0.11904296 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Binary_Codes_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Using_Bilinear_Projections.html">246 cvpr-2013-Learning Binary Codes for High-Dimensional Data Using Bilinear Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>5 0.76215494 <a title="69-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Binary_Code_Ranking_with_Weighted_Hamming_Distance.html">63 cvpr-2013-Binary Code Ranking with Weighted Hamming Distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Jinhu Tang, Ke Lu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Binary hashing has been widely used for efficient similarity search due to its query and storage efficiency. In most existing binary hashing methods, the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient, however, in practice, there are often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level weights to different hash bits, the returned binary codes are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p><p>6 0.74730879 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Cartesian_K-Means.html">79 cvpr-2013-Cartesian K-Means</a></p>

<p>Author: Masaki Saito, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inference of marginal densities based on MRF models. The optimization algorithmsfor continuous variables are only applicable to a limited number of problems, whereas those for discrete variables are versatile. Thus, it is quite common to convert the continuous variables into discrete ones for the problems that ideally should be solved in the continuous domain, such as stereo matching and optical flow estimation. In this paper, we show a novel formulation for this continuous-discrete conversion. The key idea is to estimate the marginal densities in the continuous domain by approximating them with mixtures of rectangular densities. Based on this formulation, we derive a mean field (MF) algorithm and a belief propagation (BP) algorithm. These algorithms can correctly handle the case where the variable space is discretized in a non-uniform manner. By intentionally using such a non-uniform discretization, a higher balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of marginal density estimates could be achieved. We present a method for actually doing this, which dynamically discretizes the variable space in a coarse-to-fine manner in the course of the computation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>3 0.85604942 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Winding_Number_for_Region-Boundary_Consistent_Salient_Contour_Extraction.html">468 cvpr-2013-Winding Number for Region-Boundary Consistent Salient Contour Extraction</a></p>

For this vision task, both region segmentation cues (e.g. color/texture homogeneity) and boundary detection cues (e.g. local contrast, edge continuity and contour closure) play important and complementary roles. In this paper we show how to combine both cues in a unified framework. The main focus is given to how to maintain the consistency (compatibility) between the region cues and the boundary cues. To this ends, we introduce the use of winding numberâ€“a well-known concept in topologyâ€“as a powerful mathematical device. By this device, the region-boundary consistency is represented as a set of simple linear relationships. Our method is applied to the figure-ground segmentation problem. The experiments show clearly improved results.</p><p>4 0.85289407 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Perceptual_Organization_and_Recognition_of_Indoor_Scenes_from_RGB-D_Images.html">329 cvpr-2013-Perceptual Organization and Recognition of Indoor Scenes from RGB-D Images</a></p>

While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on sharing code and datasets, it is of great importance to develop a library and benchmark to gauge the state of the art. After briefly reviewing recent advances of online object tracking, we carry out large scale experiments with various evaluation criteria to understand how these algorithms perform. The test image sequences are annotated with different attributes for performance evaluation and analysis.

<p>Author: Yansheng Ming, Hongdong Li, Xuming He</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to extract salient closed contours from an image. For this vision task, both region segmentation cues (e.g. color/texture homogeneity) and boundary detection cues (e.g. local contrast, edge continuity and contour closure) play important and complementary roles. In this paper we show how to combine both cues in a unified framework. The main focus is given to how to maintain the consistency (compatibility) between the region cues and the boundary cues. To this ends, we introduce the use of winding number–a well-known concept in topology–as a powerful mathematical device. By this device, the region-boundary consistency is represented as a set of simple linear relationships. Our method is applied to the figure-ground segmentation problem. The experiments show clearly improved results.</p><p>3 0.32251039 <a title="222-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Active_Contours_with_Group_Similarity.html">33 cvpr-2013-Active Contours with Group Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhou, Xiaojie Huang, James S. Duncan, Weichuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: Active contours are widely used in image segmentation. To cope with missing or misleading features in images, researchers have introduced various ways to model the prior of shapes and use the prior to constrain active contours. However, the shape prior is usually learnt from a large set of annotated data, which is not always accessible in practice. Moreover, it is often doubted that the existing shapes in the training set will be sufficient to model the new instance in the testing image. In this paper, we propose to use the group similarity of object shapes in multiple images as a prior to aid segmentation, which can be interpreted as an unsupervised approach of shape prior modeling. We show that the rank of the matrix consisting of multiple shapes is a good measure of the group similarity of the shapes, and the nuclear norm minimization is a simple and effective way to impose the proposed constraint on existing active contour models. Moreover, we develop a fast algorithm to solve the proposed model by using the accelerated proximal method. Experiments using echocardiographic image sequences acquired from acute canine experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the performance of active contour models and increase the robustness against image defects such as missing boundaries.</p><p>4 0.22439812 <a title="222-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Perceptual_Organization_and_Recognition_of_Indoor_Scenes_from_RGB-D_Images.html">329 cvpr-2013-Perceptual Organization and Recognition of Indoor Scenes from RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Saurabh Gupta, Pablo Arbeláez, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We address the problems of contour detection, bottomup grouping and semantic segmentation using RGB-D data. We focus on the challenging setting of cluttered indoor scenes, and evaluate our approach on the recently introduced NYU-Depth V2 (NYUD2) dataset [27]. We propose algorithms for object boundary detection and hierarchical segmentation that generalize the gPb − ucm approach of [se2]g mbeyn mtaatkioinng t effective use oef t dheep gthP information. Wroea schho owf that our system can label each contour with its type (depth, normal or albedo). We also propose a generic method for long-range amodal completion of surfaces and show its effectiveness in grouping. We then turn to the problem of semantic segmentation and propose a simple approach that classifies superpixels into the 40 dominant object categories in NYUD2. We use both generic and class-specific features to encode the appearance and geometry of objects. We also show how our approach can be used for scene classification, and how this contextual information in turn improves object recognition. In all of these tasks, we report significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.1645591 <a title="222-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Color_Boundary_Detection_with_Color-Opponent_Mechanisms.html">140 cvpr-2013-Efficient Color Boundary Detection with Color-Opponent Mechanisms</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaifu Yang, Shaobing Gao, Chaoyi Li, Yongjie Li</p><p>Abstract: Color information plays an important role in better understanding of natural scenes by at least facilitating discriminating boundaries of objects or areas. In this study, we propose a new framework for boundary detection in complex natural scenes based on the color-opponent mechanisms of the visual system. The red-green and blue-yellow color opponent channels in the human visual system are regarded as the building blocks for various color perception tasks such as boundary detection. The proposed framework is a feedforward hierarchical model, which has direct counterpart to the color-opponent mechanisms involved in from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). Results show that our simple framework has excellent ability to flexibly capture both the structured chromatic and achromatic boundaries in complex scenes.</p><p>6 0.16263643 <a title="222-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Fast_and_Accurate_Segmentation.html">437 cvpr-2013-Towards Fast and Accurate Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Michael Hirsch, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We establish a link between Fourier optics and a recent construction from the machine learning community termed the kernel mean map. Using the Fraunhofer approximation, it identifies the kernel with the squared Fourier transform of the aperture. This allows us to use results about the invertibility of the kernel mean map to provide a statement about the invertibility of Fraunhofer diffraction, showing that imaging processes with arbitrarily small apertures can in principle be invertible, i.e., do not lose information, provided the objects to be imaged satisfy a generic condition. A real world experiment shows that we can super-resolve beyond the Rayleigh limit.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81095201 <a title="222-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_User_Interaction_and_Topological_Constraints_within_Contour_Completion_via_Discrete_Calculus.html">222 cvpr-2013-Incorporating User Interaction and Topological Constraints within Contour Completion via Discrete Calculus</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert Anderson, Björn Stenger, Vincent Wan, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a complete system for expressive visual text-to-speech (VTTS), which is capable of producing expressive output, in the form of a ‘talking head’, given an input text and a set of continuous expression weights. The face is modeled using an active appearance model (AAM), and several extensions are proposed which make it more applicable to the task of VTTS. The model allows for normalization with respect to both pose and blink state which significantly reduces artifacts in the resulting synthesized sequences. We demonstrate quantitative improvements in terms of reconstruction error over a million frames, as well as in large-scale user studies, comparing the output of different systems.</p><p>4 0.78639483 <a title="222-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Laplacian_PCA%3A_Closed-Form_Solution_and_Robustness.html">191 cvpr-2013-Graph-Laplacian PCA: Closed-Form Solution and Robustness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Chris Ding, Bio Luo, Jin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used to learn a low-dimensional representation. In many applications, both vector data X and graph data W are available. Laplacian embedding is widely used for embedding graph data. Wepropose a graph-Laplacian PCA (gLPCA) to learn a low dimensional representation of X that incorporates graph structures encoded in W. This model has several advantages: (1) It is a data representation model. (2) It has a compact closed-form solution and can be efficiently computed. (3) It is capable to remove corruptions. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets show promising results on image reconstruction and significant improvement on clustering and classification.</p><p>5 0.7567786 <a title="222-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_without_Human_Scores_for_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment.html">266 cvpr-2013-Learning without Human Scores for Blind Image Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Lei Zhang, Xuanqin Mou</p><p>Abstract: General purpose blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant attention in thefields of image processing, vision and machine learning. Stateof-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate the image quality by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how the image quality is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate the local quality of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to infer the quality of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual quality score of the whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map.</p><p>6 0.74843991 <a title="222-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>

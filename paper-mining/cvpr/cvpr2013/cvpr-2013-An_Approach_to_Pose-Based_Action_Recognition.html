<p>Author: Tsz-Ho Yu, Tae-Kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenging problem of unconstrained 3D human pose estimation (HPE)from a novelperspective. Existing approaches struggle to operate in realistic applications, mainly due to their scene-dependent priors, such as background segmentation and multi-camera network, which restrict their use in unconstrained environments. We therfore present a framework which applies action detection and 2D pose estimation techniques to infer 3D poses in an unconstrained video. Action detection offers spatiotemporal priors to 3D human pose estimation by both recognising and localising actions in space-time. Instead of holistic features, e.g. silhouettes, we leverage the flexibility of deformable part model to detect 2D body parts as a feature to estimate 3D poses. A new unconstrained pose dataset has been collected to justify the feasibility of our method, which demonstrated promising results, significantly outperforming the relevant state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.33166534 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.3212952 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Pose_from_Flow_and_Flow_from_Pose.html">334 cvpr-2013-Pose from Flow and Flow from Pose</a></p>
<p>Author: Katerina Fragkiadaki, Han Hu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Human pose detectors, although successful in localising faces and torsos of people, often fail with lower arms. Motion estimation is often inaccurate under fast movements of body parts. We build a segmentation-detection algorithm that mediates the information between body parts recognition, and multi-frame motion grouping to improve both pose detection and tracking. Motion of body parts, though not accurate, is often sufficient to segment them from their backgrounds. Such segmentations are crucialfor extracting hard to detect body parts out of their interior body clutter. By matching these segments to exemplars we obtain pose labeled body segments. The pose labeled segments and corresponding articulated joints are used to improve the motion flow fields by proposing kinematically constrained affine displacements on body parts. The pose-based articulated motion model is shown to handle large limb rotations and displacements. Our algorithm can detect people under rare poses, frequently missed by pose detectors, showing the benefits of jointly reasoning about pose, segmentation and motion in videos.</p><p>5 0.28105468 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.</p><p>6 0.25236234 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Watching_Unlabeled_Video_Helps_Learn_New_Human_Actions_from_Very_Few_Labeled_Snapshots.html">459 cvpr-2013-Watching Unlabeled Video Helps Learn New Human Actions from Very Few Labeled Snapshots</a></p>

<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>4 0.82947022 <a title="40-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuichi Takeda, Shinsaku Hiura, Kosuke Sato</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel depth measurement method by fusing depth from defocus (DFD) and stereo. One of the problems of passive stereo method is the difficulty of finding correct correspondence between images when an object has a repetitive pattern or edges parallel to the epipolar line. On the other hand, the accuracy of DFD method is inherently limited by the effective diameter of the lens. Therefore, we propose the fusion of stereo method and DFD by giving different focus distances for left and right cameras of a stereo camera with coded apertures. Two types of depth cues, defocus and disparity, are naturally integrated by the magnification and phase shift of a single point spread function (PSF) per camera. In this paper we give the proof of the proportional relationship between the diameter of defocus and disparity which makes the calibration easy. We also show the outstanding performance of our method which has both advantages of two depth cues through simulation and actual experiments.</p><p>2 0.94369102 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Dominant_and_Anomalous_Behavior_Detection_in_Videos.html">313 cvpr-2013-Online Dominant and Anomalous Behavior Detection in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrsan Javan Roshtkhari, Martin D. Levine</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for video parsing and simultaneous online learning of dominant and anomalous behaviors in surveillance videos. Dominant behaviors are those occurring frequently in videos and hence, usually do not attract much attention. They can be characterized by different complexities in space and time, ranging from a scene background to human activities. In contrast, an anomalous behavior is defined as having a low likelihood of occurrence. We do not employ any models of the entities in the scene in order to detect these two kinds of behaviors. In this paper, video events are learnt at each pixel without supervision using densely constructed spatio-temporal video volumes. Furthermore, the volumes are organized into large contextual graphs. These compositions are employed to construct a hierarchical codebook model for the dominant behaviors. By decomposing spatio-temporal contextual information into unique spatial and temporal contexts, the proposed framework learns the models of the dominant spatial and temporal events. Thus, it is ultimately capable of simultaneously modeling high-level behaviors as well as low-level spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal pixel level changes.</p><p>3 0.93089777 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_Registration_of_Nonrigid_Surface_Using_Hierarchical_Statistical_Shape_Model.html">31 cvpr-2013-Accurate and Robust Registration of Nonrigid Surface Using Hierarchical Statistical Shape Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hidekata Hontani, Yuto Tsunekawa, Yoshihide Sawada</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new non-rigid robust registration method that registers a point distribution model (PDM) of a surface to given 3D images. The contributions of the paper are (1) a new hierarchical statistical shape model (SSM) of the surface that has better generalization ability is introduced, (2) the registration algorithm of the hierarchical SSM that can estimate the marginal posterior distribution of the surface location is proposed, and (3) the registration performance is improved by (3-1) robustly registering each local shape of the surface with the sparsity regularization and by (3-2) referring to the appearance between the neighboring model points in the likelihood computation. The SSM of a liver was constructed from a set of clinical CT images, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed some existing methods that use non-hierarchical SSMs.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.92362714 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Approach_to_Pose-Based_Action_Recognition.html">40 cvpr-2013-An Approach to Pose-Based Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the “best” one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>5 0.92038494 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>6 0.91259938 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Integrating_Grammar_and_Segmentation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">225 cvpr-2013-Integrating Grammar and Segmentation for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.21610631 <a title="255-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_Based_on_Filter_Learning.html">346 cvpr-2013-Real-Time No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Filter Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Ye, Jayant Kumar, Le Kang, David Doermann</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of general-purpose No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) with the goal ofdeveloping a real-time, cross-domain model that can predict the quality of distorted images without prior knowledge of non-distorted reference images and types of distortions present in these images. The contributions of our work are two-fold: first, the proposed method is highly efficient. NR-IQA measures are often used in real-time imaging or communication systems, therefore it is important to have a fast NR-IQA algorithm that can be used in these real-time applications. Second, the proposed method has the potential to be used in multiple image domains. Previous work on NR-IQA focus primarily on predicting quality of natural scene image with respect to human perception, yet, in other image domains, the final receiver of a digital image may not be a human. The proposed method consists of the following components: (1) a local feature extractor; (2) a global feature extractor and (3) a regression model. While previous approaches usually treat local feature extraction and regres- sion model training independently, we propose a supervised method based on back-projection, which links the two steps by learning a compact set of filters which can be applied to local image patches to obtain discriminative local features. Using a small set of filters, the proposed method is extremely fast. We have tested this method on various natural scene and document image datasets and obtained stateof-the-art results.</p><p>5 0.19551176 <a title="255-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast%2C_Accurate_Detection_of_100%2C000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine.html">163 cvpr-2013-Fast, Accurate Detection of 100,000 Object Classes on a Single Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Dean, Mark A. Ruzon, Mark Segal, Jonathon Shlens, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Jay Yagnik</p><p>Abstract: Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an object’s appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times— four orders of magnitude— when compared withperforming the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.</p><p>6 0.18356532 <a title="255-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang, Chunwei Song, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Image denoising is a classical yet fundamental problem in low level vision, as well as an ideal test bed to evaluate various statistical image modeling methods. One of the most challenging problems in image denoising is how to preserve the fine scale texture structures while removing noise. Various natural image priors, such as gradient based prior, nonlocal self-similarity prior, and sparsity prior, have been extensively exploited for noise removal. The denoising algorithms based on these priors, however, tend to smooth the detailed image textures, degrading the image visual quality. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a texture enhanced image denoising (TEID) method by enforcing the gradient distribution of the denoised image to be close to the estimated gradient distribution of the original image. A novel gradient histogram preservation (GHP) algorithm is developed to enhance the texture structures while removing noise. Our experimental results demonstrate that theproposed GHP based TEID can well preserve the texture features of the denoised images, making them look more natural.</p><p>5 0.60390431 <a title="255-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Discriminative_Illumination_and_Filters_for_Raw_Material_Classification_with_Optimal_Projections_of_Bidirectional_Texture_Functions.html">251 cvpr-2013-Learning Discriminative Illumination and Filters for Raw Material Classification with Optimal Projections of Bidirectional Texture Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Liu, Geifei Yang, Jinwei Gu</p><p>Abstract: We present a computational imaging method for raw material classification using features of Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Texture is an intrinsic feature for many materials, such as wood, fabric, and granite. At appropriate scales, even “uniform” materials will also exhibit texture features that can be helpful for recognition, such as paper, metal, and ceramic. To cope with the high-dimensionality of BTFs, in this paper, we proposed to learn discriminative illumination patterns and texture filters, with which we can directly measure optimal projections of BTFs for classification. We also studied the effects of texture rotation and scale variation for material classification. We built an LED-based multispectral dome, with which we have acquired a BTF database of a variety of materials and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for material classification.</p><p>6 0.57697123 <a title="255-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Kumar, Cyril Kwong</p><p>Abstract: In order to avail the benefits of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contactless 3D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results from the use of multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contactless 3D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3D finger surface features using Finger Surface Codes and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3D space to accurately match the recovered 3D minutiae. Multiple 2D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2D features for further improving 3D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3D fingerprint identification.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84535128 <a title="255-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Rigamonti, Amos Sironi, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: Learning filters to produce sparse image representations in terms of overcomplete dictionaries has emerged as a powerful way to create image features for many different purposes. Unfortunately, these filters are usually both numerous and non-separable, making their use computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that such filters can be computed as linear combinations of a smaller number of separable ones, thus greatly reducing the computational complexity at no cost in terms of performance. This makes filter learning approaches practical even for large images or 3D volumes, and we show that we significantly outperform state-of-theart methods on the linear structure extraction task, in terms ofboth accuracy and speed. Moreover, our approach is general and can be used on generic filter banks to reduce the complexity of the convolutions.</p><p>3 0.83493245 <a title="255-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Gauging_Association_Patterns_of_Chromosome_Territories_via_Chromatic_Median.html">184 cvpr-2013-Gauging Association Patterns of Chromosome Territories via Chromatic Median</a></p>
<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>4 0.82696921 <a title="255-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_for_Structured_Prediction_Using_Approximate_Subgradient_Descent_with_Working_Sets.html">262 cvpr-2013-Learning for Structured Prediction Using Approximate Subgradient Descent with Working Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurélien Lucchi, Yunpeng Li, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a working set based approximate subgradient descent algorithm to minimize the margin-sensitive hinge loss arising from the soft constraints in max-margin learning frameworks, such as the structured SVM. We focus on the setting of general graphical models, such as loopy MRFs and CRFs commonly used in image segmentation, where exact inference is intractable and the most violated constraints can only be approximated, voiding the optimality guarantees of the structured SVM’s cutting plane algorithm as well as reducing the robustness of existing subgradient based methods. We show that the proposed method obtains better approximate subgradients through the use of working sets, leading to improved convergence properties and increased reliability. Furthermore, our method allows new constraints to be randomly sampled instead of computed using the more expensive approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation and graph cuts, which can be used to reduce learning time at only a small cost of performance. We demonstrate the strength of our method empirically on the segmentation of a new publicly available electron microscopy dataset as well as the popular MSRC data set and show state-of-the-art results.</p><p>5 0.82517487 <a title="255-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Hofmann, Daniel Wolf, Gerhard Rigoll</p><p>Abstract: We generalize the network flow formulation for multiobject tracking to multi-camera setups. In the past, reconstruction of multi-camera data was done as a separate extension. In this work, we present a combined maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation, which jointly models multicamera reconstruction as well as global temporal data association. A flow graph is constructed, which tracks objects in 3D world space. The multi-camera reconstruction can be efficiently incorporated as additional constraints on the flow graph without making the graph unnecessarily large. The final graph is efficiently solved using binary linear programming. On the PETS 2009 dataset we achieve results that significantly exceed the current state of the art.</p><p>6 0.82440084 <a title="255-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Trust_Region_for_Segmentation.html">171 cvpr-2013-Fast Trust Region for Segmentation</a></p>

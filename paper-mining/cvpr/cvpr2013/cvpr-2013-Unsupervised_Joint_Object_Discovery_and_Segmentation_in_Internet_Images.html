<p>Author: Huaizu Jiang, Jingdong Wang, Zejian Yuan, Yang Wu, Nanning Zheng, Shipeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we regard saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, uses the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score, and finally fuses the saliency scores across multiple levels, yielding the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we show our approach, which integrates the regional contrast, regional property and regional backgroundness descriptors together to form the master saliency map, is able to produce superior saliency maps to existing algorithms most of which combine saliency maps heuristically computed from different types of features. The other is that we introduce a new regional feature vector, backgroundness, to characterize the background, which can be regarded as a counterpart of the objectness descriptor [2]. The performance evaluation on several popular benchmark data sets validates that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.36905494 <a title="450-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking.html">375 cvpr-2013-Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing bottom-up methods measure the foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead of considering the contrast between the salient objects and their surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in a different way. We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with superpixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We also create a more difficult bench- mark database containing 5,172 images to test the proposed saliency model and make this database publicly available with this paper for further studies in the saliency field.</p><p>4 0.32652599 <a title="450-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>5 0.31862709 <a title="450-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Parthipan Siva, Chris Russell, Tao Xiang, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of object saliency as a sampling problem. This novel formulation allows us to learn, from a large corpus of unlabelled images, which patches of an image are of the greatest interest and most likely to correspond to an object. We then sample the object saliency map to propose object locations. We show that using only a single object location proposal per image, we are able to correctly select an object in over 42% of the images in the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, substantially outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that our object proposal can be used as a simple unsupervised approach to the weakly supervised annotation problem. Our simple unsupervised approach to annotating objects of interest in images achieves a higher annotation accuracy than most weakly supervised approaches.</p><p>6 0.30730245 <a title="450-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-PISA%3A_Pixelwise_Image_Saliency_by_Aggregating_Complementary_Appearance_Contrast_Measures_with_Spatial_Priors.html">322 cvpr-2013-PISA: Pixelwise Image Saliency by Aggregating Complementary Appearance Contrast Measures with Spatial Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or post– relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISA’s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>4 0.84785837 <a title="450-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Scharfenberger, Alexander Wong, Khalil Fergani, John S. Zelek, David A. Clausi</p><p>Abstract: A novel statistical textural distinctiveness approach for robustly detecting salient regions in natural images is proposed. Rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations are extracted and used to learn a set of representative texture atoms for defining a sparse texture model for the image. Based on the learnt sparse texture model, a weighted graphical model is constructed to characterize the statistical textural distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs. Finally, the saliency of each pixel in the image is computed based on the probability of occurrence of the representative texture atoms, their respective statistical textural distinctiveness based on the constructed graphical model, and general visual attentive constraints. Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>6 0.8310973 <a title="450-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking.html">375 cvpr-2013-Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaojie Guo, Xiaochun Cao, Xiaowu Chen, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Given an area of interest in a video sequence, one may want to manipulate or edit the area, e.g. remove occlusions from or replace with an advertisement on it. Such a task involves three main challenges including temporal consistency, spatial pose, and visual realism. The proposed method effectively seeks an optimal solution to simultaneously deal with temporal alignment, pose rectification, as well as precise recovery of the occlusion. To make our method applicable to long video sequences, we propose a batch alignment method for automatically aligning and rectifying a small number of initial frames, and then show how to align the remaining frames incrementally to the aligned base images. From the error residual of the robust alignment process, we automatically construct a trimap of the region for each frame, which is used as the input to alpha matting methods to extract the occluding foreground. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the accurate and robust performance of our method.</p><p>2 0.92816597 <a title="450-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>3 0.92428344 <a title="450-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Stereo_Pairs_from_Anaglyphs.html">352 cvpr-2013-Recovering Stereo Pairs from Anaglyphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Armand Joulin, Sing Bing Kang</p><p>Abstract: An anaglyph is a single image created by selecting complementary colors from a stereo color pair; the user can perceive depth by viewing it through color-filtered glasses. We propose a technique to reconstruct the original color stereo pair given such an anaglyph. We modified SIFT-Flow and use it to initially match the different color channels across the two views. Our technique then iteratively refines the matches, selects the good matches (which defines the “anchor” colors), and propagates the anchor colors. We use a diffusion-based technique for the color propagation, and added a step to suppress unwanted colors. Results on a variety of inputs demonstrate the robustness of our technique. We also extended our method to anaglyph videos by using optic flow between time frames.</p><p>4 0.92337567 <a title="450-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Relative_Volume_Constraints_for_Single_View_3D_Reconstruction.html">354 cvpr-2013-Relative Volume Constraints for Single View 3D Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Eno Töppe, Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of relative volume constraints in order to account for insufficient information in the reconstruction of 3D objects from a single image. The key idea is to formulate a variational reconstruction approach with shape priors in form of relative depth profiles or volume ratios relating object parts. Such shape priors can easily be derived either from a user sketch or from the object’s shading profile in the image. They can handle textured or shadowed object regions by propagating information. We propose a convex relaxation of the constrained optimization problem which can be solved optimally in a few seconds on graphics hardware. In contrast to existing single view reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithm provides substantially more flexibility to recover shape details such as self-occlusions, dents and holes, which are not visible in the object silhouette.</p><p>5 0.92335922 <a title="450-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>6 0.91985697 <a title="450-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_Model-Based_Rigid_Object_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_Combining_Dense_and_Sparse_Visual_Cues.html">345 cvpr-2013-Real-Time Model-Based Rigid Object Pose Estimation and Tracking Combining Dense and Sparse Visual Cues</a></p>

<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of detecting pedestrians who appear in groups and have interaction. A new approach is proposed for single-pedestrian detection aided by multi-pedestrian detection. A mixture model of multi-pedestrian detectors is designed to capture the unique visual cues which are formed by nearby multiple pedestrians but cannot be captured by single-pedestrian detectors. A probabilistic framework is proposed to model the relationship between the configurations estimated by single- and multi-pedestrian detectors, and to refine the single-pedestrian detection result with multi-pedestrian detection. It can integrate with any single-pedestrian detector without significantly increasing the computation load. 15 state-of-the-art single-pedestrian detection approaches are investigated on three widely used public datasets: Caltech, TUD-Brussels andETH. Experimental results show that our framework significantly improves all these approaches. The average improvement is 9% on the Caltech-Test dataset, 11% on the TUD-Brussels dataset and 17% on the ETH dataset in terms of average miss rate. The lowest average miss rate is reduced from 48% to 43% on the Caltech-Test dataset, from 55% to 50% on the TUD-Brussels dataset and from 51% to 41% on the ETH dataset.</p><p>3 0.48343167 <a title="363-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Mutual_Visibility_Relationship_in_Pedestrian_Detection.html">288 cvpr-2013-Modeling Mutual Visibility Relationship in Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xingyu Zeng, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting pedestrians in cluttered scenes is a challenging problem in computer vision. The difficulty is added when several pedestrians overlap in images and occlude each other. We observe, however, that the occlusion/visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians provide useful mutual relationship for visibility estimation - the visibility estimation of one pedestrian facilitates the visibility estimation of another. In this paper, we propose a mutual visibility deep model that jointly estimates the visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians. The visibility relationship among pedestrians is learned from the deep model for recognizing co-existing pedestrians. Experimental results show that the mutual visibility deep model effectively improves the pedestrian detection results. Compared with existing image-based pedestrian detection approaches, our approach has the lowest average miss rate on the CaltechTrain dataset, the Caltech-Test dataset and the ETHdataset. Including mutual visibility leads to 4% −8% improvements on mluudlitnipglem ubteunaclh vmiasibrki ditayta lesaedtss.</p><p>4 0.33427557 <a title="363-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Multiple-Part_Based_Object_Detection_Using_KD-Ferns.html">167 cvpr-2013-Fast Multiple-Part Based Object Detection Using KD-Ferns</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Levi, Shai Silberstein, Aharon Bar-Hillel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a new part-based object detection algorithm with hundreds of parts performing realtime detection. Part-based models are currently state-ofthe-art for object detection due to their ability to represent large appearance variations. However, due to their high computational demands such methods are limited to several parts only and are too slow for practical real-time implementation. Our algorithm is an accelerated version of the “Feature Synthesis ” (FS) method [1], which uses multiple object parts for detection and is among state-of-theart methods on human detection benchmarks, but also suffers from a high computational cost. The proposed Accelerated Feature Synthesis (AFS) uses several strategies for reducing the number of locations searched for each part. The first strategy uses a novel algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search which we developed, termed “KDFerns ”, to compare each image location to only a subset of the model parts. Candidate part locations for a specific part are further reduced using spatial inhibition, and using an object-level “coarse-to-fine ” strategy. In our empirical evaluation on pedestrian detection benchmarks, AFS main- × tains almost fully the accuracy performance of the original FS, while running more than 4 faster than existing partbased methods which use only several parts. AFS is to our best knowledge the first part-based object detection method achieving real-time running performance: nearly 10 frames per-second on 640 480 images on a regular CPU.</p><p>5 0.30756021 <a title="363-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-stage_Feature_Learning.html">328 cvpr-2013-Pedestrian Detection with Unsupervised Multi-stage Feature Learning</a></p>

Adding to the list of successful applications of deep learning methods to vision, we report state-of-theart and competitive results on all major pedestrian datasets with a convolutional network model. The model uses a few new twists, such as multi-stage features, connections that skip layers to integrate global shape information with local distinctive motif information, and an unsupervised method based on convolutional sparse coding to pre-train the filters at each stage.</p><p>6 0.29931945 <a title="363-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Weak_Stabilization_for_Motion_Feature_Extraction.html">158 cvpr-2013-Exploring Weak Stabilization for Motion Feature Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Sitapa Rujikietgumjorn, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We present a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) framework for reasoning about multiple object detections with spatial overlaps. The method maximizes an objective function composed of unary detection confidence scores andpairwise overlap constraints to determine which overlapping detections should be suppressed, and which should be kept. The framework is flexible enough to handle the problem of detecting objects as a shape covering of a foreground mask, and to handle the problem of filtering confidence weighted detections produced by a traditional sliding window object detector. In our experiments, we show that our method outperforms two existing state-ofthe-art pedestrian detectors.</p><p>6 0.62937438 <a title="363-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Seeking_the_Strongest_Rigid_Detector.html">383 cvpr-2013-Seeking the Strongest Rigid Detector</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhen Li, Shiyu Chang, Feng Liang, Thomas S. Huang, Liangliang Cao, John R. Smith</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the person verification problem in modern surveillance and video retrieval systems. The problem is to identify whether a pair of face or human body images is about the same person, even if the person is not seen before. Traditional methods usually look for a distance (or similarity) measure between images (e.g., by metric learning algorithms), and make decisions based on a fixed threshold. We show that this is nevertheless insufficient and sub-optimal for the verification problem. This paper proposes to learn a decision function for verification that can be viewed as a joint model of a distance metric and a locally adaptive thresholding rule. We further formulate the inference on our decision function as a second-order large-margin regularization problem, and provide an efficient algorithm in its dual from. We evaluate our algorithm on both human body verification and face verification problems. Our method outperforms not only the classical metric learning algorithm including LMNN and ITML, but also the state-of-the-art in the computer vision community.</p><p>2 0.88215929 <a title="363-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Sifre, Stéphane Mallat</p><p>Abstract: An affine invariant representation is constructed with a cascade of invariants, which preserves information for classification. A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained over texture databases with uncontrolled viewing conditions.</p><p>3 0.87466019 <a title="363-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploiting_the_Power_of_Stereo_Confidences.html">155 cvpr-2013-Exploiting the Power of Stereo Confidences</a></p>
<p>Author: David Pfeiffer, Stefan Gehrig, Nicolai Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Applications based on stereo vision are becoming increasingly common, ranging from gaming over robotics to driver assistance. While stereo algorithms have been investigated heavily both on the pixel and the application level, far less attention has been dedicated to the use of stereo confidence cues. Mostly, a threshold is applied to the confidence values for further processing, which is essentially a sparsified disparity map. This is straightforward but it does not take full advantage of the available information. In this paper, we make full use of the stereo confidence cues by propagating all confidence values along with the measured disparities in a Bayesian manner. Before using this information, a mapping from confidence values to disparity outlier probability rate is performed based on gathered disparity statistics from labeled video data. We present an extension of the so called Stixel World, a generic 3D intermediate representation that can serve as input for many of the applications mentioned above. This scheme is modified to directly exploit stereo confidence cues in the underlying sensor model during a maximum a poste- riori estimation process. The effectiveness of this step is verified in an in-depth evaluation on a large real-world traffic data base of which parts are made publicly available. We show that using stereo confidence cues allows both reducing the number of false object detections by a factor of six while keeping the detection rate at a near constant level.</p><p>4 0.87027991 <a title="363-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Large-Scale_Structured_Learning.html">143 cvpr-2013-Efficient Large-Scale Structured Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiangbo Lu, Hongsheng Yang, Dongbo Min, Minh N. Do</p><p>Abstract: Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient edge-aware filters have provided a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the label space size. When the label space is huge, which is often the case for (subpixelaccurate) stereo and optical flow estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable. Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). For the very first time, we explore effective and efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into compact superpixels, we also propose superpixelbased novel search strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. Focusing on dense correspondence field estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF’s applications in stereo and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve state-of-the-art correspondence accuracy but run much faster than other competing methods, often giving over 10-times speedup for large label space cases.</p><p>6 0.86867261 <a title="363-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Learning_for_Confidence_Measures_in_Stereo_Vision.html">147 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Learning for Confidence Measures in Stereo Vision</a></p>

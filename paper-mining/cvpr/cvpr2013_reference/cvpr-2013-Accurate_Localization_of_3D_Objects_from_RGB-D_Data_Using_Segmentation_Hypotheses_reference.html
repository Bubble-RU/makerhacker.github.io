<br/><p>Source: <a title="cvpr-2013-30-pdf" href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Kim_Accurate_Localization_of_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Byung-soo Kim, Shili Xu, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we focus on the problem of detecting objects in 3D from RGB-D images. We propose a novel framework that explores the compatibility between segmentation hypotheses of the object in the image and the corresponding 3D map. Our framework allows to discover the optimal location of the object using a generalization of the structural latent SVM formulation in 3D as well as the definition of a new loss function defined over the 3D space in training. We evaluate our method using two existing RGB-D datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-theart as methods well as a number of baseline approaches for both 3D and 2D object recognition tasks.</p><br/>

Each column represents ground truth bounding boxes in 2D, ground truth bounding boxes in 3D, 3D localization results using 3 baseline methods, and 3D localization results using our method, respectively. The localization results are drawn with black ellipsoids and green is used for ground truths. First four rows shows good examples. Notice the ellipsoids estimated by our framework is very close to ground truth ellipsoids, whereas baseline methods give less well localized ellipsoids. The last row shows failure cases. More typical examples can be found in the supplementary material [26].</p>

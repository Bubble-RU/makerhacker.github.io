<br/><p>Source: <a title="cvpr-2013-207-pdf" href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Ladicky_Human_Pose_Estimation_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ä½</p><p>Abstract: Our goal is to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose in single images. In particular, handling cases of partial visibility where some limbs may be occluded or one person is partially occluding another. Two standard, but disparate, approaches have developed in the field: the first is the part based approach for layout type problems, involving optimising an articulated pictorial structure; the second is the pixel based approach for image labelling involving optimising a random field graph defined on the image. Our novel contribution is a formulation for pose estimation which combines these two models in a principled way in one optimisation problem and thereby inherits the advantages of both of them. Inference on this joint model finds the set of instances of persons in an image, the location of their joints, and a pixel-wise body part labelling. We achieve near or state of the art results on standard human pose data sets, and demonstrate the correct estimation for cases of self-occlusion, person overlap and image truncation.</p><br/>

The first three columns are the pictorial structure pose, instance segmentation and body-part segmentation obtained using our method; the last three columns are the corresponding ground truth. The method can naturally handle multiple instances. The algorithm successfully estimated the large majority of the instances and the locations of their joints. Furthermore, there are examples of partial occlusion by another person (A right, C left), a background object (C left) and self-occlusion (B right, C right). Some of the images also demonstrate failings, including: a phantom hallucinated instance (F left), a missed part in an uncommon location (F right), incorrect visibility of the part (B right, H right), limb assigned to a wrong person (D left / right), a missed instance due to a large occlusion (I middle) or an insufficient number of candidates for images with too many instances (K middle).  labels (person vs background) in the segmentation body-part domain. We restricted the algorithm to report only a pose of a single person. 333555888533</p>

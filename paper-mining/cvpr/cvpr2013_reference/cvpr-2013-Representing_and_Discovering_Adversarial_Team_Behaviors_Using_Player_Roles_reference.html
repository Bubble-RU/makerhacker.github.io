<br/><p>Source: <a title="cvpr-2013-356-pdf" href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Lucey_Representing_and_Discovering_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Patrick Lucey, Alina Bialkowski, Peter Carr, Stuart Morgan, Iain Matthews, Yaser Sheikh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe a method to represent and discover adversarial group behavior in a continuous domain. In comparison to other types of behavior, adversarial behavior is heavily structured as the location of a player (or agent) is dependent both on their teammates and adversaries, in addition to the tactics or strategies of the team. We present a method which can exploit this relationship through the use of a spatiotemporal basis model. As players constantly change roles during a match, we show that employing a “role-based” representation instead of one based on player “identity” can best exploit the playing structure. As vision-based systems currently do not provide perfect detection/tracking (e.g. missed or false detections), we show that our compact representation can effectively “denoise ” erroneous detections as well as enabling temporal analysis, which was previously prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the signal. To evaluate our approach, we used a fully instrumented field-hockey pitch with 8 fixed highdefinition (HD) cameras and evaluated our approach on approximately 200,000 frames of data from a state-of-the- art real-time player detector and compare it to manually labelled data.</p><br/>

These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><br/>

<p>Author: Carlotta Domeniconi, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p><p>Abstract: The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classification problems. It relies on t he assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence of classification performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.06705571 <a title="120-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongyuan Zha, Xiaofeng He, Chris Ding, Ming Gu, Horst D. Simon</p><p>Abstract: The popular K-means clustering partitions a data set by minimizing a sum-of-squares cost function. A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by computing a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by computing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function. 1</p><p>4 0.061405439 <a title="120-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Sampling_Techniques_for_Kernel_Methods.html">164 nips-2001-Sampling Techniques for Kernel Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitris Achlioptas, Frank Mcsherry, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We propose randomized techniques for speeding up Kernel Principal Component Analysis on three levels: sampling and quantization of the Gram matrix in training, randomized rounding in evaluating the kernel expansions, and random projections in evaluating the kernel itself. In all three cases, we give sharp bounds on the accuracy of the obtained approximations. Rather intriguingly, all three techniques can be viewed as instantiations of the following idea: replace the kernel function by a “randomized kernel” which behaves like in expectation.</p><p>5 0.059776925 <a title="120-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Kernel_Methods_for_Clustering.html">170 nips-2001-Spectral Kernel Methods for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor, Jaz S. Kandola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce new algorithms for unsupervised learning based on the use of a kernel matrix. All the information required by such algorithms is contained in the eigenvectors of the matrix or of closely related matrices. We use two different but related cost functions, the Alignment and the 'cut cost'. The first one is discussed in a companion paper [3], the second one is based on graph theoretic concepts. Both functions measure the level of clustering of a labeled dataset, or the correlation between data clusters and labels. We state the problem of unsupervised learning as assigning labels so as to optimize these cost functions. We show how the optimal solution can be approximated by slightly relaxing the corresponding optimization problem, and how this corresponds to using eigenvector information. The resulting simple algorithms are tested on real world data with positive results. 1</p><p>6 0.059375957 <a title="120-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>

<p>Author: James M. Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe the g-factor, which relates probability distributions on image features to distributions on the images themselves. The g-factor depends only on our choice of features and lattice quantization and is independent of the training image data. We illustrate the importance of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of Markov Random Field (i.e. Gibbs or log-linear) probability models of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn image distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to feature histogram statistics (d. Minimax Entropy Learning (MEL) by Zhu, Wu and Mumford 1997 [11]) . We first use our analysis of the g-factor to determine when the clique potentials decouple for different features . Second, we show that clique potentials can be computed analytically by approximating the g-factor. Third, we demonstrate a connection between this approximation and the Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm (GIS), due to Darroch and Ratcliff 1972 [2], for calculating potentials. This connection enables us to use GIS to improve our multinomial approximation, using Bethe-Kikuchi[8] approximations to simplify the GIS procedure. We support our analysis by computer simulations. 1</p><p>3 0.45596278 <a title="120-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Escaping_the_Convex_Hull_with_Extrapolated_Vector_Machines.html">69 nips-2001-Escaping the Convex Hull with Extrapolated Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Haffner</p><p>Abstract: Maximum margin classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) critically depends upon the convex hulls of the training samples of each class, as they implicitly search for the minimum distance between the convex hulls. We propose Extrapolated Vector Machines (XVMs) which rely on extrapolations outside these convex hulls. XVMs improve SVM generalization very significantly on the MNIST [7] OCR data. They share similarities with the Fisher discriminant: maximize the inter-class margin while minimizing the intra-class disparity. 1</p><p>4 0.42940766 <a title="120-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-On_Discriminative_vs._Generative_Classifiers%3A_A_comparison_of_logistic_regression_and_naive_Bayes.html">133 nips-2001-On Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widelyheld belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster. 1</p><p>5 0.41364214 <a title="120-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Concentration_of_Spectral_Properties.html">136 nips-2001-On the Concentration of Spectral Properties</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroshi Shimodaira, Ken-ichi Noma, Mitsuru Nakai, Shigeki Sagayama</p><p>Abstract: A new class of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is applicable to sequential-pattern recognition such as speech recognition is developed by incorporating an idea of non-linear time alignment into the kernel function. Since the time-alignment operation of sequential pattern is embedded in the new kernel function, standard SVM training and classiﬁcation algorithms can be employed without further modiﬁcations. The proposed SVM (DTAK-SVM) is evaluated in speaker-dependent speech recognition experiments of hand-segmented phoneme recognition. Preliminary experimental results show comparable recognition performance with hidden Markov models (HMMs). 1</p><p>3 0.36506853 <a title="120-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>4 0.36149809 <a title="120-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>

In such approaches, an object is defined by means of local features. fu this paper we show that including contextual information in object detection procedures provides an efficient way of cutting down the need for exhaustive search.

<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.36043558 <a title="120-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">183 nips-2001-The Infinite Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Samy Bengio, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are currently the state-of-the-art models for many classification problems but they suffer from the complexity of their training algorithm which is at least quadratic with respect to the number of examples. Hence, it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundreds of thousands examples with SVMs. The present paper proposes a new mixture of SVMs that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each SVM is trained on a small subset of the whole dataset. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (Forest) as well as a difficult speech database , yielded significant time improvement (time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples) . In addition, and that is a surprise, a significant improvement in generalization was observed on Forest. 1</p><p>3 0.18472622 <a title="95-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Products_of_Gaussians.html">154 nips-2001-Products of Gaussians</a></p>

Recently Hinton (1999) has introduced the Products of Experts (PoE) model in which several individual probabilistic models for data are combined to provide an overall model of the data. In this paper we consider PoE models in which each expert is a Gaussian. It is easy to see that in this case the product model will also be Gaussian. However, if each Gaussian has a simple structure, the product can have a richer structure. Using Gaussian experts is attractive as it permits a thorough analysis of the product architecture, which can be difficult with other models , e.g. models defined over discrete random variables. Below we examine three cases of the products of Gaussians construction: (1) Products of Gaussian pancakes (PoGP) which give rise to probabilistic Minor Components Analysis (MCA), providing a complementary result to probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) obtained by Tipping and Bishop (1999); (2) Products of I-factor PPCA models; (3) A products of experts construction for an AR(l) process.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Beal, Zoubin Ghahramani, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably inﬁnite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the inﬁnitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters deﬁne a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a ﬁnite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be inﬁnite— consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.</p><p>5 0.17286058 <a title="95-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-TAP_Gibbs_Free_Energy%2C_Belief_Propagation_and_Sparsity.html">178 nips-2001-TAP Gibbs Free Energy, Belief Propagation and Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: Learning curves for Gaussian process regression are well understood when the 'student' model happens to match the 'teacher' (true data generation process). I derive approximations to the learning curves for the more generic case of mismatched models, and find very rich behaviour: For large input space dimensionality, where the results become exact, there are universal (student-independent) plateaux in the learning curve, with transitions in between that can exhibit arbitrarily many over-fitting maxima; over-fitting can occur even if the student estimates the teacher noise level correctly. In lower dimensions, plateaux also appear, and the learning curve remains dependent on the mismatch between student and teacher even in the asymptotic limit of a large number of training examples. Learning with excessively strong smoothness assumptions can be particularly dangerous: For example, a student with a standard radial basis function covariance function will learn a rougher teacher function only logarithmically slowly. All predictions are confirmed by simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.41740778 <a title="95-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">183 nips-2001-The Infinite Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Chapados, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Joumana Ghosn, Charles Dugas, Ichiro Takeuchi, Linyan Meng</p><p>Abstract: Estimating insurance premia from data is a difficult regression problem for several reasons: the large number of variables, many of which are .discrete, and the very peculiar shape of the noise distribution, asymmetric with fat tails, with a large majority zeros and a few unreliable and very large values. We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78652436 <a title="95-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Infinite_Mixtures_of_Gaussian_Process_Experts.html">95 nips-2001-Infinite Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts</a></p>

<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>4 0.67333382 <a title="95-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>5 0.67008436 <a title="95-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Means%2C_Correlations_and_Bounds.html">119 nips-2001-Means, Correlations and Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Martijn Leisink, Bert Kappen</p><p>Abstract: The partition function for a Boltzmann machine can be bounded from above and below. We can use this to bound the means and the correlations. For networks with small weights, the values of these statistics can be restricted to non-trivial regions (i.e. a subset of [-1 , 1]). Experimental results show that reasonable bounding occurs for weight sizes where mean field expansions generally give good results. 1</p><p>6 0.66991109 <a title="95-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>

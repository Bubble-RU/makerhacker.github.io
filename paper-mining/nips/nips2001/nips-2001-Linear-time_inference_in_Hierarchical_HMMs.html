<p>Author: Matthew J. Beal, Zoubin Ghahramani, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably inﬁnite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the inﬁnitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters deﬁne a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a ﬁnite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be inﬁnite— consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.</p><p>3 0.17444305 <a title="115-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Relative_Density_Nets%3A_A_New_Way_to_Combine_Backpropagation_with_HMM%27s.html">162 nips-2001-Relative Density Nets: A New Way to Combine Backpropagation with HMM's</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>5 0.11667386 <a title="115-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Jens Kohlmorgen, Steven Lemm</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits an inherent mode switching. In particular, the data might be a non-stationary time series from a dynamical system that switches between multiple operating modes. Unlike other approaches, our method processes the data incrementally and without any training of internal parameters. We use an HMM with a dynamically changing number of states and an on-line variant of the Viterbi algorithm that performs an unsupervised segmentation and classification of the data on-the-fly, i.e. the method is able to process incoming data in real-time. The main idea of the approach is to track and segment changes of the probability density of the data in a sliding window on the incoming data stream. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application to a switching dynamical system. 1</p><p>5 0.46836087 <a title="115-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-ACh%2C_Uncertainty%2C_and_Cortical_Inference.html">3 nips-2001-ACh, Uncertainty, and Cortical Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Acetylcholine (ACh) has been implicated in a wide variety of tasks involving attentional processes and plasticity. Following extensive animal studies, it has previously been suggested that ACh reports on uncertainty and controls hippocampal, cortical and cortico-amygdalar plasticity. We extend this view and consider its effects on cortical representational inference, arguing that ACh controls the balance between bottom-up inference, inﬂuenced by input stimuli, and top-down inference, inﬂuenced by contextual information. We illustrate our proposal using a hierarchical hidden Markov model.</p><p>6 0.45903504 <a title="115-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

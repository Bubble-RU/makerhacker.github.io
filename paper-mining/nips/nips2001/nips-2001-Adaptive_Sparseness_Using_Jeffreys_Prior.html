<p>Author: Anita C. Faul, Michael E. Tipping</p><p>Abstract: The recent introduction of the 'relevance vector machine' has effectively demonstrated how sparsity may be obtained in generalised linear models within a Bayesian framework. Using a particular form of Gaussian parameter prior, 'learning' is the maximisation, with respect to hyperparameters, of the marginal likelihood of the data. This paper studies the properties of that objective function, and demonstrates that conditioned on an individual hyperparameter, the marginal likelihood has a unique maximum which is computable in closed form. It is further shown that if a derived 'sparsity criterion' is satisfied, this maximum is exactly equivalent to 'pruning' the corresponding parameter from the model. 1</p><p>3 0.15862523 <a title="29-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-A_General_Greedy_Approximation_Algorithm_with_Applications.html">8 nips-2001-A General Greedy Approximation Algorithm with Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Ji Zhu, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) is known for its good performance in binary classiﬁcation, but its extension to multi-class classiﬁcation is still an on-going research issue. In this paper, we propose a new approach for classiﬁcation, called the import vector machine (IVM), which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR). We show that the IVM not only performs as well as the SVM in binary classiﬁcation, but also can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar to the “support points” of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This gives the IVM a computational advantage over the SVM, especially when the size of the training data set is large.</p><p>3 0.71937162 <a title="29-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Analysis_of_Sparse_Bayesian_Learning.html">35 nips-2001-Analysis of Sparse Bayesian Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: A. D'avella, M. C. Tresch</p><p>Abstract: The question of whether the nervous system produces movement through the combination of a few discrete elements has long been central to the study of motor control. Muscle synergies, i.e. coordinated patterns of muscle activity, have been proposed as possible building blocks. Here we propose a model based on combinations of muscle synergies with a speciﬁc amplitude and temporal structure. Time-varying synergies provide a realistic basis for the decomposition of the complex patterns observed in natural behaviors. To extract time-varying synergies from simultaneous recording of EMG activity we developed an algorithm which extends existing non-negative matrix factorization techniques.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.8037796 <a title="29-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Adaptive_Sparseness_Using_Jeffreys_Prior.html">29 nips-2001-Adaptive Sparseness Using Jeffreys Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Sam T. Roweis, Lawrence K. Saul, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be described by a collection of local linear models. Such a description, however, does not provide a global parameterization of the manifold—arguably an important goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a collection of local linear models that solves this more difﬁcult problem. Our local linear models are represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the “global coordination” of these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a degeneracy in the mixture model’s parameter space, favoring models whose internal coordinate systems are aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coordinates change smoothly and continuously as one traverses a connected path on the manifold—even when the path crosses the domains of many different local models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and illustrates an unexpected application of variational methods: not to perform approximate inference in intractable probabilistic models, but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones. 1 Manifold Learning Consider an ensemble of images, each of which contains a face against a neutral background. Each image can be represented by a point in the high dimensional vector space of pixel intensities. This representation, however, does not exploit the strong correlations between pixels of the same image, nor does it support many useful operations for reasoning about faces. If, for example, we select two images with faces in widely different locations and then average their pixel intensities, we do not obtain an image of a face at their average location. Images of faces lie on or near a low-dimensional, curved manifold, and we can represent them more usefully by the coordinates on this manifold than by pixel intensities. Using these “intrinsic coordinates”, the average of two faces is another face with the average of their locations, poses and expressions. To analyze and manipulate faces, it is helpful to imagine a “magic black box” with levers or dials corresponding to the intrinsic coordinates on this manifold. Given a setting of the levers and dials, the box generates an image of a face. Given an image of a face, the box deduces the appropriate setting of the levers and dials. In this paper, we describe a fairly general way to construct such a box automatically from an ensemble of high-dimensional vectors. We assume only that there exists an underlying manifold of low dimensionality and that the relationship between the raw data and the manifold coordinates is locally linear and smoothly varying. Thus our method applies not only to images of faces, but also to many other forms of highly distributed perceptual and scientiﬁc data (e.g., spectrograms of speech, robotic sensors, gene expression arrays, document collections). 2 Local Linear Models The global structure of perceptual manifolds (such as images of faces) tends to be highly nonlinear. Fortunately, despite their complicated global structure, we can usually characterize these manifolds as locally linear. Thus, to a good approximation, they can be represented by collections of simpler models, each of which describes a locally linear neighborhood[3, 6, 8]. For unsupervised learning tasks, a probabilistic model that nicely captures this intuition is a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA)[5]. The model is used to describe high dimensional data that lies on or near a lower dimensional manifold. MFAs parameterize a joint distribution over observed and hidden variables: (1) where the observed variable, , represents the high dimensional data; the discrete hidden variables, , indexes different neighborhoods on the manifold; and the continuous hidden variables, , represent low dimensional local coordinates. The model assumes that data is sampled from different neighborhoods on the manifold with prior probabilities , and that within each neighborhood, the data’s local coordinates are normally distributed1 as:  RP&¤§¢  Q  ¡ I 0 (  3HGF D C¥@@@¥ 8¥75 ( E¨BAA9¨©©64§ 2 0 ( 31)£ ¥ ¡    ¡   ¥ ¡     ¥ §¥ ¡ &¤§¢'&§ %#¤¢$#¨</p><p>4 0.7219463 <a title="29-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>

Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>5 0.71865416 <a title="29-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Sampling_Techniques_for_Kernel_Methods.html">164 nips-2001-Sampling Techniques for Kernel Methods</a></p>

In all three cases, we give sharp bounds on the accuracy of the obtained approximations. Rather intriguingly, all three techniques can be viewed as instantiations of the following idea: replace the kernel function by a “randomized kernel” which behaves like in expectation.</p><p>6 0.71846759 <a title="29-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>

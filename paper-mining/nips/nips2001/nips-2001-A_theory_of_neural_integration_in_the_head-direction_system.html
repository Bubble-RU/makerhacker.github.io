<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>3 0.22569741 <a title="23-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Generating_velocity_tuning_by_asymmetric_recurrent_connections.html">82 nips-2001-Generating velocity tuning by asymmetric recurrent connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Asymmetric lateral connections are one possible mechanism that can account for the direction selectivity of cortical neurons. We present a mathematical analysis for a class of these models. Contrasting with earlier theoretical work that has relied on methods from linear systems theory, we study the network’s nonlinear dynamic properties that arise when the threshold nonlinearity of the neurons is taken into account. We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatiotemporal periodicity. This predicts that if direction selectivity in the cortex is mainly achieved by asymmetric lateral connections lurching activity waves might be observable in ensembles of direction selective cortical neurons within appropriate regimes of the stimulus speed.</p><p>4 0.20643097 <a title="23-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Self-regulation_Mechanism_of_Temporally_Asymmetric_Hebbian_Plasticity.html">166 nips-2001-Self-regulation Mechanism of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: N. Matsumoto, M. Okada</p><p>Abstract: Recent biological experimental ﬁndings have shown that the synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of the pre- and postsynaptic spikes which determines whether Long Term Potentiation (LTP) occurs or Long Term Depression (LTD) does. The synaptic plasticity has been called “Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian plasticity (TAH)”. Many authors have numerically shown that spatiotemporal patterns can be stored in neural networks. However, the mathematical mechanism for storage of the spatio-temporal patterns is still unknown, especially the eﬀects of LTD. In this paper, we employ a simple neural network model and show that interference of LTP and LTD disappears in a sparse coding scheme. On the other hand, it is known that the covariance learning is indispensable for storing sparse patterns. We also show that TAH qualitatively has the same eﬀect as the covariance learning when spatio-temporal patterns are embedded in the network. 1</p><p>5 0.20210665 <a title="23-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

In order to correctly integrate head-velocity signals during high-speed head rotations, very fast synaptic dynamics had to be assumed. Here we address the question whether integration in the head-direction system is possible with slow synapses, for example excitatory NMDA and inhibitory GABA(B) type synapses. For neural networks with such slow synapses, rate-based dynamics are a good approximation of spiking neurons [Ermentrout, 1994]. We ﬁnd that correct integration during high-speed head rotations imposes strong constraints on possible network architectures.</p><p>2 0.8788957 <a title="23-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_principles_in_unsupervised_learning_of_visual_structure%3A_human_data_and_a_model.html">151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</a></p>
<p>Author: Shimon Edelman, Benjamin P. Hiles, Hwajin Yang, Nathan Intrator</p><p>Abstract: To ﬁnd out how the representations of structured visual objects depend on the co-occurrence statistics of their constituents, we exposed subjects to a set of composite images with tight control exerted over (1) the conditional probabilities of the constituent fragments, and (2) the value of Barlow’s criterion of “suspicious coincidence” (the ratio of joint probability to the product of marginals). We then compared the part veriﬁcation response times for various probe/target combinations before and after the exposure. For composite probes, the speedup was much larger for targets that contained pairs of fragments perfectly predictive of each other, compared to those that did not. This effect was modulated by the signiﬁcance of their co-occurrence as estimated by Barlow’s criterion. For lone-fragment probes, the speedup in all conditions was generally lower than for composites. These results shed light on the brain’s strategies for unsupervised acquisition of structural information in vision. 1 Motivation How does the human visual system decide for which objects it should maintain distinct and persistent internal representations of the kind typically postulated by theories of object recognition? Consider, for example, the image shown in Figure 1, left. This image can be represented as a monolithic hieroglyph, a pair of Chinese characters (which we shall refer to as and ), a set of strokes, or, trivially, as a collection of pixels. Note that the second option is only available to a system previously exposed to various combinations of Chinese characters. Indeed, a principled decision whether to represent this image as , or otherwise can only be made on the basis of prior exposure to related images. £ ¡ £¦ ¡ £ ¥¨§¢   ¥¤¢   ¢ According to Barlow’s [1] insight, one useful principle is tallying suspicious coincidences: two candidate fragments and should be combined into a composite object if the probability of their joint appearance is much higher than , which is the probability expected in the case of their statistical independence. This criterion may be compared to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which has been previously discussed in the context of object representation [2, 3]. In a simpliﬁed form [4], MDL calls for representing explicitly as a whole if , just as the principle of suspicious coincidences does. £ ©¢  £  ¢ ¥¤¥  £¦ ¢ ¥  £  ¢   £¦ ¢ ¥¤¥! ¨§¥ £ ¢ £ ©¢  £¦  £ ¨§¢¥ ¡ ¢   While the Barlow/MDL criterion certainly indicates a suspicious coincidence, there are additional probabilistic considerations that may be used and .

<p>Author: Jonathan L. Shapiro, J. Wearden</p><p>Abstract: Animal data on delayed-reward conditioning experiments shows a striking property - the data for different time intervals collapses into a single curve when the data is scaled by the time interval. This is called the scalar property of interval timing. Here a simple model of a neural clock is presented and shown to give rise to the scalar property. The model is an accumulator consisting of noisy, linear spiking neurons. It is analytically tractable and contains only three parameters. When coupled with reinforcement learning it simulates peak procedure experiments, producing both the scalar property and the pattern of single trial covariances. 1</p><p>4 0.70894808 <a title="23-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Eye_movements_and_the_maturation_of_cortical_orientation_selectivity.html">73 nips-2001-Eye movements and the maturation of cortical orientation selectivity</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>5 0.64440089 <a title="23-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Discriminative_Direction_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">60 nips-2001-Discriminative Direction for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>6 0.61877316 <a title="23-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Perceptual_Metamers_in_Stereoscopic_Vision.html">145 nips-2001-Perceptual Metamers in Stereoscopic Vision</a></p>

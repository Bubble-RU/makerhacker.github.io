<h1>130 nips-2001-Natural Language Grammar Induction Using a Constituent-Context Model</h1>

Manning</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syntactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In contrast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher quality analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset. 1 Overview To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given tree-structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words called constituents, as in ﬁgure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to ﬁgure out, given just the sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts. It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difﬁculty of this task, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences [7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic expertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicit within a supervised parser’s supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised systems often have difﬁculty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the data is deﬁcient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4].

Several different distributional clustering approaches have resulted in relatively high-quality clusterings, though the clusters’ resemblance to classical parts-of-speech varies substantially [9, 15]. For the present work, we take the part-ofspeech induction problem as solved and work with sequences of parts-of-speech rather than words. In some ways this makes the problem easier, such as by reducing sparsity, but in other ways it complicates the task (even supervised parsers perform relatively poorly with the actual words replaced by parts-of-speech). Work attempting to induce tree structures has met with much less success. Most grammar induction work assumes that trees are generated by a symbolic or probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG or PCFG). These systems generally boil down to one of two types. Some ﬁx the structure of the grammar in advance [12], often with an aim to incorporate linguistic constraints [2] or prior knowledge [13]. These systems typically then attempt to ﬁnd the grammar production parameters which maximize the likelihood P(S| ) using the inside-outside algorithm [1], which is an efﬁcient (dynamic programming) instance of the EM algorithm [8] for PCFG s. Other systems (which have generally been more successful) incorporate a structural search as well, typically using a heuristic to propose candidate grammar modiﬁcations which minimize the joint encoding of data and grammar using an MDL criterion, which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding of the grammar and the data is compact [6, 16, 18, 17]. These approaches can also be seen as likelihood maximization where the objective function is the a posteriori likelihood of the grammar given the data, and the description length provides a structural prior. The “compact grammar” aspect of MDL is close to some traditional linguistic argumentation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical [10] or cognitive [5] economy. However, the primary weakness of MDL-based systems does not have to do with the objective function, but the search procedures they employ. Such systems end up growing structures greedily, in a bottom-up fashion. Therefore, their induction quality is determined by how well they are able to heuristically predict what local intermediate structures will ﬁt into good ﬁnal global solutions. A potential advantage of systems which ﬁx the grammar and only perform parameter search is that they do compare complete grammars against each other, and are therefore able to detect which give rise to systematically compatible parses. However, although early work showed that small, artiﬁcial CFGs could be induced with the EM algorithm [12], studies with large natural language grammars have generally suggested that completely unsupervised EM over PCFG s is ineffective for grammar acquisition. For instance, Carroll and Charniak [2] describe experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which produced widely varying learned grammars, almost all of extremely poor quality. 1 1 We duplicated one of their experiments, which used grammars restricted to rules of the form x → x y | y x, where there is one category x for each part-of-speech (such a restricted CFG is isomorphic to a dependency grammar). We began reestimation from a grammar with uniform rewrite It is well-known that EM is only locally optimal, and one might think that the locality of the search procedure, not the objective function, is to blame. The truth is somewhere in between. There are linguistic reasons to distrust an ML objective function. It encourages the symbols and rules to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional independence assumptions embodied by the PCFG. The symbols and rules of a natural language grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units, for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made [14]. None of these have anything to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reﬂects only grammatical regularities and possibilities for expansion. There are expected to be strong connections across phrases (such as dependencies between verbs and their selected arguments). It could be that ML over PCFGs and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do not always seem to. Experiments with both artiﬁcial [12] and real [13] data have shown that starting from ﬁxed, correct (or at least linguistically reasonable) structure, EM produces a grammar which has higher log-likelihood than the linguistically determined grammar, but lower parsing accuracy. However, we additionally conjecture that EM over PCFGs fails to propagate contextual cues efﬁciently. The reason we expect an algorithm to converge on a good PCFG is that there seem to be coherent categories, like noun phrases, which occur in distinctive environments, like between the beginning of the sentence and the verb phrase. In the inside-outside algorithm, the product of inside and outside probabilities α j ( p, q)β j ( p, q) is the probability of generating the sentence with a j constituent spanning words p through q: the outside probability captures the environment, and the inside probability the coherent category. If we had a good idea of what VPs and NPs looked like, then if a novel NP appeared in an NP context, the outside probabilities should pressure the sequence to be parsed as an NP . However, what happens early in the EM procedure, when we have no real idea about the grammar parameters? With randomly-weighted, complete grammars over a symbol set X, we have observed that a frequent, short, noun phrase sequence often does get assigned to some category x early on. However, since there is not a clear overall structure learned, there is only very weak pressure for other NPs, even if they occur in the same positions, to also be assigned to x, and the reestimation process goes astray. To enable this kind of constituent-context pressure to be effective, we propose the model in the following section. 3 The Constituent-Context Model We propose an alternate parametric family of models over trees which is better suited for grammar induction. Broadly speaking, inducing trees like the one shown in ﬁgure 1(a) can be broken into two tasks. One is deciding constituent identity: where the brackets should be placed. The second is deciding what to label the constituents. These tasks are certainly correlated and are usually solved jointly. However, the task of labeling chosen brackets is essentially the same as the part-of-speech induction problem, and the solutions cited above can be adapted to cluster constituents [6]. The task of deciding brackets, is the harder task. For example, the sequence DT NN IN DT NN ([the man in the moon]) is virtually always a noun phrase when it is a constituent, but it is only a constituent 66% of the time, because the IN DT NN is often attached elsewhere ([we [sent a man] [to the moon]]). Figure 2(a) probabilities. Figure 4 shows that the resulting grammar (DEP - PCFG) is not as bad as conventional wisdom suggests. Carroll and Charniak are right to observe that the search spaces is riddled with pronounced local maxima, and EM does not do nearly so well when randomly initialized. The need for random seeding in using EM over PCFGs is two-fold. For some grammars, such as one over a set X of non-terminals in which any x 1 → x2 x3 , xi ∈ X is possible, it is needed to break symmetry. This is not the case for dependency grammars, where symmetry is broken by the yields (e.g., a sentence noun verb can only be covered by a noun or verb projection). The second reason is to start the search from a random region of the space. But unless one does many random restarts, the uniform starting condition is better than most extreme points in the space, and produces superior results. 1.5 2 Usually a Constituent Rarely a Constituent 1 1 0.5 0 0 −1 −2 −3 −1.5 −1 −0.5 NP VP PP −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 (a) (b) Figure 2: The most frequent examples of (a) different constituent labels and (b) constituents and non-constituents, in the vector space of linear contexts, projected onto the ﬁrst two principal components. Clustering is effective for labeling, but not detecting constituents. shows the 50 most frequent constituent sequences of three types, represented as points in the vector space of their contexts (see below), projected onto their ﬁrst two principal components. The three clusters are relatively coherent, and it is not difﬁcult to believe that a clustering algorithm could detect them in the unprojected space. Figure 2(a), however, shows 150 sequences which are parsed as constituents at least 50% of the time along with 150 which are not, again projected onto the ﬁrst two components. This plot at least suggests that the constituent/non-constituent classiﬁcation is less amenable to direct clustering. Thus, it is important that an induction system be able to detect constituents, either implicitly or explicitly. A variety of methods of constituent detection have been proposed [11, 6], usually based on information-theoretic properties of a sequence’s distributional context. However, here we rely entirely on the following two simple assumptions: (i) constituents of a parse do not cross each other, and (ii) constituents occur in constituent contexts. The ﬁrst property is self-evident from the nature of the parse trees. The second is an extremely weakened version of classic linguistic constituency tests [14]. Let σ be a terminal sequence. Every occurrence of σ will be in some linear context c(σ ) = x σ y, where x and y are the adjacent terminals or sentence boundaries. Then we can view any tree t over a sentence s as a collection of sequences and contexts, one of each for every node in the tree, plus one for each inter-terminal empty span, as in ﬁgure 1(b). Good trees will include nodes whose yields frequently occur as constituents and whose contexts frequently surround constituents. Formally, we use a conditional exponential model of the form: exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) P(t|s, ) = t:yield(t)=s exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) We have one feature f σ (t) for each sequence σ whose value on a tree t is the number of nodes in t with yield σ , and one feature f c (t) for each context c representing the number of times c is the context of the yield of some node in the tree.2 No joint features over c and σ are used, and, unlike many other systems, there is no distinction between constituent types. We model only the conditional likelihood of the trees, P(T |S, ), where = {λ σ , λc }. We then use an iterative EM-style procedure to ﬁnd a local maximum P(T |S, ) of the completed data (trees) T (P(T |S, ) = t∈T ,s=yield(t) P(t|s, )). We initialize such that each λ is zero and initialize T to any arbitrary set of trees. In alternating steps, we ﬁrst ﬁx the parameters and ﬁnd the most probable single tree structure t ∗ for each sentence s according to P(t|s, ), using a simple dynamic program. For any this produces the 2 So, for the tree in ﬁgure 1(a), P(t|s) ∝ exp(λ NN NNS + λVBD IN NN + λIN NN + λ −VBD + λNNS− + λVBD− + λ −NNS + λNN−VBD + λNNS−IN + λVBD−NN + λIN− ). set of parses T ∗ which maximizes P(T |S, ). Since T ∗ maximizes this quantity, if T is the former set of trees, P(T ∗ |S, ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Second, we ﬁx the trees and estimate new parameters . The task of ﬁnding the parameters ∗ which maximize P(T |S, ) is simply the well-studied task of ﬁtting our exponential model to maximize the conditional likelihood of the ﬁxed parses. Running, for example, a conjugate gradient (CG) ascent on will produce the desired ∗ . If is the former parameters, then we will have P(T |S, ∗ ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Therefore, each iteration will increase P(T |S, ) until convergence.3 Note that our parsing model is not a generative model, and this procedure, though clearly related, is not exactly an instance of the EM algorithm. We merely guarantee that the conditional likelihood of the data completions is increasing. Furthermore, unlike in EM where each iteration increases the marginal likelihood of the ﬁxed observed data, our procedure increases the conditional likelihood of a changing complete data set, with the completions changing at every iteration as we reparse. Several implementation details were important in making the system work well. First, tiebreaking was needed, most of all for the ﬁrst round. Initially, the parameters are zero, and all parses are therefore equally likely. To prevent bias, all ties were broken randomly. Second, like so many statistical NLP tasks, smoothing was vital. There are features in our model for arbitrarily long yields and most yield types occurred only a few times. The most severe consequence of this sparsity was that initial parsing choices could easily become frozen. If a λσ for some yield σ was either 0 or 0, which was usually the case for rare yields, σ would either be locked into always occurring or never occurring, respectively. Not only did we want to push the λσ values close to zero, we also wanted to account for the fact that most spans are not constituents.4 Therefore, we expect the distribution of the λσ to be skewed towards low values.5 A greater amount of smoothing was needed for the ﬁrst few iterations, while much less was required in later iterations. Finally, parameter estimation using a CG method was slow and difﬁcult to smooth in the desired manner, and so we used the smoothed relative frequency estimates λ σ = count( fσ )/(count(σ ) + M) and λc = count( f c )/(count(c) + N). These estimates ensured that the λ values were between 0 and 1, and gave the desired bias towards non-constituency. These estimates were fast and surprisingly effective, but do not guarantee non-decreasing conditional likelihood (though the conditional likelihood was increasing in practice). 6 4 Results In all experiments, we used hand-parsed sentences from the Penn Treebank. For training, we took the approximately 7500 sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section which contained 10 words or fewer after the removal of punctuation. For testing, we evaluated the system by comparing the system’s parses for those same sentences against the supervised parses in the treebank. We consider each parse as a set of constituent brackets, discarding all trivial brackets.7 We calculated the precision and recall of these brackets against the treebank parses in the obvious way. 3 In practice, we stopped the system after 10 iterations, but ﬁnal behavior was apparent after 4–8. 4 In a sentence of length n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 total (possibly size zero) spans, but only 3n constituent spans: n − 1 of size ≥ 2, n of size 1, and n + 1 empty spans. 5 Gaussian priors for the exponential model accomplish the former goal, but not the latter. 6 The relative frequency estimators had a somewhat subtle positive effect. Empty spans have no effect on the model when using CG ﬁtting, as all trees include the same empty spans. However, including their counts improved performance substantially when using relative frequency estimators. This is perhaps an indication that a generative version of this model would be advantageous. 7 We discarded both brackets of length one and brackets spanning the entire sentence, since all of these are impossible to get incorrect, and hence ignored sentences of length ≤ 2 during testing.

UR = unlabeled recall; UP = unlabeled precision; F1 = the harmonic mean of UR and UP; CB = crossing brackets. Separate recall values are shown for three major categories. To situate the results of our system, ﬁgure 4(a) gives the values of several parsing strategies. CCM is our constituent-context model. DEP - PCFG is a dependency PCFG model [2] trained using the inside-outside algorithm. Figure 3 shows sample parses to give a feel for the parses the systems produce. We also tested several baselines. RANDOM parses randomly. This is an appropriate baseline for an unsupervised system. RBRANCH always chooses the right-branching chain, while LBRANCH always chooses the left-branching chain. RBRANCH is often used as a baseline for supervised systems, but exploits a systematic right-branching tendency of English. An unsupervised system has no a priori reason to prefer right chains to left chains, and LBRANCH is well worse than RANDOM. A system need not beat RBRANCH to claim partial success at grammar induction. Finally, we include an upper bound. All of the parsing strategies and systems mentioned here give fully binary-branching structures. Treebank trees, however, need not be fully binary-branching, and generally are not. As a result, there is an upper bound UBOUND on the precision and F1 scores achievable when structurally conﬁned to binary trees. Clearly, CCM is parsing much better than the RANDOM baseline and the DEP - PCFG induced grammar. Signiﬁcantly, it also out-performs RBRANCH in both precision and recall, and, to our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst unsupervised system to do so. To facilitate comparison with other recent systems, ﬁgure 4(b) gives results where we trained as before but used (all) the sentences from the distributionally different ATIS section of the treebank as a test set. For this experiment, precision and recall were calculated using the EVALB system of measuring precision and recall (as in [6, 17]) – EVALB is a standard for parser evaluation, but complex, and unsuited to evaluating unlabeled constituency. EMILE and ABL are lexical systems described in [17]. The results for CDC-40, from [6], reﬂect training on much more data (12M words). Our system is superior in terms of both precision and recall (and so F 1 ). These ﬁgures are certainly not all that there is to say about an induced grammar; there are a number of issues in how to interpret the results of an unsupervised system when comparing with treebank parses. Errors come in several kinds. First are innocent sins of commission. Treebank trees are very ﬂat; for example, there is no analysis of the inside of many short noun phrases ([two hard drives] rather than [two [hard drives]]). Our system gives a Sequence DT NN NNP NNP CD CD JJ NNS DT JJ NN DT NNS JJ NN CD NN IN NN IN DT NN NN NNS NN NN TO VB DT JJ IN DT PRP VBZ PRP VBP NNS VBP NN VBZ NN IN NNS VBD Example the man United States 4 1/2 daily yields the top rank the people plastic furniture 12 percent on Monday for the moment ﬁre trucks ﬁre truck to go ?the big *of the ?he says ?they say ?people are ?value is *man from ?people were CORRECT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 22 26 78 90 95 180 =350 =532 =648 =648 FREQUENCY 2 1 9 7 – – 3 – – – – 8 – 6 4 – – – 10 5 – ENTROPY 2 – – 3 – – 7 – 9 – 6 10 1 – – – – 4 5 – 8 DEP - PCFG 1 2 5 4 7 – 3 – – – – – 6 – 10 8 9 – – – – CCM 1 2 5 4 6 10 3 9 – – 8 7 – – – – – – – – – Figure 5: Top non-trivial sequences by actual treebank constituent counts, linear frequency, scaled context entropy, and in DEP - PCFG and CCM learned models’ parses. (usually correct) analysis of the insides of such NPs, for which it is penalized on precision (though not recall or crossing brackets). Second are systematic alternate analyses. Our system tends to form modal verb groups and often attaches verbs ﬁrst to pronoun subjects rather than to objects. As a result, many VPs are systematically incorrect, boosting crossing bracket scores and impacting VP recall. Finally, the treebank’s grammar is sometimes an arbitrary, and even inconsistent standard for an unsupervised learner: alternate analyses may be just as good.8 Notwithstanding this, we believe that the treebank parses have enough truth in them that parsing scores are a useful component of evaluation. Ideally, we would like to inspect the quality of the grammar directly. Unfortunately, the grammar acquired by our system is implicit in the learned feature weights. These are not by themselves particularly interpretable, and not directly comparable to the grammars produced by other systems, except through their functional behavior. Any grammar which parses a corpus will have a distribution over which sequences tend to be analyzed as constituents. These distributions can give a good sense of what structures are and are not being learned. Therefore, to supplement the parsing scores above, we examine these distributions. Figure 5 shows the top scoring constituents by several orderings. These lists do not say very much about how long, complex, recursive constructions are being analyzed by a given system, but grammar induction systems are still at the level where major mistakes manifest themselves in short, frequent sequences. CORRECT ranks sequences by how often they occur as constituents in the treebank parses. DEP - PCFG and CCM are the same, but use counts from the DEP - PCFG and CCM parses. As a baseline, FREQUENCY lists sequences by how often they occur anywhere in the sentence yields. Note that the sequence IN DT (e.g., “of the”) is high on this list, and is a typical error of many early systems. Finally, ENTROPY is the heuristic proposed in [11] which ranks by context entropy. It is better in practice than FREQUENCY , but that isn’t self-evident from this list. Clearly, the lists produced by the CCM system are closer to correct than the others. They look much like a censored version of the FREQUENCY list, where sequences which do not co-exist with higher-ranked ones have been removed (e.g., IN DT often crosses DT NN). This observation may explain a good part of the success of this method. Another explanation for the surprising success of the system is that it exploits a deep fact about language. Most long constituents have some short, frequent equivalent, or proform, which occurs in similar contexts [14]. In the very common case where the proform is a single word, it is guaranteed constituency, which will be transmitted to longer sequences 8 For example, transitive sentences are bracketed [subject [verb object]] (The president [executed the law]) while nominalizations are bracketed [[possessive noun] complement] ([The president’s execution] of the law), an arbitrary inconsistency which is unlikely to be learned automatically. via shared contexts (categories like PP which have infrequent proforms are not learned well unless the empty sequence is in the model – interestingly, the empty sequence appears to act as the proform for PPs, possibly due to the highly optional nature of many PPs). 5 Conclusions We have presented an alternate probability model over trees which is based on simple assumptions about the nature of natural language structure. It is driven by the explicit transfer between sequences and their contexts, and exploits both the proform phenomenon and the fact that good constituents must tile in ways that systematically cover the corpus sentences without crossing. The model clearly has limits. Lacking recursive features, it essentially must analyze long, rare constructions using only contexts. However, despite, or perhaps due to its simplicity, our model predicts bracketings very well, producing higher quality structural analyses than previous methods which employ the PCFG model family.

<p>Author: Dan Klein, Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syntactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In contrast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher quality analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset. 1 Overview To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given tree-structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words called constituents, as in ﬁgure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to ﬁgure out, given just the sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts. It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difﬁculty of this task, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences [7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic expertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicit within a supervised parser’s supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised systems often have difﬁculty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the data is deﬁcient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4].

Several different distributional clustering approaches have resulted in relatively high-quality clusterings, though the clusters’ resemblance to classical parts-of-speech varies substantially [9, 15]. For the present work, we take the part-ofspeech induction problem as solved and work with sequences of parts-of-speech rather than words. In some ways this makes the problem easier, such as by reducing sparsity, but in other ways it complicates the task (even supervised parsers perform relatively poorly with the actual words replaced by parts-of-speech). Work attempting to induce tree structures has met with much less success. Most grammar induction work assumes that trees are generated by a symbolic or probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG or PCFG). These systems generally boil down to one of two types. Some ﬁx the structure of the grammar in advance [12], often with an aim to incorporate linguistic constraints [2] or prior knowledge [13]. These systems typically then attempt to ﬁnd the grammar production parameters which maximize the likelihood P(S| ) using the inside-outside algorithm [1], which is an efﬁcient (dynamic programming) instance of the EM algorithm [8] for PCFG s. Other systems (which have generally been more successful) incorporate a structural search as well, typically using a heuristic to propose candidate grammar modiﬁcations which minimize the joint encoding of data and grammar using an MDL criterion, which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding of the grammar and the data is compact [6, 16, 18, 17]. These approaches can also be seen as likelihood maximization where the objective function is the a posteriori likelihood of the grammar given the data, and the description length provides a structural prior. The “compact grammar” aspect of MDL is close to some traditional linguistic argumentation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical [10] or cognitive [5] economy. However, the primary weakness of MDL-based systems does not have to do with the objective function, but the search procedures they employ. Such systems end up growing structures greedily, in a bottom-up fashion. Therefore, their induction quality is determined by how well they are able to heuristically predict what local intermediate structures will ﬁt into good ﬁnal global solutions. A potential advantage of systems which ﬁx the grammar and only perform parameter search is that they do compare complete grammars against each other, and are therefore able to detect which give rise to systematically compatible parses. However, although early work showed that small, artiﬁcial CFGs could be induced with the EM algorithm [12], studies with large natural language grammars have generally suggested that completely unsupervised EM over PCFG s is ineffective for grammar acquisition. For instance, Carroll and Charniak [2] describe experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which produced widely varying learned grammars, almost all of extremely poor quality. 1 1 We duplicated one of their experiments, which used grammars restricted to rules of the form x → x y | y x, where there is one category x for each part-of-speech (such a restricted CFG is isomorphic to a dependency grammar). We began reestimation from a grammar with uniform rewrite It is well-known that EM is only locally optimal, and one might think that the locality of the search procedure, not the objective function, is to blame. The truth is somewhere in between. There are linguistic reasons to distrust an ML objective function. It encourages the symbols and rules to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional independence assumptions embodied by the PCFG. The symbols and rules of a natural language grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units, for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made [14]. None of these have anything to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reﬂects only grammatical regularities and possibilities for expansion. There are expected to be strong connections across phrases (such as dependencies between verbs and their selected arguments). It could be that ML over PCFGs and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do not always seem to. Experiments with both artiﬁcial [12] and real [13] data have shown that starting from ﬁxed, correct (or at least linguistically reasonable) structure, EM produces a grammar which has higher log-likelihood than the linguistically determined grammar, but lower parsing accuracy. However, we additionally conjecture that EM over PCFGs fails to propagate contextual cues efﬁciently. The reason we expect an algorithm to converge on a good PCFG is that there seem to be coherent categories, like noun phrases, which occur in distinctive environments, like between the beginning of the sentence and the verb phrase. In the inside-outside algorithm, the product of inside and outside probabilities α j ( p, q)β j ( p, q) is the probability of generating the sentence with a j constituent spanning words p through q: the outside probability captures the environment, and the inside probability the coherent category. If we had a good idea of what VPs and NPs looked like, then if a novel NP appeared in an NP context, the outside probabilities should pressure the sequence to be parsed as an NP . However, what happens early in the EM procedure, when we have no real idea about the grammar parameters? With randomly-weighted, complete grammars over a symbol set X, we have observed that a frequent, short, noun phrase sequence often does get assigned to some category x early on. However, since there is not a clear overall structure learned, there is only very weak pressure for other NPs, even if they occur in the same positions, to also be assigned to x, and the reestimation process goes astray. To enable this kind of constituent-context pressure to be effective, we propose the model in the following section. 3 The Constituent-Context Model We propose an alternate parametric family of models over trees which is better suited for grammar induction. Broadly speaking, inducing trees like the one shown in ﬁgure 1(a) can be broken into two tasks. One is deciding constituent identity: where the brackets should be placed. The second is deciding what to label the constituents. These tasks are certainly correlated and are usually solved jointly. However, the task of labeling chosen brackets is essentially the same as the part-of-speech induction problem, and the solutions cited above can be adapted to cluster constituents [6]. The task of deciding brackets, is the harder task. For example, the sequence DT NN IN DT NN ([the man in the moon]) is virtually always a noun phrase when it is a constituent, but it is only a constituent 66% of the time, because the IN DT NN is often attached elsewhere ([we [sent a man] [to the moon]]). Figure 2(a) probabilities. Figure 4 shows that the resulting grammar (DEP - PCFG) is not as bad as conventional wisdom suggests. Carroll and Charniak are right to observe that the search spaces is riddled with pronounced local maxima, and EM does not do nearly so well when randomly initialized. The need for random seeding in using EM over PCFGs is two-fold. For some grammars, such as one over a set X of non-terminals in which any x 1 → x2 x3 , xi ∈ X is possible, it is needed to break symmetry. This is not the case for dependency grammars, where symmetry is broken by the yields (e.g., a sentence noun verb can only be covered by a noun or verb projection). The second reason is to start the search from a random region of the space. But unless one does many random restarts, the uniform starting condition is better than most extreme points in the space, and produces superior results. 1.5 2 Usually a Constituent Rarely a Constituent 1 1 0.5 0 0 −1 −2 −3 −1.5 −1 −0.5 NP VP PP −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 (a) (b) Figure 2: The most frequent examples of (a) different constituent labels and (b) constituents and non-constituents, in the vector space of linear contexts, projected onto the ﬁrst two principal components. Clustering is effective for labeling, but not detecting constituents. shows the 50 most frequent constituent sequences of three types, represented as points in the vector space of their contexts (see below), projected onto their ﬁrst two principal components. The three clusters are relatively coherent, and it is not difﬁcult to believe that a clustering algorithm could detect them in the unprojected space. Figure 2(a), however, shows 150 sequences which are parsed as constituents at least 50% of the time along with 150 which are not, again projected onto the ﬁrst two components. This plot at least suggests that the constituent/non-constituent classiﬁcation is less amenable to direct clustering. Thus, it is important that an induction system be able to detect constituents, either implicitly or explicitly. A variety of methods of constituent detection have been proposed [11, 6], usually based on information-theoretic properties of a sequence’s distributional context. However, here we rely entirely on the following two simple assumptions: (i) constituents of a parse do not cross each other, and (ii) constituents occur in constituent contexts. The ﬁrst property is self-evident from the nature of the parse trees. The second is an extremely weakened version of classic linguistic constituency tests [14]. Let σ be a terminal sequence. Every occurrence of σ will be in some linear context c(σ ) = x σ y, where x and y are the adjacent terminals or sentence boundaries. Then we can view any tree t over a sentence s as a collection of sequences and contexts, one of each for every node in the tree, plus one for each inter-terminal empty span, as in ﬁgure 1(b). Good trees will include nodes whose yields frequently occur as constituents and whose contexts frequently surround constituents. Formally, we use a conditional exponential model of the form: exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) P(t|s, ) = t:yield(t)=s exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) We have one feature f σ (t) for each sequence σ whose value on a tree t is the number of nodes in t with yield σ , and one feature f c (t) for each context c representing the number of times c is the context of the yield of some node in the tree.2 No joint features over c and σ are used, and, unlike many other systems, there is no distinction between constituent types. We model only the conditional likelihood of the trees, P(T |S, ), where = {λ σ , λc }. We then use an iterative EM-style procedure to ﬁnd a local maximum P(T |S, ) of the completed data (trees) T (P(T |S, ) = t∈T ,s=yield(t) P(t|s, )). We initialize such that each λ is zero and initialize T to any arbitrary set of trees. In alternating steps, we ﬁrst ﬁx the parameters and ﬁnd the most probable single tree structure t ∗ for each sentence s according to P(t|s, ), using a simple dynamic program. For any this produces the 2 So, for the tree in ﬁgure 1(a), P(t|s) ∝ exp(λ NN NNS + λVBD IN NN + λIN NN + λ −VBD + λNNS− + λVBD− + λ −NNS + λNN−VBD + λNNS−IN + λVBD−NN + λIN− ). set of parses T ∗ which maximizes P(T |S, ). Since T ∗ maximizes this quantity, if T is the former set of trees, P(T ∗ |S, ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Second, we ﬁx the trees and estimate new parameters . The task of ﬁnding the parameters ∗ which maximize P(T |S, ) is simply the well-studied task of ﬁtting our exponential model to maximize the conditional likelihood of the ﬁxed parses. Running, for example, a conjugate gradient (CG) ascent on will produce the desired ∗ . If is the former parameters, then we will have P(T |S, ∗ ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Therefore, each iteration will increase P(T |S, ) until convergence.3 Note that our parsing model is not a generative model, and this procedure, though clearly related, is not exactly an instance of the EM algorithm. We merely guarantee that the conditional likelihood of the data completions is increasing. Furthermore, unlike in EM where each iteration increases the marginal likelihood of the ﬁxed observed data, our procedure increases the conditional likelihood of a changing complete data set, with the completions changing at every iteration as we reparse. Several implementation details were important in making the system work well. First, tiebreaking was needed, most of all for the ﬁrst round. Initially, the parameters are zero, and all parses are therefore equally likely. To prevent bias, all ties were broken randomly. Second, like so many statistical NLP tasks, smoothing was vital. There are features in our model for arbitrarily long yields and most yield types occurred only a few times. The most severe consequence of this sparsity was that initial parsing choices could easily become frozen. If a λσ for some yield σ was either 0 or 0, which was usually the case for rare yields, σ would either be locked into always occurring or never occurring, respectively. Not only did we want to push the λσ values close to zero, we also wanted to account for the fact that most spans are not constituents.4 Therefore, we expect the distribution of the λσ to be skewed towards low values.5 A greater amount of smoothing was needed for the ﬁrst few iterations, while much less was required in later iterations. Finally, parameter estimation using a CG method was slow and difﬁcult to smooth in the desired manner, and so we used the smoothed relative frequency estimates λ σ = count( fσ )/(count(σ ) + M) and λc = count( f c )/(count(c) + N). These estimates ensured that the λ values were between 0 and 1, and gave the desired bias towards non-constituency. These estimates were fast and surprisingly effective, but do not guarantee non-decreasing conditional likelihood (though the conditional likelihood was increasing in practice). 6 4 Results In all experiments, we used hand-parsed sentences from the Penn Treebank. For training, we took the approximately 7500 sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section which contained 10 words or fewer after the removal of punctuation. For testing, we evaluated the system by comparing the system’s parses for those same sentences against the supervised parses in the treebank. We consider each parse as a set of constituent brackets, discarding all trivial brackets.7 We calculated the precision and recall of these brackets against the treebank parses in the obvious way. 3 In practice, we stopped the system after 10 iterations, but ﬁnal behavior was apparent after 4–8. 4 In a sentence of length n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 total (possibly size zero) spans, but only 3n constituent spans: n − 1 of size ≥ 2, n of size 1, and n + 1 empty spans. 5 Gaussian priors for the exponential model accomplish the former goal, but not the latter. 6 The relative frequency estimators had a somewhat subtle positive effect. Empty spans have no effect on the model when using CG ﬁtting, as all trees include the same empty spans. However, including their counts improved performance substantially when using relative frequency estimators. This is perhaps an indication that a generative version of this model would be advantageous. 7 We discarded both brackets of length one and brackets spanning the entire sentence, since all of these are impossible to get incorrect, and hence ignored sentences of length ≤ 2 during testing.

UR = unlabeled recall; UP = unlabeled precision; F1 = the harmonic mean of UR and UP; CB = crossing brackets. Separate recall values are shown for three major categories. To situate the results of our system, ﬁgure 4(a) gives the values of several parsing strategies. CCM is our constituent-context model. DEP - PCFG is a dependency PCFG model [2] trained using the inside-outside algorithm. Figure 3 shows sample parses to give a feel for the parses the systems produce. We also tested several baselines. RANDOM parses randomly. This is an appropriate baseline for an unsupervised system. RBRANCH always chooses the right-branching chain, while LBRANCH always chooses the left-branching chain. RBRANCH is often used as a baseline for supervised systems, but exploits a systematic right-branching tendency of English. An unsupervised system has no a priori reason to prefer right chains to left chains, and LBRANCH is well worse than RANDOM. A system need not beat RBRANCH to claim partial success at grammar induction. Finally, we include an upper bound. All of the parsing strategies and systems mentioned here give fully binary-branching structures. Treebank trees, however, need not be fully binary-branching, and generally are not. As a result, there is an upper bound UBOUND on the precision and F1 scores achievable when structurally conﬁned to binary trees. Clearly, CCM is parsing much better than the RANDOM baseline and the DEP - PCFG induced grammar. Signiﬁcantly, it also out-performs RBRANCH in both precision and recall, and, to our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst unsupervised system to do so. To facilitate comparison with other recent systems, ﬁgure 4(b) gives results where we trained as before but used (all) the sentences from the distributionally different ATIS section of the treebank as a test set. For this experiment, precision and recall were calculated using the EVALB system of measuring precision and recall (as in [6, 17]) – EVALB is a standard for parser evaluation, but complex, and unsuited to evaluating unlabeled constituency. EMILE and ABL are lexical systems described in [17]. The results for CDC-40, from [6], reﬂect training on much more data (12M words). Our system is superior in terms of both precision and recall (and so F 1 ). These ﬁgures are certainly not all that there is to say about an induced grammar; there are a number of issues in how to interpret the results of an unsupervised system when comparing with treebank parses. Errors come in several kinds. First are innocent sins of commission. Treebank trees are very ﬂat; for example, there is no analysis of the inside of many short noun phrases ([two hard drives] rather than [two [hard drives]]). Our system gives a Sequence DT NN NNP NNP CD CD JJ NNS DT JJ NN DT NNS JJ NN CD NN IN NN IN DT NN NN NNS NN NN TO VB DT JJ IN DT PRP VBZ PRP VBP NNS VBP NN VBZ NN IN NNS VBD Example the man United States 4 1/2 daily yields the top rank the people plastic furniture 12 percent on Monday for the moment ﬁre trucks ﬁre truck to go ?the big *of the ?he says ?they say ?people are ?value is *man from ?people were CORRECT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 22 26 78 90 95 180 =350 =532 =648 =648 FREQUENCY 2 1 9 7 – – 3 – – – – 8 – 6 4 – – – 10 5 – ENTROPY 2 – – 3 – – 7 – 9 – 6 10 1 – – – – 4 5 – 8 DEP - PCFG 1 2 5 4 7 – 3 – – – – – 6 – 10 8 9 – – – – CCM 1 2 5 4 6 10 3 9 – – 8 7 – – – – – – – – – Figure 5: Top non-trivial sequences by actual treebank constituent counts, linear frequency, scaled context entropy, and in DEP - PCFG and CCM learned models’ parses. (usually correct) analysis of the insides of such NPs, for which it is penalized on precision (though not recall or crossing brackets). Second are systematic alternate analyses. Our system tends to form modal verb groups and often attaches verbs ﬁrst to pronoun subjects rather than to objects. As a result, many VPs are systematically incorrect, boosting crossing bracket scores and impacting VP recall. Finally, the treebank’s grammar is sometimes an arbitrary, and even inconsistent standard for an unsupervised learner: alternate analyses may be just as good.8 Notwithstanding this, we believe that the treebank parses have enough truth in them that parsing scores are a useful component of evaluation. Ideally, we would like to inspect the quality of the grammar directly. Unfortunately, the grammar acquired by our system is implicit in the learned feature weights. These are not by themselves particularly interpretable, and not directly comparable to the grammars produced by other systems, except through their functional behavior. Any grammar which parses a corpus will have a distribution over which sequences tend to be analyzed as constituents. These distributions can give a good sense of what structures are and are not being learned. Therefore, to supplement the parsing scores above, we examine these distributions. Figure 5 shows the top scoring constituents by several orderings. These lists do not say very much about how long, complex, recursive constructions are being analyzed by a given system, but grammar induction systems are still at the level where major mistakes manifest themselves in short, frequent sequences. CORRECT ranks sequences by how often they occur as constituents in the treebank parses. DEP - PCFG and CCM are the same, but use counts from the DEP - PCFG and CCM parses. As a baseline, FREQUENCY lists sequences by how often they occur anywhere in the sentence yields. Note that the sequence IN DT (e.g., “of the”) is high on this list, and is a typical error of many early systems. Finally, ENTROPY is the heuristic proposed in [11] which ranks by context entropy. It is better in practice than FREQUENCY , but that isn’t self-evident from this list. Clearly, the lists produced by the CCM system are closer to correct than the others. They look much like a censored version of the FREQUENCY list, where sequences which do not co-exist with higher-ranked ones have been removed (e.g., IN DT often crosses DT NN). This observation may explain a good part of the success of this method. Another explanation for the surprising success of the system is that it exploits a deep fact about language. Most long constituents have some short, frequent equivalent, or proform, which occurs in similar contexts [14]. In the very common case where the proform is a single word, it is guaranteed constituency, which will be transmitted to longer sequences 8 For example, transitive sentences are bracketed [subject [verb object]] (The president [executed the law]) while nominalizations are bracketed [[possessive noun] complement] ([The president’s execution] of the law), an arbitrary inconsistency which is unlikely to be learned automatically. via shared contexts (categories like PP which have infrequent proforms are not learned well unless the empty sequence is in the model – interestingly, the empty sequence appears to act as the proform for PPs, possibly due to the highly optional nature of many PPs). 5 Conclusions We have presented an alternate probability model over trees which is based on simple assumptions about the nature of natural language structure. It is driven by the explicit transfer between sequences and their contexts, and exploits both the proform phenomenon and the fact that good constituents must tile in ways that systematically cover the corpus sentences without crossing. The model clearly has limits. Lacking recursive features, it essentially must analyze long, rare constructions using only contexts. However, despite, or perhaps due to its simplicity, our model predicts bracketings very well, producing higher quality structural analyses than previous methods which employ the PCFG model family.

Paskin</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms have been derived for several statistical models of English grammar, but their computational complexity makes applying them to large data sets intractable. This paper presents a probabilistic model of English grammar that is much simpler than conventional models, but which admits an efficient EM training algorithm. The model is based upon grammatical bigrams, i.e. , syntactic relationships between pairs of words. We present the results of experiments that quantify the representational adequacy of the grammatical bigram model, its ability to generalize from labelled data, and its ability to induce syntactic structure from large amounts of raw text. 1</p><p>4 0.27228242 <a title="130-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Grammar_Transfer_in_a_Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network.html">85 nips-2001-Grammar Transfer in a Second Order Recurrent Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiro Negishi, Stephen J. Hanson</p><p>Abstract: It has been known that people, after being exposed to sentences generated by an artificial grammar, acquire implicit grammatical knowledge and are able to transfer the knowledge to inputs that are generated by a modified grammar. We show that a second order recurrent neural network is able to transfer grammatical knowledge from one language (generated by a Finite State Machine) to another language which differ both in vocabularies and syntax. Representation of the grammatical knowledge in the network is analyzed using linear discriminant analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.21375401 <a title="130-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Bayesian_Model_Predicts_Human_Parse_Preference_and_Reading_Times_in_Sentence_Processing.html">5 nips-2001-A Bayesian Model Predicts Human Parse Preference and Reading Times in Sentence Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Klein, Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syntactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In contrast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher quality analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset. 1 Overview To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given tree-structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words called constituents, as in ﬁgure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to ﬁgure out, given just the sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts. It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difﬁculty of this task, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences [7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic expertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicit within a supervised parser’s supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised systems often have difﬁculty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the data is deﬁcient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4].

Several different distributional clustering approaches have resulted in relatively high-quality clusterings, though the clusters’ resemblance to classical parts-of-speech varies substantially [9, 15]. For the present work, we take the part-ofspeech induction problem as solved and work with sequences of parts-of-speech rather than words. In some ways this makes the problem easier, such as by reducing sparsity, but in other ways it complicates the task (even supervised parsers perform relatively poorly with the actual words replaced by parts-of-speech). Work attempting to induce tree structures has met with much less success. Most grammar induction work assumes that trees are generated by a symbolic or probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG or PCFG). These systems generally boil down to one of two types. Some ﬁx the structure of the grammar in advance [12], often with an aim to incorporate linguistic constraints [2] or prior knowledge [13]. These systems typically then attempt to ﬁnd the grammar production parameters which maximize the likelihood P(S| ) using the inside-outside algorithm [1], which is an efﬁcient (dynamic programming) instance of the EM algorithm [8] for PCFG s. Other systems (which have generally been more successful) incorporate a structural search as well, typically using a heuristic to propose candidate grammar modiﬁcations which minimize the joint encoding of data and grammar using an MDL criterion, which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding of the grammar and the data is compact [6, 16, 18, 17]. These approaches can also be seen as likelihood maximization where the objective function is the a posteriori likelihood of the grammar given the data, and the description length provides a structural prior. The “compact grammar” aspect of MDL is close to some traditional linguistic argumentation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical [10] or cognitive [5] economy. However, the primary weakness of MDL-based systems does not have to do with the objective function, but the search procedures they employ. Such systems end up growing structures greedily, in a bottom-up fashion. Therefore, their induction quality is determined by how well they are able to heuristically predict what local intermediate structures will ﬁt into good ﬁnal global solutions. A potential advantage of systems which ﬁx the grammar and only perform parameter search is that they do compare complete grammars against each other, and are therefore able to detect which give rise to systematically compatible parses. However, although early work showed that small, artiﬁcial CFGs could be induced with the EM algorithm [12], studies with large natural language grammars have generally suggested that completely unsupervised EM over PCFG s is ineffective for grammar acquisition. For instance, Carroll and Charniak [2] describe experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which produced widely varying learned grammars, almost all of extremely poor quality. 1 1 We duplicated one of their experiments, which used grammars restricted to rules of the form x → x y | y x, where there is one category x for each part-of-speech (such a restricted CFG is isomorphic to a dependency grammar). We began reestimation from a grammar with uniform rewrite It is well-known that EM is only locally optimal, and one might think that the locality of the search procedure, not the objective function, is to blame. The truth is somewhere in between. There are linguistic reasons to distrust an ML objective function. It encourages the symbols and rules to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional independence assumptions embodied by the PCFG. The symbols and rules of a natural language grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units, for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made [14]. None of these have anything to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reﬂects only grammatical regularities and possibilities for expansion. There are expected to be strong connections across phrases (such as dependencies between verbs and their selected arguments). It could be that ML over PCFGs and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do not always seem to. Experiments with both artiﬁcial [12] and real [13] data have shown that starting from ﬁxed, correct (or at least linguistically reasonable) structure, EM produces a grammar which has higher log-likelihood than the linguistically determined grammar, but lower parsing accuracy. However, we additionally conjecture that EM over PCFGs fails to propagate contextual cues efﬁciently. The reason we expect an algorithm to converge on a good PCFG is that there seem to be coherent categories, like noun phrases, which occur in distinctive environments, like between the beginning of the sentence and the verb phrase. In the inside-outside algorithm, the product of inside and outside probabilities α j ( p, q)β j ( p, q) is the probability of generating the sentence with a j constituent spanning words p through q: the outside probability captures the environment, and the inside probability the coherent category. If we had a good idea of what VPs and NPs looked like, then if a novel NP appeared in an NP context, the outside probabilities should pressure the sequence to be parsed as an NP . However, what happens early in the EM procedure, when we have no real idea about the grammar parameters? With randomly-weighted, complete grammars over a symbol set X, we have observed that a frequent, short, noun phrase sequence often does get assigned to some category x early on. However, since there is not a clear overall structure learned, there is only very weak pressure for other NPs, even if they occur in the same positions, to also be assigned to x, and the reestimation process goes astray. To enable this kind of constituent-context pressure to be effective, we propose the model in the following section. 3 The Constituent-Context Model We propose an alternate parametric family of models over trees which is better suited for grammar induction. Broadly speaking, inducing trees like the one shown in ﬁgure 1(a) can be broken into two tasks. One is deciding constituent identity: where the brackets should be placed. The second is deciding what to label the constituents. These tasks are certainly correlated and are usually solved jointly. However, the task of labeling chosen brackets is essentially the same as the part-of-speech induction problem, and the solutions cited above can be adapted to cluster constituents [6]. The task of deciding brackets, is the harder task. For example, the sequence DT NN IN DT NN ([the man in the moon]) is virtually always a noun phrase when it is a constituent, but it is only a constituent 66% of the time, because the IN DT NN is often attached elsewhere ([we [sent a man] [to the moon]]). Figure 2(a) probabilities. Figure 4 shows that the resulting grammar (DEP - PCFG) is not as bad as conventional wisdom suggests. Carroll and Charniak are right to observe that the search spaces is riddled with pronounced local maxima, and EM does not do nearly so well when randomly initialized. The need for random seeding in using EM over PCFGs is two-fold. For some grammars, such as one over a set X of non-terminals in which any x 1 → x2 x3 , xi ∈ X is possible, it is needed to break symmetry. This is not the case for dependency grammars, where symmetry is broken by the yields (e.g., a sentence noun verb can only be covered by a noun or verb projection). The second reason is to start the search from a random region of the space. But unless one does many random restarts, the uniform starting condition is better than most extreme points in the space, and produces superior results. 1.5 2 Usually a Constituent Rarely a Constituent 1 1 0.5 0 0 −1 −2 −3 −1.5 −1 −0.5 NP VP PP −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 (a) (b) Figure 2: The most frequent examples of (a) different constituent labels and (b) constituents and non-constituents, in the vector space of linear contexts, projected onto the ﬁrst two principal components. Clustering is effective for labeling, but not detecting constituents. shows the 50 most frequent constituent sequences of three types, represented as points in the vector space of their contexts (see below), projected onto their ﬁrst two principal components. The three clusters are relatively coherent, and it is not difﬁcult to believe that a clustering algorithm could detect them in the unprojected space. Figure 2(a), however, shows 150 sequences which are parsed as constituents at least 50% of the time along with 150 which are not, again projected onto the ﬁrst two components. This plot at least suggests that the constituent/non-constituent classiﬁcation is less amenable to direct clustering. Thus, it is important that an induction system be able to detect constituents, either implicitly or explicitly. A variety of methods of constituent detection have been proposed [11, 6], usually based on information-theoretic properties of a sequence’s distributional context. However, here we rely entirely on the following two simple assumptions: (i) constituents of a parse do not cross each other, and (ii) constituents occur in constituent contexts. The ﬁrst property is self-evident from the nature of the parse trees. The second is an extremely weakened version of classic linguistic constituency tests [14]. Let σ be a terminal sequence. Every occurrence of σ will be in some linear context c(σ ) = x σ y, where x and y are the adjacent terminals or sentence boundaries. Then we can view any tree t over a sentence s as a collection of sequences and contexts, one of each for every node in the tree, plus one for each inter-terminal empty span, as in ﬁgure 1(b). Good trees will include nodes whose yields frequently occur as constituents and whose contexts frequently surround constituents. Formally, we use a conditional exponential model of the form: exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) P(t|s, ) = t:yield(t)=s exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) We have one feature f σ (t) for each sequence σ whose value on a tree t is the number of nodes in t with yield σ , and one feature f c (t) for each context c representing the number of times c is the context of the yield of some node in the tree.2 No joint features over c and σ are used, and, unlike many other systems, there is no distinction between constituent types. We model only the conditional likelihood of the trees, P(T |S, ), where = {λ σ , λc }. We then use an iterative EM-style procedure to ﬁnd a local maximum P(T |S, ) of the completed data (trees) T (P(T |S, ) = t∈T ,s=yield(t) P(t|s, )). We initialize such that each λ is zero and initialize T to any arbitrary set of trees. In alternating steps, we ﬁrst ﬁx the parameters and ﬁnd the most probable single tree structure t ∗ for each sentence s according to P(t|s, ), using a simple dynamic program. For any this produces the 2 So, for the tree in ﬁgure 1(a), P(t|s) ∝ exp(λ NN NNS + λVBD IN NN + λIN NN + λ −VBD + λNNS− + λVBD− + λ −NNS + λNN−VBD + λNNS−IN + λVBD−NN + λIN− ). set of parses T ∗ which maximizes P(T |S, ). Since T ∗ maximizes this quantity, if T is the former set of trees, P(T ∗ |S, ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Second, we ﬁx the trees and estimate new parameters . The task of ﬁnding the parameters ∗ which maximize P(T |S, ) is simply the well-studied task of ﬁtting our exponential model to maximize the conditional likelihood of the ﬁxed parses. Running, for example, a conjugate gradient (CG) ascent on will produce the desired ∗ . If is the former parameters, then we will have P(T |S, ∗ ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Therefore, each iteration will increase P(T |S, ) until convergence.3 Note that our parsing model is not a generative model, and this procedure, though clearly related, is not exactly an instance of the EM algorithm. We merely guarantee that the conditional likelihood of the data completions is increasing. Furthermore, unlike in EM where each iteration increases the marginal likelihood of the ﬁxed observed data, our procedure increases the conditional likelihood of a changing complete data set, with the completions changing at every iteration as we reparse. Several implementation details were important in making the system work well. First, tiebreaking was needed, most of all for the ﬁrst round. Initially, the parameters are zero, and all parses are therefore equally likely. To prevent bias, all ties were broken randomly. Second, like so many statistical NLP tasks, smoothing was vital. There are features in our model for arbitrarily long yields and most yield types occurred only a few times. The most severe consequence of this sparsity was that initial parsing choices could easily become frozen. If a λσ for some yield σ was either 0 or 0, which was usually the case for rare yields, σ would either be locked into always occurring or never occurring, respectively. Not only did we want to push the λσ values close to zero, we also wanted to account for the fact that most spans are not constituents.4 Therefore, we expect the distribution of the λσ to be skewed towards low values.5 A greater amount of smoothing was needed for the ﬁrst few iterations, while much less was required in later iterations. Finally, parameter estimation using a CG method was slow and difﬁcult to smooth in the desired manner, and so we used the smoothed relative frequency estimates λ σ = count( fσ )/(count(σ ) + M) and λc = count( f c )/(count(c) + N). These estimates ensured that the λ values were between 0 and 1, and gave the desired bias towards non-constituency. These estimates were fast and surprisingly effective, but do not guarantee non-decreasing conditional likelihood (though the conditional likelihood was increasing in practice). 6 4 Results In all experiments, we used hand-parsed sentences from the Penn Treebank. For training, we took the approximately 7500 sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section which contained 10 words or fewer after the removal of punctuation. For testing, we evaluated the system by comparing the system’s parses for those same sentences against the supervised parses in the treebank. We consider each parse as a set of constituent brackets, discarding all trivial brackets.7 We calculated the precision and recall of these brackets against the treebank parses in the obvious way. 3 In practice, we stopped the system after 10 iterations, but ﬁnal behavior was apparent after 4–8. 4 In a sentence of length n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 total (possibly size zero) spans, but only 3n constituent spans: n − 1 of size ≥ 2, n of size 1, and n + 1 empty spans. 5 Gaussian priors for the exponential model accomplish the former goal, but not the latter. 6 The relative frequency estimators had a somewhat subtle positive effect. Empty spans have no effect on the model when using CG ﬁtting, as all trees include the same empty spans. However, including their counts improved performance substantially when using relative frequency estimators. This is perhaps an indication that a generative version of this model would be advantageous. 7 We discarded both brackets of length one and brackets spanning the entire sentence, since all of these are impossible to get incorrect, and hence ignored sentences of length ≤ 2 during testing.

UR = unlabeled recall; UP = unlabeled precision; F1 = the harmonic mean of UR and UP; CB = crossing brackets. Separate recall values are shown for three major categories. To situate the results of our system, ﬁgure 4(a) gives the values of several parsing strategies. CCM is our constituent-context model. DEP - PCFG is a dependency PCFG model [2] trained using the inside-outside algorithm. Figure 3 shows sample parses to give a feel for the parses the systems produce. We also tested several baselines. RANDOM parses randomly. This is an appropriate baseline for an unsupervised system. RBRANCH always chooses the right-branching chain, while LBRANCH always chooses the left-branching chain. RBRANCH is often used as a baseline for supervised systems, but exploits a systematic right-branching tendency of English. An unsupervised system has no a priori reason to prefer right chains to left chains, and LBRANCH is well worse than RANDOM. A system need not beat RBRANCH to claim partial success at grammar induction. Finally, we include an upper bound. All of the parsing strategies and systems mentioned here give fully binary-branching structures. Treebank trees, however, need not be fully binary-branching, and generally are not. As a result, there is an upper bound UBOUND on the precision and F1 scores achievable when structurally conﬁned to binary trees. Clearly, CCM is parsing much better than the RANDOM baseline and the DEP - PCFG induced grammar. Signiﬁcantly, it also out-performs RBRANCH in both precision and recall, and, to our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst unsupervised system to do so. To facilitate comparison with other recent systems, ﬁgure 4(b) gives results where we trained as before but used (all) the sentences from the distributionally different ATIS section of the treebank as a test set. For this experiment, precision and recall were calculated using the EVALB system of measuring precision and recall (as in [6, 17]) – EVALB is a standard for parser evaluation, but complex, and unsuited to evaluating unlabeled constituency. EMILE and ABL are lexical systems described in [17]. The results for CDC-40, from [6], reﬂect training on much more data (12M words). Our system is superior in terms of both precision and recall (and so F 1 ). These ﬁgures are certainly not all that there is to say about an induced grammar; there are a number of issues in how to interpret the results of an unsupervised system when comparing with treebank parses. Errors come in several kinds. First are innocent sins of commission. Treebank trees are very ﬂat; for example, there is no analysis of the inside of many short noun phrases ([two hard drives] rather than [two [hard drives]]). Our system gives a Sequence DT NN NNP NNP CD CD JJ NNS DT JJ NN DT NNS JJ NN CD NN IN NN IN DT NN NN NNS NN NN TO VB DT JJ IN DT PRP VBZ PRP VBP NNS VBP NN VBZ NN IN NNS VBD Example the man United States 4 1/2 daily yields the top rank the people plastic furniture 12 percent on Monday for the moment ﬁre trucks ﬁre truck to go ?the big *of the ?he says ?they say ?people are ?value is *man from ?people were CORRECT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 22 26 78 90 95 180 =350 =532 =648 =648 FREQUENCY 2 1 9 7 – – 3 – – – – 8 – 6 4 – – – 10 5 – ENTROPY 2 – – 3 – – 7 – 9 – 6 10 1 – – – – 4 5 – 8 DEP - PCFG 1 2 5 4 7 – 3 – – – – – 6 – 10 8 9 – – – – CCM 1 2 5 4 6 10 3 9 – – 8 7 – – – – – – – – – Figure 5: Top non-trivial sequences by actual treebank constituent counts, linear frequency, scaled context entropy, and in DEP - PCFG and CCM learned models’ parses. (usually correct) analysis of the insides of such NPs, for which it is penalized on precision (though not recall or crossing brackets). Second are systematic alternate analyses. Our system tends to form modal verb groups and often attaches verbs ﬁrst to pronoun subjects rather than to objects. As a result, many VPs are systematically incorrect, boosting crossing bracket scores and impacting VP recall. Finally, the treebank’s grammar is sometimes an arbitrary, and even inconsistent standard for an unsupervised learner: alternate analyses may be just as good.8 Notwithstanding this, we believe that the treebank parses have enough truth in them that parsing scores are a useful component of evaluation. Ideally, we would like to inspect the quality of the grammar directly. Unfortunately, the grammar acquired by our system is implicit in the learned feature weights. These are not by themselves particularly interpretable, and not directly comparable to the grammars produced by other systems, except through their functional behavior. Any grammar which parses a corpus will have a distribution over which sequences tend to be analyzed as constituents. These distributions can give a good sense of what structures are and are not being learned. Therefore, to supplement the parsing scores above, we examine these distributions. Figure 5 shows the top scoring constituents by several orderings. These lists do not say very much about how long, complex, recursive constructions are being analyzed by a given system, but grammar induction systems are still at the level where major mistakes manifest themselves in short, frequent sequences. CORRECT ranks sequences by how often they occur as constituents in the treebank parses. DEP - PCFG and CCM are the same, but use counts from the DEP - PCFG and CCM parses. As a baseline, FREQUENCY lists sequences by how often they occur anywhere in the sentence yields. Note that the sequence IN DT (e.g., “of the”) is high on this list, and is a typical error of many early systems. Finally, ENTROPY is the heuristic proposed in [11] which ranks by context entropy. It is better in practice than FREQUENCY , but that isn’t self-evident from this list. Clearly, the lists produced by the CCM system are closer to correct than the others. They look much like a censored version of the FREQUENCY list, where sequences which do not co-exist with higher-ranked ones have been removed (e.g., IN DT often crosses DT NN). This observation may explain a good part of the success of this method. Another explanation for the surprising success of the system is that it exploits a deep fact about language. Most long constituents have some short, frequent equivalent, or proform, which occurs in similar contexts [14]. In the very common case where the proform is a single word, it is guaranteed constituency, which will be transmitted to longer sequences 8 For example, transitive sentences are bracketed [subject [verb object]] (The president [executed the law]) while nominalizations are bracketed [[possessive noun] complement] ([The president’s execution] of the law), an arbitrary inconsistency which is unlikely to be learned automatically. via shared contexts (categories like PP which have infrequent proforms are not learned well unless the empty sequence is in the model – interestingly, the empty sequence appears to act as the proform for PPs, possibly due to the highly optional nature of many PPs). 5 Conclusions We have presented an alternate probability model over trees which is based on simple assumptions about the nature of natural language structure. It is driven by the explicit transfer between sequences and their contexts, and exploits both the proform phenomenon and the fact that good constituents must tile in ways that systematically cover the corpus sentences without crossing. The model clearly has limits. Lacking recursive features, it essentially must analyze long, rare constructions using only contexts. However, despite, or perhaps due to its simplicity, our model predicts bracketings very well, producing higher quality structural analyses than previous methods which employ the PCFG model family.

<p>Author: Dan Klein, Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syntactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In contrast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher quality analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset. 1 Overview To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given tree-structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words called constituents, as in ﬁgure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to ﬁgure out, given just the sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts. It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difﬁculty of this task, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences [7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic expertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicit within a supervised parser’s supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised systems often have difﬁculty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the data is deﬁcient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4].

Several different distributional clustering approaches have resulted in relatively high-quality clusterings, though the clusters’ resemblance to classical parts-of-speech varies substantially [9, 15]. For the present work, we take the part-ofspeech induction problem as solved and work with sequences of parts-of-speech rather than words. In some ways this makes the problem easier, such as by reducing sparsity, but in other ways it complicates the task (even supervised parsers perform relatively poorly with the actual words replaced by parts-of-speech). Work attempting to induce tree structures has met with much less success. Most grammar induction work assumes that trees are generated by a symbolic or probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG or PCFG). These systems generally boil down to one of two types. Some ﬁx the structure of the grammar in advance [12], often with an aim to incorporate linguistic constraints [2] or prior knowledge [13]. These systems typically then attempt to ﬁnd the grammar production parameters which maximize the likelihood P(S| ) using the inside-outside algorithm [1], which is an efﬁcient (dynamic programming) instance of the EM algorithm [8] for PCFG s. Other systems (which have generally been more successful) incorporate a structural search as well, typically using a heuristic to propose candidate grammar modiﬁcations which minimize the joint encoding of data and grammar using an MDL criterion, which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding of the grammar and the data is compact [6, 16, 18, 17]. These approaches can also be seen as likelihood maximization where the objective function is the a posteriori likelihood of the grammar given the data, and the description length provides a structural prior. The “compact grammar” aspect of MDL is close to some traditional linguistic argumentation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical [10] or cognitive [5] economy. However, the primary weakness of MDL-based systems does not have to do with the objective function, but the search procedures they employ. Such systems end up growing structures greedily, in a bottom-up fashion. Therefore, their induction quality is determined by how well they are able to heuristically predict what local intermediate structures will ﬁt into good ﬁnal global solutions. A potential advantage of systems which ﬁx the grammar and only perform parameter search is that they do compare complete grammars against each other, and are therefore able to detect which give rise to systematically compatible parses. However, although early work showed that small, artiﬁcial CFGs could be induced with the EM algorithm [12], studies with large natural language grammars have generally suggested that completely unsupervised EM over PCFG s is ineffective for grammar acquisition. For instance, Carroll and Charniak [2] describe experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which produced widely varying learned grammars, almost all of extremely poor quality. 1 1 We duplicated one of their experiments, which used grammars restricted to rules of the form x → x y | y x, where there is one category x for each part-of-speech (such a restricted CFG is isomorphic to a dependency grammar). We began reestimation from a grammar with uniform rewrite It is well-known that EM is only locally optimal, and one might think that the locality of the search procedure, not the objective function, is to blame. The truth is somewhere in between. There are linguistic reasons to distrust an ML objective function. It encourages the symbols and rules to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional independence assumptions embodied by the PCFG. The symbols and rules of a natural language grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units, for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made [14]. None of these have anything to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reﬂects only grammatical regularities and possibilities for expansion. There are expected to be strong connections across phrases (such as dependencies between verbs and their selected arguments). It could be that ML over PCFGs and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do not always seem to. Experiments with both artiﬁcial [12] and real [13] data have shown that starting from ﬁxed, correct (or at least linguistically reasonable) structure, EM produces a grammar which has higher log-likelihood than the linguistically determined grammar, but lower parsing accuracy. However, we additionally conjecture that EM over PCFGs fails to propagate contextual cues efﬁciently. The reason we expect an algorithm to converge on a good PCFG is that there seem to be coherent categories, like noun phrases, which occur in distinctive environments, like between the beginning of the sentence and the verb phrase. In the inside-outside algorithm, the product of inside and outside probabilities α j ( p, q)β j ( p, q) is the probability of generating the sentence with a j constituent spanning words p through q: the outside probability captures the environment, and the inside probability the coherent category. If we had a good idea of what VPs and NPs looked like, then if a novel NP appeared in an NP context, the outside probabilities should pressure the sequence to be parsed as an NP . However, what happens early in the EM procedure, when we have no real idea about the grammar parameters? With randomly-weighted, complete grammars over a symbol set X, we have observed that a frequent, short, noun phrase sequence often does get assigned to some category x early on. However, since there is not a clear overall structure learned, there is only very weak pressure for other NPs, even if they occur in the same positions, to also be assigned to x, and the reestimation process goes astray. To enable this kind of constituent-context pressure to be effective, we propose the model in the following section. 3 The Constituent-Context Model We propose an alternate parametric family of models over trees which is better suited for grammar induction. Broadly speaking, inducing trees like the one shown in ﬁgure 1(a) can be broken into two tasks. One is deciding constituent identity: where the brackets should be placed. The second is deciding what to label the constituents. These tasks are certainly correlated and are usually solved jointly. However, the task of labeling chosen brackets is essentially the same as the part-of-speech induction problem, and the solutions cited above can be adapted to cluster constituents [6]. The task of deciding brackets, is the harder task. For example, the sequence DT NN IN DT NN ([the man in the moon]) is virtually always a noun phrase when it is a constituent, but it is only a constituent 66% of the time, because the IN DT NN is often attached elsewhere ([we [sent a man] [to the moon]]). Figure 2(a) probabilities. Figure 4 shows that the resulting grammar (DEP - PCFG) is not as bad as conventional wisdom suggests. Carroll and Charniak are right to observe that the search spaces is riddled with pronounced local maxima, and EM does not do nearly so well when randomly initialized. The need for random seeding in using EM over PCFGs is two-fold. For some grammars, such as one over a set X of non-terminals in which any x 1 → x2 x3 , xi ∈ X is possible, it is needed to break symmetry. This is not the case for dependency grammars, where symmetry is broken by the yields (e.g., a sentence noun verb can only be covered by a noun or verb projection). The second reason is to start the search from a random region of the space. But unless one does many random restarts, the uniform starting condition is better than most extreme points in the space, and produces superior results. 1.5 2 Usually a Constituent Rarely a Constituent 1 1 0.5 0 0 −1 −2 −3 −1.5 −1 −0.5 NP VP PP −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 (a) (b) Figure 2: The most frequent examples of (a) different constituent labels and (b) constituents and non-constituents, in the vector space of linear contexts, projected onto the ﬁrst two principal components. Clustering is effective for labeling, but not detecting constituents. shows the 50 most frequent constituent sequences of three types, represented as points in the vector space of their contexts (see below), projected onto their ﬁrst two principal components. The three clusters are relatively coherent, and it is not difﬁcult to believe that a clustering algorithm could detect them in the unprojected space. Figure 2(a), however, shows 150 sequences which are parsed as constituents at least 50% of the time along with 150 which are not, again projected onto the ﬁrst two components. This plot at least suggests that the constituent/non-constituent classiﬁcation is less amenable to direct clustering. Thus, it is important that an induction system be able to detect constituents, either implicitly or explicitly. A variety of methods of constituent detection have been proposed [11, 6], usually based on information-theoretic properties of a sequence’s distributional context. However, here we rely entirely on the following two simple assumptions: (i) constituents of a parse do not cross each other, and (ii) constituents occur in constituent contexts. The ﬁrst property is self-evident from the nature of the parse trees. The second is an extremely weakened version of classic linguistic constituency tests [14]. Let σ be a terminal sequence. Every occurrence of σ will be in some linear context c(σ ) = x σ y, where x and y are the adjacent terminals or sentence boundaries. Then we can view any tree t over a sentence s as a collection of sequences and contexts, one of each for every node in the tree, plus one for each inter-terminal empty span, as in ﬁgure 1(b). Good trees will include nodes whose yields frequently occur as constituents and whose contexts frequently surround constituents. Formally, we use a conditional exponential model of the form: exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) P(t|s, ) = t:yield(t)=s exp( (σ,c)∈t λσ f σ + λc f c ) We have one feature f σ (t) for each sequence σ whose value on a tree t is the number of nodes in t with yield σ , and one feature f c (t) for each context c representing the number of times c is the context of the yield of some node in the tree.2 No joint features over c and σ are used, and, unlike many other systems, there is no distinction between constituent types. We model only the conditional likelihood of the trees, P(T |S, ), where = {λ σ , λc }. We then use an iterative EM-style procedure to ﬁnd a local maximum P(T |S, ) of the completed data (trees) T (P(T |S, ) = t∈T ,s=yield(t) P(t|s, )). We initialize such that each λ is zero and initialize T to any arbitrary set of trees. In alternating steps, we ﬁrst ﬁx the parameters and ﬁnd the most probable single tree structure t ∗ for each sentence s according to P(t|s, ), using a simple dynamic program. For any this produces the 2 So, for the tree in ﬁgure 1(a), P(t|s) ∝ exp(λ NN NNS + λVBD IN NN + λIN NN + λ −VBD + λNNS− + λVBD− + λ −NNS + λNN−VBD + λNNS−IN + λVBD−NN + λIN− ). set of parses T ∗ which maximizes P(T |S, ). Since T ∗ maximizes this quantity, if T is the former set of trees, P(T ∗ |S, ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Second, we ﬁx the trees and estimate new parameters . The task of ﬁnding the parameters ∗ which maximize P(T |S, ) is simply the well-studied task of ﬁtting our exponential model to maximize the conditional likelihood of the ﬁxed parses. Running, for example, a conjugate gradient (CG) ascent on will produce the desired ∗ . If is the former parameters, then we will have P(T |S, ∗ ) ≥ P(T |S, ). Therefore, each iteration will increase P(T |S, ) until convergence.3 Note that our parsing model is not a generative model, and this procedure, though clearly related, is not exactly an instance of the EM algorithm. We merely guarantee that the conditional likelihood of the data completions is increasing. Furthermore, unlike in EM where each iteration increases the marginal likelihood of the ﬁxed observed data, our procedure increases the conditional likelihood of a changing complete data set, with the completions changing at every iteration as we reparse. Several implementation details were important in making the system work well. First, tiebreaking was needed, most of all for the ﬁrst round. Initially, the parameters are zero, and all parses are therefore equally likely. To prevent bias, all ties were broken randomly. Second, like so many statistical NLP tasks, smoothing was vital. There are features in our model for arbitrarily long yields and most yield types occurred only a few times. The most severe consequence of this sparsity was that initial parsing choices could easily become frozen. If a λσ for some yield σ was either 0 or 0, which was usually the case for rare yields, σ would either be locked into always occurring or never occurring, respectively. Not only did we want to push the λσ values close to zero, we also wanted to account for the fact that most spans are not constituents.4 Therefore, we expect the distribution of the λσ to be skewed towards low values.5 A greater amount of smoothing was needed for the ﬁrst few iterations, while much less was required in later iterations. Finally, parameter estimation using a CG method was slow and difﬁcult to smooth in the desired manner, and so we used the smoothed relative frequency estimates λ σ = count( fσ )/(count(σ ) + M) and λc = count( f c )/(count(c) + N). These estimates ensured that the λ values were between 0 and 1, and gave the desired bias towards non-constituency. These estimates were fast and surprisingly effective, but do not guarantee non-decreasing conditional likelihood (though the conditional likelihood was increasing in practice). 6 4 Results In all experiments, we used hand-parsed sentences from the Penn Treebank. For training, we took the approximately 7500 sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section which contained 10 words or fewer after the removal of punctuation. For testing, we evaluated the system by comparing the system’s parses for those same sentences against the supervised parses in the treebank. We consider each parse as a set of constituent brackets, discarding all trivial brackets.7 We calculated the precision and recall of these brackets against the treebank parses in the obvious way. 3 In practice, we stopped the system after 10 iterations, but ﬁnal behavior was apparent after 4–8. 4 In a sentence of length n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 total (possibly size zero) spans, but only 3n constituent spans: n − 1 of size ≥ 2, n of size 1, and n + 1 empty spans. 5 Gaussian priors for the exponential model accomplish the former goal, but not the latter. 6 The relative frequency estimators had a somewhat subtle positive effect. Empty spans have no effect on the model when using CG ﬁtting, as all trees include the same empty spans. However, including their counts improved performance substantially when using relative frequency estimators. This is perhaps an indication that a generative version of this model would be advantageous. 7 We discarded both brackets of length one and brackets spanning the entire sentence, since all of these are impossible to get incorrect, and hence ignored sentences of length ≤ 2 during testing.

To situate the results of our system, ﬁgure 4(a) gives the values of several parsing strategies. CCM is our constituent-context model. DEP - PCFG is a dependency PCFG model [2] trained using the inside-outside algorithm. Figure 3 shows sample parses to give a feel for the parses the systems produce. We also tested several baselines. RANDOM parses randomly. This is an appropriate baseline for an unsupervised system. RBRANCH always chooses the right-branching chain, while LBRANCH always chooses the left-branching chain. RBRANCH is often used as a baseline for supervised systems, but exploits a systematic right-branching tendency of English. An unsupervised system has no a priori reason to prefer right chains to left chains, and LBRANCH is well worse than RANDOM. A system need not beat RBRANCH to claim partial success at grammar induction. Finally, we include an upper bound. All of the parsing strategies and systems mentioned here give fully binary-branching structures. Treebank trees, however, need not be fully binary-branching, and generally are not. As a result, there is an upper bound UBOUND on the precision and F1 scores achievable when structurally conﬁned to binary trees. Clearly, CCM is parsing much better than the RANDOM baseline and the DEP - PCFG induced grammar. Signiﬁcantly, it also out-performs RBRANCH in both precision and recall, and, to our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst unsupervised system to do so. To facilitate comparison with other recent systems, ﬁgure 4(b) gives results where we trained as before but used (all) the sentences from the distributionally different ATIS section of the treebank as a test set. For this experiment, precision and recall were calculated using the EVALB system of measuring precision and recall (as in [6, 17]) – EVALB is a standard for parser evaluation, but complex, and unsuited to evaluating unlabeled constituency. EMILE and ABL are lexical systems described in [17]. The results for CDC-40, from [6], reﬂect training on much more data (12M words). Our system is superior in terms of both precision and recall (and so F 1 ). These ﬁgures are certainly not all that there is to say about an induced grammar; there are a number of issues in how to interpret the results of an unsupervised system when comparing with treebank parses. Errors come in several kinds. First are innocent sins of commission. Treebank trees are very ﬂat; for example, there is no analysis of the inside of many short noun phrases ([two hard drives] rather than [two [hard drives]]). Our system gives a Sequence DT NN NNP NNP CD CD JJ NNS DT JJ NN DT NNS JJ NN CD NN IN NN IN DT NN NN NNS NN NN TO VB DT JJ IN DT PRP VBZ PRP VBP NNS VBP NN VBZ NN IN NNS VBD Example the man United States 4 1/2 daily yields the top rank the people plastic furniture 12 percent on Monday for the moment ﬁre trucks ﬁre truck to go ?the big *of the ?he says ?they say ?people are ?value is *man from ?people were CORRECT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 22 26 78 90 95 180 =350 =532 =648 =648 FREQUENCY 2 1 9 7 – – 3 – – – – 8 – 6 4 – – – 10 5 – ENTROPY 2 – – 3 – – 7 – 9 – 6 10 1 – – – – 4 5 – 8 DEP - PCFG 1 2 5 4 7 – 3 – – – – – 6 – 10 8 9 – – – – CCM 1 2 5 4 6 10 3 9 – – 8 7 – – – – – – – – – Figure 5: Top non-trivial sequences by actual treebank constituent counts, linear frequency, scaled context entropy, and in DEP - PCFG and CCM learned models’ parses. (usually correct) analysis of the insides of such NPs, for which it is penalized on precision (though not recall or crossing brackets). Second are systematic alternate analyses. Our system tends to form modal verb groups and often attaches verbs ﬁrst to pronoun subjects rather than to objects. As a result, many VPs are systematically incorrect, boosting crossing bracket scores and impacting VP recall. Finally, the treebank’s grammar is sometimes an arbitrary, and even inconsistent standard for an unsupervised learner: alternate analyses may be just as good.8 Notwithstanding this, we believe that the treebank parses have enough truth in them that parsing scores are a useful component of evaluation. Ideally, we would like to inspect the quality of the grammar directly. Unfortunately, the grammar acquired by our system is implicit in the learned feature weights. These are not by themselves particularly interpretable, and not directly comparable to the grammars produced by other systems, except through their functional behavior. Any grammar which parses a corpus will have a distribution over which sequences tend to be analyzed as constituents. These distributions can give a good sense of what structures are and are not being learned. Therefore, to supplement the parsing scores above, we examine these distributions. Figure 5 shows the top scoring constituents by several orderings. These lists do not say very much about how long, complex, recursive constructions are being analyzed by a given system, but grammar induction systems are still at the level where major mistakes manifest themselves in short, frequent sequences. CORRECT ranks sequences by how often they occur as constituents in the treebank parses. DEP - PCFG and CCM are the same, but use counts from the DEP - PCFG and CCM parses. As a baseline, FREQUENCY lists sequences by how often they occur anywhere in the sentence yields. Note that the sequence IN DT (e.g., “of the”) is high on this list, and is a typical error of many early systems. Finally, ENTROPY is the heuristic proposed in [11] which ranks by context entropy. It is better in practice than FREQUENCY , but that isn’t self-evident from this list. Clearly, the lists produced by the CCM system are closer to correct than the others. They look much like a censored version of the FREQUENCY list, where sequences which do not co-exist with higher-ranked ones have been removed (e.g., IN DT often crosses DT NN). This observation may explain a good part of the success of this method. Another explanation for the surprising success of the system is that it exploits a deep fact about language. Most long constituents have some short, frequent equivalent, or proform, which occurs in similar contexts [14]. In the very common case where the proform is a single word, it is guaranteed constituency, which will be transmitted to longer sequences 8 For example, transitive sentences are bracketed [subject [verb object]] (The president [executed the law]) while nominalizations are bracketed [[possessive noun] complement] ([The president’s execution] of the law), an arbitrary inconsistency which is unlikely to be learned automatically. via shared contexts (categories like PP which have infrequent proforms are not learned well unless the empty sequence is in the model – interestingly, the empty sequence appears to act as the proform for PPs, possibly due to the highly optional nature of many PPs). 5 Conclusions We have presented an alternate probability model over trees which is based on simple assumptions about the nature of natural language structure. It is driven by the explicit transfer between sequences and their contexts, and exploits both the proform phenomenon and the fact that good constituents must tile in ways that systematically cover the corpus sentences without crossing. The model clearly has limits. Lacking recursive features, it essentially must analyze long, rare constructions using only contexts. However, despite, or perhaps due to its simplicity, our model predicts bracketings very well, producing higher quality structural analyses than previous methods which employ the PCFG model family.

<p>Author: James M. Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe the g-factor, which relates probability distributions on image features to distributions on the images themselves. The g-factor depends only on our choice of features and lattice quantization and is independent of the training image data. We illustrate the importance of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of Markov Random Field (i.e. Gibbs or log-linear) probability models of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn image distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to feature histogram statistics (d. Minimax Entropy Learning (MEL) by Zhu, Wu and Mumford 1997 [11]) . We first use our analysis of the g-factor to determine when the clique potentials decouple for different features . Second, we show that clique potentials can be computed analytically by approximating the g-factor. Third, we demonstrate a connection between this approximation and the Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm (GIS), due to Darroch and Ratcliff 1972 [2], for calculating potentials. This connection enables us to use GIS to improve our multinomial approximation, using Bethe-Kikuchi[8] approximations to simplify the GIS procedure. We support our analysis by computer simulations. 1</p><p>4 0.73138517 <a title="130-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Sampling_Techniques_for_Kernel_Methods.html">164 nips-2001-Sampling Techniques for Kernel Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Robert Dodier, Michael D. Colagrosso, Cesar Guerra-Salcedo, Richard Wolniewicz</p><p>Abstract: When designing a two-alternative classiﬁer, one ordinarily aims to maximize the classiﬁer’s ability to discriminate between members of the two classes. We describe a situation in a real-world business application of machine-learning prediction in which an additional constraint is placed on the nature of the solution: that the classiﬁer achieve a speciﬁed correct acceptance or correct rejection rate (i.e., that it achieve a ﬁxed accuracy on members of one class or the other). Our domain is predicting churn in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to customers who switch from one service provider to another. We propose four algorithms for training a classiﬁer subject to this domain constraint, and present results showing that each algorithm yields a reliable improvement in performance. Although the improvement is modest in magnitude, it is nonetheless impressive given the difﬁculty of the problem and the ﬁnancial return that it achieves to the service provider. When designing a classiﬁer, one must specify an objective measure by which the classiﬁer’s performance is to be evaluated. One simple objective measure is to minimize the number of misclassiﬁcations. If the cost of a classiﬁcation error depends on the target and/ or response class, one might utilize a risk-minimization framework to reduce the expected loss. A more general approach is to maximize the classiﬁer’s ability to discriminate one class from another class (e.g., Chang & Lippmann, 1994). An ROC curve (Green & Swets, 1966) can be used to visualize the discriminative performance of a two-alternative classiﬁer that outputs class posteriors. To explain the ROC curve, a classiﬁer can be thought of as making a positive/negative judgement as to whether an input is a member of some class. Two different accuracy measures can be obtained from the classiﬁer: the accuracy of correctly identifying an input as a member of the class (a correct acceptance or CA), and the accuracy of correctly identifying an input as a nonmember of the class (a correct rejection or CR). To evaluate the CA and CR rates, it is necessary to pick a threshold above which the classiﬁer’s probability estimate is interpreted as an “accept,” and below which is interpreted as a “reject”—call this the criterion. The ROC curve plots CA against CR rates for various criteria (Figure 1a). Note that as the threshold is lowered, the CA rate increases and the CR rate decreases. For a criterion of 1, the CA rate approaches 0 and the CR rate 1; for a criterion of 0, the CA rate approaches 1 0 0 correct rejection rate 20 40 60 80 100 100 (b) correct rejection rate 20 40 60 80 (a) 0 20 40 60 80 100 correct acceptance rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 correct acceptance rate FIGURE 1. (a) two ROC curves reﬂecting discrimination performance; the dashed curve indicates better performance. (b) two plausible ROC curves, neither of which is clearly superior to the other. and the CR rate 0. Thus, the ROC curve is anchored at (0,1) and (1,0), and is monotonically nonincreasing. The degree to which the curve is bowed reﬂects the discriminative ability of the classiﬁer. The dashed curve in Figure 1a is therefore a better classiﬁer than the solid curve. The degree to which the curve is bowed can be quantiﬁed by various measures such as the area under the ROC curve or d’, the distance between the positive and negative distributions. However, training a classiﬁer to maximize either the ROC area or d’ often yields the same result as training a classiﬁer to estimate posterior class probabilities, or equivalently, to minimize the mean squared error (e.g., Frederick & Floyd, 1998). The ROC area and d’ scores are useful, however, because they reﬂect a classiﬁer’s intrinsic ability to discriminate between two classes, regardless of how the decision criterion is set. That is, each point on an ROC curve indicates one possible CA/CR trade off the classiﬁer can achieve, and that trade off is determined by the criterion. But changing the criterion does not change the classiﬁer’s intrinsic ability to discriminate. Generally, one seeks to optimize the discrimination performance of a classiﬁer. However, we are working in a domain where overall discrimination performance is not as critical as performance at a particular point on the ROC curve, and we are not interested in the remainder of the ROC curve. To gain an intuition as to why this goal should be feasible, consider Figure 1b. Both the solid and dashed curves are valid ROC curves, because they satisfy the monotonicity constraint: as the criterion is lowered, the CA rate does not decrease and the CR rate does not increase. Although the bow shape of the solid curve is typical, it is not mandatory; the precise shape of the curve depends on the nature of the classiﬁer and the nature of the domain. Thus, it is conceivable that a classiﬁer could produce a curve like the dashed one. The dashed curve indicates better performance when the CA rate is around 50%, but worse performance when the CA rate is much lower or higher than 50%. Consequently, if our goal is to maximize the CR rate subject to the constraint that the CA rate is around 50%, or to maximize the CA rate subject to the constraint that the CR rate is around 90%, the dashed curve is superior to the solid curve. One can imagine that better performance can be obtained along some stretches of the curve by sacriﬁcing performance along other stretches of the curve. Note that obtaining a result such as the dashed curve requires a nonstandard training algorithm, as the discrimination performance as measured by the ROC area is worse for the dashed curve than for the solid curve. In this paper, we propose and evaluate four algorithms for optimizing performance in a certain region of the ROC curve. To begin, we explain the domain we are concerned with and why focusing on a certain region of the ROC curve is important in this domain. 1 OUR DOMAIN Athene Software focuses on predicting and managing subscriber churn in the telecommunications industry (Mozer, Wolniewicz, Grimes, Johnson, & Kaushansky, 2000). “Churn” refers to the loss of subscribers who switch from one company to the other. Churn is a signiﬁcant problem for wireless, long distance, and internet service providers. For example, in the wireless industry, domestic monthly churn rates are 2–3% of the customer base. Consequently, service providers are highly motivated to identify subscribers who are dissatisﬁed with their service and offer them incentives to prevent churn. We use techniques from statistical machine learning—primarily neural networks and ensemble methods—to estimate the probability that an individual subscriber will churn in the near future. The prediction of churn is based on various sources of information about a subscriber, including: call detail records (date, time, duration, and location of each call, and whether call was dropped due to lack of coverage or available bandwidth), ﬁnancial information appearing on a subscriber’s bill (monthly base fee, additional charges for roaming and usage beyond monthly prepaid limit), complaints to the customer service department and their resolution, information from the initial application for service (contract details, rate plan, handset type, credit report), market information (e.g., rate plans offered by the service provider and its competitors), and demographic data. Churn prediction is an extremely difﬁcult problem for several reasons. First, the business environment is highly nonstationary; models trained on data from a certain time period perform far better with hold-out examples from that same time period than examples drawn from successive time periods. Second, features available for prediction are only weakly related to churn; when computing mutual information between individual features and churn, the greatest value we typically encounter is .01 bits. Third, information critical to predicting subscriber behavior, such as quality of service, is often unavailable. Obtaining accurate churn predictions is only part of the challenge of subscriber retention. Subscribers who are likely to churn must be contacted by a call center and offered some incentive to remain with the service provider. In a mathematically principled business scenario, one would frame the challenge as maximizing proﬁtability to a service provider, and making the decision about whether to contact a subscriber and what incentive to offer would be based on the expected utility of offering versus not offering an incentive. However, business practices complicate the scenario and place some unique constraints on predictive models. First, call centers are operated by a staff of customer service representatives who can contact subscribers at a ﬁxed rate; consequently, our models cannot advise contacting 50,000 subscribers one week, and 50 the next. Second, internal business strategies at the service providers constrain the minimum acceptable CA or CR rates (above and beyond the goal of maximizing proﬁtability). Third, contracts that Athene makes with service providers will occasionally call for achieving a speciﬁc target CA and CR rate. These three practical issues pose formal problems which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been addressed by the machine learning community. The formal problems can be stated in various ways, including: (1) maximize the CA rate, subject to the constraint that a ﬁxed percentage of the subscriber base is identiﬁed as potential churners, (2) optimize the CR rate, subject to the constraint that the CA rate should be αCA, (3) optimize the CA rate, subject to the constraint that the CR rate should be αCR, and ﬁnally—what marketing executives really want—(4) design a classiﬁer that has a CA rate of αCA and a CR rate of αCR. Problem (1) sounds somewhat different than problems (2) or (3), but it can be expressed in terms of a lift curve, which plots the CA rate as a function of the total fraction of subscribers identiﬁed by the model. Problem (1) thus imposes the constraint that the solution lies at one coordinate of the lift curve, just as problems (2) and (3) place the constraint that the solution lies at one coordinate of the ROC curve. Thus, a solution to problems (2) or (3) will also serve as a solution to (1). Although addressing problem (4) seems most fanciful, it encompasses problems (2) and (3), and thus we focus on it. Our goal is not altogether unreasonable, because a solution to problem (4) has the property we characterized in Figure 1b: the ROC curve can suffer everywhere except in the region near CA αCA and CR αCR. Hence, the approaches we consider will trade off performance in some regions of the ROC curve against performance in other regions. We call this prodding the ROC curve. 2 FOUR ALGORITHMS TO PROD THE ROC CURVE In this section, we describe four algorithms for prodding the ROC curve toward a target CA rate of αCA and a target CR rate of αCR. 2.1 EMPHASIZING CRITICAL TRAINING EXAMPLES Suppose we train a classiﬁer on a set of positive and negative examples from a class— churners and nonchurners in our domain. Following training, the classiﬁer will assign a posterior probability of class membership to each example. The examples can be sorted by the posterior and arranged on a continuum anchored by probabilities 0 and 1 (Figure 2). We can identify the thresholds, θCA and θCR, which yield CA and CR rates of αCA and αCR, respectively. If the classiﬁer’s discrimination performance fails to achieve the target CA and CR rates, then θCA will be lower than θCR, as depicted in the Figure. If we can bring these two thresholds together, we will achieve the target CA and CR rates. Thus, the ﬁrst algorithm we propose involves training a series of classiﬁers, attempting to make classiﬁer n+1 achieve better CA and CR rates by focusing its effort on examples from classiﬁer n that lie between θCA and θCR; the positive examples must be pushed above θCR and the negative examples must be pushed below θCA. (Of course, the thresholds are speciﬁc to a classiﬁer, and hence should be indexed by n.) We call this the emphasis algorithm, because it involves placing greater weight on the examples that lie between the two thresholds. In the Figure, the emphasis for classiﬁer n+1 would be on examples e5 through e8. This retraining procedure can be iterated until the classiﬁer’s training set performance reaches asymptote. In our implementation, we deﬁne a weighting of each example i for training classiﬁer n, λ in . For classiﬁer 1, λ i1 = 1 . For subsequent classiﬁers, λ in + 1 = λ in if example i is not in the region of emphasis, or λ in + 1 = κ e λ in otherwise, where κe is a constant, κe > 1. 2.2 DEEMPHASIZING IRRELEVANT TRAINING EXAMPLES The second algorithm we propose is related to the ﬁrst, but takes a slightly different perspective on the continuum depicted in Figure 2. Positive examples below θCA—such as e2—are clearly the most dif ﬁcult positive examples to classify correctly. Not only are they the most difﬁcult positive examples, but they do not in fact need to be classiﬁed correctly to achieve the target CA and CR rates. Threshold θCR does not depend on examples such as e2, and threshold θCA allows a fraction (1–αCA) of the positive examples to be classiﬁed incorrectly. Likewise, one can argue that negative examples above θCR—such as e10 and e11—need not be of concern. Essentially , the second algorithm, which we term the eemd phasis algorithm, is like the emphasis algorithm in that a series of classiﬁers are trained, but when training classiﬁer n+1, less weight is placed on the examples whose correct clasθCA e1 e2 e3 0 e4 θCR e5 e6 e7 e8 churn probability e9 e10 e11 e12 e13 1 FIGURE 2. A schematic depiction of all training examples arranged by the classiﬁer’s posterior. Each solid bar corresponds to a positive example (e.g., a churner) and each grey bar corresponds to a negative example (e.g., a nonchurner). siﬁcation is unnecessary to achieve the target CA and CR rates for classiﬁer n. As with the emphasis algorithm, the retraining procedure can be iterated until no further performance improvements are obtained on the training set. Note that the set of examples given emphasis by the previous algorithm is not the complement of the set of examples deemphasized by the current algorithm; the algorithms are not identical. In our implementation, we assign a weight to each example i for training classiﬁer n, λ in . For classiﬁer 1, λ i1 = 1 . For subsequent classiﬁers, λ in + 1 = λ in if example i is not in the region of deemphasis, or λ in + 1 = κ d λ in otherwise, where κd is a constant, κd <1. 2.3 CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION The third algorithm we propose is formulated as maximizing the CR rate while maintaining the CA rate equal to αCA. (We do not attempt to simultaneously maximize the CA rate while maintaining the CR rate equal to αCR.) Gradient methods cannot be applied directly because the CA and CR rates are nondifferentiable, but we can approximate the CA and CR rates with smooth differentiable functions: 1 1 CA ( w, t ) = ----- ∑ σ β ( f ( x i, w ) – t ) CR ( w, t ) = ------ ∑ σ β ( t – f ( x i, w ) ) , P i∈P N i∈N where P and N are the set of positive and negative examples, respectively, f(x,w) is the model posterior for input x, w is the parameterization of the model, t is a threshold, and σβ –1 is a sigmoid function with scaling parameter β: σ β ( y ) = ( 1 + exp ( – βy ) ) . The larger β is, the more nearly step-like the sigmoid is and the more nearly equal the approximations are to the model CR and CA rates. We consider the problem formulation in which CA is a constraint and CR is a ﬁgure of merit. We convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem by the augmented Lagrangian method (Bertsekas, 1982), which involves iteratively maximizing an objective function 2 µ A ( w, t ) = CR ( w, t ) + ν CA ( w, t ) – α CA + -- CA ( w, t ) – α CA 2 with a ﬁxed Lagrangian multiplier, ν, and then updating ν following the optimization step: ν ← ν + µ CA ( w *, t * ) – α CA , where w * and t * are the values found by the optimization step. We initialize ν = 1 and ﬁx µ = 1 and β = 10 and iterate until ν converges. 2.4 GENETIC ALGORITHM The fourth algorithm we explore is a steady-state genetic search over a space deﬁned by the continuous parameters of a classiﬁer (Whitley, 1989). The ﬁtness of a classiﬁer is the reciprocal of the number of training examples falling between the θCA and θCR thresholds. Much like the emphasis algorithm, this ﬁtness function encourages the two thresholds to come together. The genetic search permits direct optimization over a nondifferentiable criterion, and therefore seems sensible for the present task. 3 METHODOLOGY For our tests, we studied two large data bases made available to Athene by two telecommunications providers. Data set 1 had 50,000 subscribers described by 35 input features and a churn rate of 4.86%. Data set 2 had 169,727 subscribers described by 51 input features and a churn rate of 6.42%. For each data base, the features input to the classiﬁer were obtained by proprietary transformations of the raw data (see Mozer et al., 2000). We chose these two large, real world data sets because achieving gains with these data sets should be more difﬁcult than with smaller, less noisy data sets. Plus, with our real-world data, we can evaluate the cost savings achieved by an improvement in prediction accuracy. We performed 10-fold cross-validation on each data set, preserving the overall churn/nonchurn ratio in each split. In all tests, we chose α CR = 0.90 and α CA = 0.50 , values which, based on our past experience in this domain, are ambitious yet realizable targets for data sets such as these. We used a logistic regression model (i.e., a no hidden unit neural network) for our studies, believing that it would be more difﬁcult to obtain improvements with such a model than with a more ﬂexible multilayer perceptron. For the emphasis and deemphasis algorithms, models were trained to minimize mean-squared error on the training set. We chose κe = 1.3 and κd = .75 by quick exploration. Because the weightings are cumulative over training restarts, the choice of κ is not critical for either algorithm; rather, the magnitude of κ controls how many restarts are necessary to reach asymptotic performance, but the results we obtained were robust to the choice of κ. The emphasis and deemphasis algorithms were run for 100 iterations, which was the number of iterations required to reach asymptotic performance on the training set. 4 RESULTS Figure 3 illustrates training set performance for the emphasis algorithm on data set 1. The graph on the left shows the CA rate when the CR rate is .9, and the graph on the right show the CR rate when the CA rate is .5. Clearly, the algorithm appears to be stable, and the ROC curve is improving in the region around (αCA, αCR). Figure 4 shows cross-validation performance on the two data sets for the four prodding algorithms as well as for a traditional least-squares training procedure. The emphasis and deemphasis algorithms yield reliable improvements in performance in the critical region of the ROC curve over the traditional training procedure. The constrained-optimization and genetic algorithms perform well on achieving a high CR rate for a ﬁxed CA rate, but neither does as well on achieving a high CA rate for a ﬁxed CR rate. For the constrained-optimization algorithm, this result is not surprising as it was trained asymmetrically, with the CA rate as the constraint. However, for the genetic algorithm, we have little explanation for its poor performance, other than the difﬁculty faced in searching a continuous space without gradient information. 5 DISCUSSION In this paper, we have identiﬁed an interesting, novel problem in classiﬁer design which is motivated by our domain of churn prediction and real-world business considerations. Rather than seeking a classiﬁer that maximizes discriminability between two classes, as measured by area under the ROC curve, we are concerned with optimizing performance at certain points along the ROC curve. We presented four alternative approaches to prodding the ROC curve, and found that all four have promise, depending on the speciﬁc goal. Although the magnitude of the gain is small—an increase of about .01 in the CR rate given a target CA rate of .50—the impro vement results in signiﬁcant dollar savings. Using a framework for evaluating dollar savings to a service provider, based on estimates of subscriber retention and costs of intervention obtained in real world data collection (Mozer et 0.845 0.84 0.39 0.835 0.385 CR rate CA rate 0.4 0.395 0.38 0.83 0.825 0.375 0.82 0.37 0.815 0.365 0.81 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Iteration 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Iteration FIGURE 3.

The left column shows the CA rate for CR rate .9; the right column shows the CR rate for CA rate .5. The error bar indicates one standard error of the mean over the 10 data splits. al., 2000), we obtain a savings of $11 per churnable subscriber when the (CA, CR) rates go from (.50, .80) to (.50, .81), which amounts to an 8% increase in proﬁtability of the subscriber intervention effort. These ﬁgures are clearly promising. However, based on the data sets we have studied, it is difﬁcult to know whether another algorithm might exist that achieves even greater gains. Interestingly, all algorithms we proposed yielded roughly the same gains when successful, suggesting that we may have milked the data for whatever gain could be had, given the model class evaluated. Our work clearly illustrate the difﬁculty of the problem, and we hope that others in the NIPS community will be motivated by the problem to suggest even more powerful, theoretically grounded approaches. 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS No white males were angered in the course of conducting this research.

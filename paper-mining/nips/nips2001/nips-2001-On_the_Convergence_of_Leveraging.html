<p>Author: Paul Viola, Michael Jones</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a new approach for extremely fast detection in domains where the distribution of positive and negative examples is highly skewed (e.g. face detection or database retrieval). In such domains a cascade of simple classiﬁers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a ﬁnal detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classiﬁers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields signiﬁcant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The ﬁnal face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000.</p><p>6 0.23155575 <a title="137-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Boosting_and_Maximum_Likelihood_for_Exponential_Models.html">45 nips-2001-Boosting and Maximum Likelihood for Exponential Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: We derive an equivalence between AdaBoost and the dual of a convex optimization problem, showing that the only difference between minimizing the exponential loss used by AdaBoost and maximum likelihood for exponential models is that the latter requires the model to be normalized to form a conditional probability distribution over labels. In addition to establishing a simple and easily understood connection between the two methods, this framework enables us to derive new regularization procedures for boosting that directly correspond to penalized maximum likelihood. Experiments on UCI datasets support our theoretical analysis and give additional insight into the relationship between boosting and logistic regression.</p><p>3 0.69074589 <a title="137-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2001-On the Generalization Ability of On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron P. Shon, David Hsu, Chris Diorio</p><p>Abstract: We have designed and fabricated a VLSI synapse that can learn a conditional probability or correlation between spike-based inputs and feedback signals. The synapse is low power, compact, provides nonvolatile weight storage, and can perform simultaneous multiplication and adaptation. We can calibrate arrays of synapses to ensure uniform adaptation characteristics. Finally, adaptation in our synapse does not necessarily depend on the signals used for computation. Consequently, our synapse can implement learning rules that correlate past and present synaptic activity. We provide analysis and experimental chip results demonstrating the operation in learning and calibration mode, and show how to use our synapse to implement various learning rules in silicon. 1 I n tro d u cti o n Computation with conditional probabilities and correlations underlies many models of neurally inspired information processing. For example, in the sequence-learning neural network models proposed by Levy [1], synapses store the log conditional probability that a presynaptic spike occurred given that the postsynaptic neuron spiked sometime later. Boltzmann machine synapses learn the difference between the correlations of pairs of neurons in the sleep and wake phase [2]. In most neural models, computation and adaptation occurs at the synaptic level. Hence, a silicon synapse that can learn conditional probabilities or correlations between pre- and post-synaptic signals can be a key part of many silicon neural-learning architectures. We have designed and implemented a silicon synapse, in a 0.35µm CMOS process, that learns a synaptic weight that corresponds to the conditional probability or correlation between binary input and feedback signals. This circuit utilizes floating-gate transistors to provide both nonvolatile storage and weight adaptation mechanisms [3]. In addition, the circuit is compact, low power, and provides simultaneous adaptation and computation. Our circuit improves upon previous implementations of floating-gate based learning synapses [3,4,5] in several ways. First, our synapse appears to be the first spike-based floating-gate synapse that implements a general learning principle, rather than a particular learning rule [4,5]. We demon- strate that our synapse can learn either the conditional probability or the correlation between input and feedback signals. Consequently, we can implement a wide range of synaptic learning networks with our circuit. Second, unlike the general correlational learning synapse proposed by Hasler et. al. [3], our synapse can implement learning rules that correlate pre- and postsynaptic activity that occur at different times. Learning algorithms that employ time-separated correlations include both temporal difference learning [6] and recently postulated temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning [7]. Hasler’s correlational floating-gate synapse can only perform updates based on the present input and feedback signals, and is therefore unsuitable for learning rules that correlate signals that occur at different times. Because signals that control adaptation and computation in our synapse are separate, our circuit can implement these time-dependent learning rules. Finally, we can calibrate our synapses to remove mismatch between the adaptation mechanisms of individual synapses. Mismatch between the same adaptation mechanisms on different floating-gate transistors limits the accuracy of learning rules based on these devices. This problem has been noted in previous circuits that use floating-gate adaptation [4,8]. In our circuit, different synapses can learn widely divergent weights from the same inputs because of component mismatch. We provide a calibration mechanism that enables identical adaptation across multiple synapses despite device mismatch. To our knowledge, this circuit is the first instance of a floating-gate learning circuit that includes this feature. This paper is organized as follows. First, we provide a brief introduction to floating-gate transistors. Next, we provide a description and analysis of our synapse, demonstrating that it can learn the conditional probability or correlation between a pair of binary signals. We then describe the calibration circuitry and show its effectiveness in compensating for adaptation mismatches. Finally, we discuss how this synapse can be used for silicon implementations of various learning networks. 2 Floating-gate transistors Because our circuit relies on floating-gate transistors to achieve adaptation, we begin by briefly discussing these devices. A floating-gate transistor (e.g. transistor M3 of Fig.1(a)) comprises a MOSFET whose gate is isolated on all sides by SiO2. A control gate capacitively couples signals to the floating gate. Charge stored on the floating gate implements a nonvolatile analog weight; the transistor’s output current varies with both the floating-gate voltage and the control-gate voltage. We use Fowler-Nordheim tunneling [9] to increase the floating-gate charge, and impact-ionized hot-electron injection (IHEI) [10] to decrease the floating-gate charge. We tunnel by placing a high voltage on a tunneling implant, denoted by the arrow in Fig.1(a). We inject by imposing more than about 3V across the drain and source of transistor M3. The circuit allows simultaneous adaptation and computation, because neither tunneling nor IHEI interfere with circuit operation. Over a wide range of tunneling voltages Vtun, we can approximate the magnitude of the tunneling current Itun as [4]: I tun = I tun 0 exp (Vtun − V fg ) / Vχ (1) where Vtun is the tunneling-implant voltage, Vfg is the floating-gate voltage, and Itun0 and Vχ are fit constants. Over a wide range of transistor drain and source voltages, we can approximate the magnitude of the injection current Iinj as [4]: 1−U t / Vγ I inj = I inj 0 I s exp ( (Vs − Vd ) / Vγ ) (2) where Vs and Vd are the drain and source voltages, Iinj0 is a pre-exponential current, Vγ is a constant that depends on the VLSI process, and Ut is the thermal voltage kT/q. 3 T h e s i l i co n s y n a p s e We show our silicon synapse in Fig.1. The synapse stores an analog weight W, multiplies W by a binary input Xin, and adapts W to either a conditional probability P(Xcor|Y) or a correlation P(XcorY). Xin is analogous to a presynaptic input, while Y is analogous to a postsynaptic signal or error feedback. Xcor is a presynaptic adaptation signal, and typically has some relationship with Xin. We can implement different learning rules by altering the relationship between Xcor and Xin. For some examples, see section 4. We now describe the circuit in more detail. The drain current of floating-gate transistor M4 represents the weight value W. Because the control gate of M4 is fixed, W depends solely on the charge on floating-gate capacitor C1. We can switch the drain current on or off using transistor M7; this switching action corresponds to a multiplication of the weight value W by a binary input signal, Xin. We choose values for the drain voltage of the M4 to prevent injection. A second floating-gate transistor M3, whose gate is also connected to C1, controls adaptation by injection and tunneling. Simultaneously high input signals Xcor and Y cause injection, increasing the weight. A high Vtun causes tunneling, decreasing the weight. We either choose to correlate a high Vtun with signal Y or provide a fixed high Vtun throughout the adaptation process. The choice determines whether the circuit learns a conditional probability or a correlation, respectively. Because the drain current sourced by M4 provides is the weight W, we can express W in terms of M4’s floating-gate voltage, Vfg. Vfg includes the effects of both the fixed controlgate voltage and the variable floating-gate charge. The expression differs depending on whether the readout transistor is operating in the subthreshold or above-threshold regime. We provide both expressions below: I 0 exp( − κ 2V fg /(1 + κ )U t ) W= κ V fg (1 + κ ) 2 β V0 − below threshold 2 (3) above threshold Here V0 is a constant that depends on the threshold voltage and on Vdd, Ut is the thermal voltage kT/q, κ is the floating-gate-to-channel coupling coefficient, and I 0 is a fixed bias current. Eq. 3 shows that W depends solely on Vfg, (all the other factors are constants). These equations differ slightly from standard equations for the source current through a transistor due to source degeneration caused by M 4. This degeneration smoothes the nonlinear relationship between Vfg and Is; its addition to the circuit is optional. 3.1 Weight adaptation Because W depends on Vfg, we can control W by tunneling or injecting transistor M3. In this section, we show that these mechanisms enable our circuit to learn the correlation or conditional probability between inputs Xcor (which we will refer to as X) and Y. Our analysis assumes that these statistics are fixed over some period during which adaptation occurs. The change in floating-gate voltage, and hence the weight, discussed below should therefore be interpreted in terms of the expected weight change due to the statistics of the inputs. We discuss learning of conditional probabilities; a slight change in the tunneling signal, described previously, allows us to learn correlations instead. We first derive the injection equation for the floating-gate voltage in terms of the joint probability P(X,Y) by considering the relationship between the input signals and Is, Vs, Vb Vtun M1 W eq (nA) 80 M2 60 40 C1 Xcor M4 M3 W M5 Xin Y o chip data − fit: P(X|Y)0.78 20 M6 0 M7 synaptic output 0.2 0.4 0.6 Pr(X|Y) 1 0.8 (b) 3.5 Fig. 1.

Presentation of a joint binary event (X,Y) closes nFET switches M5 and M6, pulling the drain voltage Vd of M3 to 0V and causing injection. Therefore the probability that Vd is low enough to cause injection is the probability of the joint event Pr(X,Y). By Eq.2 , the amount of the injection is also dependent on M3’s source voltage Vs. Because M3 is constrained to a fixed channel current, a drop in the floating-gate voltage, ∆Vfg, causes a drop in Vs of magnitude κ∆Vfg. Substituting these expressions into Eq.2 results in a floating-gate voltage update of: (dV fg / dt )inj = − I inj 0 Pr( X , Y ) exp(κ Vfg / Vγ ) (4) where Iinj0 also includes the constant source current. Eq.4 shows that the floating-gate voltage update due to injection is a function of the probability of the joint event (X,Y). Next we analyze the effects of tunneling on the floating-gate voltage. The origin of the tunneling signal determines whether the synapse is learning a conditional probability or a correlation. If the circuit is learning a conditional probability, occurrence of the conditioning event Y gates a corresponding high-voltage (~9V) signal onto the tunneling implant. Consequently, we can express the change in floating-gate voltage due to tunneling in terms of the probability of Y, and the floating-gate voltage. (dV fg / dt )tun = I tun 0 Pr(Y ) exp(−V fg / Vχ ) (5) Eq.5 shows that the floating-gate voltage update due to tunneling is a function of the probability of the event Y. 3.2 Weight equilibrium To demonstrate that our circuit learns P(X|Y), we show that the equilibrium weight of the synapse is solely a function of P(X|Y). The equilibrium weight of the synapse is the weight value where the expected weight change over time equals zero. This weight value corresponds to the floating-gate voltage where injection and tunneling currents are equal. To find this voltage, we equate Eq’s. 4 and 5 and solve: eq V fg = I inj 0 −1 log Pr( X | Y ) + log I tun 0 (κ / Vy + 1/ Vx ) (6) To derive the equilibrium weight, we substitute Eq.6 into Eq.3 and solve: I0 Weq = I inj 0 I tun 0 β V0 + η log where α = α Pr( X | Y ) I inj 0 I tun 0 below threshold 2 + log ( Pr( X | Y ) ) above threshold (7) κ2 κ2 and η = . (1 + κ )U t (κ / Vγ + 1/ Vχ ) (1 + κ )(κ / Vγ + 1/ Vχ ) Consequently, the equilibrium weight is a function of the conditional probability below threshold and a function of the log-squared conditional probability above threshold. Note that the equilibrium weight is stable because of negative feedback in the tunneling and injection processes. Therefore, the weight will always converge to the equilibrium value shown in Eq.7. Figs. 1(b) and (c) show the equilibrium weight versus the conditional P(X|Y) for both sub- and above-threshold circuits, along with fits to Eq.7. Note that both the sub- and above-threshold relationship between P(X|Y) and the equilibrium weight enables us to compute the probability of a vector of synaptic inputs X given a post-synaptic response Y. In both cases, we can apply the outputs currents of an array of synapses through diodes, and then add the resulting voltages via a capacitive voltage divider, resulting in a voltage that is a linear function of log P(X|Y). 3.3 Calibration circuitry Mismatch between injection and tunneling in different floating-gate transistors can greatly reduce the ability of our synapses to learn meaningful values. Experimental data from floating-gate transistors fabricated in a 0.35µm process show that injection varies by as much as 2:1 across a chip, and tunneling by up to 1.2:1. The effect of this mismatch on our synapses causes the weight equilibrium of different synapses to differ by a multiplicative gain. Fig.2 (b) shows the equilibrium weights of an array of six synapses exposed to identical input signals. The variation of the synaptic weights is of the same order of magnitude as the weights themselves, making large arrays of synapses all but useless for implementing many learning algorithms. We alleviate this problem by calibrating our synapses to equalize the pre-exponential tunneling and injection constants. Because the dependence of the equilibrium weight on these constants is determined by the ratio of Iinj0/Itun0, our calibration process changes Iinj to equalize the ratio of injection to tunneling across all synapses. We choose to calibrate injection because we can easily change Iinj0 by altering the drain current through M1. Our calibration procedure is a self-convergent memory write [11], that causes the equilibrium weight of every synapse to equal the current Ical. Calibration requires many operat- 80 Verase M1 M8 60 W eq (nA) Vb M2 Vtun 40 M3 M4 M9 V cal 20 M5 0 M7 M6 synaptic output 0.2 Ical 0.6 P(X|Y) 0.8 1 0.4 0.6 P(X|Y) 0.8 1 0.4 (b) 80 (a) Fig. 2.

W eq (nA) 60 40 20 0 0.2 (c) ing cycles, where, during each cycle, we first increase the equilibrium weight of the synapse, and second, we let the synapse adapt to the new equilibrium weight. We create the calibrated synapse by modifying our original synapse according to Fig. 2(a). We convert M1 into a floating-gate transistor, whose floating-gate charge thereby sets M3’s channel current, providing control of Iinj0 of Eq.7. Transistor M8 modifies M1’s gate charge by means of injection when M9’s gate is low and Vcal is low. M9’s gate is only low when the equilibrium weight W is less than Ical. During calibration, injection and tunneling on M3 are continuously active. We apply a pulse train to Vcal; during each pulse period, Vcal is predominately high. When Vcal is high, the synapse adapts towards its equilibrium weight. When Vcal pulses low, M8 injects, increasing the synapse’s equilibrium weight W. We repeat this process until the equilibrium weight W matches Ical, causing M9’s gate voltage to rise, disabling Vcal and with it injection. To ensure that a precalibrated synapse has an equilibrium weight below Ical, we use tunneling to erase all bias transistors prior to calibration. Fig.2(c) shows the equilibrium weights of six synapses after calibration. The data show that calibration can reduce the effect of mismatched adaptation on the synapse’s learned weight to a small fraction of the weight itself. Because M1 is a floating-gate transistor, its parasitic gate-drain capacitance causes a mild dependence between M1’s drain voltage and source current. Consequently, M3’s floatinggate voltage now affects its source current (through M1’s drain voltage), and we can model M3 as a source-degenerated pFET [3]. The new expression for the injection current in M3 is: Presynaptic neuron W+ Synapse W− X Y Injection Postsynaptic neuron Injection Activation window Fig. 3. A method for achieving spike-time dependent plasticity in silicon. (dV fg / dt )inj = − I inj 0 Pr( X , Y ) exp Vfg κ Vγ − κ k1 Ut (8) where k1 is close to zero. The new expression for injection slightly changes the α and η terms of the weight equilibrium in Eq.7, although the qualitative relationship between the weight equilibrium and the conditional probability remains the same. 4 Implementing silicon synaptic learning rules In this section we discuss how to implement a variety of learning rules from the computational-neurobiology and neural-network literature with our synapse circuit. We can use our circuit to implement a Hebbian learning rule. Simultaneously activating both M5 and M6 is analogous to heterosynaptic LTP based on synchronized pre- and postsynaptic signals, and activating tunneling with the postsynaptic Y is analogous to homosynaptic LTD. In our synapse, we tie Xin and Xcor together and correlate Vtun with Y. Our synapse is also capable of emulating a Boltzmann weight-update rule [2]. This weight-update rule derives from the difference between correlations among neurons when the network receives external input, and when the network operates in a free running phase (denoted as clamped and unclamped phases respectively). With weight decay, a Boltzmann synapse learns the difference between correlations in the clamped and unclamped phase. We can create a Boltzmann synapse from a pair of our circuits, in which the effective weight is the difference between the weights of the two synapses. To implement a weight update, we update one silicon synapse based on pre- and postsynaptic signals in the clamped phase, and update the other synapse in the unclamped phase. We do this by sending Xin to Xcor of one synapse in the clamped phase, and sending Xin to Xcor of the other synapse in the negative phase. Vtun remains constant throughout adaptation. Finally, we consider implementing a temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning rule [7] using our synapse. In temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning, a synapse exhibits LTP or LTD if the presynaptic input occurs before or after the postsynaptic response, respectively. We implement an asymmetric learning synapse using two of our circuits, where the synaptic weight is the difference in the weights of the two circuit. We show the circuit in Fig. 3. Each neuron sends two signals: a neuronal output, and an adaptation time window that is active for some time afterwards. Therefore, the combined synapse receives two presynaptic signals and two postsynaptic signals. The relative timing of a postsynaptic response, Y, with the presynaptic input, X, determines whether the synapse undergoes LTP or LTD. If Y occurs before X, Y’s time window correlates with X, causing injection on the negative synapse, decreasing the weight. If Y occurs after X, Y correlates with X’s time window, causing injection on the positive synapse, increasing the weight. Hence, our circuit can use the relative timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity to implement learning. 5 Conclusion We have described a silicon synapse that implements a wide range of spike-based learning rules, and that does not suffer from device mismatch. We have also described how we can implement various silicon-learning networks using this synapse. In addition, although we have only analyzed the learning properties of the synapse for binary signals, we can instead use pulse-coded analog signals. One possible avenue for future work is to analyze the implications of different pulse-coded schemes on the circuit’s adaptive behavior.

<p>Author: Evan Greensmith, Peter L. Bartlett, Jonathan Baxter</p><p>Abstract: We consider the use of two additive control variate methods to reduce the variance of performance gradient estimates in reinforcement learning problems. The ﬁrst approach we consider is the baseline method, in which a function of the current state is added to the discounted value estimate. We relate the performance of these methods, which use sample paths, to the variance of estimates based on iid data. We derive the baseline function that minimizes this variance, and we show that the variance for any baseline is the sum of the optimal variance and a weighted squared distance to the optimal baseline. We show that the widely used average discounted value baseline (where the reward is replaced by the difference between the reward and its expectation) is suboptimal. The second approach we consider is the actor-critic method, which uses an approximate value function. We give bounds on the expected squared error of its estimates. We show that minimizing distance to the true value function is suboptimal in general; we provide an example for which the true value function gives an estimate with positive variance, but the optimal value function gives an unbiased estimate with zero variance. Our bounds suggest algorithms to estimate the gradient of the performance of parameterized baseline or value functions. We present preliminary experiments that illustrate the performance improvements on a simple control problem. 1 Introduction, Background, and Preliminary Results In reinforcement learning problems, the aim is to select a controller that will maximize the average reward in some environment. We model the environment as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Gradient ascent methods (e.g., [7, 12, 15]) estimate the gradient of the average reward, usually using Monte Carlo techniques to cal∗ Most of this work was performed while the authors were with the Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University. culate an average over a sample path of the controlled POMDP. However such estimates tend to have a high variance, which means many steps are needed to obtain a good estimate. GPOMDP [4] is an algorithm for generating an estimate of the gradient in this way. Compared with other approaches, it is suitable for large systems, when the time between visits to a state is large but the mixing time of the controlled POMDP is short. However, it can suffer from the problem of producing high variance estimates. In this paper, we investigate techniques for variance reduction in GPOMDP. One generic approach to reducing the variance of Monte Carlo estimates of integrals is to use an additive control variate (see, for example, [6]). Suppose we wish to estimate the integral of f : X → R, and we know the integral of another function ϕ : X → R. Since X f = X (f − ϕ) + X ϕ, the integral of f − ϕ can be estimated instead. Obviously if ϕ = f then the variance is zero. More generally, Var(f − ϕ) = Var(f ) − 2Cov(f, ϕ) + Var(ϕ), so that if φ and f are strongly correlated, the variance of the estimate is reduced. In this paper, we consider two approaches of this form. The ﬁrst (Section 2) is the technique of adding a baseline. We ﬁnd the optimal baseline and we show that the additional variance of a suboptimal baseline can be expressed as a weighted squared distance from the optimal baseline. Constant baselines, which do not depend on the state or observations, have been widely used [13, 15, 9, 11]. In particular, the expectation over all states of the discounted value of the state is a popular constant baseline (where, for example, the reward at each step is replaced by the difference between the reward and the expected reward). We give bounds on the estimation variance that show that, perhaps surprisingly, this may not be the best choice. The second approach (Section 3) is the use of an approximate value function. Such actorcritic methods have been investigated extensively [3, 1, 14, 10]. Generally the idea is to minimize some notion of distance between the ﬁxed value function and the true value function. In this paper we show that this may not be the best approach: selecting the ﬁxed value function to be equal to the true value function is not always the best choice. Even more surprisingly, we give an example for which the use of a ﬁxed value function that is different from the true value function reduces the variance to zero, for no increase in bias. We give a bound on the expected squared error (that is, including the estimation variance) of the gradient estimate produced with a ﬁxed value function. Our results suggest new algorithms to learn the optimum baseline, and to learn a ﬁxed value function that minimizes the bound on the error of the estimate. In Section 5, we describe the results of preliminary experiments, which show that these algorithms give performance improvements. POMDP with Reactive, Parameterized Policy A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) consists of a state space, S, a control space, U, an observation space, Y, a set of transition probability matrices {P(u) : u ∈ U}, each with components pij (u) for i, j ∈ S, u ∈ U, an observation process ν : S → PY , where PY is the space of probability distributions over Y, and a reward function r : S → R. We assume that S, U, Y are ﬁnite, although all our results extend easily to inﬁnite U and Y, and with more restrictive assumptions can be extended to inﬁnite S. A reactive, parameterized policy for a POMDP is a set of mappings {µ(·, θ) : Y → PU |θ ∈ RK }. Together with the POMDP, this deﬁnes the controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ). The joint state, observation and control process, {Xt , Yt , Ut }, is Markov. The state process, {Xt }, is also Markov, with transition probabilities pij (θ) = y∈Y,u∈U νy (i)µu (y, θ)pij (u), where νy (i) denotes the probability of observation y given the state i, and µu (y, θ) denotes the probability of action u given parameters θ and observation y. The Markov chain M(θ) = (S, P(θ)) then describes the behaviour of the process {Xt }. Assumption 1 The controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) satisﬁes: For all θ ∈ RK there exists a unique stationary distribution satisfying π (θ) P(θ) = π (θ). There is an R < ∞ such that, for all i ∈ S, |r(i)| ≤ R. There is a B < ∞ such that, for all u ∈ U, y ∈ Y and θ ∈ RK the derivatives ∂µu (y, θ)/∂θk (1 ≤ k ≤ K) exist, and the vector of these derivatives satisﬁes µu (y, θ)/µu (y, θ) ≤ B, where · denotes the Euclidean norm on RK . def T −1 1 We consider the average reward, η(θ) = limT →∞ E T t=0 r(Xt ) . Assumption 1 implies that this limit exists, and does not depend on the start state X0 . The aim is to def select a policy to maximize this quantity. Deﬁne the discounted value function, J β (i, θ) = T −1 t limT →∞ E t=0 β r(Xt ) X0 = i . Throughout the rest of the paper, dependences upon θ are assumed, and dropped in the notation. For a random vector A, we denote Var(A) = E (A − E [A])2 , where a2 denotes a a, and a denotes the transpose of the column vector a. GPOMDP Algorithm The GPOMDP algorithm [4] uses a sample path to estimate the gradient approximation def µu(y) η, but the βη = E β η approaches the true gradient µu(y) Jβ (j) . As β → 1, def variance increases. We consider a slight modiﬁcation [2]: with Jt = def ∆T = 1 T T −1 t=0 2T s=t µUt (Yt ) Jt+1 . µUt (Yt ) β s−t r(Xs ), (1) Throughout this paper the process {Xt , Yt , Ut , Xt+1 } is generally understood to be generated by a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, with X0 ∼π (ie the initial state distributed according to the stationary distribution). That is, before computing the gradient estimates, we wait until the process has settled down to the stationary distribution. Dependent Samples Correlation terms arise in the variance quantities to be analysed. We show here that considering iid samples gives an upper bound on the variance of the general case. The mixing time of a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain M = (S, P ) is deﬁned as def τ = min t > 1 : max dT V i,j Pt i , Pt j ≤ e−1 , where [P t ]i denotes the ith row of P t and dT V is the total variation distance, dT V (P, Q) = i |P (i) − Q(i)|. Theorem 1 Let M = (S, P ) be a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain, with mixing time τ , and 2|S|e and 0 ≤ α < let π be its stationary distribution. There are constants L < exp(−1/(2τ )), which depend only on M , such that, for all f : S → R and all t, Covπ (t) ≤ Lαt Varπ (f), where Varπ (f) is the variance of f under π, and Covπ (t) is f f the auto-covariance of the process {f(Xt )}, where the process {Xt } is generated by M with initial distribution π. Hence, for some constant Ω∗ ≤ 4Lτ , Var 1 T T −1 f(Xt ) t=0 ≤ Ω∗ Varπ (f). T We call (L, τ ) the mixing constants of the Markov chain M (or of the controlled POMDP D; ie the Markov chain (S, P )). We omit the proof (all proofs are in the full version [8]). Brieﬂy, we show that for a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain M , Covπ (t) ≤ Rt (M )Varπ (f), f 2 t for some Rt (M ). We then show that Rt (M ) < 2|S| exp(− τ ). In fact, for a reversible chain, we can choose L = 1 and α = |λ2 |, the second largest magnitude eigenvalue of P . 2 Baseline We consider an alteration of (1), def ∆T = 1 T T −1 µUt (Yt ) (Jt+1 − Ar (Yt )) . µUt (Yt ) t=0 (2) For any baseline Ar : Y → R, it is easy to show that E [∆T ] = E [∆T ]. Thus, we select Ar to minimize variance. The following theorem shows that this variance is bounded by a variance involving iid samples, with Jt replaced by the exact value function. Theorem 2 Suppose that D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) is a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, D has mixing constants (L, τ ), {Xt , Yt , Ut , Xt+1 } is a process generated by D with X0 ∼π ,Ar : Y → R is a baseline that is uniformly bounded by M, and J (j) has the distribution of ∞ β s r(Xt ), where the states Xt are generated by D starting in s=0 X0 = j. Then there are constants C ≤ 5B2 R(R + M) and Ω ≤ 4Lτ ln(eT ) such that Var 1 T T −1 t=0 µUt (Yt ) Ω (Jt+1 −Ar (Yt )) ≤ Varπ µUt (Yt ) T + Ω E T µu (y) (J (j) − Jβ (j)) µu (y) µu (y) (Jβ (j)−Ar (y)) µu (y) 2 + Ω +1 T C βT , (1 − β)2 where, as always, (i, y, u, j) are generated iid with i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y) and j∼P i (u). The proof uses Theorem 1 and [2, Lemma 4.3]. Here we have bounded the variance of (2) with the variance of a quantity we may readily analyse. The second term on the right hand side shows the error associated with replacing an unbiased, uncorrelated estimate of the value function with the true value function. This quantity is not dependent on the baseline. The ﬁnal term on the right hand side arises from the truncation of the discounted reward— and is exponentially decreasing. We now concentrate on minimizing the variance σ 2 = Varπ r µu (y) (Jβ (j) − Ar (y)) , µu (y) (3) which the following lemma relates to the variance σ 2 without a baseline, µu (y) Jβ (j) . µu (y) σ 2 = Varπ Lemma 3 Let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1. For any baseline Ar : Y → R, and for i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y) and j∼Pi (u), σ 2 = σ 2 + E A2 (y) E r r µu (y) µu (y) 2 y − 2Ar (y)E µu (y) µu (y) 2 Jβ (j) y . From Lemma 3 it can be seen that the task of ﬁnding the optimal baseline is in effect that of minimizing a quadratic for each observation y ∈ Y. This gives the following theorem. Theorem 4 For the controlled POMDP as in Lemma 3,  2 µu (y) min σ 2 = σ 2 − E  E Jβ (j) y r Ar µu (y) 2 /E µu (y) µu (y) 2 y and this minimum is attained with the baseline 2 µu (y) µu (y) A∗ (y) = E r Jβ (j) , 2 µu (y) µu (y) /E y  y . Furthermore, the optimal constant baseline is µu (y) µu (y) A∗ = E r 2 Jβ (j) /E µu (y) µu (y) 2 . The following theorem shows that the variance of an estimate with an arbitrary baseline can be expressed as the sum of the variance with the optimal baseline and a certain squared weighted distance between the baseline function and the optimal baseline function. Theorem 5 If Ar : Y → R is a baseline function, A∗ is the optimal baseline deﬁned in r Theorem 4, and σ 2 is the variance of the corresponding estimate, then r∗ µu (y) µu (y) σ 2 = σ2 + E r r∗ 2 (Ar (y) − A∗ (y)) r 2 , where i∼π, y ∼ν(i), and u∼µ(y). Furthermore, the same result is true for the case of constant baselines, with Ar (y) replaced by an arbitrary constant baseline Ar , and A∗ (y) r replaced by A∗ , the optimum constant baseline deﬁned in Theorem 4. r For the constant baseline Ar = E i∼π [Jβ (i)], Theorem 5 implies that σ 2 is equal to r min Ar ∈R σ2 r + E µu (y) µu (y) 2 E [Jβ (j)] − E µu (y) µu (y) 2 2 /E Jβ (j) µu (y) µu (y) 2 . Thus, its performance depends on the random variables ( µu (y)/µu (y))2 and Jβ (j); if they are nearly independent, E [Jβ ] is a good choice. 3 Fixed Value Functions: Actor-Critic Methods We consider an alteration of (1), ˜ def 1 ∆T = T T −1 t=0 µUt (Yt ) ˜ Jβ (Xt+1 ), µUt (Yt ) (4) ˜ for some ﬁxed value function Jβ : S → R. Deﬁne ∞ def β k d(Xk , Xk+1 ) Aβ (j) = E X0 = j , k=0 def ˜ ˜ where d(i, j) = r(i) + β Jβ (j) − Jβ (i) is the temporal difference. Then it is easy to show that the estimate (4) has a bias of µu (y) ˜ Aβ (j) . β η − E ∆T = E µu (y) The following theorem gives a bound on the expected squared error of (4). The main tool in the proof is Theorem 1. Theorem 6 Let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1. For a sample path from D, that is, {X0∼π, Yt∼ν(Xt ), Ut∼µ(Yt ), Xt+1∼PXt (Ut )}, E ˜ ∆T − βη 2 ≤ Ω∗ Varπ T µu (y) ˜ Jβ (j) + E µu (y) µu (y) Aβ (j) µu (y) 2 , where the second expectation is over i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y), and j∼P i (u). ˜ If we write Jβ (j) = Jβ (j) + v(j), then by selecting v = (v(1), . . . , v(|S|)) from the right def null space of the K × |S| matrix G, where G = i,y,u πi νy (i) µu (y)Pi (u), (4) will produce an unbiased estimate of β η. An obvious example of such a v is a constant vector, (c, c, . . . , c) : c ∈ R. We can use this to construct a trivial example where (4) produces an unbiased estimate with zero variance. Indeed, let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, with r(i) = c, for some 0 < c ≤ R. Then Jβ (j) = c/(1 − β) and β η = 0. If we choose v = (−c/(1 − β), . . . , −c/(1 − β)) and ˜ ˜ Jβ (j) = Jβ (j) + v(j), then µµu(y) Jβ (j) = 0 for all y, u, j, and so (4) gives an unbiased u(y) estimate of β η, with zero variance. Furthermore, for any D for which there exists a pair y, u such that µu (y) > 0 and µu (y) = 0, choosing ˜β (j) = Jβ (j) gives a variance J greater than zero—there is a non-zero probability event, (Xt = i, Yt = y, Ut = u, Xt+1 = j), such that µµu(y) Jβ (j) = 0. u(y) 4 Algorithms Given a parameterized class of baseline functions Ar (·, θ) : Y → R θ ∈ RL , we can use Theorem 5 to bound the variance of our estimates. Computing the gradient of this bound with respect to the parameters θ of the baseline function allows a gradient optimization of the baseline. The GDORB Algorithm produces an estimate ∆ S of these gradients from a sample path of length S. Under the assumption that the baseline function and its gradients are uniformly bounded, we can show that these estimates converge to the gradient of σ 2 . We omit the details (see [8]). r GDORB Algorithm: Given: Controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ), parameterized baseline Ar . set z0 = 0 (z0 ∈ RL ), ∆0 = 0 (∆0 ∈ RL ) for all {is , ys , us , is+1 , ys+1 } generated by the POMDP do zs+1 = βzs + ∆s+1 = ∆s + end for Ar (ys ) 1 s+1 µus(ys ) µus(ys ) 2 ((Ar (ys ) − βAr (ys+1 ) − r(xs+1 )) zs+1 − ∆s ) ˜ For a parameterized class of ﬁxed value functions {Jβ (·, θ) : S → R θ ∈ RL }, we can use Theorem 6 to bound the expected squared error of our estimates, and compute the gradient of this bound with respect to the parameters θ of the baseline function. The GBTE Algorithm produces an estimate ∆S of these gradients from a sample path of length S. Under the assumption that the value function and its gradients are uniformly bounded, we can show that these estimates converge to the true gradient.

The exact value function plots show how different choices of baseline and ﬁxed value function compare when all algorithms have access to the exact value function Jβ . Using the expected value function as a baseline was an improvement over GPOMDP. Using the optimum, or optimum constant, baseline was a further improvement, each performing comparably to the other. Using the pre-trained ﬁxed value function was also an improvement over GPOMDP, showing that selecting the true value function was indeed not the best choice in this case. The trained ﬁxed value function was not optimal though, as Jβ (j) − A∗ is a valid choice of ﬁxed value function. r The optimum baseline, and ﬁxed value function, will not normally be known. The online plots show experiments where the baseline and ﬁxed value function were trained using online gradient descent whilst the performance gradient was being estimated, using the same data. Clear improvement over GPOMDP is seen for the online trained baseline variant. For the online trained ﬁxed value function, improvement is seen until T becomes—given the simplicity of the system—very large. References [1] L. Baird and A. Moore.

<p>Author: Gregory Z. Grudic, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We address two open theoretical questions in Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning. The ﬁrst concerns the efﬁcacy of using function approximation to represent the state action value function, . Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of relative to when no function approximation of is used, where is the number of possible actions and is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function. Theory is presented showing that a non-zero bias term can improve the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by , where is the number of possible actions. Experimental evidence is presented showing that these theoretical results lead to signiﬁcant improvement in the convergence properties of Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning algorithms.       ¤ ¨ ¦ ¢ ©§¥¤£¡ ¦ ¤ ¨ £¡ ¨ ¤¢  ¢</p><p>5 0.86956131 <a title="137-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Generalization_Performance_of_Some_Learning_Problems_in_Hilbert_Functional_Spaces.html">81 nips-2001-Generalization Performance of Some Learning Problems in Hilbert Functional Spaces</a></p>

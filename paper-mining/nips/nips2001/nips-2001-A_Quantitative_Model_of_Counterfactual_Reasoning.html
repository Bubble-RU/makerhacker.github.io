<p>Author: Bob Rehder</p><p>Abstract: A theory of categorization is presented in which knowledge of causal relationships between category features is represented as a Bayesian network. Referred to as causal-model theory, this theory predicts that objects are classified as category members to the extent they are likely to have been produced by a categorys causal model. On this view, people have models of the world that lead them to expect a certain distribution of features in category members (e.g., correlations between feature pairs that are directly connected by causal relationships), and consider exemplars good category members when they manifest those expectations. These expectations include sensitivity to higher-order feature interactions that emerge from the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships. Research on the topic of categorization has traditionally focused on the problem of learning new categories given observations of category members. In contrast, the theory-based view of categories emphasizes the influence of the prior theoretical knowledge that learners often contribute to their representations of categories [1]. However, in contrast to models accounting for the effects of empirical observations, there have been few models developed to account for the effects of prior knowledge. The purpose of this article is to present a model of categorization referred to as causal-model theory or CMT [2, 3]. According to CMT, people 's know ledge of many categories includes not only features, but also an explicit representation of the causal mechanisms that people believe link the features of many categories. In this article I apply CMT to the problem of establishing objects category membership. In the psychological literature one standard view of categorization is that objects are placed in a category to the extent they have features that have often been observed in members of that category. For example, an object that has most of the features of birds (e.g., wings, fly, build nests in trees, etc.) and few features of other categories is thought to be a bird. This view of categorization is formalized by prototype models in which classification is a function of the similarity (i.e. , number of shared features) between a mental representation of a category prototype and a to-be-classified object. However , a well-known difficulty with prototype models is that a features contribution to category membership is independent of the presence or absence of other features. In contrast , consideration of a categorys theoretical knowledge is likely to influence which combinations of features make for acceptable category members. For example , people believe that birds have nests in trees because they can fly , and in light of this knowledge an animal that doesnt fly and yet still builds nests in trees might be considered a less plausible bird than an animal that builds nests on the ground and doesnt fly (e.g., an ostrich) even though the latter animal has fewer features typical of birds. To assess whether knowledge in fact influences which feature combinations make for good category members , in the following experiment undergraduates were taught novel categories whose four binary features exhibited either a common-cause or a common-effect schema (Figure 1). In the common-cause schema, one category feature (PI) is described as causing the three other features (F 2, F 3, and F4). In the common-effect schema one feature (F4) is described as being caused by the three others (F I, F 2, and F3). CMT assumes that people represent causal knowledge such as that in Figure 1 as a kind of Bayesian network [4] in which nodes are variables representing binary category features and directed edges are causal relationships representing the presence of probabilistic causal mechanisms between features. Specifically , CMT assumes that when a cause feature is present it enables the operation of a causal mechanism that will, with some probability m , bring about the presence of the effect feature. CMT also allow for the possibility that effect features have potential background causes that are not explicitly represented in the network, as represented by parameter b which is the probability that an effect will be present even when its network causes are absent. Finally, each cause node has a parameter c that represents the probability that a cause feature will be present. ~ Common-Cause Schema ~ ® Common-Effect Schema Figure 1. ...(~~) @ ..... : ~~:f·</p><p>3 0.065153666 <a title="17-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-The_Unified_Propagation_and_Scaling_Algorithm.html">188 nips-2001-The Unified Propagation and Scaling Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we will show that a restricted class of constrained minimum divergence problems, named generalized inference problems, can be solved by approximating the KL divergence with a Bethe free energy. The algorithm we derive is closely related to both loopy belief propagation and iterative scaling. This uniﬁed propagation and scaling algorithm reduces to a convergent alternative to loopy belief propagation when no constraints are present. Experiments show the viability of our algorithm.</p><p>4 0.048840307 <a title="17-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>5 0.047061808 <a title="17-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Alberto Paccanaro, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), a new method of learning a distributed representation of concepts from data consisting of instances of relations between given concepts. Its ﬁnal goal is to be able to generalize, i.e. infer new instances of these relations among the concepts. On a task involving family relationships we show that LRE can generalize better than any previously published method. We then show how LRE can be used effectively to ﬁnd compact distributed representations for variable-sized recursive data structures, such as trees and lists. 1 Linear Relational Embedding Our aim is to take a large set of facts about a domain expressed as tuples of arbitrary symbols in a simple and rigid syntactic format and to be able to infer other “common-sense” facts without having any prior knowledge about the domain. Let us imagine a situation in which we have a set of concepts and a set of relations among these concepts, and that our data consists of few instances of these relations that hold among the concepts. We want to be able to infer other instances of these relations. For example, if the concepts are the people in a certain family, the relations are kinship relations, and we are given the facts ”Alberto has-father Pietro” and ”Pietro has-brother Giovanni”, we would like to be able to infer ”Alberto has-uncle Giovanni”. Our approach is to learn appropriate distributed representations of the entities in the data, and then exploit the generalization properties of the distributed representations [2] to make the inferences. In this paper we present a method, which we have called Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), which learns a distributed representation for the concepts by embedding them in a space where the relations between concepts are linear transformations of their distributed representations. Let us consider the case in which all the relations are binary, i.e. involve two concepts. , and the problem In this case our data consists of triplets we are trying to solve is to infer missing triplets when we are given only few of them. Inferring a triplet is equivalent to being able to complete it, that is to come up with one of its elements, given the other two. Here we shall always try to complete the third element of the triplets 1 . LRE will then represent each concept in the data as a learned vector in a 2 0    £ § ¥ £  § ¥ % </p><p>4 0.35528895 <a title="17-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Hyperbolic_Self-Organizing_Maps_for_Semantic_Navigation.html">90 nips-2001-Hyperbolic Self-Organizing Maps for Semantic Navigation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jorg Ontrup, Helge Ritter</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new type of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to navigate in the Semantic Space of large text collections. We propose a “hyperbolic SOM” (HSOM) based on a regular tesselation of the hyperbolic plane, which is a non-euclidean space characterized by constant negative gaussian curvature. The exponentially increasing size of a neighborhood around a point in hyperbolic space provides more freedom to map the complex information space arising from language into spatial relations. We describe experiments, showing that the HSOM can successfully be applied to text categorization tasks and yields results comparable to other state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.34461504 <a title="17-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Constructing_Distributed_Representations_Using_Additive_Clustering.html">53 nips-2001-Constructing Distributed Representations Using Additive Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Wheeler Ruml</p><p>Abstract: If the promise of computational modeling is to be fully realized in higherlevel cognitive domains such as language processing, principled methods must be developed to construct the semantic representations used in such models. In this paper, we propose the use of an established formalism from mathematical psychology, additive clustering, as a means of automatically constructing binary representations for objects using only pairwise similarity data. However, existing methods for the unsupervised learning of additive clustering models do not scale well to large problems. We present a new algorithm for additive clustering, based on a novel heuristic technique for combinatorial optimization. The algorithm is simpler than previous formulations and makes fewer independence assumptions. Extensive empirical tests on both human and synthetic data suggest that it is more effective than previous methods and that it also scales better to larger problems. By making additive clustering practical, we take a signiﬁcant step toward scaling connectionist models beyond hand-coded examples.</p><p>6 0.34073532 <a title="17-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-ACh%2C_Uncertainty%2C_and_Cortical_Inference.html">3 nips-2001-ACh, Uncertainty, and Cortical Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Randall C. O'Reilly, R. S. Busby</p><p>Abstract: We present a model of binding of relationship information in a spatial domain (e.g., square above triangle) that uses low-order coarse-coded conjunctive representations instead of more popular temporal synchrony mechanisms. Supporters of temporal synchrony argue that conjunctive representations lack both efﬁciency (i.e., combinatorial numbers of units are required) and systematicity (i.e., the resulting representations are overly speciﬁc and thus do not support generalization to novel exemplars). To counter these claims, we show that our model: a) uses far fewer hidden units than the number of conjunctions represented, by using coarse-coded, distributed representations where each unit has a broad tuning curve through high-dimensional conjunction space, and b) is capable of considerable generalization to novel inputs.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.65320909 <a title="17-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-A_Quantitative_Model_of_Counterfactual_Reasoning.html">17 nips-2001-A Quantitative Model of Counterfactual Reasoning</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Yarlett, Michael Ramscar</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we explore two quantitative approaches to the modelling of counterfactual reasoning – a linear and a noisy-OR model – based on information contained in conceptual dependency networks. Empirical data is acquired in a study and the ﬁt of the models compared to it. We conclude by considering the appropriateness of non-parametric approaches to counterfactual reasoning, and examining the prospects for other parametric approaches in the future.</p><p>3 0.48731673 <a title="17-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Model_of_the_Phonological_Loop%3A_Generalization_and_Binding.html">12 nips-2001-A Model of the Phonological Loop: Generalization and Binding</a></p>
<p>Author: Randall C. O'Reilly, R. Soto</p><p>Abstract: We present a neural network model that shows how the prefrontal cortex, interacting with the basal ganglia, can maintain a sequence of phonological information in activation-based working memory (i.e., the phonological loop). The primary function of this phonological loop may be to transiently encode arbitrary bindings of information necessary for tasks - the combinatorial expressive power of language enables very flexible binding of essentially arbitrary pieces of information. Our model takes advantage of the closed-class nature of phonemes, which allows different neural representations of all possible phonemes at each sequential position to be encoded. To make this work, we suggest that the basal ganglia provide a region-specific update signal that allocates phonemes to the appropriate sequential coding slot. To demonstrate that flexible, arbitrary binding of novel sequences can be supported by this mechanism, we show that the model can generalize to novel sequences after moderate amounts of training. 1</p><p>4 0.48344642 <a title="17-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>5 0.47844738 <a title="17-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Grammar_Transfer_in_a_Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network.html">85 nips-2001-Grammar Transfer in a Second Order Recurrent Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiro Negishi, Stephen J. Hanson</p><p>Abstract: It has been known that people, after being exposed to sentences generated by an artificial grammar, acquire implicit grammatical knowledge and are able to transfer the knowledge to inputs that are generated by a modified grammar. We show that a second order recurrent neural network is able to transfer grammatical knowledge from one language (generated by a Finite State Machine) to another language which differ both in vocabularies and syntax. Representation of the grammatical knowledge in the network is analyzed using linear discriminant analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.47507277 <a title="17-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Fragment_Completion_in_Humans_and_Machines.html">78 nips-2001-Fragment Completion in Humans and Machines</a></p>

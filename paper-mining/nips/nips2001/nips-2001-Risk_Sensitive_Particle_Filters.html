<p>Author: Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years, particle ﬁlters have been applied with great success to a variety of state estimation problems. We present a statistical approach to increasing the efﬁciency of particle ﬁlters by adapting the size of sample sets on-the-ﬂy. The key idea of the KLD-sampling method is to bound the approximation error introduced by the sample-based representation of the particle ﬁlter. The name KLD-sampling is due to the fact that we measure the approximation error by the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our adaptation approach chooses a small number of samples if the density is focused on a small part of the state space, and it chooses a large number of samples if the state uncertainty is high. Both the implementation and computation overhead of this approach are small. Extensive experiments using mobile robot localization as a test application show that our approach yields drastic improvements over particle ﬁlters with ﬁxed sample set sizes and over a previously introduced adaptation technique.</p><p>3 0.28107509 <a title="163-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised_Particle_Filtering_via_Data_Augmentation.html">156 nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering via Data Augmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christophe Andrieu, Nando D. Freitas, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering method to more complex hybrid models consisting of Gaussian latent variables and discrete observations. This is accomplished by augmenting the models with artificial variables that enable us to apply Rao-Blackwellisation. Other improvements include the design of an optimal importance proposal distribution and being able to swap the sampling an selection steps to handle outliers. We focus on sequential binary classifiers that consist of linear combinations of basis functions , whose coefficients evolve according to a Gaussian smoothness prior. Our results show significant improvements. 1</p><p>4 0.21955265 <a title="163-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>5 0.19902562 <a title="163-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Tempo_tracking_and_rhythm_quantization_by_sequential_Monte_Carlo.html">179 nips-2001-Tempo tracking and rhythm quantization by sequential Monte Carlo</a></p>

The structure of the proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model. We formulate two well known music recognition problems, namely tempo tracking and automatic transcription (rhythm quantization) as filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) state estimation tasks. The inferences are carried out using sequential Monte Carlo integration (particle filtering) techniques. For this purpose, we have derived a novel Viterbi algorithm for Rao-Blackwellized particle filters, where a subset of the hidden variables is integrated out. The resulting model is suitable for realtime tempo tracking and transcription and hence useful in a number of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment and score typesetting. 1</p><p>6 0.14476344 <a title="163-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2001-On the Generalization Ability of On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We develop a tree-based reparameterization framework that provides a new conceptual view of a large class of iterative algorithms for computing approximate marginals in graphs with cycles. It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP /BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP /BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g. , 1, 2]. 1</p><p>3 0.79472733 <a title="163-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Efficient_Resources_Allocation_for_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">67 nips-2001-Efficient Resources Allocation for Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: It is desirable that a complex decision-making problem in an uncertain world be adequately modeled by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) whose structural representation is adaptively designed by a parsimonious resources allocation process. Resources include time and cost of exploration, amount of memory and computational time allowed for the policy or value function representation. Concerned about making the best use of the available resources, we address the problem of efficiently estimating where adding extra resources is highly needed in order to improve the expected performance of the resulting policy. Possible application in reinforcement learning (RL) , when real-world exploration is highly costly, concerns the detection of those areas of the state-space that need primarily to be explored in order to improve the policy. Another application concerns approximation of continuous state-space stochastic control problems using adaptive discretization techniques for which highly efficient grid points allocation is mandatory to survive high dimensionality. Maybe surprisingly these two problems can be formulated under a common framework: for a given resource allocation, which defines a belief state over possible MDPs, find where adding new resources (thus decreasing the uncertainty of some parameters -transition probabilities or rewards) will most likely increase the expected performance of the new policy. To do so, we use sampling techniques for estimating the contribution of each parameter's probability distribution function (Pdf) to the expected loss of using an approximate policy (such as the optimal policy of the most probable MDP) instead of the true (but unknown) policy.</p><p>4 0.7945357 <a title="163-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Steering_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Reinforcement_Learning.html">187 nips-2001-The Steering Approach for Multi-Criteria Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>5 0.79345256 <a title="163-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Multiagent_Planning_with_Factored_MDPs.html">128 nips-2001-Multiagent Planning with Factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>6 0.79309243 <a title="163-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_via_Linear_Programming.html">36 nips-2001-Approximate Dynamic Programming via Linear Programming</a></p>

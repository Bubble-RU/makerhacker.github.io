<p>Author: Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: The marriage of Renyi entropy with Parzen density estimation has been shown to be a viable tool in learning discriminative feature transforms. However, it suffers from computational complexity proportional to the square of the number of samples in the training data. This sets a practical limit to using large databases. We suggest immediate divorce of the two methods and remarriage of Renyi entropy with a semi-parametric density estimation method, such as a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). This allows all of the computation to take place in the low dimensional target space, and it reduces computational complexity proportional to square of the number of components in the mixtures. Furthermore, a convenient extension to Hidden Markov Models as commonly used in speech recognition becomes possible.</p><p>4 0.057437491 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Partially_labeled_classification_with_Markov_random_walks.html">144 nips-2001-Partially labeled classification with Markov random walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the unlabeled examples. The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classiﬁcation with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classiﬁcation. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classiﬁcation problems.</p><p>5 0.053336244 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Convergence_of_Leveraging.html">137 nips-2001-On the Convergence of Leveraging</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Mika, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We give an uniﬁed convergence analysis of ensemble learning methods including e.g. AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and the Least-SquareBoost algorithm for regression. These methods have in common that they iteratively call a base learning algorithm which returns hypotheses that are then linearly combined. We show that these methods are related to the Gauss-Southwell method known from numerical optimization and state non-asymptotical convergence results for all these methods. Our analysis includes -norm regularized cost functions leading to a clean and general way to regularize ensemble learning.</p><p>6 0.05054114 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Human_Motion_Models.html">193 nips-2001-Unsupervised Learning of Human Motion Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Song, Luis Goncalves, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm that can derive the probabilistic dependence structure of parts of an object (a moving human body in our examples) automatically from unlabeled data. The distinguished part of this work is that it is based on unlabeled data, i.e., the training features include both useful foreground parts and background clutter and the correspondence between the parts and detected features are unknown. We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algorithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables. The success of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled real image sequences.</p><p>5 0.36536977 <a title="64-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Active_Learning_in_the_Drug_Discovery_Process.html">25 nips-2001-Active Learning in the Drug Discovery Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth, Gunnar Rätsch, Michael Mathieson, Jun Liao, Christian Lemmen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the following data mining problem from Computational Chemistry: From a large data set of compounds, ﬁnd those that bind to a target molecule in as few iterations of biological testing as possible. In each iteration a comparatively small batch of compounds is screened for binding to the target. We apply active learning techniques for selecting the successive batches. One selection strategy picks unlabeled examples closest to the maximum margin hyperplane. Another produces many weight vectors by running perceptrons over multiple permutations of the data. Each weight vector votes with its prediction and we pick the unlabeled examples for which the prediction is most evenly split between and . For a third selection strategy note that each unlabeled example bisects the version space of consistent weight vectors. We estimate the volume on both sides of the split by bouncing a billiard through the version space and select unlabeled examples that cause the most even split of the version space. We demonstrate that on two data sets provided by DuPont Pharmaceuticals that all three selection strategies perform comparably well and are much better than selecting random batches for testing. § © ¨</p><p>6 0.36164436 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Noisy_Euclidean_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_and_Learning.html">186 nips-2001-The Noisy Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem and Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>4 0.51190943 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Kernel_Methods_for_Clustering.html">170 nips-2001-Spectral Kernel Methods for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor, Jaz S. Kandola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce new algorithms for unsupervised learning based on the use of a kernel matrix. All the information required by such algorithms is contained in the eigenvectors of the matrix or of closely related matrices. We use two different but related cost functions, the Alignment and the 'cut cost'. The first one is discussed in a companion paper [3], the second one is based on graph theoretic concepts. Both functions measure the level of clustering of a labeled dataset, or the correlation between data clusters and labels. We state the problem of unsupervised learning as assigning labels so as to optimize these cost functions. We show how the optimal solution can be approximated by slightly relaxing the corresponding optimization problem, and how this corresponds to using eigenvector information. The resulting simple algorithms are tested on real world data with positive results. 1</p><p>5 0.49726373 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well.

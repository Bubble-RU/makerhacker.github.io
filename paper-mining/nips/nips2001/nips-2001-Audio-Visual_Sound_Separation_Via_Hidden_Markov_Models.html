<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Trausti T. Kristjansson, Li Deng, Alex Acero</p><p>Abstract: A challenging, unsolved problem in the speech recognition community is recognizing speech signals that are corrupted by loud, highly nonstationary noise. One approach to noisy speech recognition is to automatically remove the noise from the cepstrum sequence before feeding it in to a clean speech recognizer. In previous work published in Eurospeech, we showed how a probability model trained on clean speech and a separate probability model trained on noise could be combined for the purpose of estimating the noisefree speech from the noisy speech. We showed how an iterative 2nd order vector Taylor series approximation could be used for probabilistic inference in this model. In many circumstances, it is not possible to obtain examples of noise without speech. Noise statistics may change significantly during an utterance, so that speechfree frames are not sufficient for estimating the noise model. In this paper, we show how the noise model can be learned even when the data contains speech. In particular, the noise model can be learned from the test utterance and then used to de noise the test utterance. The approximate inference technique is used as an approximate E step in a generalized EM algorithm that learns the parameters of the noise model from a test utterance. For both Wall Street J ournal data with added noise samples and the Aurora benchmark, we show that the new noise adaptive technique performs as well as or significantly better than the non-adaptive algorithm, without the need for a separate training set of noise examples. 1</p><p>3 0.25009638 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Sequence_Kernel_and_its_Application_to_Speaker_Recognition.html">20 nips-2001-A Sequence Kernel and its Application to Speaker Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach for comparing sequences of observations using an explicit-expansion kernel is demonstrated. The kernel is derived using the assumption of the independence of the sequence of observations and a mean-squared error training criterion.

The explicit expansion also preserves the computational advantages of an earlier architecture based on mean-squared error training.

<p>Author: N. Smith, Mark Gales</p><p>Abstract: An important issue in applying SVMs to speech recognition is the ability to classify variable length sequences. This paper presents extensions to a standard scheme for handling this variable length data, the Fisher score. A more useful mapping is introduced based on the likelihood-ratio. The score-space defined by this mapping avoids some limitations of the Fisher score. Class-conditional generative models are directly incorporated into the definition of the score-space. The mapping, and appropriate normalisation schemes, are evaluated on a speaker-independent isolated letter task where the new mapping outperforms both the Fisher score and HMMs trained to maximise likelihood. 1</p><p>5 0.21948379 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Dynamic_Time-Alignment_Kernel_in_Support_Vector_Machine.html">63 nips-2001-Dynamic Time-Alignment Kernel in Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroshi Shimodaira, Ken-ichi Noma, Mitsuru Nakai, Shigeki Sagayama</p><p>Abstract: A new class of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is applicable to sequential-pattern recognition such as speech recognition is developed by incorporating an idea of non-linear time alignment into the kernel function. Since the time-alignment operation of sequential pattern is embedded in the new kernel function, standard SVM training and classiﬁcation algorithms can be employed without further modiﬁcations. The proposed SVM (DTAK-SVM) is evaluated in speaker-dependent speech recognition experiments of hand-segmented phoneme recognition. Preliminary experimental results show comparable recognition performance with hidden Markov models (HMMs). 1</p><p>6 0.20499873 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_with_Missing_Data_using_Recurrent_Neural_Nets.html">173 nips-2001-Speech Recognition with Missing Data using Recurrent Neural Nets</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Yao, S. Nakamura</p><p>Abstract: We present a sequential Monte Carlo method applied to additive noise compensation for robust speech recognition in time-varying noise. The method generates a set of samples according to the prior distribution given by clean speech models and noise prior evolved from previous estimation. An explicit model representing noise effects on speech features is used, so that an extended Kalman ﬁlter is constructed for each sample, generating the updated continuous state estimate as the estimation of the noise parameter, and prediction likelihood for weighting each sample. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) inference of the time-varying noise parameter is carried out over these samples by fusion the estimation of samples according to their weights. A residual resampling selection step and a Metropolis-Hastings smoothing step are used to improve calculation eﬃciency. Experiments were conducted on speech recognition in simulated non-stationary noises, where noise power changed artiﬁcially, and highly non-stationary Machinegun noise. In all the experiments carried out, we observed that the method can have signiﬁcant recognition performance improvement, over that achieved by noise compensation with stationary noise assumption. 1</p><p>4 0.75939375 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_with_Missing_Data_using_Recurrent_Neural_Nets.html">173 nips-2001-Speech Recognition with Missing Data using Recurrent Neural Nets</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Parveen, P. Green</p><p>Abstract: In the ‘missing data’ approach to improving the robustness of automatic speech recognition to added noise, an initial process identiﬁes spectraltemporal regions which are dominated by the speech source. The remaining regions are considered to be ‘missing’. In this paper we develop a connectionist approach to the problem of adapting speech recognition to the missing data case, using Recurrent Neural Networks. In contrast to methods based on Hidden Markov Models, RNNs allow us to make use of long-term time constraints and to make the problems of classiﬁcation with incomplete data and imputing missing values interact. We report encouraging results on an isolated digit recognition task.</p><p>5 0.49935931 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Sequence_Kernel_and_its_Application_to_Speaker_Recognition.html">20 nips-2001-A Sequence Kernel and its Application to Speaker Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: J. Bi, Kristin P. Bennett</p><p>Abstract: We develop an intuitive geometric framework for support vector regression (SVR). By examining when -tubes exist, we show that SVR can be regarded as a classiﬁcation problem in the dual space. Hard and soft -tubes are constructed by separating the convex or reduced convex hulls respectively of the training data with the response variable shifted up and down by . A novel SVR model is proposed based on choosing the max-margin plane between the two shifted datasets. Maximizing the margin corresponds to shrinking the eﬀective -tube. In the proposed approach the eﬀects of the choices of all parameters become clear geometrically. 1</p><p>3 0.58731943 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Relative_Density_Nets%3A_A_New_Way_to_Combine_Backpropagation_with_HMM%27s.html">162 nips-2001-Relative Density Nets: A New Way to Combine Backpropagation with HMM's</a></p>

This approach allows us to account for some surprising temporal effects in the second order conditioning experiments of Miller et al. [1 , 2, 3], which other models are unable to explain. 1</p><p>5 0.57815504 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The most popular algorithms for object detection require the use of exhaustive spatial and scale search procedures. In such approaches, an object is defined by means of local features. fu this paper we show that including contextual information in object detection procedures provides an efficient way of cutting down the need for exhaustive search. We present results with real images showing that the proposed scheme is able to accurately predict likely object classes, locations and sizes. 1</p><p>6 0.5771687 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">183 nips-2001-The Infinite Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

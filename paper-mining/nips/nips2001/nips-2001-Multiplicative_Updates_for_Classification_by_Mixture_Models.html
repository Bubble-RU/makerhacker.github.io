In this paper, we present a general greedy algorithm for solving a class of convex optimization problems.

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Samy Bengio, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are currently the state-of-the-art models for many classification problems but they suffer from the complexity of their training algorithm which is at least quadratic with respect to the number of examples. Hence, it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundreds of thousands examples with SVMs. The present paper proposes a new mixture of SVMs that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each SVM is trained on a small subset of the whole dataset. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (Forest) as well as a difficult speech database , yielded significant time improvement (time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples) . In addition, and that is a surprise, a significant improvement in generalization was observed on Forest. 1</p><p>4 0.14734145 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Generalization_of_Principal_Components_Analysis_to_the_Exponential_Family.html">9 nips-2001-A Generalization of Principal Components Analysis to the Exponential Family</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Collins, S. Dasgupta, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly applied technique for dimensionality reduction. PCA implicitly minimizes a squared loss function, which may be inappropriate for data that is not real-valued, such as binary-valued data. This paper draws on ideas from the Exponential family, Generalized linear models, and Bregman distances, to give a generalization of PCA to loss functions that we argue are better suited to other data types. We describe algorithms for minimizing the loss functions, and give examples on simulated data.</p><p>5 0.14649202 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>6 0.13374415 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Global_Coordination_of_Local_Linear_Models.html">84 nips-2001-Global Coordination of Local Linear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: The marriage of Renyi entropy with Parzen density estimation has been shown to be a viable tool in learning discriminative feature transforms. However, it suffers from computational complexity proportional to the square of the number of samples in the training data. This sets a practical limit to using large databases. We suggest immediate divorce of the two methods and remarriage of Renyi entropy with a semi-parametric density estimation method, such as a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). This allows all of the computation to take place in the low dimensional target space, and it reduces computational complexity proportional to square of the number of components in the mixtures. Furthermore, a convenient extension to Hidden Markov Models as commonly used in speech recognition becomes possible.</p><p>3 0.72987455 <a title="129-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Product_Analysis%3A_Learning_to_Model_Observations_as_Products_of_Hidden_Variables.html">153 nips-2001-Product Analysis: Learning to Model Observations as Products of Hidden Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widelyheld belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster. 1</p><p>5 0.68389302 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Estimating_Car_Insurance_Premia%3A_a_Case_Study_in_High-Dimensional_Data_Inference.html">70 nips-2001-Estimating Car Insurance Premia: a Case Study in High-Dimensional Data Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Chapados, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Joumana Ghosn, Charles Dugas, Ichiro Takeuchi, Linyan Meng</p><p>Abstract: Estimating insurance premia from data is a difficult regression problem for several reasons: the large number of variables, many of which are .discrete, and the very peculiar shape of the noise distribution, asymmetric with fat tails, with a large majority zeros and a few unreliable and very large values. We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers. 1</p><p>6 0.6515885 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_Predictive_Profiles_With_Applications_to_Retail_Transaction_Data.html">41 nips-2001-Bayesian Predictive Profiles With Applications to Retail Transaction Data</a></p>

However, this information can be greatly suppressed by long range correlations. Here we study the efﬁciency of coding information in the second order statistics of the population responses. We show that the Fisher Information of this system grows linearly with the size of the system. We propose a bilinear readout model for extracting information from correlation codes, and evaluate its performance in discrimination and estimation tasks. It is shown that the main source of information in this system is the stimulus dependence of the variances of the single neuron responses.</p><p>3 0.9954344 <a title="129-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Kernel_Logistic_Regression_and_the_Import_Vector_Machine.html">104 nips-2001-Kernel Logistic Regression and the Import Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Ji Zhu, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) is known for its good performance in binary classiﬁcation, but its extension to multi-class classiﬁcation is still an on-going research issue. In this paper, we propose a new approach for classiﬁcation, called the import vector machine (IVM), which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR). We show that the IVM not only performs as well as the SVM in binary classiﬁcation, but also can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar to the “support points” of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This gives the IVM a computational advantage over the SVM, especially when the size of the training data set is large.</p><p>4 0.99493504 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Constructing_Distributed_Representations_Using_Additive_Clustering.html">53 nips-2001-Constructing Distributed Representations Using Additive Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Wheeler Ruml</p><p>Abstract: If the promise of computational modeling is to be fully realized in higherlevel cognitive domains such as language processing, principled methods must be developed to construct the semantic representations used in such models. In this paper, we propose the use of an established formalism from mathematical psychology, additive clustering, as a means of automatically constructing binary representations for objects using only pairwise similarity data. However, existing methods for the unsupervised learning of additive clustering models do not scale well to large problems. We present a new algorithm for additive clustering, based on a novel heuristic technique for combinatorial optimization. The algorithm is simpler than previous formulations and makes fewer independence assumptions. Extensive empirical tests on both human and synthetic data suggest that it is more effective than previous methods and that it also scales better to larger problems. By making additive clustering practical, we take a signiﬁcant step toward scaling connectionist models beyond hand-coded examples.</p><p>5 0.99443877 <a title="129-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Convolution_Kernels_for_Natural_Language.html">56 nips-2001-Convolution Kernels for Natural Language</a></p>

We show how a kernel over trees can be applied to parsing using the voted perceptron algorithm, and we give experimental results on the ATIS corpus of parse trees.</p><p>6 0.99401754 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Characterizing_Neural_Gain_Control_using_Spike-triggered_Covariance.html">48 nips-2001-Characterizing Neural Gain Control using Spike-triggered Covariance</a></p>

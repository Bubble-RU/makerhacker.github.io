<p>Author: Yang Song, Luis Goncalves, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm that can derive the probabilistic dependence structure of parts of an object (a moving human body in our examples) automatically from unlabeled data. The distinguished part of this work is that it is based on unlabeled data, i.e., the training features include both useful foreground parts and background clutter and the correspondence between the parts and detected features are unknown. We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algorithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables. The success of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled real image sequences.</p><p>3 0.093960367 <a title="108-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Product_Analysis%3A_Learning_to_Model_Observations_as_Products_of_Hidden_Variables.html">153 nips-2001-Product Analysis: Learning to Model Observations as Products of Hidden Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Bernd Heisele, Thomas Serre, Massimiliano Pontil, Thomas Vetter, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithm for automatically learning discriminative components of objects with SVM classiﬁers. It is based on growing image parts by minimizing theoretical bounds on the error probability of an SVM. Component-based face classiﬁers are then combined in a second stage to yield a hierarchical SVM classiﬁer. Experimental results in face classiﬁcation show considerable robustness against rotations in depth and suggest performance at signiﬁcantly better level than other face detection systems. Novel aspects of our approach are: a) an algorithm to learn component-based classiﬁcation experts and their combination, b) the use of 3-D morphable models for training, and c) a maximum operation on the output of each component classiﬁer which may be relevant for biological models of visual recognition.</p><p>5 0.089132003 <a title="108-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The most popular algorithms for object detection require the use of exhaustive spatial and scale search procedures. In such approaches, an object is defined by means of local features. fu this paper we show that including contextual information in object detection procedures provides an efficient way of cutting down the need for exhaustive search. We present results with real images showing that the proposed scheme is able to accurately predict likely object classes, locations and sizes. 1</p><p>6 0.088083521 <a title="108-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Michael L. Littman, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: The rule-based bootstrapping introduced by Yarowsky, and its cotraining variant by Blum and Mitchell, have met with considerable empirical success. Earlier work on the theory of co-training has been only loosely related to empirically useful co-training algorithms. Here we give a new PAC-style bound on generalization error which justiﬁes both the use of conﬁdences — partial rules and partial labeling of the unlabeled data — and the use of an agreement-based objective function as suggested by Collins and Singer. Our bounds apply to the multiclass case, i.e., where instances are to be assigned one of labels for . £ ¡ ¤¢</p><p>5 0.52101809 <a title="108-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-ACh%2C_Uncertainty%2C_and_Cortical_Inference.html">3 nips-2001-ACh, Uncertainty, and Cortical Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Acetylcholine (ACh) has been implicated in a wide variety of tasks involving attentional processes and plasticity. Following extensive animal studies, it has previously been suggested that ACh reports on uncertainty and controls hippocampal, cortical and cortico-amygdalar plasticity. We extend this view and consider its effects on cortical representational inference, arguing that ACh controls the balance between bottom-up inference, inﬂuenced by input stimuli, and top-down inference, inﬂuenced by contextual information. We illustrate our proposal using a hierarchical hidden Markov model.</p><p>6 0.51052034 <a title="108-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_principles_in_unsupervised_learning_of_visual_structure%3A_human_data_and_a_model.html">151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</a></p>

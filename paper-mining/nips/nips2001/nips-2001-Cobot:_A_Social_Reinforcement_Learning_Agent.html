<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>3 0.11220075 <a title="51-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>4 0.10054266 <a title="51-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Rates_of_Convergence_of_Performance_Gradient_Estimates_Using_Function_Approximation_and_Bias_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">157 nips-2001-Rates of Convergence of Performance Gradient Estimates Using Function Approximation and Bias in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: S. Koenig, M. Likhachev</p><p>Abstract: Incremental search techniques ﬁnd optimal solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. While researchers have developed incremental versions of uninformed search methods, we develop an incremental version of A*. The ﬁrst search of Lifelong Planning A* is the same as that of A* but all subsequent searches are much faster because it reuses those parts of the previous search tree that are identical to the new search tree. We then present experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of Lifelong Planning A* for simple route planning tasks. 1 Overview Artiﬁcial intelligence has investigated knowledge-based search techniques that allow one to solve search tasks in large domains. Most of the research on these methods has studied how to solve one-shot search problems. However, search is often a repetitive process, where one needs to solve a series of similar search tasks, for example, because the actual situation turns out to be slightly different from the one initially assumed or because the situation changes over time. An example for route planning tasks are changing trafﬁc conditions. Thus, one needs to replan for the new situation, for example if one always wants to display the least time-consuming route from the airport to the conference center on a web page. In these situations, most search methods replan from scratch, that is, solve the search problems independently. Incremental search techniques share with case-based planning, plan adaptation, repair-based planning, and learning search-control knowledge the property that they ﬁnd solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. Incremental search techniques, however, differ from the other techniques in that the quality of their solutions is guaranteed to be as good as the quality of the solutions obtained by replanning from scratch. Although incremental search methods are not widely known in artiﬁcial intelligence and control, different researchers have developed incremental search versions of uninformed search methods in the algorithms literature. An overview can be found in [FMSN00]. We, on the other hand, develop an incremental version of A*, thus combining ideas from the algorithms literature and the artiﬁcial intelligence literature. We call the algorithm Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), in analogy to “lifelong learning” [Thr98], because it reuses £ We thank Anthony Stentz for his support.

LPA* uses heuristics to focus the search and always ﬁnds a shortest path for the current edge costs. The ﬁrst search of LPA* is the same as that of A* but all subsequent searches are much faster. LPA* produces at least the search tree that A* builds. However, it achieves a substantial speedup over A* because it reuses those parts of the previous search tree that are identical to the new search tree. 2 The Route Planning Task Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) solves the following search task: It applies to ﬁnite graph search problems on known graphs whose edge costs can increase or decrease over time. denotes the ﬁnite set of vertices of the graph. denotes the set of successors of vertex .

Our initial work on Cobot (Isbell et al.2000) provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users. Here we describe an application of RL allowing Cobot to take proactive actions in this complex social environment, and adapt behavior from multiple sources of human reward. After 5 months of training, and 3171 reward and punishment events from 254 different LambdaMOO users, Cobot learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users, modiﬁng his behavior based on his current state. Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.55648375 <a title="51-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_via_Linear_Programming.html">36 nips-2001-Approximate Dynamic Programming via Linear Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>5 0.54523855 <a title="51-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised_Particle_Filtering_via_Data_Augmentation.html">156 nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering via Data Augmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christophe Andrieu, Nando D. Freitas, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering method to more complex hybrid models consisting of Gaussian latent variables and discrete observations. This is accomplished by augmenting the models with artificial variables that enable us to apply Rao-Blackwellisation. Other improvements include the design of an optimal importance proposal distribution and being able to swap the sampling an selection steps to handle outliers. We focus on sequential binary classifiers that consist of linear combinations of basis functions , whose coefficients evolve according to a Gaussian smoothness prior. Our results show significant improvements. 1</p><p>6 0.54111362 <a title="51-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>

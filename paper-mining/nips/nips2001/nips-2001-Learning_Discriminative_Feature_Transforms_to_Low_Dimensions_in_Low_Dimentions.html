<p>Author: Lawrence K. Saul, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a learning algorithm for the classiﬁcation of nonnegative data by mixture models. Multiplicative update rules are derived that directly optimize the performance of these models as classiﬁers. The update rules have a simple closed form and an intuitive appeal. Our algorithm retains the main virtues of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm—its guarantee of monotonic improvement, and its absence of tuning parameters—with the added advantage of optimizing a discriminative objective function. The algorithm reduces as a special case to the method of generalized iterative scaling for log-linear models. The learning rate of the algorithm is controlled by the sparseness of the training data. We use the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to discover sparse distributed representations of the data. This form of feature selection greatly accelerates learning and makes the algorithm practical on large problems. Experiments show that discriminatively trained mixture models lead to much better classiﬁcation than comparably sized models trained by EM. 1</p><p>4 0.11795779 <a title="109-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_using_SVMs.html">172 nips-2001-Speech Recognition using SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: N. Smith, Mark Gales</p><p>Abstract: An important issue in applying SVMs to speech recognition is the ability to classify variable length sequences. This paper presents extensions to a standard scheme for handling this variable length data, the Fisher score. A more useful mapping is introduced based on the likelihood-ratio. The score-space defined by this mapping avoids some limitations of the Fisher score. Class-conditional generative models are directly incorporated into the definition of the score-space. The mapping, and appropriate normalisation schemes, are evaluated on a speaker-independent isolated letter task where the new mapping outperforms both the Fisher score and HMMs trained to maximise likelihood. 1</p><p>5 0.11113907 <a title="109-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Audio-Visual_Sound_Separation_Via_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">39 nips-2001-Audio-Visual Sound Separation Via Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Michael Casey</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that under noisy conditions we can hear speech much more clearly when we read the speaker's lips. This suggests the utility of audio-visual information for the task of speech enhancement. We propose a method to exploit audio-visual cues to enable speech separation under non-stationary noise and with a single microphone. We revise and extend HMM-based speech enhancement techniques, in which signal and noise models are factori ally combined, to incorporate visual lip information and employ novel signal HMMs in which the dynamics of narrow-band and wide band components are factorial. We avoid the combinatorial explosion in the factorial model by using a simple approximate inference technique to quickly estimate the clean signals in a mixture. We present a preliminary evaluation of this approach using a small-vocabulary audio-visual database, showing promising improvements in machine intelligibility for speech enhanced using audio and visual information. 1</p><p>6 0.10579603 <a title="109-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Product_Analysis%3A_Learning_to_Model_Observations_as_Products_of_Hidden_Variables.html">153 nips-2001-Product Analysis: Learning to Model Observations as Products of Hidden Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Qi Zhang, Sally A. Goldman</p><p>Abstract: We present a new multiple-inst ance (MI) learning technique (EMDD) that combines EM with the diverse density (DD) algorithm. EM-DD is a general-purpose MI algorithm that can be applied with boolean or real-value labels and makes real-value predictions. On the boolean Musk benchmarks, the EM-DD algorithm without any tuning significantly outperforms all previous algorithms. EM-DD is relatively insensitive to the number of relevant attributes in the data set and scales up well to large bag sizes. Furthermore, EMDD provides a new framework for MI learning, in which the MI problem is converted to a single-instance setting by using EM to estimate the instance responsible for the label of the bag. 1</p><p>3 0.63197887 <a title="109-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Product_Analysis%3A_Learning_to_Model_Observations_as_Products_of_Hidden_Variables.html">153 nips-2001-Product Analysis: Learning to Model Observations as Products of Hidden Variables</a></p>

Gibbs sampling is used to compute average trajectories, which estimate the underlying structure common to all instances. This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between permutations and tours. In a learning setting, the average trajectory is used as a model to construct solutions to new instances sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to a single instance. 1</p><p>2 0.93858677 <a title="109-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Asymptotic_Universality_for_Learning_Curves_of_Support_Vector_Machines.html">38 nips-2001-Asymptotic Universality for Learning Curves of Support Vector Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Alberto Paccanaro, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), a new method of learning a distributed representation of concepts from data consisting of instances of relations between given concepts. Its ﬁnal goal is to be able to generalize, i.e. infer new instances of these relations among the concepts. On a task involving family relationships we show that LRE can generalize better than any previously published method. We then show how LRE can be used effectively to ﬁnd compact distributed representations for variable-sized recursive data structures, such as trees and lists. 1 Linear Relational Embedding Our aim is to take a large set of facts about a domain expressed as tuples of arbitrary symbols in a simple and rigid syntactic format and to be able to infer other “common-sense” facts without having any prior knowledge about the domain. Let us imagine a situation in which we have a set of concepts and a set of relations among these concepts, and that our data consists of few instances of these relations that hold among the concepts. We want to be able to infer other instances of these relations. For example, if the concepts are the people in a certain family, the relations are kinship relations, and we are given the facts ”Alberto has-father Pietro” and ”Pietro has-brother Giovanni”, we would like to be able to infer ”Alberto has-uncle Giovanni”. Our approach is to learn appropriate distributed representations of the entities in the data, and then exploit the generalization properties of the distributed representations [2] to make the inferences. In this paper we present a method, which we have called Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), which learns a distributed representation for the concepts by embedding them in a space where the relations between concepts are linear transformations of their distributed representations. Let us consider the case in which all the relations are binary, i.e. involve two concepts. , and the problem In this case our data consists of triplets we are trying to solve is to infer missing triplets when we are given only few of them. Inferring a triplet is equivalent to being able to complete it, that is to come up with one of its elements, given the other two. Here we shall always try to complete the third element of the triplets 1 .

I derive approximations to the learning curves for the more generic case of mismatched models, and find very rich behaviour: For large input space dimensionality, where the results become exact, there are universal (student-independent) plateaux in the learning curve, with transitions in between that can exhibit arbitrarily many over-fitting maxima; over-fitting can occur even if the student estimates the teacher noise level correctly. In lower dimensions, plateaux also appear, and the learning curve remains dependent on the mismatch between student and teacher even in the asymptotic limit of a large number of training examples. Learning with excessively strong smoothness assumptions can be particularly dangerous: For example, a student with a standard radial basis function covariance function will learn a rougher teacher function only logarithmically slowly. All predictions are confirmed by simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.74987292 <a title="109-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Algorithmic_Luckiness.html">31 nips-2001-Algorithmic Luckiness</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Hahnloser, Xiaohui Xie, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: Integration in the head-direction system is a computation by which horizontal angular head velocity signals from the vestibular nuclei are integrated to yield a neural representation of head direction. In the thalamus, the postsubiculum and the mammillary nuclei, the head-direction representation has the form of a place code: neurons have a preferred head direction in which their ﬁring is maximal [Blair and Sharp, 1995, Blair et al., 1998, ?]. Integration is a difﬁcult computation, given that head-velocities can vary over a large range. Previous models of the head-direction system relied on the assumption that the integration is achieved in a ﬁring-rate-based attractor network with a ring structure. In order to correctly integrate head-velocity signals during high-speed head rotations, very fast synaptic dynamics had to be assumed. Here we address the question whether integration in the head-direction system is possible with slow synapses, for example excitatory NMDA and inhibitory GABA(B) type synapses. For neural networks with such slow synapses, rate-based dynamics are a good approximation of spiking neurons [Ermentrout, 1994]. We ﬁnd that correct integration during high-speed head rotations imposes strong constraints on possible network architectures.</p><p>4 0.20439968 <a title="82-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, E. J. Chichilnisky, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Spike-triggered averaging techniques are effective for linear characterization of neural responses. But neurons exhibit important nonlinear behaviors, such as gain control, that are not captured by such analyses. We describe a spike-triggered covariance method for retrieving suppressive components of the gain control signal in a neuron. We demonstrate the method in simulation and on retinal ganglion cell data. Analysis of physiological data reveals signiﬁcant suppressive axes and explains neural nonlinearities. This method should be applicable to other sensory areas and modalities. White noise analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing response properties of spiking neurons. A sequence of stimuli are drawn randomly from an ensemble and presented in rapid succession, and one examines the subset that elicit action potentials. This “spike-triggered” stimulus ensemble can provide information about the neuron’s response characteristics. In the most widely used form of this analysis, one estimates an excitatory linear kernel by computing the spike-triggered average (STA); that is, the mean stimulus that elicited a spike [e.g., 1, 2]. Under the assumption that spikes are generated by a Poisson process with instantaneous rate determined by linear projection onto a kernel followed by a static nonlinearity, the STA provides an unbiased estimate of this kernel [3]. Recently, a number of authors have developed interesting extensions of white noise analysis. Some have examined spike-triggered averages in a reduced linear subspace of input stimuli [e.g., 4]. Others have recovered excitatory subspaces, by computing the spiketriggered covariance (STC), followed by an eigenvector analysis to determine the subspace axes [e.g., 5, 6]. Sensory neurons exhibit striking nonlinear behaviors that are not explained by fundamentally linear mechanisms. For example, the response of a neuron typically saturates for large amplitude stimuli; the response to the optimal stimulus is often suppressed by the presence of a non-optimal mask [e.g., 7]; and the kernel recovered from STA analysis may change shape as a function of stimulus amplitude [e.g., 8, 9]. A variety of these nonlinear behaviors can be attributed to gain control [e.g., 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], in which neural responses are suppressively modulated by a gain signal derived from the stimulus. Although the underlying mechanisms and time scales associated with such gain control are current topics of research, the basic functional properties appear to be ubiquitous, occurring throughout the nervous system. a b 0 k0 0 Figure 1: Geometric depiction of spike-triggered analyses. a, Spike-triggered averaging with two-dimensional stimuli. Black points indicate raw stimuli. White points indicate stimuli eliciting a spike, and the STA (black vector), which provides an estimate of , corresponds to their center of mass. b, Spike-triggered covariance analysis of suppressive axes. Shown are a set of stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to the excitatory kernel, . Within the plane, stimuli eliciting a spike are concentrated in an elliptical region. The minor axis of the ellipse corresponds to a suppressive stimulus direction: stimuli with a signiﬁcant component along this axis are less likely to elicit spikes. The stimulus component along the major axis of the ellipse has no inﬂuence on spiking. ¢ £  ¡ ¢  ¡ Here we develop a white noise methodology for characterizing a neuron with gain control. We show that a set of suppressive kernels may be recovered by ﬁnding the eigenvectors of the spike-triggered covariance matrix associated with smallest variance. We apply the technique to electrophysiological data obtained from ganglion cells in salamander and macaque retina, and recover a set of axes that are shown to reduce responses in the neuron. Moreover, when we ﬁt a gain control model to the data using a maximum likelihood procedure within this subspace, the model accounts for changes in the STA as a function of contrast. 1 Characterizing suppressive axes ¤¥ As in all white noise approaches, we assume that stimuli correspond to vectors, , in some ﬁnite-dimensional space (e.g., a neighborhood of pixels or an interval of time samples). We assume a gain control model in which the probability of a stimulus eliciting a spike grows monotonically with the halfwave-rectiﬁed projection onto an excitatory linear kernel, , and is suppressively modulated by the fullwave-rectiﬁed projection onto a set of . linear kernels, ¨ ¤§  ¤¥    ©¤ §   ¨ ¤ ¥ ©¤ § ¦ First, we recover the excitatory kernel, . This is achieved by presenting spherically symmetric input stimuli (e.g., Gaussian white noise) to the neuron and computing the STA (Fig. 1a). STA correctly recovers the excitatory kernel, under the assumption that each of the gain control kernels are orthogonal (or equal) to the excitatory kernel. The proof is essentially the same as that given for recovering the kernel of a linear model followed by a monotonic nonlinearity [3]. In particular, any stimulus can be decomposed into a component in the direction of the excitatory kernel, and a component in a perpendicular direction. This can be paired with another stimulus that is identical, except that its component in the perpendicular direction is negated. The two stimuli are equally likely to occur in a spherically Gaussian stimulus set (since they are equidistant from the origin), and they are equally likely to elicit a spike (since their excitatory components are equal, and their rectiﬁed perpendicular components are equal). Their vector average lies in the direction of the excitatory kernel. Thus, the STA (which is an average over all such stimuli, or all such stimulus pairs) must also lie in that direction. In a subsequent section we explain how to Model: Retrieved: Excitatory: Excitatory: Eigenvalues: Suppressive: Suppressive: Weights Variance (eigenvalue) { 1.5 { 2{ 2.5 { 3{ 1 1 Arbitrary 0 Axis number 350 Figure 2: Estimation of kernels from a simulated model (equation 2).

Middle: STA (excitatory kernel) and eigenvectors (suppressive kernels) associated with the lowest eigenvalues. recover the excitatory kernel when it is not orthogonal to the suppressive kernels. Next, we recover the suppressive subspace, assuming the excitatory kernel is known. Consider the stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to this kernel. These stimuli all elicit the same response in the excitatory kernel, but they may produce different amounts of suppression. Figure 1b illustrates the behavior in a three-dimensional stimulus space, in which one axis is assumed to be suppressive. The distribution of raw stimuli on the plane is spherically symmetric about the origin. But the distribution of stimuli eliciting a spike is narrower along the suppressive direction: these stimuli have a component along the suppressive axis and are therefore less likely to elicit a spike. This behavior is easily generalized from this plane to the entire stimulus space. If we assume that the suppressive axes are ﬁxed, then we expect to see reductions in variance in the same directions for any level of numerator excitation. Given this behavior of the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble, we can recover the suppressive subspace using principal component analysis. We construct the sample covariance matrix of the stimuli eliciting a spike: £ §¥</p><p>6 0.15806589 <a title="82-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>

The stimulus component along the major axis of the ellipse has no inﬂuence on spiking. ¢ £  ¡ ¢  ¡ Here we develop a white noise methodology for characterizing a neuron with gain control. We show that a set of suppressive kernels may be recovered by ﬁnding the eigenvectors of the spike-triggered covariance matrix associated with smallest variance. We apply the technique to electrophysiological data obtained from ganglion cells in salamander and macaque retina, and recover a set of axes that are shown to reduce responses in the neuron. Moreover, when we ﬁt a gain control model to the data using a maximum likelihood procedure within this subspace, the model accounts for changes in the STA as a function of contrast. 1 Characterizing suppressive axes ¤¥ As in all white noise approaches, we assume that stimuli correspond to vectors, , in some ﬁnite-dimensional space (e.g., a neighborhood of pixels or an interval of time samples). We assume a gain control model in which the probability of a stimulus eliciting a spike grows monotonically with the halfwave-rectiﬁed projection onto an excitatory linear kernel, , and is suppressively modulated by the fullwave-rectiﬁed projection onto a set of . linear kernels, ¨ ¤§  ¤¥    ©¤ §   ¨ ¤ ¥ ©¤ § ¦ First, we recover the excitatory kernel, . This is achieved by presenting spherically symmetric input stimuli (e.g., Gaussian white noise) to the neuron and computing the STA (Fig. 1a). STA correctly recovers the excitatory kernel, under the assumption that each of the gain control kernels are orthogonal (or equal) to the excitatory kernel. The proof is essentially the same as that given for recovering the kernel of a linear model followed by a monotonic nonlinearity [3]. In particular, any stimulus can be decomposed into a component in the direction of the excitatory kernel, and a component in a perpendicular direction. This can be paired with another stimulus that is identical, except that its component in the perpendicular direction is negated. The two stimuli are equally likely to occur in a spherically Gaussian stimulus set (since they are equidistant from the origin), and they are equally likely to elicit a spike (since their excitatory components are equal, and their rectiﬁed perpendicular components are equal). Their vector average lies in the direction of the excitatory kernel. Thus, the STA (which is an average over all such stimuli, or all such stimulus pairs) must also lie in that direction. In a subsequent section we explain how to Model: Retrieved: Excitatory: Excitatory: Eigenvalues: Suppressive: Suppressive: Weights Variance (eigenvalue) { 1.5 { 2{ 2.5 { 3{ 1 1 Arbitrary 0 Axis number 350 Figure 2: Estimation of kernels from a simulated model (equation 2).

Middle: STA (excitatory kernel) and eigenvectors (suppressive kernels) associated with the lowest eigenvalues. recover the excitatory kernel when it is not orthogonal to the suppressive kernels. Next, we recover the suppressive subspace, assuming the excitatory kernel is known. Consider the stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to this kernel. These stimuli all elicit the same response in the excitatory kernel, but they may produce different amounts of suppression. Figure 1b illustrates the behavior in a three-dimensional stimulus space, in which one axis is assumed to be suppressive. The distribution of raw stimuli on the plane is spherically symmetric about the origin. But the distribution of stimuli eliciting a spike is narrower along the suppressive direction: these stimuli have a component along the suppressive axis and are therefore less likely to elicit a spike. This behavior is easily generalized from this plane to the entire stimulus space. If we assume that the suppressive axes are ﬁxed, then we expect to see reductions in variance in the same directions for any level of numerator excitation. Given this behavior of the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble, we can recover the suppressive subspace using principal component analysis. We construct the sample covariance matrix of the stimuli eliciting a spike: £ §¥</p><p>6 0.51752889 <a title="82-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Self-regulation_Mechanism_of_Temporally_Asymmetric_Hebbian_Plasticity.html">166 nips-2001-Self-regulation Mechanism of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Plasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Asymmetric lateral connections are one possible mechanism that can account for the direction selectivity of cortical neurons. We present a mathematical analysis for a class of these models. Contrasting with earlier theoretical work that has relied on methods from linear systems theory, we study the network’s nonlinear dynamic properties that arise when the threshold nonlinearity of the neurons is taken into account. We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatiotemporal periodicity. This predicts that if direction selectivity in the cortex is mainly achieved by asymmetric lateral connections lurching activity waves might be observable in ensembles of direction selective cortical neurons within appropriate regimes of the stimulus speed.</p><p>2 0.77276731 <a title="82-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Face_Recognition_Using_Kernel_Methods.html">74 nips-2001-Face Recognition Using Kernel Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis and Fisher Linear Discriminant methods have demonstrated their success in face detection, recognition, and tracking. The representation in these subspace methods is based on second order statistics of the image set, and does not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Recently Higher Order Statistics and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used as informative low dimensional representations for visual recognition. In this paper, we investigate the use of Kernel Principal Component Analysis and Kernel Fisher Linear Discriminant for learning low dimensional representations for face recognition, which we call Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods. While Eigenface and Fisherface methods aim to find projection directions based on the second order correlation of samples, Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods provide generalizations which take higher order correlations into account. We compare the performance of kernel methods with Eigenface, Fisherface and ICA-based methods for face recognition with variation in pose, scale, lighting and expression. Experimental results show that kernel methods provide better representations and achieve lower error rates for face recognition. 1 Motivation and Approach Subspace methods have been applied successfully in numerous visual recognition tasks such as face localization, face recognition, 3D object recognition, and tracking. In particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [20] [13] ,and Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) methods [6] have been applied to face recognition with impressive results. While PCA aims to extract a subspace in which the variance is maximized (or the reconstruction error is minimized), some unwanted variations (due to lighting, facial expressions, viewing points, etc.) may be retained (See [8] for examples). It has been observed that in face recognition the variations between the images of the same face due to illumination and viewing direction are almost always larger than image variations due to the changes in face identity [1]. Therefore, while the PCA projections are optimal in a correlation sense (or for reconstruction</p><p>3 0.76025605 <a title="82-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>4 0.74800837 <a title="82-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Discriminative_Direction_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">60 nips-2001-Discriminative Direction for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>5 0.7452597 <a title="82-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>6 0.74509472 <a title="82-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Effective_Size_of_Receptive_Fields_of_Inferior_Temporal_Visual_Cortex_Neurons_in_Natural_Scenes.html">65 nips-2001-Effective Size of Receptive Fields of Inferior Temporal Visual Cortex Neurons in Natural Scenes</a></p>

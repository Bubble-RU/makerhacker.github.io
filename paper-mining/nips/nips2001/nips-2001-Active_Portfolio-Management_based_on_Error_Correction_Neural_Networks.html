This allocation scheme distributes funds across various securities or ﬁnancial markets while simultaneously complying with speciﬁc allocation constraints which meet the requirements of an investor. The portfolio optimization algorithm is modeled by a feedforward neural network. The underlying expected return forecasts are based on error correction neural networks (ECNN), which utilize the last model error as an auxiliary input to evaluate their own misspeciﬁcation. The portfolio optimization is implemented such that (i.) the allocations comply with investor’s constraints and that (ii.) the risk of the portfolio can be controlled. We demonstrate the proﬁtability of our approach by constructing internationally diversiﬁed portfolios across different ﬁnancial markets of the G7 contries. It turns out, that our approach is superior to a preset benchmark portfolio. ¢ £¡ 1 Introduction: Portfolio-Management We integrate the portfolio optimization algorithm suggested by Black / Litterman [1] into a neural network architecture. Combining the mean-variance theory [5] with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [7], this approach utilizes excess returns of the CAPM equilibrium to deﬁne a neutral, well balanced benchmark portfolio. Deviations from the benchmark allocation are only allowed within preset boundaries. Hence, as an advantage, there are no unrealistic solutions (e. g. large short positions, huge portfolio changes). Moreover, there is no need of formulating return expectations for all assets. In contrast to Black / Litterman, excess return forecasts are estimated by time-delay recurrent error correction neural networks [8]. Investment decisions which comply with given allocation constraints are derived from these predictions. The risk exposure of the portfolio is implicitly controlled by a parameter-optimizing task over time (sec. 3 and 5). Our approach consists of the following three steps: (i.)

<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.055047441 <a title="26-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Kernel_Machines_and_Boolean_Functions.html">105 nips-2001-Kernel Machines and Boolean Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Kowalczyk, Alex J. Smola, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We give results about the learnability and required complexity of logical formulae to solve classiﬁcation problems. These results are obtained by linking propositional logic with kernel machines. In particular we show that decision trees and disjunctive normal forms (DNF) can be represented by the help of a special kernel, linking regularized risk to separation margin. Subsequently we derive a number of lower bounds on the required complexity of logic formulae using properties of algorithms for generation of linear estimators, such as perceptron and maximal perceptron learning.</p><p>5 0.051656198 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Online_Learning_with_Kernels.html">139 nips-2001-Online Learning with Kernels</a></p>

Our method is computationally efﬁcient and leads to simple algorithms. In particular we derive update equations for classiﬁcation, regression, and novelty detection. The inclusion of the -trick allows us to give a robust parameterization. Moreover, unlike in batch learning where the -trick only applies to the -insensitive loss function we are able to derive general trimmed-mean types of estimators such as for Huber’s robust loss.     ¡</p><p>6 0.041742157 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Computing_Time_Lower_Bounds_for_Recurrent_Sigmoidal_Neural_Networks.html">52 nips-2001-Computing Time Lower Bounds for Recurrent Sigmoidal Neural Networks</a></p>

The best policy depends on the current state of the switch and current trafﬁc patterns. This problem is hard because the state space, possible transitions, and set of actions all grow exponentially with the size of the switch. We present a reinforcement learning formulation of the problem that decomposes the value function into many small independent value functions and enables an efﬁcient action selection.</p><p>3 0.4334318 <a title="26-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2001-On the Generalization Ability of On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Chapados, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Joumana Ghosn, Charles Dugas, Ichiro Takeuchi, Linyan Meng</p><p>Abstract: Estimating insurance premia from data is a difficult regression problem for several reasons: the large number of variables, many of which are .discrete, and the very peculiar shape of the noise distribution, asymmetric with fat tails, with a large majority zeros and a few unreliable and very large values. We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers. 1</p><p>5 0.39433199 <a title="26-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Rotation_and_Translation_Invariant_Discrete_Saliency_Network.html">19 nips-2001-A Rotation and Translation Invariant Discrete Saliency Network</a></p>

Our work is different from all previous work in three important ways. First, like the input provided to V1 by LGN, the input to our computation is isotropic. That is, the input is composed of spots not edges. Second, our network computes a well deﬁned function of the input based on a distribution of closed contours characterized by a random process. Third, even though our computation is implemented in a discrete network, its output is invariant to continuous rotations and translations of the input pattern.</p><p>6 0.39322844 <a title="26-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Grammar_Transfer_in_a_Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network.html">85 nips-2001-Grammar Transfer in a Second Order Recurrent Neural Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Hans-Georg Zimmermann, Ralph Neuneier, Ralph Grothmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with a neural network architecture which establishes a portfolio management system similar to the Black / Litterman approach. This allocation scheme distributes funds across various securities or ﬁnancial markets while simultaneously complying with speciﬁc allocation constraints which meet the requirements of an investor. The portfolio optimization algorithm is modeled by a feedforward neural network. The underlying expected return forecasts are based on error correction neural networks (ECNN), which utilize the last model error as an auxiliary input to evaluate their own misspeciﬁcation. The portfolio optimization is implemented such that (i.) the allocations comply with investor’s constraints and that (ii.) the risk of the portfolio can be controlled. We demonstrate the proﬁtability of our approach by constructing internationally diversiﬁed portfolios across different ﬁnancial markets of the G7 contries. It turns out, that our approach is superior to a preset benchmark portfolio. ¢ £¡ 1 Introduction: Portfolio-Management We integrate the portfolio optimization algorithm suggested by Black / Litterman [1] into a neural network architecture. Combining the mean-variance theory [5] with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [7], this approach utilizes excess returns of the CAPM equilibrium to deﬁne a neutral, well balanced benchmark portfolio. Deviations from the benchmark allocation are only allowed within preset boundaries. Hence, as an advantage, there are no unrealistic solutions (e. g. large short positions, huge portfolio changes). Moreover, there is no need of formulating return expectations for all assets. In contrast to Black / Litterman, excess return forecasts are estimated by time-delay recurrent error correction neural networks [8]. Investment decisions which comply with given allocation constraints are derived from these predictions. The risk exposure of the portfolio is implicitly controlled by a parameter-optimizing task over time (sec. 3 and 5). Our approach consists of the following three steps: (i.) Construction of forecast models on the basis of error correction neural networks (ECNN) for all assets (sec. 2).   ¤§© © © § ¥ ¦¨¦¤ To whom correspondence should be addressed: Georg.Zimmermann@mchp.siemens.de.  ¤ ¤ (ii.)

<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: Vie sho,v the convergence of tV/O deterministic variants of Qlearning. The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>3 0.3740893 <a title="26-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.36953709 <a title="26-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>6 0.36856097 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Efficient_Resources_Allocation_for_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">67 nips-2001-Efficient Resources Allocation for Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

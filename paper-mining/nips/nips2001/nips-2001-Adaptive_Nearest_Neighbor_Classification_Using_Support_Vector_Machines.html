<p>Author: Pascal Vincent, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Guided by an initial idea of building a complex (non linear) decision surface with maximal local margin in input space, we give a possible geometrical intuition as to why K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms often perform more poorly than SVMs on classiﬁcation tasks. We then propose modiﬁed K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to overcome the perceived problem. The approach is similar in spirit to Tangent Distance, but with invariances inferred from the local neighborhood rather than prior knowledge. Experimental results on real world classiﬁcation tasks suggest that the modiﬁed KNN algorithms often give a dramatic improvement over standard KNN and perform as well or better than SVMs. 1 Motivation The notion of margin for classiﬁcation tasks has been largely popularized by the success of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) [2, 15] approach. The margin of SVMs has a nice geometric interpretation1: it can be deﬁned informally as (twice) the smallest Euclidean distance between the decision surface and the closest training point. The decision surface produced by the original SVM algorithm is the hyperplane that maximizes this distance while still correctly separating the two classes. While the notion of keeping the largest possible safety margin between the decision surface and the data points seems very reasonable and intuitively appealing, questions arise when extending the approach to building more complex, non-linear decision surfaces. Non-linear SVMs usually use the “kernel trick” to achieve their non-linearity. This conceptually corresponds to ﬁrst mapping the input into a higher-dimensional feature space with some non-linear transformation and building a maximum-margin hyperplane (a linear decision surface) there. The “trick” is that this mapping is never computed directly, but implicitly induced by a kernel. In this setting, the margin being maximized is still the smallest Euclidean distance between the decision surface and the training points, but this time measured in some strange, sometimes inﬁnite dimensional, kernel-induced feature space rather than the original input space. It is less clear whether maximizing the margin in this new space, is meaningful in general (see [16]). 1 for the purpose of this discussion, we consider the original hard-margin SVM algorithm for two linearly separable classes. A different approach is to try and build a non-linear decision surface with maximal distance to the closest data point as measured directly in input space (as proposed in [14]). We could for instance restrict ourselves to a certain class of decision functions and try to ﬁnd the function with maximal margin among this class. But let us take this even further. Extending the idea of building a correctly separating non-linear decision surface as far away as possible from the data points, we deﬁne the notion of local margin as the Euclidean distance, in input space, between a given point on the decision surface and the closest training point. Now would it be possible to ﬁnd an algorithm that could produce a decision surface which correctly separates the classes and such that the local margin is everywhere maximal along its surface? Surprisingly, the plain old Nearest Neighbor algorithm (1NN) [5] does precisely this! So why does 1NN in practice often perform worse than SVMs? One typical explanation, is that it has too much capacity, compared to SVM, that the class of function it can produce is too rich. But, considering it has inﬁnite capacity (VC-dimension), 1NN is still performing quite well... This study is an attempt to better understand what is happening, based on geometrical intuition, and to derive an improved Nearest Neighbor algorithm from this understanding. 2 Fixing a broken Nearest Neighbor algorithm 2.1 Setting and deﬁnitions The setting is that of a classical classiﬁcation problem in (the input space).  wx u  r i q ©</p><p>3 0.18482038 <a title="28-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Asymptotic_Universality_for_Learning_Curves_of_Support_Vector_Machines.html">38 nips-2001-Asymptotic Universality for Learning Curves of Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Robert Urbanczik</p><p>Abstract: Using methods of Statistical Physics, we investigate the rOle of model complexity in learning with support vector machines (SVMs). We show the advantages of using SVMs with kernels of infinite complexity on noisy target rules, which, in contrast to common theoretical beliefs, are found to achieve optimal generalization error although the training error does not converge to the generalization error. Moreover, we find a universal asymptotics of the learning curves which only depend on the target rule but not on the SVM kernel. 1</p><p>4 0.18322848 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Active_Information_Retrieval.html">24 nips-2001-Active Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Tommi Jaakkola, Hava T. Siegelmann</p><p>Abstract: In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>5 0.15072897 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Parallel_Mixture_of_SVMs_for_Very_Large_Scale_Problems.html">16 nips-2001-A Parallel Mixture of SVMs for Very Large Scale Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Samy Bengio, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are currently the state-of-the-art models for many classification problems but they suffer from the complexity of their training algorithm which is at least quadratic with respect to the number of examples. Hence, it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundreds of thousands examples with SVMs. The present paper proposes a new mixture of SVMs that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each SVM is trained on a small subset of the whole dataset. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (Forest) as well as a difficult speech database , yielded significant time improvement (time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples) . In addition, and that is a surprise, a significant improvement in generalization was observed on Forest. 1</p><p>6 0.13562556 <a title="28-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_using_SVMs.html">172 nips-2001-Speech Recognition using SVMs</a></p>

<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>4 0.63066959 <a title="28-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Escaping_the_Convex_Hull_with_Extrapolated_Vector_Machines.html">69 nips-2001-Escaping the Convex Hull with Extrapolated Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Haffner</p><p>Abstract: Maximum margin classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) critically depends upon the convex hulls of the training samples of each class, as they implicitly search for the minimum distance between the convex hulls. We propose Extrapolated Vector Machines (XVMs) which rely on extrapolations outside these convex hulls. XVMs improve SVM generalization very significantly on the MNIST [7] OCR data. They share similarities with the Fisher discriminant: maximize the inter-class margin while minimizing the intra-class disparity. 1</p><p>5 0.58845884 <a title="28-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-On_Discriminative_vs._Generative_Classifiers%3A_A_comparison_of_logistic_regression_and_naive_Bayes.html">133 nips-2001-On Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widelyheld belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster. 1</p><p>6 0.57063729 <a title="28-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Active_Learning_in_the_Drug_Discovery_Process.html">25 nips-2001-Active Learning in the Drug Discovery Process</a></p>

<p>Author: Michail G. Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efﬁcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly inﬂuenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We have tested LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efﬁciently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79963017 <a title="28-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Adaptive_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines.html">28 nips-2001-Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Classification Using Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlotta Domeniconi, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p><p>Abstract: The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classification problems. It relies on t he assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence of classification performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.74345231 <a title="28-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>4 0.74235564 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>5 0.74046195 <a title="28-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.73886991 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>

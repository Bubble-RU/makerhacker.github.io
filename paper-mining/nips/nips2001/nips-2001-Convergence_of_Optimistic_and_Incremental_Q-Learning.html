</p><p>13 We show the convergence of the widely used optimistic Q-Iearning, thus explaining and supporting the results observed in practice. [sent-33, score-0.409]
</p><p>14 Our second result is a new and novel deterministic algorithm incremental Qlearning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. [sent-34, score-0.525]
</p><p>15 We show that the frequency of sub-optimal actions vanishes, in the limit, and that the strategy defined by incremental Q-Iearning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy (rather than a near optimal policy). [sent-35, score-0.833]
</p><p>16 Another view of incremental Q-Iearning is as a derandomization of the E-greedy Q-Iearning. [sent-36, score-0.355]
</p><p>17 The E-greedy Qlearning performs the sub optimal action every liE times in expectation, while the incremental Q-learning performs sub optimal action every (Q(s, a(s)) - Q(s, b))jE times. [sent-37, score-1.088]

</p><p>22 In this work we focus on discounted return, which has a parameter, E (0,1), and the discounted return of policy 1f is VM== L:o ,trt , where Tt is the reward observed at time t. [sent-48, score-0.487]
</p><p>23 We define a value function for ~ach state s, under policy 1f, as VM(s) == E[L:o Ti,i] , where the expectation is over a run of policy 1f starting at state s, and a state-action (a)ViI(s/). [sent-52, score-0.815]

[sent-60, score-1.386]
</p><p>28 Also, [#(8, a, t)] is the number of times action a is performed in state 8 up to time t, Le. [sent-61, score-0.614]
</p><p>29 Finally, throughout the paper we assume that the MDP is a uni-chain (see [9]), namely that from every state we can reach any other state. [sent-63, score-0.246]
</p><p>30 A learning rate at is well-behaved if for every state action pair (s, a): (1) 2::1 at(8, a) == 00 and (2) 2::1o'. [sent-67, score-0.595]
</p><p>31 If the learning rate is well-behaved and every state action pair is performed infinitely often then Q-Learning converges to Q* with probability 1 (see [1, 11, 12, 8, 6]). [sent-69, score-1.11]
</p><p>32 The convergence of Q-Iearning holds using any exploration policy, and only requires that each state action pair is executed infinitely often. [sent-70, score-0.959]
</p><p>33 The greedy policy with respect to the Q-values tries to exploit continuously, however, since it does not explore properly, it might result in poor return. [sent-71, score-0.321]
</p><p>34 At the other extreme random policy continuously explores, but its actual return may be very poor. [sent-72, score-0.312]
</p><p>35 This policy executes the greedy policy with probability 1 - E and the random policy with probability E. [sent-74, score-0.791]
</p><p>36 This balance between exploration and exploitation both guarantees convergence and often good performance. [sent-75, score-0.181]

</p><p>54 Since ti :::; t, by the inductive hypothesis we have that V* (Si) - vt i (Si) :::; E, and therefore,  V* (s) - vt+l (s) :::; (1 - I')E + I'E ==  E. [sent-132, score-0.177]
</p><p>55 5 Consider optimistic Q-learning and let T == T((I-I')E,{)/\SIIAI) be the initialization time. [sent-137, score-0.421]
</p><p>56 With probability at least 1 - {) any state action pair (s, a)  that is executed infinitely often is E-optimal, i. [sent-138, score-0.911]
</p><p>57 Proof: Given a trajectory let U' be the set of state action pairs that are executed infinitely often, and let M' be the original MDP M restricted to U'. [sent-141, score-0.865]
</p><p>58 For M' we can use the classical convergence proofs, and claim that vt (s) converges to ViII (s ) and Qt(s, a), for (s, a) E U', converges to QMI (s, a), both with probability 1. [sent-142, score-0.523]
</p><p>59 Since (8, a) E U' is performed infinitely often it implies that Qt (s, a) converges to vt (s) == VM, (s) and therefore QM' (s, a) == ViII (s). [sent-143, score-0.645]
</p><p>60 Q*(s,a)}, then optimistic Q-Iearning converges to the optimal policy. [sent-152, score-0.497]
</p><p>61 For any constant ~, with probability at least 1 - {) there is a time T~ > T such that at any time t > T~ the strategy defined by the optimistic Q-learning is (E + ~)/(1 - ,)-optimal. [sent-155, score-0.547]
</p><p>62 6 Consider optimistic Q-learning and let T  5  Incremental Q-Iearning  In this section we describe a new algorithm that we call incremental Q-learning. [sent-157, score-0.624]
</p><p>63 Incremental Q-Iearning is a greedy policy with respect to the estimated Q-values plus a promotion term. [sent-159, score-0.53]
</p><p>64 The promotion term of a state-action pair (s, a) is promoted  each time the action a is not executed in state s, and zeroed each time action a is executed. [sent-160, score-1.171]
</p><p>65 We show that in incremental Q-Iearning every state-action pair is taken infinitely often, which implies standard convergence of the estimates. [sent-161, score-0.735]
</p><p>66 We show that the fraction of time in which sub-optimal actions are executed vanishes in the limit. [sent-162, score-0.312]
</p><p>67 This implies that the strategy defined by incremental Q-Iearning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. [sent-163, score-0.457]
</p><p>68 Incremental Q-Iearning estimates the Q-function as in Q-Iearning:  Qt+l(S, a) == (1 - (It(s, a))Qt(s, a)  + (It(s, a)(rt(s, a) + IVi(s/))  where Sl is the next state reached when performing action a in state s at time t. [sent-164, score-0.71]
</p><p>69 The promotion term At is define as follows:  A t+1 (s, a) == 0: t E Ts,a A t+1 (s, a) == At(s, a) + "p([#(s, a, t)]): t E Ts,not(a) A t+1 (s, a) == At(s, a): t E Tnot(s) , where "p(i) is a promotion junction which in our case depends only on the number of times we performed (s, a' ), al :j:. [sent-165, score-0.595]
</p><p>70 We say that a promotion function "p is well-behaved if: (1) The function "p converges to zero, Le. [sent-167, score-0.342]
</p><p>71 For example "p(i) == is well behaved promotion function. [sent-169, score-0.355]
</p><p>72 t  Incremental Q-Iearning is a greedy policy with respect to St(s, a) == Qt(s, a) + At(s, a). [sent-170, score-0.321]
</p><p>73 First we show that Qt, in incremental Q-Iearning, converges to Q*. [sent-171, score-0.416]
</p><p>74 1 Consider incremental Q-Iearning using a well-behaved learning rate and a well-behaved promotion function. [sent-173, score-0.556]
</p><p>75 Proof: Since the learning rate is well-behaved, we need only to show that each state  action pair is performed infinitely often. [sent-175, score-0.868]
</p><p>76 We show that each state that is visited infinitely often, all of its actions are performed infinitely often. [sent-176, score-0.909]
</p><p>77 Since the MDP is uni-chain this will imply that with probability 1 we reach all states infinitely often, which completes the proof. [sent-177, score-0.328]
</p><p>78 Since s is visited infinitely often, there has to be a non-empty subset of the actions AI which are performed infinitely often in s. [sent-179, score-0.77]
</p><p>79 Let tl be the last time that an action not in A' is performed in state s. [sent-182, score-0.627]
</p><p>80 Since"p is well behaved we have that 'ljJ(tl) is constant for a fixed tl , it implies that At(s, a) diverges for a fj. [sent-183, score-0.288]
</p><p>81 Therefore, eventually we reach a time t2 > tl such that A t2 (s, a) > Vmax , for every a fj. [sent-185, score-0.184]
</p><p>82 Since the actions in AI are performed infinitely often there is a time t3 > t 2 such that each action al E AI is performed at least once in [t2, ts]. [sent-187, score-0.928]
</p><p>83 Therefore, some action in a E A \ AI will be performed after t 1 , contradicting our assumption. [sent-190, score-0.333]
</p><p>84 The following lemma shows that the frequency of sub-optimal actions vanishes. [sent-194, score-0.34]
</p><p>85 2 Consider incremental Q-learning using a well behaved learning rate and a well behaved promotion function. [sent-196, score-0.848]
</p><p>86 Let a* be an optimal action in state s and a be a sub-optimal action. [sent-201, score-0.493]
</p><p>87 The leaning rate of both Incremantal and epsilon greedy Q-Iearning is set to 0. [sent-224, score-0.192]
</p><p>88 Qt(s, a*) converges to Q*(s, a*) == V*(s) and Qt(s, a) converges to Q*(s, a). [sent-227, score-0.266]
</p><p>89 Since the promotion function is well behaved, the number of time steps required until At(s, a) changes from 0 to h increases after each time we perform (s,a). [sent-229, score-0.333]
</p><p>90 3 Consider incremental Q-learning with learning rate at(s, a) == l/[#(s, a, t)] and 'Â¢(k) == l/e k . [sent-233, score-0.347]
</p><p>91 The number of times (s, a) is performed in the first n visits to state s is 8( V'(s~~~(s,aÂ»)' for sufficiently large n. [sent-235, score-0.332]
</p><p>92 Furthermore, the return obtained by incremental Q-Iearning converges to the optimal return. [sent-236, score-0.547]

</p><p>96 Each state action pair immediate reward is randomly chosen in the interval [0, 10]. [sent-244, score-0.529]
</p><p>97 For each state and action (s, a) the next state transition is random,i. [sent-245, score-0.611]
</p><p>98 , for every state  Sl  we have a random variable  X:: a  E [0, 1] and  PS~SI =  E:::;. [sent-247, score-0.217]
</p><p>99 For  the â¬t-greedy Q-Iearning, we have â¬t == 10000/t at time t, while for the incremental we have 'l/Jt == 10000/t. [sent-249, score-0.345]
</p><p>100 We plan to further investigate the theoretical connection between â¬-greedy, Boltzman machine and incremental Q-Learning. [sent-253, score-0.283]

Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of relative to when no function approximation of is used, where is the number of possible actions and is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function.

<p>Author: Xin Wang, Thomas G. Dietterich</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of non-convergence of online reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q learning and SARSA(A)) by adopting an incremental-batch approach that separates the exploration process from the function fitting process. Our BFBP (Batch Fit to Best Paths) algorithm alternates between an exploration phase (during which trajectories are generated to try to find fragments of the optimal policy) and a function fitting phase (during which a function approximator is fit to the best known paths from start states to terminal states). An advantage of this approach is that batch value-function fitting is a global process, which allows it to address the tradeoffs in function approximation that cannot be handled by local, online algorithms. This approach was pioneered by Boyan and Moore with their GROWSUPPORT and ROUT algorithms. We show how to improve upon their work by applying a better exploration process and by enriching the function fitting procedure to incorporate Bellman error and advantage error measures into the objective function. The results show improved performance on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>3 0.82234639 <a title="55-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Batch_Value_Function_Approximation_via_Support_Vectors.html">40 nips-2001-Batch Value Function Approximation via Support Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Jens Kohlmorgen, Steven Lemm</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits an inherent mode switching. In particular, the data might be a non-stationary time series from a dynamical system that switches between multiple operating modes. Unlike other approaches, our method processes the data incrementally and without any training of internal parameters. We use an HMM with a dynamically changing number of states and an on-line variant of the Viterbi algorithm that performs an unsupervised segmentation and classification of the data on-the-fly, i.e. the method is able to process incoming data in real-time. The main idea of the approach is to track and segment changes of the probability density of the data in a sliding window on the incoming data stream. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application to a switching dynamical system. 1</p><p>3 0.65222466 <a title="55-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>4 0.64846456 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>

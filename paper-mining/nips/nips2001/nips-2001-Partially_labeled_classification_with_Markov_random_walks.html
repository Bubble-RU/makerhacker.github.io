<p>Author: Yang Song, Luis Goncalves, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm that can derive the probabilistic dependence structure of parts of an object (a moving human body in our examples) automatically from unlabeled data. The distinguished part of this work is that it is based on unlabeled data, i.e., the training features include both useful foreground parts and background clutter and the correspondence between the parts and detected features are unknown. We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algorithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables.

Earlier work on the theory of co-training has been only loosely related to empirically useful co-training algorithms. Here we give a new PAC-style bound on generalization error which justiﬁes both the use of conﬁdences — partial rules and partial labeling of the unlabeled data — and the use of an agreement-based objective function as suggested by Collins and Singer.

<p>Author: Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose the framework of mutual information kernels for learning covariance kernels, as used in Support Vector machines and Gaussian process classifiers, from unlabeled task data using Bayesian techniques. We describe an implementation of this framework which uses variational Bayesian mixtures of factor analyzers in order to attack classification problems in high-dimensional spaces where labeled data is sparse, but unlabeled data is abundant. 1</p><p>6 0.13423045 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Active_Learning_in_the_Drug_Discovery_Process.html">25 nips-2001-Active Learning in the Drug Discovery Process</a></p>

<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth, Gunnar Rätsch, Michael Mathieson, Jun Liao, Christian Lemmen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the following data mining problem from Computational Chemistry: From a large data set of compounds, ﬁnd those that bind to a target molecule in as few iterations of biological testing as possible. In each iteration a comparatively small batch of compounds is screened for binding to the target. We apply active learning techniques for selecting the successive batches. One selection strategy picks unlabeled examples closest to the maximum margin hyperplane. Another produces many weight vectors by running perceptrons over multiple permutations of the data. Each weight vector votes with its prediction and we pick the unlabeled examples for which the prediction is most evenly split between and . For a third selection strategy note that each unlabeled example bisects the version space of consistent weight vectors. We estimate the volume on both sides of the split by bouncing a billiard through the version space and select unlabeled examples that cause the most even split of the version space. We demonstrate that on two data sets provided by DuPont Pharmaceuticals that all three selection strategies perform comparably well and are much better than selecting random batches for testing. § © ¨</p><p>3 0.63346052 <a title="144-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Human_Motion_Models.html">193 nips-2001-Unsupervised Learning of Human Motion Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Stuart N. Wrigley, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone. 1</p><p>2 0.83244801 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Transform-invariant_Image_Decomposition_with_Similarity_Templates.html">191 nips-2001-Transform-invariant Image Decomposition with Similarity Templates</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Stauffer, Erik Miller, Kinh Tieu</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown impressive transform-invariant modeling and clustering for sets of images of objects with similar appearance. We seek to expand these capabilities to sets of images of an object class that show considerable variation across individual instances (e.g. pedestrian images) using a representation based on pixel-wise similarities, similarity templates. Because of its invariance to the colors of particular components of an object, this representation enables detection of instances of an object class and enables alignment of those instances. Further, this model implicitly represents the regions of color regularity in the class-speciﬁc image set enabling a decomposition of that object class into component regions. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81633192 <a title="144-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Partially_labeled_classification_with_Markov_random_walks.html">144 nips-2001-Partially labeled classification with Markov random walks</a></p>

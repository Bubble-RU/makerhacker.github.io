<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>3 0.062333308 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Effective_Size_of_Receptive_Fields_of_Inferior_Temporal_Visual_Cortex_Neurons_in_Natural_Scenes.html">65 nips-2001-Effective Size of Receptive Fields of Inferior Temporal Visual Cortex Neurons in Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas P. Trappenberg, Edmund T. Rolls, Simon M. Stringer</p><p>Abstract: Inferior temporal cortex (IT) neurons have large receptive ﬁelds when a single effective object stimulus is shown against a blank background, but have much smaller receptive ﬁelds when the object is placed in a natural scene. Thus, translation invariant object recognition is reduced in natural scenes, and this may help object selection. We describe a model which accounts for this by competition within an attractor in which the neurons are tuned to different objects in the scene, and the fovea has a higher cortical magniﬁcation factor than the peripheral visual ﬁeld. Furthermore, we show that top-down object bias can increase the receptive ﬁeld size, facilitating object search in complex visual scenes, and providing a model of object-based attention. The model leads to the prediction that introduction of a second object into a scene with blank background will reduce the receptive ﬁeld size to values that depend on the closeness of the second object to the target stimulus. We suggest that mechanisms of this type enable the output of IT to be primarily about one object, so that the areas that receive from IT can select the object as a potential target for action.</p><p>4 0.051987361 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Human_Motion_Models.html">193 nips-2001-Unsupervised Learning of Human Motion Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Song, Luis Goncalves, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm that can derive the probabilistic dependence structure of parts of an object (a moving human body in our examples) automatically from unlabeled data. The distinguished part of this work is that it is based on unlabeled data, i.e., the training features include both useful foreground parts and background clutter and the correspondence between the parts and detected features are unknown. We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algorithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables. The success of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled real image sequences.</p><p>5 0.047723882 <a title="158-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Rómer Rosales, Stan Sclaroff</p><p>Abstract: A nonlinear supervised learning model, the Specialized Mappings Architecture (SMA), is described and applied to the estimation of human body pose from monocular images. The SMA consists of several specialized forward mapping functions and an inverse mapping function. Each specialized function maps certain domains of the input space (image features) onto the output space (body pose parameters). The key algorithmic problems faced are those of learning the specialized domains and mapping functions in an optimal way, as well as performing inference given inputs and knowledge of the inverse function. Solutions to these problems employ the EM algorithm and alternating choices of conditional independence assumptions. Performance of the approach is evaluated with synthetic and real video sequences of human motion. 1</p><p>3 0.44800916 <a title="158-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Human_Motion_Models.html">193 nips-2001-Unsupervised Learning of Human Motion Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvio P. Sabatini, Fabio Solari, Giulia Andreani, Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo M. Bisio</p><p>Abstract: A cortical model for motion-in-depth selectivity of complex cells in the visual cortex is proposed. The model is based on a time extension of the phase-based techniques for disparity estimation. We consider the computation of the total temporal derivative of the time-varying disparity through the combination of the responses of disparity energy units. To take into account the physiological plausibility, the model is based on the combinations of binocular cells characterized by different ocular dominance indices. The resulting cortical units of the model show a sharp selectivity for motion-indepth that has been compared with that reported in the literature for real cortical cells. 1</p><p>6 0.34533015 <a title="158-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Perceptual_Metamers_in_Stereoscopic_Vision.html">145 nips-2001-Perceptual Metamers in Stereoscopic Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: J. A. Beintema, M. Lappe, Alexander C. Berg</p><p>Abstract: Observer translation relative to the world creates image flow that expands from the observer's direction of translation (heading) from which the observer can recover heading direction. Yet, the image flow is often more complex, depending on rotation of the eye, scene layout and translation velocity. A number of models [1-4] have been proposed on how the human visual system extracts heading from flow in a neurophysiologic ally plausible way. These models represent heading by a set of neurons that respond to large image flow patterns and receive input from motion sensed at different image locations. We analysed these models to determine the exact receptive field of these heading detectors. We find most models predict that, contrary to widespread believe, the contribut ing motion sensors have a preferred motion directed circularly rather than radially around the detector's preferred heading. Moreover, the results suggest to look for more refined structure within the circular flow, such as bi-circularity or local motion-opponency.</p><p>2 0.4523485 <a title="158-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-The_Unified_Propagation_and_Scaling_Algorithm.html">188 nips-2001-The Unified Propagation and Scaling Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we will show that a restricted class of constrained minimum divergence problems, named generalized inference problems, can be solved by approximating the KL divergence with a Bethe free energy. The algorithm we derive is closely related to both loopy belief propagation and iterative scaling. This uniﬁed propagation and scaling algorithm reduces to a convergent alternative to loopy belief propagation when no constraints are present. Experiments show the viability of our algorithm.</p><p>3 0.44339392 <a title="158-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Gaussian_Process_Regression_with_Mismatched_Models.html">79 nips-2001-Gaussian Process Regression with Mismatched Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: Learning curves for Gaussian process regression are well understood when the 'student' model happens to match the 'teacher' (true data generation process). I derive approximations to the learning curves for the more generic case of mismatched models, and find very rich behaviour: For large input space dimensionality, where the results become exact, there are universal (student-independent) plateaux in the learning curve, with transitions in between that can exhibit arbitrarily many over-fitting maxima; over-fitting can occur even if the student estimates the teacher noise level correctly. In lower dimensions, plateaux also appear, and the learning curve remains dependent on the mismatch between student and teacher even in the asymptotic limit of a large number of training examples. Learning with excessively strong smoothness assumptions can be particularly dangerous: For example, a student with a standard radial basis function covariance function will learn a rougher teacher function only logarithmically slowly. All predictions are confirmed by simulations. 1</p><p>4 0.23603672 <a title="158-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Tree-based_reparameterization_for_approximate_inference_on_loopy_graphs.html">192 nips-2001-Tree-based reparameterization for approximate inference on loopy graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We develop a tree-based reparameterization framework that provides a new conceptual view of a large class of iterative algorithms for computing approximate marginals in graphs with cycles. It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP /BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP /BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g. , 1, 2]. 1</p><p>5 0.20919222 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Abstraction_Hierarchies.html">149 nips-2001-Probabilistic Abstraction Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Eran Segal, Daphne Koller, Dirk Ormoneit</p><p>Abstract: Many domains are naturally organized in an abstraction hierarchy or taxonomy, where the instances in “nearby” classes in the taxonomy are similar. In this paper, we provide a general probabilistic framework for clustering data into a set of classes organized as a taxonomy, where each class is associated with a probabilistic model from which the data was generated. The clustering algorithm simultaneously optimizes three things: the assignment of data instances to clusters, the models associated with the clusters, and the structure of the abstraction hierarchy. A unique feature of our approach is that it utilizes global optimization algorithms for both of the last two steps, reducing the sensitivity to noise and the propensity to local maxima that are characteristic of algorithms such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering that only take local steps. We provide a theoretical analysis for our algorithm, showing that it converges to a local maximum of the joint likelihood of model and data. We present experimental results on synthetic data, and on real data in the domains of gene expression and text.</p><p>6 0.20842853 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Iterative_Double_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">100 nips-2001-Iterative Double Clustering for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

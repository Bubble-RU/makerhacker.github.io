<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Michael Casey</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that under noisy conditions we can hear speech much more clearly when we read the speaker's lips. This suggests the utility of audio-visual information for the task of speech enhancement. We propose a method to exploit audio-visual cues to enable speech separation under non-stationary noise and with a single microphone. We revise and extend HMM-based speech enhancement techniques, in which signal and noise models are factori ally combined, to incorporate visual lip information and employ novel signal HMMs in which the dynamics of narrow-band and wide band components are factorial. We avoid the combinatorial explosion in the factorial model by using a simple approximate inference technique to quickly estimate the clean signals in a mixture. We present a preliminary evaluation of this approach using a small-vocabulary audio-visual database, showing promising improvements in machine intelligibility for speech enhanced using audio and visual information. 1</p><p>3 0.18613638 <a title="173-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-ALGONQUIN_-_Learning_Dynamic_Noise_Models_From_Noisy_Speech_for_Robust_Speech_Recognition.html">4 nips-2001-ALGONQUIN - Learning Dynamic Noise Models From Noisy Speech for Robust Speech Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Trausti T. Kristjansson, Li Deng, Alex Acero</p><p>Abstract: A challenging, unsolved problem in the speech recognition community is recognizing speech signals that are corrupted by loud, highly nonstationary noise. One approach to noisy speech recognition is to automatically remove the noise from the cepstrum sequence before feeding it in to a clean speech recognizer. In previous work published in Eurospeech, we showed how a probability model trained on clean speech and a separate probability model trained on noise could be combined for the purpose of estimating the noisefree speech from the noisy speech. We showed how an iterative 2nd order vector Taylor series approximation could be used for probabilistic inference in this model. In many circumstances, it is not possible to obtain examples of noise without speech. Noise statistics may change significantly during an utterance, so that speechfree frames are not sufficient for estimating the noise model. In this paper, we show how the noise model can be learned even when the data contains speech. In particular, the noise model can be learned from the test utterance and then used to de noise the test utterance. The approximate inference technique is used as an approximate E step in a generalized EM algorithm that learns the parameters of the noise model from a test utterance. For both Wall Street J ournal data with added noise samples and the Aurora benchmark, we show that the new noise adaptive technique performs as well as or significantly better than the non-adaptive algorithm, without the need for a separate training set of noise examples. 1</p><p>4 0.10579805 <a title="173-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Dynamic_Time-Alignment_Kernel_in_Support_Vector_Machine.html">63 nips-2001-Dynamic Time-Alignment Kernel in Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroshi Shimodaira, Ken-ichi Noma, Mitsuru Nakai, Shigeki Sagayama</p><p>Abstract: A new class of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is applicable to sequential-pattern recognition such as speech recognition is developed by incorporating an idea of non-linear time alignment into the kernel function. Since the time-alignment operation of sequential pattern is embedded in the new kernel function, standard SVM training and classiﬁcation algorithms can be employed without further modiﬁcations. The proposed SVM (DTAK-SVM) is evaluated in speaker-dependent speech recognition experiments of hand-segmented phoneme recognition. Preliminary experimental results show comparable recognition performance with hidden Markov models (HMMs). 1</p><p>5 0.098891832 <a title="173-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Sequence_Kernel_and_its_Application_to_Speaker_Recognition.html">20 nips-2001-A Sequence Kernel and its Application to Speaker Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach for comparing sequences of observations using an explicit-expansion kernel is demonstrated. The kernel is derived using the assumption of the independence of the sequence of observations and a mean-squared error training criterion. The use of an explicit expansion kernel reduces classiﬁer model size and computation dramatically, resulting in model sizes and computation one-hundred times smaller in our application. The explicit expansion also preserves the computational advantages of an earlier architecture based on mean-squared error training. Training using standard support vector machine methodology gives accuracy that signiﬁcantly exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art mean-squared error training for a speaker recognition task.</p><p>6 0.081983835 <a title="173-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory.html">161 nips-2001-Reinforcement Learning with Long Short-Term Memory</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Yao, S. Nakamura</p><p>Abstract: We present a sequential Monte Carlo method applied to additive noise compensation for robust speech recognition in time-varying noise. The method generates a set of samples according to the prior distribution given by clean speech models and noise prior evolved from previous estimation. An explicit model representing noise effects on speech features is used, so that an extended Kalman ﬁlter is constructed for each sample, generating the updated continuous state estimate as the estimation of the noise parameter, and prediction likelihood for weighting each sample. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) inference of the time-varying noise parameter is carried out over these samples by fusion the estimation of samples according to their weights. A residual resampling selection step and a Metropolis-Hastings smoothing step are used to improve calculation eﬃciency. Experiments were conducted on speech recognition in simulated non-stationary noises, where noise power changed artiﬁcially, and highly non-stationary Machinegun noise. In all the experiments carried out, we observed that the method can have signiﬁcant recognition performance improvement, over that achieved by noise compensation with stationary noise assumption. 1</p><p>5 0.47894591 <a title="173-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Sequence_Kernel_and_its_Application_to_Speaker_Recognition.html">20 nips-2001-A Sequence Kernel and its Application to Speaker Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to standard statistical learning theory which studies uniform bounds on the expected error we present a framework that exploits the specific learning algorithm used. Motivated by the luckiness framework [8] we are also able to exploit the serendipity of the training sample. The main difference to previous approaches lies in the complexity measure; rather than covering all hypotheses in a given hypothesis space it is only necessary to cover the functions which could have been learned using the fixed learning algorithm. We show how the resulting framework relates to the VC, luckiness and compression frameworks. Finally, we present an application of this framework to the maximum margin algorithm for linear classifiers which results in a bound that exploits both the margin and the distribution of the data in feature space. 1</p><p>4 0.41006386 <a title="173-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Relative_Density_Nets%3A_A_New_Way_to_Combine_Backpropagation_with_HMM%27s.html">162 nips-2001-Relative Density Nets: A New Way to Combine Backpropagation with HMM's</a></p>

Experiments on speech data show it to be superior to the standard method of discriminatively training HMM's. 1</p><p>5 0.40935683 <a title="173-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Linear-time_inference_in_Hierarchical_HMMs.html">115 nips-2001-Linear-time inference in Hierarchical HMMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin P. Murphy, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: The hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) is a generalization of the hidden Markov model (HMM) that models sequences with structure at many length/time scales [FST98]. Unfortunately, the original infertime, where is ence algorithm is rather complicated, and takes the length of the sequence, making it impractical for many domains. In this paper, we show how HHMMs are a special kind of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), and thereby derive a much simpler inference algorithm, which only takes time. Furthermore, by drawing the connection between HHMMs and DBNs, we enable the application of many standard approximation techniques to further speed up inference. ¥ ©§ £ ¨¦¥¤¢ © £ ¦¥¤¢</p><p>6 0.40553445 <a title="173-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvio P. Sabatini, Fabio Solari, Giulia Andreani, Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo M. Bisio</p><p>Abstract: A cortical model for motion-in-depth selectivity of complex cells in the visual cortex is proposed. The model is based on a time extension of the phase-based techniques for disparity estimation. We consider the computation of the total temporal derivative of the time-varying disparity through the combination of the responses of disparity energy units. To take into account the physiological plausibility, the model is based on the combinations of binocular cells characterized by different ocular dominance indices. The resulting cortical units of the model show a sharp selectivity for motion-indepth that has been compared with that reported in the literature for real cortical cells. 1</p><p>3 0.12650417 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>5 0.1006972 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Characterizing_Neural_Gain_Control_using_Spike-triggered_Covariance.html">48 nips-2001-Characterizing Neural Gain Control using Spike-triggered Covariance</a></p>
<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, E. J. Chichilnisky, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Spike-triggered averaging techniques are effective for linear characterization of neural responses. But neurons exhibit important nonlinear behaviors, such as gain control, that are not captured by such analyses. We describe a spike-triggered covariance method for retrieving suppressive components of the gain control signal in a neuron. We demonstrate the method in simulation and on retinal ganglion cell data. Analysis of physiological data reveals signiﬁcant suppressive axes and explains neural nonlinearities. This method should be applicable to other sensory areas and modalities. White noise analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing response properties of spiking neurons. A sequence of stimuli are drawn randomly from an ensemble and presented in rapid succession, and one examines the subset that elicit action potentials. This “spike-triggered” stimulus ensemble can provide information about the neuron’s response characteristics. In the most widely used form of this analysis, one estimates an excitatory linear kernel by computing the spike-triggered average (STA); that is, the mean stimulus that elicited a spike [e.g., 1, 2]. Under the assumption that spikes are generated by a Poisson process with instantaneous rate determined by linear projection onto a kernel followed by a static nonlinearity, the STA provides an unbiased estimate of this kernel [3]. Recently, a number of authors have developed interesting extensions of white noise analysis. Some have examined spike-triggered averages in a reduced linear subspace of input stimuli [e.g., 4]. Others have recovered excitatory subspaces, by computing the spiketriggered covariance (STC), followed by an eigenvector analysis to determine the subspace axes [e.g., 5, 6]. Sensory neurons exhibit striking nonlinear behaviors that are not explained by fundamentally linear mechanisms. For example, the response of a neuron typically saturates for large amplitude stimuli; the response to the optimal stimulus is often suppressed by the presence of a non-optimal mask [e.g., 7]; and the kernel recovered from STA analysis may change shape as a function of stimulus amplitude [e.g., 8, 9]. A variety of these nonlinear behaviors can be attributed to gain control [e.g., 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], in which neural responses are suppressively modulated by a gain signal derived from the stimulus. Although the underlying mechanisms and time scales associated with such gain control are current topics of research, the basic functional properties appear to be ubiquitous, occurring throughout the nervous system. a b 0 k0 0 Figure 1: Geometric depiction of spike-triggered analyses. a, Spike-triggered averaging with two-dimensional stimuli. Black points indicate raw stimuli. White points indicate stimuli eliciting a spike, and the STA (black vector), which provides an estimate of , corresponds to their center of mass. b, Spike-triggered covariance analysis of suppressive axes. Shown are a set of stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to the excitatory kernel, . Within the plane, stimuli eliciting a spike are concentrated in an elliptical region. The minor axis of the ellipse corresponds to a suppressive stimulus direction: stimuli with a signiﬁcant component along this axis are less likely to elicit spikes. The stimulus component along the major axis of the ellipse has no inﬂuence on spiking. ¢ £  ¡ ¢  ¡ Here we develop a white noise methodology for characterizing a neuron with gain control. We show that a set of suppressive kernels may be recovered by ﬁnding the eigenvectors of the spike-triggered covariance matrix associated with smallest variance. We apply the technique to electrophysiological data obtained from ganglion cells in salamander and macaque retina, and recover a set of axes that are shown to reduce responses in the neuron. Moreover, when we ﬁt a gain control model to the data using a maximum likelihood procedure within this subspace, the model accounts for changes in the STA as a function of contrast. 1 Characterizing suppressive axes ¤¥ As in all white noise approaches, we assume that stimuli correspond to vectors, , in some ﬁnite-dimensional space (e.g., a neighborhood of pixels or an interval of time samples). We assume a gain control model in which the probability of a stimulus eliciting a spike grows monotonically with the halfwave-rectiﬁed projection onto an excitatory linear kernel, , and is suppressively modulated by the fullwave-rectiﬁed projection onto a set of . linear kernels, ¨ ¤§  ¤¥    ©¤ §   ¨ ¤ ¥ ©¤ § ¦ First, we recover the excitatory kernel, . This is achieved by presenting spherically symmetric input stimuli (e.g., Gaussian white noise) to the neuron and computing the STA (Fig. 1a). STA correctly recovers the excitatory kernel, under the assumption that each of the gain control kernels are orthogonal (or equal) to the excitatory kernel. The proof is essentially the same as that given for recovering the kernel of a linear model followed by a monotonic nonlinearity [3]. In particular, any stimulus can be decomposed into a component in the direction of the excitatory kernel, and a component in a perpendicular direction. This can be paired with another stimulus that is identical, except that its component in the perpendicular direction is negated. The two stimuli are equally likely to occur in a spherically Gaussian stimulus set (since they are equidistant from the origin), and they are equally likely to elicit a spike (since their excitatory components are equal, and their rectiﬁed perpendicular components are equal). Their vector average lies in the direction of the excitatory kernel. Thus, the STA (which is an average over all such stimuli, or all such stimulus pairs) must also lie in that direction. In a subsequent section we explain how to Model: Retrieved: Excitatory: Excitatory: Eigenvalues: Suppressive: Suppressive: Weights Variance (eigenvalue) { 1.5 { 2{ 2.5 { 3{ 1 1 Arbitrary 0 Axis number 350 Figure 2: Estimation of kernels from a simulated model (equation 2).

Middle: STA (excitatory kernel) and eigenvectors (suppressive kernels) associated with the lowest eigenvalues. recover the excitatory kernel when it is not orthogonal to the suppressive kernels. Next, we recover the suppressive subspace, assuming the excitatory kernel is known. Consider the stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to this kernel. These stimuli all elicit the same response in the excitatory kernel, but they may produce different amounts of suppression. Figure 1b illustrates the behavior in a three-dimensional stimulus space, in which one axis is assumed to be suppressive. The distribution of raw stimuli on the plane is spherically symmetric about the origin. But the distribution of stimuli eliciting a spike is narrower along the suppressive direction: these stimuli have a component along the suppressive axis and are therefore less likely to elicit a spike. This behavior is easily generalized from this plane to the entire stimulus space. If we assume that the suppressive axes are ﬁxed, then we expect to see reductions in variance in the same directions for any level of numerator excitation. Given this behavior of the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble, we can recover the suppressive subspace using principal component analysis. We construct the sample covariance matrix of the stimuli eliciting a spike: £ §¥</p><p>6 0.07790304 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Maximum-Likelihood_Approach_to_Modeling_Multisensory_Enhancement.html">11 nips-2001-A Maximum-Likelihood Approach to Modeling Multisensory Enhancement</a></p>

This is achieved by presenting spherically symmetric input stimuli (e.g., Gaussian white noise) to the neuron and computing the STA (Fig. 1a). STA correctly recovers the excitatory kernel, under the assumption that each of the gain control kernels are orthogonal (or equal) to the excitatory kernel. The proof is essentially the same as that given for recovering the kernel of a linear model followed by a monotonic nonlinearity [3]. In particular, any stimulus can be decomposed into a component in the direction of the excitatory kernel, and a component in a perpendicular direction. This can be paired with another stimulus that is identical, except that its component in the perpendicular direction is negated. The two stimuli are equally likely to occur in a spherically Gaussian stimulus set (since they are equidistant from the origin), and they are equally likely to elicit a spike (since their excitatory components are equal, and their rectiﬁed perpendicular components are equal). Their vector average lies in the direction of the excitatory kernel. Thus, the STA (which is an average over all such stimuli, or all such stimulus pairs) must also lie in that direction. In a subsequent section we explain how to Model: Retrieved: Excitatory: Excitatory: Eigenvalues: Suppressive: Suppressive: Weights Variance (eigenvalue) { 1.5 { 2{ 2.5 { 3{ 1 1 Arbitrary 0 Axis number 350 Figure 2: Estimation of kernels from a simulated model (equation 2).

Middle: STA (excitatory kernel) and eigenvectors (suppressive kernels) associated with the lowest eigenvalues. recover the excitatory kernel when it is not orthogonal to the suppressive kernels. Next, we recover the suppressive subspace, assuming the excitatory kernel is known. Consider the stimuli lying on a plane perpendicular to this kernel. These stimuli all elicit the same response in the excitatory kernel, but they may produce different amounts of suppression. Figure 1b illustrates the behavior in a three-dimensional stimulus space, in which one axis is assumed to be suppressive. The distribution of raw stimuli on the plane is spherically symmetric about the origin. But the distribution of stimuli eliciting a spike is narrower along the suppressive direction: these stimuli have a component along the suppressive axis and are therefore less likely to elicit a spike. This behavior is easily generalized from this plane to the entire stimulus space. If we assume that the suppressive axes are ﬁxed, then we expect to see reductions in variance in the same directions for any level of numerator excitation. Given this behavior of the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble, we can recover the suppressive subspace using principal component analysis. We construct the sample covariance matrix of the stimuli eliciting a spike: £ §¥</p><p>6 0.44638848 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Maximum-Likelihood_Approach_to_Modeling_Multisensory_Enhancement.html">11 nips-2001-A Maximum-Likelihood Approach to Modeling Multisensory Enhancement</a></p>

<p>Author: B. T. Backus</p><p>Abstract: Theories of cue combination suggest the possibility of constructing visual stimuli that evoke different patterns of neural activity in sensory areas of the brain, but that cannot be distinguished by any behavioral measure of perception. Such stimuli, if they exist, would be interesting for two reasons. First, one could know that none of the differences between the stimuli survive past the computations used to build the percepts. Second, it can be difficult to distinguish stimulus-driven components of measured neural activity from top-down components (such as those due to the interestingness of the stimuli). Changing the stimulus without changing the percept could be exploited to measure the stimulusdriven activity. Here we describe stimuli in which vertical and horizontal disparities trade during the construction of percepts of slanted surfaces, yielding stimulus equivalence classes. Equivalence class membership changed after a change of vergence eye posture alone, without changes to the retinal images. A formal correspondence can be drawn between these “perceptual metamers” and more familiar “sensory metamers” such as color metamers. 1</p><p>2 0.46875808 <a title="145-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Exact_differential_equation_population_dynamics_for_integrate-and-fire_neurons.html">72 nips-2001-Exact differential equation population dynamics for integrate-and-fire neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Julian Eggert, Berthold BĂ¤uml</p><p>Abstract: Mesoscopical, mathematical descriptions of dynamics of populations of spiking neurons are getting increasingly important for the understanding of large-scale processes in the brain using simulations. In our previous work, integral equation formulations for population dynamics have been derived for a special type of spiking neurons. For Integrate- and- Fire type neurons , these formulations were only approximately correct. Here, we derive a mathematically compact, exact population dynamics formulation for Integrate- and- Fire type neurons. It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Jonathan L. Shapiro, J. Wearden</p><p>Abstract: Animal data on delayed-reward conditioning experiments shows a striking property - the data for different time intervals collapses into a single curve when the data is scaled by the time interval. This is called the scalar property of interval timing. Here a simple model of a neural clock is presented and shown to give rise to the scalar property. The model is an accumulator consisting of noisy, linear spiking neurons. It is analytically tractable and contains only three parameters. When coupled with reinforcement learning it simulates peak procedure experiments, producing both the scalar property and the pattern of single trial covariances. 1</p><p>4 0.34975502 <a title="145-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Complex_Cells_in_Visual_Cortex_for_the_Binocular_Perception_of_Motion-in-Depth.html">10 nips-2001-A Hierarchical Model of Complex Cells in Visual Cortex for the Binocular Perception of Motion-in-Depth</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvio P. Sabatini, Fabio Solari, Giulia Andreani, Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo M. Bisio</p><p>Abstract: A cortical model for motion-in-depth selectivity of complex cells in the visual cortex is proposed. The model is based on a time extension of the phase-based techniques for disparity estimation. We consider the computation of the total temporal derivative of the time-varying disparity through the combination of the responses of disparity energy units. To take into account the physiological plausibility, the model is based on the combinations of binocular cells characterized by different ocular dominance indices. The resulting cortical units of the model show a sharp selectivity for motion-indepth that has been compared with that reported in the literature for real cortical cells. 1</p><p>5 0.34936666 <a title="145-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Activity_Driven_Adaptive_Stochastic_Resonance.html">27 nips-2001-Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic Resonance</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>6 0.34753183 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Eye_movements_and_the_maturation_of_cortical_orientation_selectivity.html">73 nips-2001-Eye movements and the maturation of cortical orientation selectivity</a></p>

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that induces a class of models with thin junction trees—models that are characterized by an upper bound on the size of the maximal cliques of their triangulated graph. By ensuring that the junction tree is thin, inference in our models remains tractable throughout the learning process. This allows both an efﬁcient implementation of an iterative scaling parameter estimation algorithm and also ensures that inference can be performed efﬁciently with the ﬁnal model. We illustrate the approach with applications in handwritten digit recognition and DNA splice site detection.</p><p>3 0.23813865 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-The_g_Factor%3A_Relating_Distributions_on_Features_to_Distributions_on_Images.html">189 nips-2001-The g Factor: Relating Distributions on Features to Distributions on Images</a></p>
<p>Author: James M. Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe the g-factor, which relates probability distributions on image features to distributions on the images themselves. The g-factor depends only on our choice of features and lattice quantization and is independent of the training image data. We illustrate the importance of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of Markov Random Field (i.e. Gibbs or log-linear) probability models of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn image distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to feature histogram statistics (d. Minimax Entropy Learning (MEL) by Zhu, Wu and Mumford 1997 [11]) . We first use our analysis of the g-factor to determine when the clique potentials decouple for different features . Second, we show that clique potentials can be computed analytically by approximating the g-factor. Third, we demonstrate a connection between this approximation and the Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm (GIS), due to Darroch and Ratcliff 1972 [2], for calculating potentials. This connection enables us to use GIS to improve our multinomial approximation, using Bethe-Kikuchi[8] approximations to simplify the GIS procedure. We support our analysis by computer simulations. 1</p><p>4 0.1295567 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Collins, Nigel Duffy</p><p>Abstract: We describe the application of kernel methods to Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. In many NLP tasks the objects being modeled are strings, trees, graphs or other discrete structures which require some mechanism to convert them into feature vectors. We describe kernels for various natural language structures, allowing rich, high dimensional representations of these structures. We show how a kernel over trees can be applied to parsing using the voted perceptron algorithm, and we give experimental results on the ATIS corpus of parse trees.</p><p>6 0.11012615 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Tree-based_reparameterization_for_approximate_inference_on_loopy_graphs.html">192 nips-2001-Tree-based reparameterization for approximate inference on loopy graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We develop a tree-based reparameterization framework that provides a new conceptual view of a large class of iterative algorithms for computing approximate marginals in graphs with cycles. It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP /BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP /BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g. , 1, 2]. 1</p><p>6 0.42546052 <a title="118-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Learning_Hierarchical_Structures_with_Linear_Relational_Embedding.html">110 nips-2001-Learning Hierarchical Structures with Linear Relational Embedding</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: Learning curves for Gaussian process regression are well understood when the 'student' model happens to match the 'teacher' (true data generation process). I derive approximations to the learning curves for the more generic case of mismatched models, and find very rich behaviour: For large input space dimensionality, where the results become exact, there are universal (student-independent) plateaux in the learning curve, with transitions in between that can exhibit arbitrarily many over-fitting maxima; over-fitting can occur even if the student estimates the teacher noise level correctly. In lower dimensions, plateaux also appear, and the learning curve remains dependent on the mismatch between student and teacher even in the asymptotic limit of a large number of training examples. Learning with excessively strong smoothness assumptions can be particularly dangerous: For example, a student with a standard radial basis function covariance function will learn a rougher teacher function only logarithmically slowly. All predictions are confirmed by simulations. 1</p><p>3 0.52553666 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.52408415 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Martijn Leisink, Bert Kappen</p><p>Abstract: The partition function for a Boltzmann machine can be bounded from above and below. We can use this to bound the means and the correlations. For networks with small weights, the values of these statistics can be restricted to non-trivial regions (i.e. a subset of [-1 , 1]). Experimental results show that reasonable bounding occurs for weight sizes where mean field expansions generally give good results. 1</p><p>6 0.52149248 <a title="118-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory.html">161 nips-2001-Reinforcement Learning with Long Short-Term Memory</a></p>

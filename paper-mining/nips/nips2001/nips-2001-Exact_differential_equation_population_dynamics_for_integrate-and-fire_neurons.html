<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Jörg Kramer, Giacomo Indiveri, Tobi Delbrück, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models. The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-ﬁre neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture. The circuit on this multi-neuron chip approximates a cortical microcircuit. The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.</p><p>3 0.40960488 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Activity_Driven_Adaptive_Stochastic_Resonance.html">27 nips-2001-Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic Resonance</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>4 0.34923118 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>6 0.29723847 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-3_state_neurons_for_contextual_processing.html">2 nips-2001-3 state neurons for contextual processing</a></p>

The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.</p><p>3 0.75973767 <a title="72-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-3_state_neurons_for_contextual_processing.html">2 nips-2001-3 state neurons for contextual processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ádám Kepecs, S. Raghavachari</p><p>Abstract: Neurons receive excitatory inputs via both fast AMPA and slow NMDA type receptors. We find that neurons receiving input via NMDA receptors can have two stable membrane states which are input dependent. Action potentials can only be initiated from the higher voltage state. Similar observations have been made in several brain areas which might be explained by our model. The interactions between the two kinds of inputs lead us to suggest that some neurons may operate in 3 states: disabled, enabled and firing. Such enabled, but non-firing modes can be used to introduce context-dependent processing in neural networks. We provide a simple example and discuss possible implications for neuronal processing and response variability. 1</p><p>4 0.74073464 <a title="72-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Activity_Driven_Adaptive_Stochastic_Resonance.html">27 nips-2001-Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic Resonance</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>5 0.73211378 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: B. T. Backus</p><p>Abstract: Theories of cue combination suggest the possibility of constructing visual stimuli that evoke different patterns of neural activity in sensory areas of the brain, but that cannot be distinguished by any behavioral measure of perception. Such stimuli, if they exist, would be interesting for two reasons. First, one could know that none of the differences between the stimuli survive past the computations used to build the percepts. Second, it can be difficult to distinguish stimulus-driven components of measured neural activity from top-down components (such as those due to the interestingness of the stimuli). Changing the stimulus without changing the percept could be exploited to measure the stimulusdriven activity. Here we describe stimuli in which vertical and horizontal disparities trade during the construction of percepts of slanted surfaces, yielding stimulus equivalence classes. Equivalence class membership changed after a change of vergence eye posture alone, without changes to the retinal images. A formal correspondence can be drawn between these “perceptual metamers” and more familiar “sensory metamers” such as color metamers. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88284874 <a title="72-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Exact_differential_equation_population_dynamics_for_integrate-and-fire_neurons.html">72 nips-2001-Exact differential equation population dynamics for integrate-and-fire neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Julian Eggert, Berthold BĂ¤uml</p><p>Abstract: Mesoscopical, mathematical descriptions of dynamics of populations of spiking neurons are getting increasingly important for the understanding of large-scale processes in the brain using simulations. In our previous work, integral equation formulations for population dynamics have been derived for a special type of spiking neurons. For Integrate- and- Fire type neurons , these formulations were only approximately correct. Here, we derive a mathematically compact, exact population dynamics formulation for Integrate- and- Fire type neurons. It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>4 0.80463934 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Generating_velocity_tuning_by_asymmetric_recurrent_connections.html">82 nips-2001-Generating velocity tuning by asymmetric recurrent connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Asymmetric lateral connections are one possible mechanism that can account for the direction selectivity of cortical neurons. We present a mathematical analysis for a class of these models. Contrasting with earlier theoretical work that has relied on methods from linear systems theory, we study the network’s nonlinear dynamic properties that arise when the threshold nonlinearity of the neurons is taken into account. We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatiotemporal periodicity. This predicts that if direction selectivity in the cortex is mainly achieved by asymmetric lateral connections lurching activity waves might be observable in ensembles of direction selective cortical neurons within appropriate regimes of the stimulus speed.</p><p>5 0.80020559 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>6 0.79974353 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

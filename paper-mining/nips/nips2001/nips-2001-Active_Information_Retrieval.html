<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I.

First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>3 0.2537953 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-The_Intelligent_surfer%3A_Probabilistic_Combination_of_Link_and_Content_Information_in_PageRank.html">184 nips-2001-The Intelligent surfer: Probabilistic Combination of Link and Content Information in PageRank</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Richardson, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: The PageRank algorithm, used in the Google search engine, greatly improves the results of Web search by taking into account the link structure of the Web. PageRank assigns to a page a score proportional to the number of times a random surfer would visit that page, if it surfed indefinitely from page to page, following all outlinks from a page with equal probability. We propose to improve PageRank by using a more intelligent surfer, one that is guided by a probabilistic model of the relevance of a page to a query. Efficient execution of our algorithm at query time is made possible by precomputing at crawl time (and thus once for all queries) the necessary terms. Experiments on two large subsets of the Web indicate that our algorithm significantly outperforms PageRank in the (human-rated) quality of the pages returned, while remaining efficient enough to be used in today’s large search engines. 1</p><p>4 0.24604943 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongyuan Zha, Xiaofeng He, Chris Ding, Ming Gu, Horst D. Simon</p><p>Abstract: The popular K-means clustering partitions a data set by minimizing a sum-of-squares cost function. A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by computing a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by computing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function. 1</p><p>5 0.2294888 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Novel_iteration_schemes_for_the_Cluster_Variation_Method.html">132 nips-2001-Novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: The Cluster Variation method is a class of approximation methods containing the Bethe and Kikuchi approximations as special cases. We derive two novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method. One is a fixed point iteration scheme which gives a significant improvement over loopy BP, mean field and TAP methods on directed graphical models. The other is a gradient based method, that is guaranteed to converge and is shown to give useful results on random graphs with mild frustration. We conclude that the methods are of significant practical value for large inference problems. 1</p><p>6 0.20738943 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Method_of_Quantum_Clustering.html">185 nips-2001-The Method of Quantum Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: David Horn, Assaf Gottlieb</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel clustering method that is an extension of ideas inherent to scale-space clustering and support-vector clustering. Like the latter, it associates every data point with a vector in Hilbert space, and like the former it puts emphasis on their total sum, that is equal to the scalespace probability function. The novelty of our approach is the study of an operator in Hilbert space, represented by the Schr¨ dinger equation of o which the probability function is a solution. This Schr¨ dinger equation o contains a potential function that can be derived analytically from the probability function. We associate minima of the potential with cluster centers. The method has one variable parameter, the scale of its Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate its applicability on known data sets. By limiting the evaluation of the Schr¨ dinger potential to the locations of data points, o we can apply this method to problems in high dimensions.</p><p>4 0.59511483 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Oren Souroujon</p><p>Abstract: We present a powerful meta-clustering technique called Iterative Double Clustering (IDC). The IDC method is a natural extension of the recent Double Clustering (DC) method of Slonim and Tishby that exhibited impressive performance on text categorization tasks [12]. Using synthetically generated data we empirically ﬁnd that whenever the DC procedure is successful in recovering some of the structure hidden in the data, the extended IDC procedure can incrementally compute a signiﬁcantly more accurate classiﬁcation. IDC is especially advantageous when the data exhibits high attribute noise. Our simulation results also show the eﬀectiveness of IDC in text categorization problems. Surprisingly, this unsupervised procedure can be competitive with a (supervised) SVM trained with a small training set. Finally, we propose a simple and natural extension of IDC for semi-supervised and transductive learning where we are given both labeled and unlabeled examples. 1</p><p>6 0.5688405 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Judy A. Franklin</p><p>Abstract: This article presents a 2-phase computational learning model and application. As a demonstration, a system has been built, called CHIME for Computer Human Interacting Musical Entity. In phase 1 of training, recurrent back-propagation trains the machine to reproduce 3 jazz melodies. The recurrent network is expanded and is further trained in phase 2 with a reinforcement learning algorithm and a critique produced by a set of basic rules for jazz improvisation. After each phase CHIME can interactively improvise with a human in real time. 1 Foundations Jazz improvisation is the creation of a jazz melody in real time. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, and Sonny Rollins et al. were the founders of bebop and post bop jazz [9] where drummers, bassists, and pianists keep the beat and maintain harmonic structure. Other players improvise over this structure and even take turns improvising for 4 bars at a time. This is called trading fours. Meanwhile, artiﬁcial neural networks have been used in computer music [4, 12]. In particular, the work of (Todd [11]) is the basis for phase 1 of CHIME, a novice machine improvisor that learns to trade fours. Firstly, a recurrent network is trained with back-propagation to play three jazz melodies by Sonny Rollins [1], as described in Section 2. Phase 2 uses actor-critic reinforcement learning and is described in Section 3. This section is on jazz basics. 1.1 Basics: Chords, the ii-V-I Chord Progression and Scales The harmonic structure mentioned above is a series of chords that may be reprated and that are often grouped into standard subsequences. A chord is a group of notes played simultaneously. In the chromatic scale, C-Db-D-Eb-E-F-Gb-G-Ab-A-Bb-B-C, notes are separated by a half step. A ﬂat (b) note is a half step below the original note; a sharp (#) is a half above. Two half steps are a whole step. Two whole steps are a major third. Three half steps are a minor third. A major triad (chord) is the ﬁrst or tonic note, then the note a major third up, then the note a minor third up. When F is the tonic, F major triad is F-A-C. A minor triad (chord) is the tonic ¡ www.cs.smith.edu/˜jfrankli then a minor third, then a major third. F minor triad is F-Ab-C. The diminished triad is the tonic, then a minor third, then a minor third. F diminished triad is F-Ab-Cb. An augmented triad is the tonic, then a major third, then a major third. The F augmented triad is F-A-Db. A third added to the top of a triad forms a seventh chord. A major triad plus a major third is the major seventh chord. F-A-C-E is the F major seventh chord (Fmaj7). A minor triad plus a minor third is a minor seventh chord. For F it is F-Ab-C-Eb (Fm7). A major triad plus a minor third is a dominant seventh chord. For F it is F-A-C-Eb (F7). These three types of chords are used heavily in jazz harmony. Notice that each note in the chromatic scales can be the tonic note for any of these types of chords. A scale, a subset of the chromatic scale, is characterized by note intervals. Let W be a whole step and H be a half. The chromatic scale is HHHHHHHHHHHH. The major scale or ionian mode is WWHWWWH. F major scale is F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E-F. The notes in a scale are degrees; E is the seventh degree of F major. The ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, and seventh notes of a major scale are the major seventh chord. The ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, and seventh notes of other modes produce the minor seventh and dominant seventh chords. Roman numerals represent scale degrees and their seventh chords. Upper case implies major or dominant seventh and lower case implies minor seventh [9]. The major seventh chord starting at the scale tonic is the I (one) chord. G is the second degree of F major, and G-Bb-D-F is Gm7, the ii chord, with respect to F. The ii-V-I progression is prevalent in jazz [9], and for F it is Gm7-C7-Fmaj7. The minor ii-V-i progression is obtained using diminished and augmented triads, their seventh chords, and the aeolian mode. Seventh chords can be extended by adding major or minor thirds, e.g. Fmaj9, Fmaj11, Fmaj13, Gm9, Gm11, and Gm13. Any extension can be raised or lowered by 1 step [9] to obtain, e.g. Fmaj7#11, C7#9, C7b9, C7#11. Most jazz compositions are either the 12 bar blues or sectional forms (e.g. ABAB, ABAC, or AABA) [8]. The 3 Rollins songs are 12 bar blues. “Blue 7” has a simple blues form. In “Solid” and “Tenor Madness”, Rollins adds bebop variations to the blues form [1]. ii-V-I and VI-II-V-I progressions are added and G7+9 substitutes for the VI and F7+9 for the V (see section 1.2 below); the II-V in the last bar provides the turnaround to the I of the ﬁrst bar to foster smooth repetition of the form. The result is at left and in Roman numeral notation Bb7 Bb7 Bb7 Bb7 I I I I Eb7 Eb7 Bb7 G7+9 IV IV I VI at right: Cm7 F7 Bb7 G7+9 C7 F7+9 ii V I VI II V 1.2 Scale Substitutions and Rules for Reinforcement Learning First note that the theory and rules derived in this subsection are used in Phase 2, to be described in Section 3. They are presented here since they derive from the jazz basics immediately preceding. One way a novice improvisor can play is to associate one scale with each chord and choose notes from that scale when the chord is presented in the musical score. Therefore, Rule 1 is that an improvisor may choose notes from a “standard” scale associated with a chord. Next, the 4th degree of the scale is often avoided on a major or dominant seventh chord (Rule 3), unless the player can resolve its dissonance. The major 7th is an avoid note on a dominant seventh chord (Rule 4) since a dominant seventh chord and its scale contain the ﬂat 7th, not the major 7th. Rule 2 contains many notes that can be added. A brief rationale is given next. The C7 in Gm7-C7-Fmaj7 may be replaced by a C7#11, a C7+ chord, or a C7b9b5 or C7alt chord [9]. The scales for C7+ and C7#11 make available the raised fourth (ﬂat 5), and ﬂat 6 (ﬂat 13) for improvising. The C7b9b5 and C7alt (C7+9) chords and their scales make available the ﬂat9, raised 9, ﬂat5 and raised 5 [1]. These substitutions provide the notes of Rule 2. These rules (used in phase 2) are stated below, using for reinforcement values very bad (-1.0), bad (-0.5), a little bad (-0.25), ok (0.25), good (0.5), and very good (1.0). The rules are discussed further in Section 4. The Rule Set: 1) Any note in the scale associated with the chord is ok (except as noted in rule 3). 2) On a dominant seventh, hip notes 9, ﬂat9, #9, #11, 13 or ﬂat13 are very good. One hip note 2 times in a row is a little bad. 2 hip notes more than 2 times in a row is a little bad. 3) If the chord is a dominant seventh chord, a natural 4th note is bad. 4) If the chord is a dominant seventh chord, a natural 7th is very bad. 5) A rest is good unless it is held for more than 2 16th notes and then it is very bad. 6) Any note played longer than 1 beat (4 16th notes) is very bad. 7) If two consecutive notes match the human’s, that is good. 2 CHIME Phase 1 In Phase 1, supervised learning is used to train a recurrent network to reproduce the three Sonny Rollins melodies. 2.1 Network Details and Training The recurrent network’s output units are linear. The hidden units are nonlinear (logistic function). Todd [11] used a Jordan recurrent network [6] for classical melody learning and generation. In CHIME, a Jordan net is also used, with the addition of the chord as input (Figure 1. 24 of the 26 outputs are notes (2 chromatic octaves), the 25th is a rest, and the 26th indicates a new note. The output with the highest value above a threshold is the next note, including the rest output. The new note output indicates if this is a new note, or if it is the same note being held for another time step ( note resolution). ¥£ ¡ ¦¤¢  The 12 chord inputs (12 notes in a chromatic scale), are 1 or 0. A chord is represented as its ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, and seventh notes and it “wraps around” within the 12 inputs. E.g., the Fm7 chord F-Ab-C-Eb is represented as C, Eb, F, Ab or 100101001000. One plan input per song enables distinguishing between songs. The 26 context inputs use eligibility traces, giving the hidden units a decaying history of notes played. CHIME (as did Todd) uses teacher forcing [13], wherein the target outputs for the previous step are used as inputs (so erroneous outputs are not used as inputs). Todd used from 8 to 15 hidden units; CHIME uses 50. The learning rate is 0.075 (Todd used 0.05). The eligibility rate is 0.9 (Todd used 0.8). Differences in values perhaps reﬂect contrasting styles of the songs and available computing power. Todd used 15 output units and assumed a rest when all note units are “turned off.” CHIME uses 24 output note units (2 octaves). Long rests in the Rollins tunes require a dedicated output unit for a rest. Without it, the note outputs learned to turn off all the time. Below are results of four representative experiments. In all experiments, 15,000 presentations of the songs were made. Each song has 192 16th note events. All songs are played at a ﬁxed tempo. Weights are initialized to small random values. The squared error is the average squared error over one complete presentation of the song. “Finessing” the network may improve these values. The songs are easily recognized however, and an exact match could impair the network’s ability to improvise. Figure 2 shows the results for “Solid.” Experiment 1. Song: Blue Seven. Squared error starts at 185, decreases to 2.67. Experiment 2. Song: Tenor Madness. Squared error starts at 218, decreases to 1.05. Experiment 3. Song: Solid. Squared error starts at 184, decreases to 3.77. Experiment 4. Song: All three songs: Squared error starts at 185, decreases to 36. Figure 1: Jordan recurrent net with addition of chord input 2.2 Phase 1 Human Computer Interaction in Real Time In trading fours with the trained network, human note events are brought in via the MIDI interface [7]. Four bars of human notes are recorded then given, one note event at a time to the context inputs (replacing the recurrent inputs). The plan inputs are all 1. The chord inputs follow the “Solid” form. The machine generates its four bars and they are played in real time. Then the human plays again, etc. An accompaniment (drums, bass, and piano), produced by Band-in-a-Box software (PG Music), keeps the beat and provides chords for the human. Figure 3 shows an interaction. The machine’s improvisations are in the second and fourth lines. In bar 5 the ﬂat 9 of the Eb7 appears; the E. This note is used on the Eb7 and Bb7 chords by Rollins in “Blue 7”, as a “passing tone.” D is played in bar 5 on the Eb7. D is the natural 7 over Eb7 (with its ﬂat 7) but is a note that Rollins uses heavily in all three songs, and once over the Eb7. It may be a response to the rest and the Bb played by the human in bar 1. D follows both a rest and a Bb in many places in “Tenor Madness” and “Solid.” In bar 6, the long G and the Ab (the third then fourth of Eb7) ﬁgure prominently in “Solid.” At the beginning of bar 7 is the 2-note sequence Ab-E that appears in exactly the same place in the song “Blue 7.” The focus of bars 7 and 8 is jumping between the 3rd and 4th of Bb7. At the end of bar 8 the machine plays the ﬂat 9 (Ab) then the ﬂat 3 (Bb), of G7+9. In bars 13-16 the tones are longer, as are the human’s in bars 9-12. The tones are the 5th, the root, the 3rd, the root, the ﬂat 7, the 3rd, the 7th, and the raised fourth. Except for the last 2, these are chord tones. 3 CHIME Phase 2 In Phase 2, the network is expanded and trained by reinforcement learning to improvise according to the rules of Section 1.2 and using its knowledge of the Sonny Rollins songs. 3.1 The Expanded Network Figure 4 shows the phase 2 network. The same inputs plus 26 human inputs brings the total to 68. The weights obtained in phase 1 initialize this network. The plan and chord weights Figure 2: At left “Solid” played by a human; at right the song reproduced by the ANN. are the same. The weights connecting context units to the hidden layer are halved. The same weights, halved, connect the 26 human inputs to the hidden layer. Each output unit gets the 100 hidden units’ outputs as input. The original 50 weights are halved and used as initial values of the two sets of 50 hidden unit weights to the output unit. 3.2 SSR and Critic Algorithms Using actor-critic reinforcement learning ([2, 10, 13]), the actor chooses the next note to play. The critic receives a “raw” reinforcement signal from the critique made by the . A rules of Section 1.2. For output j, the SSR (actor) computes mean Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation chooses the output . is generated, the critic modiﬁes and produces . is further modiﬁed by a self-scaling algorithm that tracks, via moving average, the maximum and minimum reinforcement and uses them to scale the signal to produce .</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79992998 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Active_Information_Retrieval.html">24 nips-2001-Active Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Tommi Jaakkola, Hava T. Siegelmann</p><p>Abstract: In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>3 0.6793263 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>4 0.67797142 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The most popular algorithms for object detection require the use of exhaustive spatial and scale search procedures. In such approaches, an object is defined by means of local features. fu this paper we show that including contextual information in object detection procedures provides an efficient way of cutting down the need for exhaustive search. We present results with real images showing that the proposed scheme is able to accurately predict likely object classes, locations and sizes. 1</p><p>5 0.67697734 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>6 0.674972 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Global_Coordination_of_Local_Linear_Models.html">84 nips-2001-Global Coordination of Local Linear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Zibulevsky, Pavel Kisilev, Yehoshua Y. Zeevi, Barak A. Pearlmutter</p><p>Abstract: We consider a problem of blind source separation from a set of instantaneous linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. It was discovered recently, that exploiting the sparsity of sources in an appropriate representation according to some signal dictionary, dramatically improves the quality of separation. In this work we use the property of multi scale transforms, such as wavelet or wavelet packets, to decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees of sparsity. We use this intrinsic property for selecting the best (most sparse) subsets of features for further separation. The performance of the algorithm is verified on noise-free and noisy data. Experiments with simulated signals, musical sounds and images demonstrate significant improvement of separation quality over previously reported results. 1</p><p>3 0.04654751 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>4 0.046135653 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Steering_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Reinforcement_Learning.html">187 nips-2001-The Steering Approach for Multi-Criteria Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>5 0.043196853 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>6 0.042361896 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Model-Free_Least-Squares_Policy_Iteration.html">121 nips-2001-Model-Free Least-Squares Policy Iteration</a></p>

<p>Author: S. Koenig, M. Likhachev</p><p>Abstract: Incremental search techniques ﬁnd optimal solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. While researchers have developed incremental versions of uninformed search methods, we develop an incremental version of A*. The ﬁrst search of Lifelong Planning A* is the same as that of A* but all subsequent searches are much faster because it reuses those parts of the previous search tree that are identical to the new search tree. We then present experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of Lifelong Planning A* for simple route planning tasks. 1 Overview Artiﬁcial intelligence has investigated knowledge-based search techniques that allow one to solve search tasks in large domains. Most of the research on these methods has studied how to solve one-shot search problems. However, search is often a repetitive process, where one needs to solve a series of similar search tasks, for example, because the actual situation turns out to be slightly different from the one initially assumed or because the situation changes over time. An example for route planning tasks are changing trafﬁc conditions. Thus, one needs to replan for the new situation, for example if one always wants to display the least time-consuming route from the airport to the conference center on a web page. In these situations, most search methods replan from scratch, that is, solve the search problems independently. Incremental search techniques share with case-based planning, plan adaptation, repair-based planning, and learning search-control knowledge the property that they ﬁnd solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. Incremental search techniques, however, differ from the other techniques in that the quality of their solutions is guaranteed to be as good as the quality of the solutions obtained by replanning from scratch. Although incremental search methods are not widely known in artiﬁcial intelligence and control, different researchers have developed incremental search versions of uninformed search methods in the algorithms literature. An overview can be found in [FMSN00]. We, on the other hand, develop an incremental version of A*, thus combining ideas from the algorithms literature and the artiﬁcial intelligence literature. We call the algorithm Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), in analogy to “lifelong learning” [Thr98], because it reuses £ We thank Anthony Stentz for his support.

LPA* uses heuristics to focus the search and always ﬁnds a shortest path for the current edge costs. The ﬁrst search of LPA* is the same as that of A* but all subsequent searches are much faster. LPA* produces at least the search tree that A* builds. However, it achieves a substantial speedup over A* because it reuses those parts of the previous search tree that are identical to the new search tree. 2 The Route Planning Task Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) solves the following search task: It applies to ﬁnite graph search problems on known graphs whose edge costs can increase or decrease over time. denotes the ﬁnite set of vertices of the graph. denotes the set of successors of vertex .

<p>Author: Hans-Georg Zimmermann, Ralph Neuneier, Ralph Grothmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with a neural network architecture which establishes a portfolio management system similar to the Black / Litterman approach. This allocation scheme distributes funds across various securities or ﬁnancial markets while simultaneously complying with speciﬁc allocation constraints which meet the requirements of an investor. The portfolio optimization algorithm is modeled by a feedforward neural network. The underlying expected return forecasts are based on error correction neural networks (ECNN), which utilize the last model error as an auxiliary input to evaluate their own misspeciﬁcation. The portfolio optimization is implemented such that (i.) the allocations comply with investor’s constraints and that (ii.) the risk of the portfolio can be controlled. We demonstrate the proﬁtability of our approach by constructing internationally diversiﬁed portfolios across different ﬁnancial markets of the G7 contries. It turns out, that our approach is superior to a preset benchmark portfolio. ¢ £¡ 1 Introduction: Portfolio-Management We integrate the portfolio optimization algorithm suggested by Black / Litterman [1] into a neural network architecture. Combining the mean-variance theory [5] with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [7], this approach utilizes excess returns of the CAPM equilibrium to deﬁne a neutral, well balanced benchmark portfolio. Deviations from the benchmark allocation are only allowed within preset boundaries. Hence, as an advantage, there are no unrealistic solutions (e. g. large short positions, huge portfolio changes). Moreover, there is no need of formulating return expectations for all assets. In contrast to Black / Litterman, excess return forecasts are estimated by time-delay recurrent error correction neural networks [8]. Investment decisions which comply with given allocation constraints are derived from these predictions. The risk exposure of the portfolio is implicitly controlled by a parameter-optimizing task over time (sec. 3 and 5). Our approach consists of the following three steps: (i.) Construction of forecast models on the basis of error correction neural networks (ECNN) for all assets (sec. 2).   ¤§© © © § ¥ ¦¨¦¤ To whom correspondence should be addressed: Georg.Zimmermann@mchp.siemens.de.  ¤ ¤ (ii.) Computation of excess returns by a higher-level feedforward network (sec. 3 and 4). By this, the proﬁtability of an asset with respect to all others is measured. on the basis of the excess returns. (iii.) Optimization of the investment proportions Allocation constraints ensure, that the investment proportions may deviate from a given benchmark only within predeﬁned intervals (sec. 3 and 4). £ § ¨¡ ¥ £¡ ¦¤¢  ¡ © ¡ © Finally, we apply our neural network based portfolio management system to an asset allocation problem concerning the G7 countries (sec. 6). 2 Forecasting by Error Correction Neural Networks Most dynamical systems are driven by a superposition of autonomous development and external inﬂuences [8].

<p>Author: Xin Wang, Thomas G. Dietterich</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of non-convergence of online reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q learning and SARSA(A)) by adopting an incremental-batch approach that separates the exploration process from the function fitting process. Our BFBP (Batch Fit to Best Paths) algorithm alternates between an exploration phase (during which trajectories are generated to try to find fragments of the optimal policy) and a function fitting phase (during which a function approximator is fit to the best known paths from start states to terminal states). An advantage of this approach is that batch value-function fitting is a global process, which allows it to address the tradeoffs in function approximation that cannot be handled by local, online algorithms. This approach was pioneered by Boyan and Moore with their GROWSUPPORT and ROUT algorithms. We show how to improve upon their work by applying a better exploration process and by enriching the function fitting procedure to incorporate Bellman error and advantage error measures into the objective function. The results show improved performance on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>5 0.37739313 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Scaling_Laws_and_Local_Minima_in_Hebbian_ICA.html">165 nips-2001-Scaling Laws and Local Minima in Hebbian ICA</a></p>

For both on-line and batch learning we ﬁnd that a surprisingly large number of examples are required to avoid trapping in a sub-optimal state close to the initial conditions. To extract a skewed signal at least examples are required for -dimensional data and examples are required to extract a symmetrical signal with non-zero kurtosis. § ¡ ©£¢  £ §¥ ¡ ¨¦¤£¢</p><p>6 0.37053257 <a title="177-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Blind_Source_Separation_via_Multinode_Sparse_Representation.html">44 nips-2001-Blind Source Separation via Multinode Sparse Representation</a></p>

We present a reinforcement learning formulation of the problem that decomposes the value function into many small independent value functions and enables an efﬁcient action selection.</p><p>2 0.38106999 <a title="177-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Convergence_of_Optimistic_and_Incremental_Q-Learning.html">55 nips-2001-Convergence of Optimistic and Incremental Q-Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: Vie sho,v the convergence of tV/O deterministic variants of Qlearning. The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>3 0.37894455 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu-Han Chang, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new classiﬁcation for multi-agent learning algorithms, with each league of players characterized by both their possible strategies and possible beliefs. Using this classiﬁcation, we review the optimality of existing algorithms, including the case of interleague play. We propose an incremental improvement to the existing algorithms that seems to achieve average payoffs that are at least the Nash equilibrium payoffs in the longrun against fair opponents.</p><p>5 0.37506002 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Batch_Value_Function_Approximation_via_Support_Vectors.html">40 nips-2001-Batch Value Function Approximation via Support Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Xin Wang</p><p>Abstract: We present three ways of combining linear programming with the kernel trick to find value function approximations for reinforcement learning. One formulation is based on SVM regression; the second is based on the Bellman equation; and the third seeks only to ensure that good moves have an advantage over bad moves. All formulations attempt to minimize the number of support vectors while fitting the data. Experiments in a difficult, synthetic maze problem show that all three formulations give excellent performance, but the advantage formulation is much easier to train. Unlike policy gradient methods, the kernel methods described here can easily 'adjust the complexity of the function approximator to fit the complexity of the value function. 1</p><p>6 0.37440094 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>

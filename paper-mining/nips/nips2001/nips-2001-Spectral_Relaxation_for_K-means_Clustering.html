<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>3 0.27246734 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Kernel_Methods_for_Clustering.html">170 nips-2001-Spectral Kernel Methods for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor, Jaz S. Kandola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce new algorithms for unsupervised learning based on the use of a kernel matrix. All the information required by such algorithms is contained in the eigenvectors of the matrix or of closely related matrices. We use two different but related cost functions, the Alignment and the 'cut cost'. The first one is discussed in a companion paper [3], the second one is based on graph theoretic concepts. Both functions measure the level of clustering of a labeled dataset, or the correlation between data clusters and labels. We state the problem of unsupervised learning as assigning labels so as to optimize these cost functions. We show how the optimal solution can be approximated by slightly relaxing the corresponding optimization problem, and how this corresponds to using eigenvector information. The resulting simple algorithms are tested on real world data with positive results. 1</p><p>4 0.25088137 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Method_of_Quantum_Clustering.html">185 nips-2001-The Method of Quantum Clustering</a></p>

The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>6 0.22850537 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Novel_iteration_schemes_for_the_Cluster_Variation_Method.html">132 nips-2001-Novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method</a></p>

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Oren Souroujon</p><p>Abstract: We present a powerful meta-clustering technique called Iterative Double Clustering (IDC). The IDC method is a natural extension of the recent Double Clustering (DC) method of Slonim and Tishby that exhibited impressive performance on text categorization tasks [12]. Using synthetically generated data we empirically ﬁnd that whenever the DC procedure is successful in recovering some of the structure hidden in the data, the extended IDC procedure can incrementally compute a signiﬁcantly more accurate classiﬁcation. IDC is especially advantageous when the data exhibits high attribute noise. Our simulation results also show the eﬀectiveness of IDC in text categorization problems. Surprisingly, this unsupervised procedure can be competitive with a (supervised) SVM trained with a small training set. Finally, we propose a simple and natural extension of IDC for semi-supervised and transductive learning where we are given both labeled and unlabeled examples. 1</p><p>5 0.64485651 <a title="171-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Active_Information_Retrieval.html">24 nips-2001-Active Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Evan Greensmith, Peter L. Bartlett, Jonathan Baxter</p><p>Abstract: We consider the use of two additive control variate methods to reduce the variance of performance gradient estimates in reinforcement learning problems. The ﬁrst approach we consider is the baseline method, in which a function of the current state is added to the discounted value estimate. We relate the performance of these methods, which use sample paths, to the variance of estimates based on iid data. We derive the baseline function that minimizes this variance, and we show that the variance for any baseline is the sum of the optimal variance and a weighted squared distance to the optimal baseline. We show that the widely used average discounted value baseline (where the reward is replaced by the difference between the reward and its expectation) is suboptimal. The second approach we consider is the actor-critic method, which uses an approximate value function. We give bounds on the expected squared error of its estimates. We show that minimizing distance to the true value function is suboptimal in general; we provide an example for which the true value function gives an estimate with positive variance, but the optimal value function gives an unbiased estimate with zero variance. Our bounds suggest algorithms to estimate the gradient of the performance of parameterized baseline or value functions. We present preliminary experiments that illustrate the performance improvements on a simple control problem. 1 Introduction, Background, and Preliminary Results In reinforcement learning problems, the aim is to select a controller that will maximize the average reward in some environment. We model the environment as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Gradient ascent methods (e.g., [7, 12, 15]) estimate the gradient of the average reward, usually using Monte Carlo techniques to cal∗ Most of this work was performed while the authors were with the Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University. culate an average over a sample path of the controlled POMDP. However such estimates tend to have a high variance, which means many steps are needed to obtain a good estimate. GPOMDP [4] is an algorithm for generating an estimate of the gradient in this way. Compared with other approaches, it is suitable for large systems, when the time between visits to a state is large but the mixing time of the controlled POMDP is short. However, it can suffer from the problem of producing high variance estimates. In this paper, we investigate techniques for variance reduction in GPOMDP. One generic approach to reducing the variance of Monte Carlo estimates of integrals is to use an additive control variate (see, for example, [6]). Suppose we wish to estimate the integral of f : X → R, and we know the integral of another function ϕ : X → R. Since X f = X (f − ϕ) + X ϕ, the integral of f − ϕ can be estimated instead. Obviously if ϕ = f then the variance is zero. More generally, Var(f − ϕ) = Var(f ) − 2Cov(f, ϕ) + Var(ϕ), so that if φ and f are strongly correlated, the variance of the estimate is reduced. In this paper, we consider two approaches of this form. The ﬁrst (Section 2) is the technique of adding a baseline. We ﬁnd the optimal baseline and we show that the additional variance of a suboptimal baseline can be expressed as a weighted squared distance from the optimal baseline. Constant baselines, which do not depend on the state or observations, have been widely used [13, 15, 9, 11]. In particular, the expectation over all states of the discounted value of the state is a popular constant baseline (where, for example, the reward at each step is replaced by the difference between the reward and the expected reward). We give bounds on the estimation variance that show that, perhaps surprisingly, this may not be the best choice. The second approach (Section 3) is the use of an approximate value function. Such actorcritic methods have been investigated extensively [3, 1, 14, 10]. Generally the idea is to minimize some notion of distance between the ﬁxed value function and the true value function. In this paper we show that this may not be the best approach: selecting the ﬁxed value function to be equal to the true value function is not always the best choice. Even more surprisingly, we give an example for which the use of a ﬁxed value function that is different from the true value function reduces the variance to zero, for no increase in bias. We give a bound on the expected squared error (that is, including the estimation variance) of the gradient estimate produced with a ﬁxed value function. Our results suggest new algorithms to learn the optimum baseline, and to learn a ﬁxed value function that minimizes the bound on the error of the estimate. In Section 5, we describe the results of preliminary experiments, which show that these algorithms give performance improvements. POMDP with Reactive, Parameterized Policy A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) consists of a state space, S, a control space, U, an observation space, Y, a set of transition probability matrices {P(u) : u ∈ U}, each with components pij (u) for i, j ∈ S, u ∈ U, an observation process ν : S → PY , where PY is the space of probability distributions over Y, and a reward function r : S → R. We assume that S, U, Y are ﬁnite, although all our results extend easily to inﬁnite U and Y, and with more restrictive assumptions can be extended to inﬁnite S. A reactive, parameterized policy for a POMDP is a set of mappings {µ(·, θ) : Y → PU |θ ∈ RK }. Together with the POMDP, this deﬁnes the controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ). The joint state, observation and control process, {Xt , Yt , Ut }, is Markov. The state process, {Xt }, is also Markov, with transition probabilities pij (θ) = y∈Y,u∈U νy (i)µu (y, θ)pij (u), where νy (i) denotes the probability of observation y given the state i, and µu (y, θ) denotes the probability of action u given parameters θ and observation y. The Markov chain M(θ) = (S, P(θ)) then describes the behaviour of the process {Xt }. Assumption 1 The controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) satisﬁes: For all θ ∈ RK there exists a unique stationary distribution satisfying π (θ) P(θ) = π (θ). There is an R < ∞ such that, for all i ∈ S, |r(i)| ≤ R. There is a B < ∞ such that, for all u ∈ U, y ∈ Y and θ ∈ RK the derivatives ∂µu (y, θ)/∂θk (1 ≤ k ≤ K) exist, and the vector of these derivatives satisﬁes µu (y, θ)/µu (y, θ) ≤ B, where · denotes the Euclidean norm on RK . def T −1 1 We consider the average reward, η(θ) = limT →∞ E T t=0 r(Xt ) . Assumption 1 implies that this limit exists, and does not depend on the start state X0 . The aim is to def select a policy to maximize this quantity. Deﬁne the discounted value function, J β (i, θ) = T −1 t limT →∞ E t=0 β r(Xt ) X0 = i . Throughout the rest of the paper, dependences upon θ are assumed, and dropped in the notation. For a random vector A, we denote Var(A) = E (A − E [A])2 , where a2 denotes a a, and a denotes the transpose of the column vector a. GPOMDP Algorithm The GPOMDP algorithm [4] uses a sample path to estimate the gradient approximation def µu(y) η, but the βη = E β η approaches the true gradient µu(y) Jβ (j) . As β → 1, def variance increases. We consider a slight modiﬁcation [2]: with Jt = def ∆T = 1 T T −1 t=0 2T s=t µUt (Yt ) Jt+1 . µUt (Yt ) β s−t r(Xs ), (1) Throughout this paper the process {Xt , Yt , Ut , Xt+1 } is generally understood to be generated by a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, with X0 ∼π (ie the initial state distributed according to the stationary distribution). That is, before computing the gradient estimates, we wait until the process has settled down to the stationary distribution. Dependent Samples Correlation terms arise in the variance quantities to be analysed. We show here that considering iid samples gives an upper bound on the variance of the general case. The mixing time of a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain M = (S, P ) is deﬁned as def τ = min t > 1 : max dT V i,j Pt i , Pt j ≤ e−1 , where [P t ]i denotes the ith row of P t and dT V is the total variation distance, dT V (P, Q) = i |P (i) − Q(i)|. Theorem 1 Let M = (S, P ) be a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain, with mixing time τ , and 2|S|e and 0 ≤ α < let π be its stationary distribution. There are constants L < exp(−1/(2τ )), which depend only on M , such that, for all f : S → R and all t, Covπ (t) ≤ Lαt Varπ (f), where Varπ (f) is the variance of f under π, and Covπ (t) is f f the auto-covariance of the process {f(Xt )}, where the process {Xt } is generated by M with initial distribution π. Hence, for some constant Ω∗ ≤ 4Lτ , Var 1 T T −1 f(Xt ) t=0 ≤ Ω∗ Varπ (f). T We call (L, τ ) the mixing constants of the Markov chain M (or of the controlled POMDP D; ie the Markov chain (S, P )). We omit the proof (all proofs are in the full version [8]). Brieﬂy, we show that for a ﬁnite ergodic Markov chain M , Covπ (t) ≤ Rt (M )Varπ (f), f 2 t for some Rt (M ). We then show that Rt (M ) < 2|S| exp(− τ ). In fact, for a reversible chain, we can choose L = 1 and α = |λ2 |, the second largest magnitude eigenvalue of P . 2 Baseline We consider an alteration of (1), def ∆T = 1 T T −1 µUt (Yt ) (Jt+1 − Ar (Yt )) . µUt (Yt ) t=0 (2) For any baseline Ar : Y → R, it is easy to show that E [∆T ] = E [∆T ]. Thus, we select Ar to minimize variance. The following theorem shows that this variance is bounded by a variance involving iid samples, with Jt replaced by the exact value function. Theorem 2 Suppose that D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) is a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, D has mixing constants (L, τ ), {Xt , Yt , Ut , Xt+1 } is a process generated by D with X0 ∼π ,Ar : Y → R is a baseline that is uniformly bounded by M, and J (j) has the distribution of ∞ β s r(Xt ), where the states Xt are generated by D starting in s=0 X0 = j. Then there are constants C ≤ 5B2 R(R + M) and Ω ≤ 4Lτ ln(eT ) such that Var 1 T T −1 t=0 µUt (Yt ) Ω (Jt+1 −Ar (Yt )) ≤ Varπ µUt (Yt ) T + Ω E T µu (y) (J (j) − Jβ (j)) µu (y) µu (y) (Jβ (j)−Ar (y)) µu (y) 2 + Ω +1 T C βT , (1 − β)2 where, as always, (i, y, u, j) are generated iid with i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y) and j∼P i (u). The proof uses Theorem 1 and [2, Lemma 4.3]. Here we have bounded the variance of (2) with the variance of a quantity we may readily analyse. The second term on the right hand side shows the error associated with replacing an unbiased, uncorrelated estimate of the value function with the true value function. This quantity is not dependent on the baseline. The ﬁnal term on the right hand side arises from the truncation of the discounted reward— and is exponentially decreasing. We now concentrate on minimizing the variance σ 2 = Varπ r µu (y) (Jβ (j) − Ar (y)) , µu (y) (3) which the following lemma relates to the variance σ 2 without a baseline, µu (y) Jβ (j) . µu (y) σ 2 = Varπ Lemma 3 Let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1. For any baseline Ar : Y → R, and for i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y) and j∼Pi (u), σ 2 = σ 2 + E A2 (y) E r r µu (y) µu (y) 2 y − 2Ar (y)E µu (y) µu (y) 2 Jβ (j) y . From Lemma 3 it can be seen that the task of ﬁnding the optimal baseline is in effect that of minimizing a quadratic for each observation y ∈ Y. This gives the following theorem. Theorem 4 For the controlled POMDP as in Lemma 3,  2 µu (y) min σ 2 = σ 2 − E  E Jβ (j) y r Ar µu (y) 2 /E µu (y) µu (y) 2 y and this minimum is attained with the baseline 2 µu (y) µu (y) A∗ (y) = E r Jβ (j) , 2 µu (y) µu (y) /E y  y . Furthermore, the optimal constant baseline is µu (y) µu (y) A∗ = E r 2 Jβ (j) /E µu (y) µu (y) 2 . The following theorem shows that the variance of an estimate with an arbitrary baseline can be expressed as the sum of the variance with the optimal baseline and a certain squared weighted distance between the baseline function and the optimal baseline function. Theorem 5 If Ar : Y → R is a baseline function, A∗ is the optimal baseline deﬁned in r Theorem 4, and σ 2 is the variance of the corresponding estimate, then r∗ µu (y) µu (y) σ 2 = σ2 + E r r∗ 2 (Ar (y) − A∗ (y)) r 2 , where i∼π, y ∼ν(i), and u∼µ(y). Furthermore, the same result is true for the case of constant baselines, with Ar (y) replaced by an arbitrary constant baseline Ar , and A∗ (y) r replaced by A∗ , the optimum constant baseline deﬁned in Theorem 4. r For the constant baseline Ar = E i∼π [Jβ (i)], Theorem 5 implies that σ 2 is equal to r min Ar ∈R σ2 r + E µu (y) µu (y) 2 E [Jβ (j)] − E µu (y) µu (y) 2 2 /E Jβ (j) µu (y) µu (y) 2 . Thus, its performance depends on the random variables ( µu (y)/µu (y))2 and Jβ (j); if they are nearly independent, E [Jβ ] is a good choice. 3 Fixed Value Functions: Actor-Critic Methods We consider an alteration of (1), ˜ def 1 ∆T = T T −1 t=0 µUt (Yt ) ˜ Jβ (Xt+1 ), µUt (Yt ) (4) ˜ for some ﬁxed value function Jβ : S → R. Deﬁne ∞ def β k d(Xk , Xk+1 ) Aβ (j) = E X0 = j , k=0 def ˜ ˜ where d(i, j) = r(i) + β Jβ (j) − Jβ (i) is the temporal difference. Then it is easy to show that the estimate (4) has a bias of µu (y) ˜ Aβ (j) . β η − E ∆T = E µu (y) The following theorem gives a bound on the expected squared error of (4). The main tool in the proof is Theorem 1. Theorem 6 Let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1. For a sample path from D, that is, {X0∼π, Yt∼ν(Xt ), Ut∼µ(Yt ), Xt+1∼PXt (Ut )}, E ˜ ∆T − βη 2 ≤ Ω∗ Varπ T µu (y) ˜ Jβ (j) + E µu (y) µu (y) Aβ (j) µu (y) 2 , where the second expectation is over i∼π, y∼ν(i), u∼µ(y), and j∼P i (u). ˜ If we write Jβ (j) = Jβ (j) + v(j), then by selecting v = (v(1), . . . , v(|S|)) from the right def null space of the K × |S| matrix G, where G = i,y,u πi νy (i) µu (y)Pi (u), (4) will produce an unbiased estimate of β η. An obvious example of such a v is a constant vector, (c, c, . . . , c) : c ∈ R. We can use this to construct a trivial example where (4) produces an unbiased estimate with zero variance. Indeed, let D = (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ) be a controlled POMDP satisfying Assumption 1, with r(i) = c, for some 0 < c ≤ R. Then Jβ (j) = c/(1 − β) and β η = 0. If we choose v = (−c/(1 − β), . . . , −c/(1 − β)) and ˜ ˜ Jβ (j) = Jβ (j) + v(j), then µµu(y) Jβ (j) = 0 for all y, u, j, and so (4) gives an unbiased u(y) estimate of β η, with zero variance. Furthermore, for any D for which there exists a pair y, u such that µu (y) > 0 and µu (y) = 0, choosing ˜β (j) = Jβ (j) gives a variance J greater than zero—there is a non-zero probability event, (Xt = i, Yt = y, Ut = u, Xt+1 = j), such that µµu(y) Jβ (j) = 0. u(y) 4 Algorithms Given a parameterized class of baseline functions Ar (·, θ) : Y → R θ ∈ RL , we can use Theorem 5 to bound the variance of our estimates. Computing the gradient of this bound with respect to the parameters θ of the baseline function allows a gradient optimization of the baseline. The GDORB Algorithm produces an estimate ∆ S of these gradients from a sample path of length S. Under the assumption that the baseline function and its gradients are uniformly bounded, we can show that these estimates converge to the gradient of σ 2 . We omit the details (see [8]). r GDORB Algorithm: Given: Controlled POMDP (S, U, Y, P , ν, r, µ), parameterized baseline Ar . set z0 = 0 (z0 ∈ RL ), ∆0 = 0 (∆0 ∈ RL ) for all {is , ys , us , is+1 , ys+1 } generated by the POMDP do zs+1 = βzs + ∆s+1 = ∆s + end for Ar (ys ) 1 s+1 µus(ys ) µus(ys ) 2 ((Ar (ys ) − βAr (ys+1 ) − r(xs+1 )) zs+1 − ∆s ) ˜ For a parameterized class of ﬁxed value functions {Jβ (·, θ) : S → R θ ∈ RL }, we can use Theorem 6 to bound the expected squared error of our estimates, and compute the gradient of this bound with respect to the parameters θ of the baseline function. The GBTE Algorithm produces an estimate ∆S of these gradients from a sample path of length S. Under the assumption that the value function and its gradients are uniformly bounded, we can show that these estimates converge to the true gradient.

The exact value function plots show how different choices of baseline and ﬁxed value function compare when all algorithms have access to the exact value function Jβ . Using the expected value function as a baseline was an improvement over GPOMDP. Using the optimum, or optimum constant, baseline was a further improvement, each performing comparably to the other. Using the pre-trained ﬁxed value function was also an improvement over GPOMDP, showing that selecting the true value function was indeed not the best choice in this case. The trained ﬁxed value function was not optimal though, as Jβ (j) − A∗ is a valid choice of ﬁxed value function. r The optimum baseline, and ﬁxed value function, will not normally be known. The online plots show experiments where the baseline and ﬁxed value function were trained using online gradient descent whilst the performance gradient was being estimated, using the same data. Clear improvement over GPOMDP is seen for the online trained baseline variant. For the online trained ﬁxed value function, improvement is seen until T becomes—given the simplicity of the system—very large. References [1] L. Baird and A. Moore.

<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Dan Roth, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning in Boolean domains using kernels which capture feature expansions equivalent to using conjunctions over basic features. We demonstrate a tradeoff between the computational efﬁciency with which these kernels can be computed and the generalization ability of the resulting classiﬁer. We ﬁrst describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efﬁciently run the Perceptron algorithm over an exponential number of conjunctions; however we also prove that using such kernels the Perceptron algorithm can make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We also consider an analogous use of kernel functions to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. While known upper bounds imply that Winnow can learn DNF formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnow’s behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set, and thus that such kernel functions for Winnow are not efﬁciently computable.</p><p>4 0.72988188 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>5 0.72769582 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.72681487 <a title="171-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Global_Coordination_of_Local_Linear_Models.html">84 nips-2001-Global Coordination of Local Linear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Julian Eggert, Berthold BĂ¤uml</p><p>Abstract: Mesoscopical, mathematical descriptions of dynamics of populations of spiking neurons are getting increasingly important for the understanding of large-scale processes in the brain using simulations. In our previous work, integral equation formulations for population dynamics have been derived for a special type of spiking neurons. For Integrate- and- Fire type neurons , these formulations were only approximately correct. Here, we derive a mathematically compact, exact population dynamics formulation for Integrate- and- Fire type neurons. It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>4 0.27859735 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Giorgio A. Ascoli, Alexei V. Samsonovich</p><p>Abstract: Visual inspection of neurons suggests that dendritic orientation may be determined both by internal constraints (e.g. membrane tension) and by external vector fields (e.g. neurotrophic gradients). For example, basal dendrites of pyramidal cells appear nicely fan-out. This regular orientation is hard to justify completely with a general tendency to grow straight, given the zigzags observed experimentally. Instead, dendrites could (A) favor a fixed (“external”) direction, or (B) repel from their own soma. To investigate these possibilities quantitatively, reconstructed hippocampal cells were subjected to Bayesian analysis. The statistical model combined linearly factors A and B, as well as the tendency to grow straight. For all morphological classes, B was found to be significantly positive and consistently greater than A. In addition, when dendrites were artificially re-oriented according to this model, the resulting structures closely resembled real morphologies. These results suggest that somatodendritic repulsion may play a role in determining dendritic orientation. Since hippocampal cells are very densely packed and their dendritic trees highly overlap, the repulsion must be cellspecific. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying such specificity. 1 I n t r od uc t i on The study of brain dynamics and development at the cellular level would greatly benefit from a standardized, accurate and yet succinct statistical model characterizing the morphology of major neuronal classes. Such model could also provide a basis for simulation of anatomically realistic virtual neurons [1]. The model should accurately distinguish among different neuronal classes: a morphological difference between classes would be captured by a difference in model parameters and reproduced in generated virtual neurons. In addition, the model should be self-consistent: there should be no statistical difference in model parameters measured from real neurons of a given class and from virtual neurons of the same class. The assumption that a simple statistical model of this sort exists relies on the similarity of average environmental and homeostatic conditions encountered by individual neurons during development and on the limited amount of genetic information that underlies differentiation of neuronal classes. Previous research in computational neuroanatomy has mainly focused on the topology and internal geometry of dendrites (i.e., the properties described in “dendrograms”) [2,3]. Recently, we attempted to include spatial orientation in the models, thus generating 2 virtual neurons in 3D [4]. Dendritic growth was assumed to deviate from the straight direction both randomly and based on a constant bias in a given direction, or “tropism”. Different models of tropism (e.g. along a fixed axis, towards a plane, or away from the soma) had dramatic effects on the shape of virtual neurons [5]. Our current strategy is to split the problem of finding a statistical model describing neuronal morphology in two parts. First, we maintain that the topology and the internal geometry of a particular dendritic tree can be described independently of its 3D embedding (i.e., the set of local dendritic orientations). At the same time, one and the same internal geometry (e.g., the experimental dendrograms obtained from real neurons) may have many equally plausible 3D embeddings that are statistically consistent with the anatomical characteristics of that neuronal class. The present work aims at finding a minimal statistical model describing local dendritic orientation in experimentally reconstructed hippocampal principal cells. Hippocampal neurons have a polarized shape: their dendrites tend to grow from the soma as if enclosed in cones. In pyramidal cells, basal and apical dendrites invade opposite hemispaces (fig. 1A), while granule cell dendrites all invade the same hemispace. This behavior could be caused by a tendency to grow towards the layers of incoming fibers to establish synapses. Such tendency would correspond to a tropism in a direction roughly parallel to the cell main axis. Alternatively, dendrites could initially stem in the appropriate (possibly genetically determined) directions, and then continue to grow approximately in a radial direction from the soma. A close inspection of pyramidal (basal) trees suggests that dendrites may indeed be repelled from their soma (Fig. 1B). A typical dendrite may reorient itself (arrow) to grow nearly straight along a radius from the soma. Remarkably, this happens even after many turns, when the initial direction is lost. Such behavior may be hard to explain without tropism. If the deviations from straight growth were random, one should be able to “remodel”th e trees by measuring and reproducing the statistics of local turn angles, assuming its independence of dendritic orientation and location. Figure 1C shows the cell from 1A after such remodeling. In this case basal and apical dendrites retain only their initial (stemming) orientations from the original data. The resulting “cotton ball” uggests that dendritic turns are not in dependent s of dendritic orientation. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to quantify the dendritic tropism. 2 M e t h od s Digital files of fully reconstructed rat hippocampal pyramidal cells (24 CA3 and 23 CA1 neurons) were kindly provided by Dr. D.

It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>5 0.63645333 <a title="2-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Orientation-Selective_aVLSI_Spiking_Neurons.html">141 nips-2001-Orientation-Selective aVLSI Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Jörg Kramer, Giacomo Indiveri, Tobi Delbrück, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models. The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-ﬁre neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture. The circuit on this multi-neuron chip approximates a cortical microcircuit. The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.</p><p>6 0.61860234 <a title="2-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ádám Kepecs, S. Raghavachari</p><p>Abstract: Neurons receive excitatory inputs via both fast AMPA and slow NMDA type receptors. We find that neurons receiving input via NMDA receptors can have two stable membrane states which are input dependent. Action potentials can only be initiated from the higher voltage state. Similar observations have been made in several brain areas which might be explained by our model. The interactions between the two kinds of inputs lead us to suggest that some neurons may operate in 3 states: disabled, enabled and firing. Such enabled, but non-firing modes can be used to introduce context-dependent processing in neural networks. We provide a simple example and discuss possible implications for neuronal processing and response variability. 1</p><p>2 0.46278465 <a title="2-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-A_Variational_Approach_to_Learning_Curves.html">21 nips-2001-A Variational Approach to Learning Curves</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan L. Shapiro, J. Wearden</p><p>Abstract: Animal data on delayed-reward conditioning experiments shows a striking property - the data for different time intervals collapses into a single curve when the data is scaled by the time interval. This is called the scalar property of interval timing. Here a simple model of a neural clock is presented and shown to give rise to the scalar property. The model is an accumulator consisting of noisy, linear spiking neurons. It is analytically tractable and contains only three parameters. When coupled with reinforcement learning it simulates peak procedure experiments, producing both the scalar property and the pattern of single trial covariances. 1</p><p>4 0.45798415 <a title="2-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_theory_of_neural_integration_in_the_head-direction_system.html">23 nips-2001-A theory of neural integration in the head-direction system</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Hahnloser, Xiaohui Xie, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: Integration in the head-direction system is a computation by which horizontal angular head velocity signals from the vestibular nuclei are integrated to yield a neural representation of head direction. In the thalamus, the postsubiculum and the mammillary nuclei, the head-direction representation has the form of a place code: neurons have a preferred head direction in which their ﬁring is maximal [Blair and Sharp, 1995, Blair et al., 1998, ?]. Integration is a difﬁcult computation, given that head-velocities can vary over a large range. Previous models of the head-direction system relied on the assumption that the integration is achieved in a ﬁring-rate-based attractor network with a ring structure. In order to correctly integrate head-velocity signals during high-speed head rotations, very fast synaptic dynamics had to be assumed. Here we address the question whether integration in the head-direction system is possible with slow synapses, for example excitatory NMDA and inhibitory GABA(B) type synapses. For neural networks with such slow synapses, rate-based dynamics are a good approximation of spiking neurons [Ermentrout, 1994]. We ﬁnd that correct integration during high-speed head rotations imposes strong constraints on possible network architectures.</p><p>5 0.45053944 <a title="2-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_principles_in_unsupervised_learning_of_visual_structure%3A_human_data_and_a_model.html">151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</a></p>
<p>Author: Shimon Edelman, Benjamin P. Hiles, Hwajin Yang, Nathan Intrator</p><p>Abstract: To ﬁnd out how the representations of structured visual objects depend on the co-occurrence statistics of their constituents, we exposed subjects to a set of composite images with tight control exerted over (1) the conditional probabilities of the constituent fragments, and (2) the value of Barlow’s criterion of “suspicious coincidence” (the ratio of joint probability to the product of marginals). We then compared the part veriﬁcation response times for various probe/target combinations before and after the exposure. For composite probes, the speedup was much larger for targets that contained pairs of fragments perfectly predictive of each other, compared to those that did not. This effect was modulated by the signiﬁcance of their co-occurrence as estimated by Barlow’s criterion. For lone-fragment probes, the speedup in all conditions was generally lower than for composites. These results shed light on the brain’s strategies for unsupervised acquisition of structural information in vision. 1 Motivation How does the human visual system decide for which objects it should maintain distinct and persistent internal representations of the kind typically postulated by theories of object recognition? Consider, for example, the image shown in Figure 1, left. This image can be represented as a monolithic hieroglyph, a pair of Chinese characters (which we shall refer to as and ), a set of strokes, or, trivially, as a collection of pixels. Note that the second option is only available to a system previously exposed to various combinations of Chinese characters. Indeed, a principled decision whether to represent this image as , or otherwise can only be made on the basis of prior exposure to related images. £ ¡ £¦ ¡ £ ¥¨§¢   ¥¤¢   ¢ According to Barlow’s [1] insight, one useful principle is tallying suspicious coincidences: two candidate fragments and should be combined into a composite object if the probability of their joint appearance is much higher than , which is the probability expected in the case of their statistical independence. This criterion may be compared to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which has been previously discussed in the context of object representation [2, 3]. In a simpliﬁed form [4], MDL calls for representing explicitly as a whole if , just as the principle of suspicious coincidences does. £ ©¢  £  ¢ ¥¤¥  £¦ ¢ ¥  £  ¢   £¦ ¢ ¥¤¥! ¨§¥ £ ¢ £ ©¢  £¦  £ ¨§¢¥ ¡ ¢   While the Barlow/MDL criterion certainly indicates a suspicious coincidence, there are additional probabilistic considerations that may be used and .

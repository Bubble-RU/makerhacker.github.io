<p>Author: Thomas P. Trappenberg, Edmund T. Rolls, Simon M. Stringer</p><p>Abstract: Inferior temporal cortex (IT) neurons have large receptive ﬁelds when a single effective object stimulus is shown against a blank background, but have much smaller receptive ﬁelds when the object is placed in a natural scene. Thus, translation invariant object recognition is reduced in natural scenes, and this may help object selection. We describe a model which accounts for this by competition within an attractor in which the neurons are tuned to different objects in the scene, and the fovea has a higher cortical magniﬁcation factor than the peripheral visual ﬁeld. Furthermore, we show that top-down object bias can increase the receptive ﬁeld size, facilitating object search in complex visual scenes, and providing a model of object-based attention. The model leads to the prediction that introduction of a second object into a scene with blank background will reduce the receptive ﬁeld size to values that depend on the closeness of the second object to the target stimulus. We suggest that mechanisms of this type enable the output of IT to be primarily about one object, so that the areas that receive from IT can select the object as a potential target for action.</p><p>3 0.21702318 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Categorization_by_Learning_and_Combining_Object_Parts.html">46 nips-2001-Categorization by Learning and Combining Object Parts</a></p>

<p>Author: Randall C. O'Reilly, R. S. Busby</p><p>Abstract: We present a model of binding of relationship information in a spatial domain (e.g., square above triangle) that uses low-order coarse-coded conjunctive representations instead of more popular temporal synchrony mechanisms. Supporters of temporal synchrony argue that conjunctive representations lack both efﬁciency (i.e., combinatorial numbers of units are required) and systematicity (i.e., the resulting representations are overly speciﬁc and thus do not support generalization to novel exemplars). To counter these claims, we show that our model: a) uses far fewer hidden units than the number of conjunctions represented, by using coarse-coded, distributed representations where each unit has a broad tuning curve through high-dimensional conjunction space, and b) is capable of considerable generalization to novel inputs.</p><p>5 0.12849316 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Global_Coordination_of_Local_Linear_Models.html">84 nips-2001-Global Coordination of Local Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Sam T. Roweis, Lawrence K. Saul, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be described by a collection of local linear models. Such a description, however, does not provide a global parameterization of the manifold—arguably an important goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a collection of local linear models that solves this more difﬁcult problem. Our local linear models are represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the “global coordination” of these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a degeneracy in the mixture model’s parameter space, favoring models whose internal coordinate systems are aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coordinates change smoothly and continuously as one traverses a connected path on the manifold—even when the path crosses the domains of many different local models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and illustrates an unexpected application of variational methods: not to perform approximate inference in intractable probabilistic models, but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones. 1 Manifold Learning Consider an ensemble of images, each of which contains a face against a neutral background. Each image can be represented by a point in the high dimensional vector space of pixel intensities. This representation, however, does not exploit the strong correlations between pixels of the same image, nor does it support many useful operations for reasoning about faces. If, for example, we select two images with faces in widely different locations and then average their pixel intensities, we do not obtain an image of a face at their average location. Images of faces lie on or near a low-dimensional, curved manifold, and we can represent them more usefully by the coordinates on this manifold than by pixel intensities. Using these “intrinsic coordinates”, the average of two faces is another face with the average of their locations, poses and expressions. To analyze and manipulate faces, it is helpful to imagine a “magic black box” with levers or dials corresponding to the intrinsic coordinates on this manifold. Given a setting of the levers and dials, the box generates an image of a face. Given an image of a face, the box deduces the appropriate setting of the levers and dials. In this paper, we describe a fairly general way to construct such a box automatically from an ensemble of high-dimensional vectors. We assume only that there exists an underlying manifold of low dimensionality and that the relationship between the raw data and the manifold coordinates is locally linear and smoothly varying. Thus our method applies not only to images of faces, but also to many other forms of highly distributed perceptual and scientiﬁc data (e.g., spectrograms of speech, robotic sensors, gene expression arrays, document collections). 2 Local Linear Models The global structure of perceptual manifolds (such as images of faces) tends to be highly nonlinear. Fortunately, despite their complicated global structure, we can usually characterize these manifolds as locally linear. Thus, to a good approximation, they can be represented by collections of simpler models, each of which describes a locally linear neighborhood[3, 6, 8]. For unsupervised learning tasks, a probabilistic model that nicely captures this intuition is a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA)[5]. The model is used to describe high dimensional data that lies on or near a lower dimensional manifold. MFAs parameterize a joint distribution over observed and hidden variables: (1) where the observed variable, , represents the high dimensional data; the discrete hidden variables, , indexes different neighborhoods on the manifold; and the continuous hidden variables, , represent low dimensional local coordinates. The model assumes that data is sampled from different neighborhoods on the manifold with prior probabilities , and that within each neighborhood, the data’s local coordinates are normally distributed1 as:  RP&¤§¢  Q  ¡ I 0 (  3HGF D C¥@@@¥ 8¥75 ( E¨BAA9¨©©64§ 2 0 ( 31)£ ¥ ¡    ¡   ¥ ¡     ¥ §¥ ¡ &¤§¢'&§ %#¤¢$#¨</p><p>6 0.12514444 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_principles_in_unsupervised_learning_of_visual_structure%3A_human_data_and_a_model.html">151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</a></p>

<p>Author: Javid Sadr, Sayan Mukherjee, Keith Thoresz, Pawan Sinha</p><p>Abstract: A key question in neuroscience is how to encode sensory stimuli such as images and sounds. Motivated by studies of response properties of neurons in the early cortical areas, we propose an encoding scheme that dispenses with absolute measures of signal intensity or contrast and uses, instead, only local ordinal measures. In this scheme, the structure of a signal is represented by a set of equalities and inequalities across adjacent regions. In this paper, we focus on characterizing the ﬁdelity of this representation strategy. We develop a regularization approach for image reconstruction from ordinal measures and thereby demonstrate that the ordinal representation scheme can faithfully encode signal structure. We also present a neurally plausible implementation of this computation that uses only local update rules. The results highlight the robustness and generalization ability of local ordinal encodings for the task of pattern classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.51915884 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_principles_in_unsupervised_learning_of_visual_structure%3A_human_data_and_a_model.html">151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</a></p>

<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>3 0.89877534 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: The Temporal Coding Hypothesis of Miller and colleagues [7] suggests that animals integrate related temporal patterns of stimuli into single memory representations. We formalize this concept using quasi-Bayes estimation to update the parameters of a constrained hidden Markov model. This approach allows us to account for some surprising temporal effects in the second order conditioning experiments of Miller et al. [1 , 2, 3], which other models are unable to explain. 1</p><p>4 0.88952249 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory.html">161 nips-2001-Reinforcement Learning with Long Short-Term Memory</a></p>
<p>Author: Bram Bakker</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents reinforcement learning with a Long ShortTerm Memory recurrent neural network: RL-LSTM. Model-free RL-LSTM using Advantage(,x) learning and directed exploration can solve non-Markovian tasks with long-term dependencies between relevant events. This is demonstrated in a T-maze task, as well as in a difficult variation of the pole balancing task. 1</p><p>5 0.88051039 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">183 nips-2001-The Infinite Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew J. Beal, Zoubin Ghahramani, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably inﬁnite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the inﬁnitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters deﬁne a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a ﬁnite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be inﬁnite— consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.</p><p>6 0.87985206 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Self-regulation_Mechanism_of_Temporally_Asymmetric_Hebbian_Plasticity.html">166 nips-2001-Self-regulation Mechanism of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Plasticity</a></p>

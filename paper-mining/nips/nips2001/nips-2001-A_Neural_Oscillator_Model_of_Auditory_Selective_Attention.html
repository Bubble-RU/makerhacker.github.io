<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>4 0.1174712 <a title="14-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Group_Redundancy_Measures_Reveal_Redundancy_Reduction_in_the_Auditory_Pathway.html">87 nips-2001-Group Redundancy Measures Reveal Redundancy Reduction in the Auditory Pathway</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, M. J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic information is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hypothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are significant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells. The results suggest that the auditory system transforms low level representations that contain redundancies due to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, into a representation in which cortical neurons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic signals, that are useful for auditory scene analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.10855908 <a title="14-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.10133461 <a title="14-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Dynamic_HMM_for_On-line_Segmentation_of_Sequential_Data.html">7 nips-2001-A Dynamic HMM for On-line Segmentation of Sequential Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Antony I. T. Rowstron, Christopher M. Bishop, Michael J. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: With the increasing number of users of mobile computing devices (e.g. personal digital assistants) and the advent of third generation mobile phones, wireless communications are becoming increasingly important. Many applications rely on the device maintaining a replica of a data-structure which is stored on a server, for example news databases, calendars and e-mail. ill this paper we explore the question of the optimal strategy for synchronising such replicas. We utilise probabilistic models to represent how the data-structures evolve and to model user behaviour. We then formulate objective functions which can be minimised with respect to the synchronisation timings. We demonstrate, using two real world data-sets, that a user can obtain more up-to-date information using our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.47865254 <a title="14-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Dynamic_HMM_for_On-line_Segmentation_of_Sequential_Data.html">7 nips-2001-A Dynamic HMM for On-line Segmentation of Sequential Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jens Kohlmorgen, Steven Lemm</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits an inherent mode switching. In particular, the data might be a non-stationary time series from a dynamical system that switches between multiple operating modes. Unlike other approaches, our method processes the data incrementally and without any training of internal parameters. We use an HMM with a dynamically changing number of states and an on-line variant of the Viterbi algorithm that performs an unsupervised segmentation and classification of the data on-the-fly, i.e. the method is able to process incoming data in real-time. The main idea of the approach is to track and segment changes of the probability density of the data in a sliding window on the incoming data stream. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application to a switching dynamical system. 1</p><p>5 0.42189026 <a title="14-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Maximum-Likelihood_Approach_to_Modeling_Multisensory_Enhancement.html">11 nips-2001-A Maximum-Likelihood Approach to Modeling Multisensory Enhancement</a></p>
<p>Author: H. Colonius, A. Diederich</p><p>Abstract: Multisensory response enhancement (MRE) is the augmentation of the response of a neuron to sensory input of one modality by simultaneous input from another modality. The maximum likelihood (ML) model presented here modifies the Bayesian model for MRE (Anastasio et al.) by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize the number of correct decisions. Thus the ML model can also deal with the important tasks of stimulus discrimination and identification in the presence of incongruent visual and auditory cues. It accounts for the inverse effectiveness observed in neurophysiological recording data, and it predicts a functional relation between uni- and bimodal levels of discriminability that is testable both in neurophysiological and behavioral experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.40138689 <a title="14-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>

<p>Author: Chris Stauffer, Erik Miller, Kinh Tieu</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown impressive transform-invariant modeling and clustering for sets of images of objects with similar appearance. We seek to expand these capabilities to sets of images of an object class that show considerable variation across individual instances (e.g. pedestrian images) using a representation based on pixel-wise similarities, similarity templates. Because of its invariance to the colors of particular components of an object, this representation enables detection of instances of an object class and enables alignment of those instances. Further, this model implicitly represents the regions of color regularity in the class-speciﬁc image set enabling a decomposition of that object class into component regions. 1</p><p>3 0.4421148 <a title="14-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Partially_labeled_classification_with_Markov_random_walks.html">144 nips-2001-Partially labeled classification with Markov random walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the unlabeled examples. The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classiﬁcation with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classiﬁcation. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classiﬁcation problems.</p><p>4 0.38602179 <a title="14-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>6 0.38344872 <a title="14-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory.html">161 nips-2001-Reinforcement Learning with Long Short-Term Memory</a></p>

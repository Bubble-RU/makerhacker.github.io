<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>3 0.25088137 <a title="185-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongyuan Zha, Xiaofeng He, Chris Ding, Ming Gu, Horst D. Simon</p><p>Abstract: The popular K-means clustering partitions a data set by minimizing a sum-of-squares cost function. A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by computing a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by computing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function. 1</p><p>4 0.21765219 <a title="185-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Novel_iteration_schemes_for_the_Cluster_Variation_Method.html">132 nips-2001-Novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: The Cluster Variation method is a class of approximation methods containing the Bethe and Kikuchi approximations as special cases. We derive two novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method. One is a fixed point iteration scheme which gives a significant improvement over loopy BP, mean field and TAP methods on directed graphical models. The other is a gradient based method, that is guaranteed to converge and is shown to give useful results on random graphs with mild frustration. We conclude that the methods are of significant practical value for large inference problems. 1</p><p>5 0.20738943 <a title="185-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Active_Information_Retrieval.html">24 nips-2001-Active Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Tommi Jaakkola, Hava T. Siegelmann</p><p>Abstract: In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>6 0.13991258 <a title="185-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient_Clustering_Algorithm_Using_Stochastic_Association_Model_and_Its_Implementation_Using_Nanostructures.html">33 nips-2001-An Efficient Clustering Algorithm Using Stochastic Association Model and Its Implementation Using Nanostructures</a></p>

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Oren Souroujon</p><p>Abstract: We present a powerful meta-clustering technique called Iterative Double Clustering (IDC). The IDC method is a natural extension of the recent Double Clustering (DC) method of Slonim and Tishby that exhibited impressive performance on text categorization tasks [12]. Using synthetically generated data we empirically ﬁnd that whenever the DC procedure is successful in recovering some of the structure hidden in the data, the extended IDC procedure can incrementally compute a signiﬁcantly more accurate classiﬁcation. IDC is especially advantageous when the data exhibits high attribute noise. Our simulation results also show the eﬀectiveness of IDC in text categorization problems. Surprisingly, this unsupervised procedure can be competitive with a (supervised) SVM trained with a small training set. Finally, we propose a simple and natural extension of IDC for semi-supervised and transductive learning where we are given both labeled and unlabeled examples. 1</p><p>5 0.75805736 <a title="185-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Constructing_Distributed_Representations_Using_Additive_Clustering.html">53 nips-2001-Constructing Distributed Representations Using Additive Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Wheeler Ruml</p><p>Abstract: If the promise of computational modeling is to be fully realized in higherlevel cognitive domains such as language processing, principled methods must be developed to construct the semantic representations used in such models. In this paper, we propose the use of an established formalism from mathematical psychology, additive clustering, as a means of automatically constructing binary representations for objects using only pairwise similarity data. However, existing methods for the unsupervised learning of additive clustering models do not scale well to large problems. We present a new algorithm for additive clustering, based on a novel heuristic technique for combinatorial optimization. The algorithm is simpler than previous formulations and makes fewer independence assumptions. Extensive empirical tests on both human and synthetic data suggest that it is more effective than previous methods and that it also scales better to larger problems. By making additive clustering practical, we take a signiﬁcant step toward scaling connectionist models beyond hand-coded examples.</p><p>6 0.72544944 <a title="185-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Active_Information_Retrieval.html">24 nips-2001-Active Information Retrieval</a></p>

Several temporally-asymmetric Hebbian learning rules motivated by this data have been proposed. We argue that such learning rules are suitable to analog VLSI implementation. We describe an easily tunable circuit to modify the weight of a silicon spiking neuron according to those learning rules. Test results from the fabrication of the circuit using a O.6J.lm CMOS process are given. 1</p><p>2 0.88629651 <a title="185-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-A_Bayesian_Model_Predicts_Human_Parse_Preference_and_Reading_Times_in_Sentence_Processing.html">5 nips-2001-A Bayesian Model Predicts Human Parse Preference and Reading Times in Sentence Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesper Tegnér, Ádám Kepecs</p><p>Abstract: Hebbian learning rules are generally formulated as static rules. Under changing condition (e.g. neuromodulation, input statistics) most rules are sensitive to parameters. In particular, recent work has focused on two different formulations of spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules. Additive STDP [1] is remarkably versatile but also very fragile, whereas multiplicative STDP [2, 3] is more robust but lacks attractive features such as synaptic competition and rate stabilization. Here we address the problem of robustness in the additive STDP rule. We derive an adaptive control scheme, where the learning function is under fast dynamic control by postsynaptic activity to stabilize learning under a variety of conditions. Such a control scheme can be implemented using known biophysical mechanisms of synapses. We show that this adaptive rule makes the addit ive STDP more robust. Finally, we give an example how meta plasticity of the adaptive rule can be used to guide STDP into different type of learning regimes. 1</p><p>5 0.71171111 <a title="185-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.70708668 <a title="185-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>

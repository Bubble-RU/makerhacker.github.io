<p>Author: Carl E. Rasmussen, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We present an extension to the Mixture of Experts (ME) model, where the individual experts are Gaussian Process (GP) regression models. Using an input-dependent adaptation of the Dirichlet Process, we implement a gating network for an inﬁnite number of Experts. Inference in this model may be done efﬁciently using a Markov Chain relying on Gibbs sampling. The model allows the effective covariance function to vary with the inputs, and may handle large datasets – thus potentially overcoming two of the biggest hurdles with GP models.

We show the advantages of using SVMs with kernels of infinite complexity on noisy target rules, which, in contrast to common theoretical beliefs, are found to achieve optimal generalization error although the training error does not converge to the generalization error. Moreover, we find a universal asymptotics of the learning curves which only depend on the target rule but not on the SVM kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.09721972 <a title="79-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Concentration_of_Spectral_Properties.html">136 nips-2001-On the Concentration of Spectral Properties</a></p>

<p>Author: Marcello Pelillo</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by our recent work on rooted tree matching, in this paper we provide a solution to the problem of matching two free (i.e., unrooted) trees by constructing an association graph whose maximal cliques are in one-to-one correspondence with maximal common subtrees. We then solve the problem using simple replicator dynamics from evolutionary game theory. Experiments on hundreds of uniformly random trees are presented. The results are impressive: despite the inherent inability of these simple dynamics to escape from local optima, they always returned a globally optimal solution.</p><p>3 0.59798032 <a title="79-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Learning_Hierarchical_Structures_with_Linear_Relational_Embedding.html">110 nips-2001-Learning Hierarchical Structures with Linear Relational Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Alberto Paccanaro, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), a new method of learning a distributed representation of concepts from data consisting of instances of relations between given concepts. Its ﬁnal goal is to be able to generalize, i.e. infer new instances of these relations among the concepts. On a task involving family relationships we show that LRE can generalize better than any previously published method. We then show how LRE can be used effectively to ﬁnd compact distributed representations for variable-sized recursive data structures, such as trees and lists. 1 Linear Relational Embedding Our aim is to take a large set of facts about a domain expressed as tuples of arbitrary symbols in a simple and rigid syntactic format and to be able to infer other “common-sense” facts without having any prior knowledge about the domain. Let us imagine a situation in which we have a set of concepts and a set of relations among these concepts, and that our data consists of few instances of these relations that hold among the concepts. We want to be able to infer other instances of these relations. For example, if the concepts are the people in a certain family, the relations are kinship relations, and we are given the facts ”Alberto has-father Pietro” and ”Pietro has-brother Giovanni”, we would like to be able to infer ”Alberto has-uncle Giovanni”. Our approach is to learn appropriate distributed representations of the entities in the data, and then exploit the generalization properties of the distributed representations [2] to make the inferences. In this paper we present a method, which we have called Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), which learns a distributed representation for the concepts by embedding them in a space where the relations between concepts are linear transformations of their distributed representations. Let us consider the case in which all the relations are binary, i.e. involve two concepts. , and the problem In this case our data consists of triplets we are trying to solve is to infer missing triplets when we are given only few of them. Inferring a triplet is equivalent to being able to complete it, that is to come up with one of its elements, given the other two. Here we shall always try to complete the third element of the triplets 1 . LRE will then represent each concept in the data as a learned vector in a 2 0    £ § ¥ £  § ¥ % </p><p>4 0.59499991 <a title="79-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Learning_Discriminative_Feature_Transforms_to_Low_Dimensions_in_Low_Dimentions.html">109 nips-2001-Learning Discriminative Feature Transforms to Low Dimensions in Low Dimentions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: The marriage of Renyi entropy with Parzen density estimation has been shown to be a viable tool in learning discriminative feature transforms. However, it suffers from computational complexity proportional to the square of the number of samples in the training data. This sets a practical limit to using large databases. We suggest immediate divorce of the two methods and remarriage of Renyi entropy with a semi-parametric density estimation method, such as a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). This allows all of the computation to take place in the low dimensional target space, and it reduces computational complexity proportional to square of the number of components in the mixtures. Furthermore, a convenient extension to Hidden Markov Models as commonly used in speech recognition becomes possible.</p><p>5 0.59496605 <a title="79-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-The_Noisy_Euclidean_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_and_Learning.html">186 nips-2001-The Noisy Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem and Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We consider noisy Euclidean traveling salesman problems in the plane, which are random combinatorial problems with underlying structure. Gibbs sampling is used to compute average trajectories, which estimate the underlying structure common to all instances. This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between permutations and tours. In a learning setting, the average trajectory is used as a model to construct solutions to new instances sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to a single instance. 1</p><p>6 0.5923022 <a title="79-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Asymptotic_Universality_for_Learning_Curves_of_Support_Vector_Machines.html">38 nips-2001-Asymptotic Universality for Learning Curves of Support Vector Machines</a></p>

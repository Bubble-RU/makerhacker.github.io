<p>Author: Michael Collins, S. Dasgupta, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly applied technique for dimensionality reduction. PCA implicitly minimizes a squared loss function, which may be inappropriate for data that is not real-valued, such as binary-valued data. This paper draws on ideas from the Exponential family, Generalized linear models, and Bregman distances, to give a generalization of PCA to loss functions that we argue are better suited to other data types. We describe algorithms for minimizing the loss functions, and give examples on simulated data.</p><p>5 0.1947424 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Covariance_Kernels_from_Bayesian_Generative_Models.html">58 nips-2001-Covariance Kernels from Bayesian Generative Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Meinicke, Helge Ritter</p><p>Abstract: We suggest a nonparametric framework for unsupervised learning of projection models in terms of density estimation on quantized sample spaces. The objective is not to optimally reconstruct the data but instead the quantizer is chosen to optimally reconstruct the density of the data. For the resulting quantizing density estimator (QDE) we present a general method for parameter estimation and model selection. We show how projection sets which correspond to traditional unsupervised methods like vector quantization or PCA appear in the new framework. For a principal component quantizer we present results on synthetic and realworld data, which show that the QDE can improve the generalization of the kernel density estimator although its estimate is based on signiﬁcantly lower-dimensional projection indices of the data.</p><p>4 0.5457437 <a title="74-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-A_New_Discriminative_Kernel_From_Probabilistic_Models.html">15 nips-2001-A New Discriminative Kernel From Probabilistic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Asymmetric lateral connections are one possible mechanism that can account for the direction selectivity of cortical neurons. We present a mathematical analysis for a class of these models. Contrasting with earlier theoretical work that has relied on methods from linear systems theory, we study the network’s nonlinear dynamic properties that arise when the threshold nonlinearity of the neurons is taken into account. We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatiotemporal periodicity. This predicts that if direction selectivity in the cortex is mainly achieved by asymmetric lateral connections lurching activity waves might be observable in ensembles of direction selective cortical neurons within appropriate regimes of the stimulus speed.</p><p>3 0.73177898 <a title="74-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>4 0.69417912 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Activity_Driven_Adaptive_Stochastic_Resonance.html">27 nips-2001-Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic Resonance</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>5 0.69091272 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>6 0.68882954 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>

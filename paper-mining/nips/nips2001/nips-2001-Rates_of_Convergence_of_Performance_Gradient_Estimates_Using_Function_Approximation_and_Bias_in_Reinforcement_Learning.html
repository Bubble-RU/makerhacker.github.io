<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>3 0.26690173 <a title="157-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Multiagent_Planning_with_Factored_MDPs.html">128 nips-2001-Multiagent Planning with Factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>4 0.24954291 <a title="157-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Steering_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Reinforcement_Learning.html">187 nips-2001-The Steering Approach for Multi-Criteria Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>5 0.23349494 <a title="157-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Model-Free_Least-Squares_Policy_Iteration.html">121 nips-2001-Model-Free Least-Squares Policy Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Michail G. Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efﬁcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly inﬂuenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We have tested LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efﬁciently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials.</p><p>6 0.18806799 <a title="157-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>

Our initial work on Cobot (Isbell et al.2000) provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users. Here we describe an application of RL allowing Cobot to take proactive actions in this complex social environment, and adapt behavior from multiple sources of human reward. After 5 months of training, and 3171 reward and punishment events from 254 different LambdaMOO users, Cobot learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users, modiﬁng his behavior based on his current state. Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment. 1</p><p>4 0.77688223 <a title="157-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Steering_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Reinforcement_Learning.html">187 nips-2001-The Steering Approach for Multi-Criteria Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: It is desirable that a complex decision-making problem in an uncertain world be adequately modeled by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) whose structural representation is adaptively designed by a parsimonious resources allocation process. Resources include time and cost of exploration, amount of memory and computational time allowed for the policy or value function representation. Concerned about making the best use of the available resources, we address the problem of efficiently estimating where adding extra resources is highly needed in order to improve the expected performance of the resulting policy. Possible application in reinforcement learning (RL) , when real-world exploration is highly costly, concerns the detection of those areas of the state-space that need primarily to be explored in order to improve the policy. Another application concerns approximation of continuous state-space stochastic control problems using adaptive discretization techniques for which highly efficient grid points allocation is mandatory to survive high dimensionality. Maybe surprisingly these two problems can be formulated under a common framework: for a given resource allocation, which defines a belief state over possible MDPs, find where adding new resources (thus decreasing the uncertainty of some parameters -transition probabilities or rewards) will most likely increase the expected performance of the new policy. To do so, we use sampling techniques for estimating the contribution of each parameter's probability distribution function (Pdf) to the expected loss of using an approximate policy (such as the optimal policy of the most probable MDP) instead of the true (but unknown) policy.</p><p>4 0.82613176 <a title="157-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Playing_is_believing%3A_The_role_of_beliefs_in_multi-agent_learning.html">146 nips-2001-Playing is believing: The role of beliefs in multi-agent learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Han Chang, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new classiﬁcation for multi-agent learning algorithms, with each league of players characterized by both their possible strategies and possible beliefs. Using this classiﬁcation, we review the optimality of existing algorithms, including the case of interleague play. We propose an incremental improvement to the existing algorithms that seems to achieve average payoffs that are at least the Nash equilibrium payoffs in the longrun against fair opponents.</p><p>5 0.82353389 <a title="157-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>6 0.8206991 <a title="157-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

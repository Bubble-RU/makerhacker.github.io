<p>Author: Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor, André Elisseeff, Jaz S. Kandola</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of kernel-alignment, a measure of similarity between two kernel functions or between a kernel and a target function. This quantity captures the degree of agreement between a kernel and a given learning task, and has very natural interpretations in machine learning, leading also to simple algorithms for model selection and learning. We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy. Hence, the approach provides a principled method of performing transduction.

<p>Author: Toshihiko Yamasaki, Tadashi Shibata</p><p>Abstract: A flexible pattern-matching analog classifier is presented in conjunction with a robust image representation algorithm called Principal Axes Projection (PAP). In the circuit, the functional form of matching is configurable in terms of the peak position, the peak height and the sharpness of the similarity evaluation. The test chip was fabricated in a 0.6-µm CMOS technology and successfully applied to hand-written pattern recognition and medical radiograph analysis using PAP as a feature extraction pre-processing step for robust image coding. The separation and classification of overlapping patterns is also experimentally demonstrated. 1 I ntr o du c ti o n Pattern classification using template matching techniques is a powerful tool in implementing human-like intelligent systems. However, the processing is computationally very expensive, consuming a lot of CPU time when implemented as software running on general-purpose computers. Therefore, software approaches are not practical for real-time applications. For systems working in mobile environment, in particular, they are not realistic because the memory and computational resources are severely limited. The development of analog VLSI chips having a fully parallel template matching architecture [1,2] would be a promising solution in such applications because they offer an opportunity of low-power operation as well as very compact implementation. In order to build a real human-like intelligent system, however, not only the pattern representation algorithm but also the matching hardware itself needs to be made flexible and robust in carrying out the pattern matching task. First of all, two-dimensional patterns need to be represented by feature vectors having substantially reduced dimensions, while at the same time preserving the human perception of similarity among patterns in the vector space mapping. For this purpose, an image representation algorithm called Principal Axes Projection (PAP) has been de- veloped [3] and its robust nature in pattern recognition has been demonstrated in the applications to medical radiograph analysis [3] and hand-written digits recognition [4]. However, the demonstration so far was only carried out by computer simulation. Regarding the matching hardware, high-flexibility analog template matching circuits have been developed for PAP vector representation. The circuits are flexible in a sense that the matching criteria (the weight to elements, the strictness in matching) are configurable. In Ref. [5], the fundamental characteristics of the building block circuits were presented, and their application to simple hand-written digits was presented in Ref. [6]. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the robust nature of the hardware matching system by experiments. The classification of simple hand-written patterns and the cephalometric landmark identification in gray-scale medical radiographs have been carried out and successful results are presented. In addition, multiple overlapping patterns can be separated without utilizing a priori knowledge, which is one of the most difficult problems at present in artificial intelligence. 2 I ma g e re pr es e n tati on by P AP PAP is a feature extraction technique using the edge information. The input image (64x64 pixels) is first subjected to pixel-by-pixel spatial filtering operations to detect edges in four directions: horizontal (HR); vertical (VR); +45 degrees (+45); and –45 degrees (-45). Each detected edge is represented by a binary flag and four edge maps are generated. The two-dimensional bit array in an edge map is reduced to a one-dimensional array of numerals by projection. The horizontal edge flags are accumulated in the horizontal direction and projected onto vertical axis. The vertical, +45-degree and –45-degree edge flags are similarly projected onto horizontal, -45-degree and +45-degree axes, respectively. Therefore the method is called “Principal Axes Projection (PAP)” [3,4]. Then each projection data set is series connected in the order of HR, +45, VR, -45 to form a feature vector. Neighboring four elements are averaged and merged to one element and a 64-dimensional vector is finally obtained. This vector representation very well preserves the human perception of similarity in the vector space. In the experiments below, we have further reduced the feature vector to 16 dimensions by merging each set of four neighboring elements into one, without any significant degradation in performance.

The capacitor area ratio is indicated in the figure. The basic functional form of the similarity evaluation is generated by the shortcut current flowing in a CMOS inverter as in Refs. [7,8,9]. However, their circuits were utilized to form radial basis functions and only the peak position was programmable. In our circuits, not only the peak position but also the peak height and the sharpness of the peak response shape are made configurable to realize flexible matching operations [5]. Two types of the element matching circuit are shown in Fig. 1. They evaluate the similarity between two vector elements. The result of the evaluation is given as an output current (IOUT ) from the pMOS current mirror. The peak position is temporarily memorized by auto-zeroing of the CMOS inverter. The common-gate transistor with VGG stabilizes the voltage supply to the inverter. By controlling the gate bias VGG, the peak height can be changed. This corresponds to multiplying a weight factor to the element. The sharpness of the functional form is taken as the strictness of the similarity evaluation. In the pyramid type circuit (Fig. 1(a)), the sharpness is controlled by the gain reduction in the input. In the plateau type (Fig. 1(b)), the output voltage of the inverter is fed back to input nodes and the sharpness changes in accordance with the amount of the feedback.    ¥£¡ ¦¤¢   £¨ 9&% ¦©§ (!! #$ 5 !' #$ &% 9 9 4 92 !¦ A1@9  ¨¥  5 4 52 (!  5 8765  9) 0 1 ¥ 1 ¨</p><p>6 0.12796924 <a title="191-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Fidelity_of_Local_Ordinal_Encoding.html">182 nips-2001-The Fidelity of Local Ordinal Encoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Javid Sadr, Sayan Mukherjee, Keith Thoresz, Pawan Sinha</p><p>Abstract: A key question in neuroscience is how to encode sensory stimuli such as images and sounds. Motivated by studies of response properties of neurons in the early cortical areas, we propose an encoding scheme that dispenses with absolute measures of signal intensity or contrast and uses, instead, only local ordinal measures. In this scheme, the structure of a signal is represented by a set of equalities and inequalities across adjacent regions. In this paper, we focus on characterizing the ﬁdelity of this representation strategy. We develop a regularization approach for image reconstruction from ordinal measures and thereby demonstrate that the ordinal representation scheme can faithfully encode signal structure. We also present a neurally plausible implementation of this computation that uses only local update rules. The results highlight the robustness and generalization ability of local ordinal encodings for the task of pattern classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.5445115 <a title="191-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>

<p>Author: Stuart N. Wrigley, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74981523 <a title="191-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Transform-invariant_Image_Decomposition_with_Similarity_Templates.html">191 nips-2001-Transform-invariant Image Decomposition with Similarity Templates</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Stauffer, Erik Miller, Kinh Tieu</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown impressive transform-invariant modeling and clustering for sets of images of objects with similar appearance. We seek to expand these capabilities to sets of images of an object class that show considerable variation across individual instances (e.g. pedestrian images) using a representation based on pixel-wise similarities, similarity templates. Because of its invariance to the colors of particular components of an object, this representation enables detection of instances of an object class and enables alignment of those instances. Further, this model implicitly represents the regions of color regularity in the class-speciﬁc image set enabling a decomposition of that object class into component regions. 1</p><p>3 0.66710526 <a title="191-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Partially_labeled_classification_with_Markov_random_walks.html">144 nips-2001-Partially labeled classification with Markov random walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the unlabeled examples. The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classiﬁcation with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classiﬁcation. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classiﬁcation problems.</p><p>4 0.60750115 <a title="191-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is motivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be correlated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classiﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models.</p><p>5 0.6050787 <a title="191-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>6 0.6039921 <a title="191-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, M. J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic information is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hypothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are significant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells. The results suggest that the auditory system transforms low level representations that contain redundancies due to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, into a representation in which cortical neurons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic signals, that are useful for auditory scene analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.14611119 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>
<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>4 0.12958723 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Orientation-Selective_aVLSI_Spiking_Neurons.html">141 nips-2001-Orientation-Selective aVLSI Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Jörg Kramer, Giacomo Indiveri, Tobi Delbrück, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models. The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-ﬁre neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture. The circuit on this multi-neuron chip approximates a cortical microcircuit. The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.</p><p>5 0.12598923 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_the_Modulatory_Effect_of_Attention_on_Human_Spatial_Vision.html">124 nips-2001-Modeling the Modulatory Effect of Attention on Human Spatial Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Maoz Shamir, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: Population codes often rely on the tuning of the mean responses to the stimulus parameters. However, this information can be greatly suppressed by long range correlations. Here we study the efﬁciency of coding information in the second order statistics of the population responses. We show that the Fisher Information of this system grows linearly with the size of the system. We propose a bilinear readout model for extracting information from correlation codes, and evaluate its performance in discrimination and estimation tasks. It is shown that the main source of information in this system is the stimulus dependence of the variances of the single neuron responses.</p><p>6 0.60393882 <a title="11-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Perceptual_Metamers_in_Stereoscopic_Vision.html">145 nips-2001-Perceptual Metamers in Stereoscopic Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: N. Matsumoto, M. Okada</p><p>Abstract: Recent biological experimental ﬁndings have shown that the synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of the pre- and postsynaptic spikes which determines whether Long Term Potentiation (LTP) occurs or Long Term Depression (LTD) does. The synaptic plasticity has been called “Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian plasticity (TAH)”. Many authors have numerically shown that spatiotemporal patterns can be stored in neural networks. However, the mathematical mechanism for storage of the spatio-temporal patterns is still unknown, especially the eﬀects of LTD. In this paper, we employ a simple neural network model and show that interference of LTP and LTD disappears in a sparse coding scheme. On the other hand, it is known that the covariance learning is indispensable for storing sparse patterns. We also show that TAH qualitatively has the same eﬀect as the covariance learning when spatio-temporal patterns are embedded in the network. 1</p><p>3 0.49956298 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Discriminative_Direction_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">60 nips-2001-Discriminative Direction for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>4 0.49925539 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-A_Rational_Analysis_of_Cognitive_Control_in_a_Speeded_Discrimination_Task.html">18 nips-2001-A Rational Analysis of Cognitive Control in a Speeded Discrimination Task</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Michael D. Colagrosso, David E. Huber</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in the mechanisms by which individuals monitor and adjust their performance of simple cognitive tasks. We model a speeded discrimination task in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). Response conﬂict arises when one stimulus class is infrequent relative to another, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times for the infrequent class. How do control processes modulate behavior based on the relative class frequencies? We explain performance from a rational perspective that casts the goal of individuals as minimizing a cost that depends both on error rate and reaction time. With two additional assumptions of rationality—that class prior probabilities are accurately estimated and that inference is optimal subject to limitations on rate of information transmission—we obtain a good ﬁt to overall RT and error data, as well as trial-by-trial variations in performance. Consider the following scenario: While driving, you approach an intersection at which the trafﬁc light has already turned yellow, signaling that it is about to turn red. You also notice that a car is approaching you rapidly from behind, with no indication of slowing. Should you stop or speed through the intersection? The decision is difﬁcult due to the presence of two conﬂicting signals. Such response conﬂict can be produced in a psychological laboratory as well. For example, Stroop (1935) asked individuals to name the color of ink on which a word is printed. When the words are color names incongruous with the ink color— e.g., “blue” printed in red—reaction times are slower and error rates are higher. We are interested in the control mechanisms underlying performance of high-conﬂict tasks. Conﬂict requires individuals to monitor and adjust their behavior, possibly responding more slowly if errors are too frequent. In this paper, we model a speeded discrimination paradigm in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). The stimuli are letters of the alphabet, A–Z, presented in rapid succession. In a choice task, individuals are asked to press one response key if the letter is an X or another response key for any letter other than X (as a shorthand, we will refer to non-X stimuli as Y). In a go/no-go task, individuals are asked to press a response key when X is presented and to make no response otherwise. We address both tasks because they elicit slightly different decision-making behavior. In both tasks, Jones and Braver (2001) manipulated the relative frequency of the X and Y stimuli; the ratio of presentation frequency was either 17:83, 50:50, or 83:17. Response conﬂict arises when the two stimulus classes are unbalanced in frequency, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times. For example, when X’s are frequent but Y is presented, individuals are predisposed toward producing the X response, and this predisposition must be overcome by the perceptual evidence from the Y. Jones and Braver (2001) also performed an fMRI study of this task and found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) becomes activated in situations involving response conﬂict. Specifically, when one stimulus occurs infrequently relative to the other, event-related fMRI response in the ACC is greater for the low frequency stimulus. Jones and Braver also extended a neural network model of Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen (2001) to account for human performance in the two discrimination tasks. The heart of the model is a mechanism that monitors conﬂict—the posited role of the ACC—and adjusts response biases accordingly. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious alternative account of the role of the ACC and of how control processes modulate behavior when response conﬂict arises. 1 A RATIONAL ANALYSIS Our account is based on a rational analysis of human cognition, which views cognitive processes as being optimized with respect to certain task-related goals, and being adaptive to the structure of the environment (Anderson, 1990). We make three assumptions of rationality: (1) perceptual inference is optimal but is subject to rate limitations on information transmission, (2) response class prior probabilities are accurately estimated, and (3) the goal of individuals is to minimize a cost that depends both on error rate and reaction time. The heart of our account is an existing probabilistic model that explains a variety of facilitation effects that arise from long-term repetition priming (Colagrosso, in preparation; Mozer, Colagrosso, & Huber, 2000), and more broadly, that addresses changes in the nature of information transmission in neocortex due to experience. We give a brief overview of this model; the details are not essential for the present work. The model posits that neocortex can be characterized by a collection of informationprocessing pathways, and any act of cognition involves coordination among pathways. To model a simple discrimination task, we might suppose a perceptual pathway to map the visual input to a semantic representation, and a response pathway to map the semantic representation to a response. The choice and go/no-go tasks described earlier share a perceptual pathway, but require different response pathways. The model is framed in terms of probability theory: pathway inputs and outputs are random variables and microinference in a pathway is carried out by Bayesian belief revision.   To elaborate, consider a pathway whose input at time is a discrete random variable, denoted , which can assume values corresponding to alternative input states. Similarly, the output of the pathway at time is a discrete random variable, denoted , which can assume values . For example, the input to the perceptual pathway in the discrimination task is one of visual patterns corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, and the output is one of letter identities. (This model is highly abstract: the visual patterns are enumerated, but the actual pixel patterns are not explicitly represented in the model. Nonetheless, the similarity structure among inputs can be captured, but we skip a discussion of this issue because it is irrelevant for the current work.) To present a particular input alternative, , to the model for time steps, we clamp for . The model computes a probability distribution over given , i.e., P . ¡ # 4 0 ©2' &  0 ' ! 1)(</p><p>5 0.49782208 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Contextual_Modulation_of_Target_Saliency.html">54 nips-2001-Contextual Modulation of Target Saliency</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The most popular algorithms for object detection require the use of exhaustive spatial and scale search procedures. In such approaches, an object is defined by means of local features. fu this paper we show that including contextual information in object detection procedures provides an efficient way of cutting down the need for exhaustive search. We present results with real images showing that the proposed scheme is able to accurately predict likely object classes, locations and sizes. 1</p><p>6 0.49774283 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Exact_differential_equation_population_dynamics_for_integrate-and-fire_neurons.html">72 nips-2001-Exact differential equation population dynamics for integrate-and-fire neurons</a></p>

</p><p>6 1  Introduction  In a typical environment stimuli occur at various positions in space and time. [sent-10, score-0.16]
</p><p>7 In order to produce a coherent assessment of the external world an individual must constantly discriminate between signals relevant for action planning (targets) and signals that need no immediate response (distractors). [sent-11, score-0.236]
</p><p>8 Separate sensory channels process stimuli by modality, but an individual must determine which stimuli are related to one another, i. [sent-12, score-0.385]
</p><p>9 For example, stimuli that occur at the same time and space are likely to be interrelated by a common cause. [sent-15, score-0.136]
</p><p>10 However, if the visual and auditory cues are incongruent, e. [sent-16, score-0.237]

</p><p>12 This indicates that cross-modal synthesis is particularly important for stimulus identification and discrimination, not only for detection. [sent-20, score-0.094]
</p><p>13 Evidence for multisensory integration at the neural level has been well documented in a series of studies in the mammalian midbrain by Stein, Meredith and Wallace (e. [sent-21, score-0.639]

</p><p>16 Multisensory response enhancement refers to the augmentation of the response of a DSC neuron to a multisensory stimulus compared to the response elicited by the most effective single modality stimulus. [sent-30, score-1.386]
</p><p>17 A quantitative measure of the percent enhancement is MRE = CM - SMmax x 100, SMmax  (1)  where CM is the mean number of impulses evoked by the combined-modality stimulus in a given time interval, and S Mmax refers to the response of the most effective single-modality stimulus (cf. [sent-31, score-0.592]
</p><p>18 Response enhancement in the DSC neurons can be quite impressive, with values of M RE sometimes reaching values above 1000. [sent-33, score-0.327]
</p><p>19 Typically, this enhancement is most dramatic when the unimodal stimuli are weak and/or ambiguous, a principle referred to in [4] as "inverse effectiveness" . [sent-34, score-0.596]
</p><p>20 Inverse effectiveness makes intuitive sense in the behavioral situation: the detection probability for a weak or ambiguous stimulus gains more from response enhancement by multisensory integration than a highintensity stimulus that is easily detected by a single modality alone. [sent-38, score-1.398]
</p><p>21 A model of the functional significance of multisensory enhancement has recently been proposed by Anastasio, Patton, and Belkacem-Boussaid [9]. [sent-39, score-0.855]
</p><p>22 They suggested that the responses of individual DSC neurons are proportional to the Bayesian probability that a target is present given their sensory inputs. [sent-40, score-0.325]
</p><p>23 Here, this Bayesian model is extended to yield a more complete account of the decision situation an organism is faced with. [sent-41, score-0.157]
</p><p>24 As noted above, in a natural environment an individual is confronted with the task of discriminating between stimuli important for survival (" targets") and stimuli that are irrelevant (" distractors") . [sent-42, score-0.361]
</p><p>25 Thus, an organism must not only keep up a high rate of detecting targets but, at the same time, must strive to minimize " false alarms" to irrelevant stimuli. [sent-43, score-0.163]
</p><p>26 It will be shown here that this can be achieved already at the level of individual DSC neurons by appealing to a maximum-likelihood principle, without requiring any more information than is assumed in the Bayesian model. [sent-45, score-0.125]
</p><p>27 The next section sketches the Bayesian model by Anastasio, Patton, and BelkacemBoussaid (Bayesian model, for short), after which a maximum-likelihood model of multisensory response enhancement will be introduced. [sent-46, score-0.966]
</p><p>28 2  The Bayesian Model of Multisensory Enhancement  DSC neurons receive input from the visual and auditory systems elicited by stimuli occurring within their receptive fields! [sent-47, score-0.564]
</p><p>29 According to the Bayesian model, these vii An extension to the trimodal situation, including somatosensory input, could be easily attained in the models discussed here. [sent-48, score-0.065]
</p><p>30 sual and auditory inputs are represented by random variables V and A, respectively. [sent-49, score-0.203]
</p><p>31 The response of the DSC neuron (number of spikes in a unit time interval) is postulated to be proportional to these probabilities. [sent-53, score-0.189]
</p><p>32 In order to arrive at quantitative predictions two more specific assumptions are made: (1) the distributions of V and A, given T = 1 or T = 0, are conditionally independent , i. [sent-54, score-0.039]
</p><p>33 The conditional independence assumption means that the visibility of a target indicates nothing about its audibility, and vice-versa. [sent-58, score-0.082]
</p><p>34 Finally, the computation of the posterior probability that a target is present requires specification of the a-priori probability of a target, P(T = 1). [sent-60, score-0.082]
</p><p>35 The parameters Ao and {-to denote the mean intensity of the visual and auditory input, resp. [sent-61, score-0.293]
</p><p>36 , when no target is present (spontaneous input) , while Al and {-tl are the corresponding mean intensities when a target is present (driven input). [sent-62, score-0.164]
</p><p>37 [9] show that the Bayesian model reproduces values of multisensory response enhancement in the order of magnitude observed in neurophysiological experiments [10]. [sent-64, score-1.005]
</p><p>38 In particular, the property of inverse effectiveness, by which the enhancement is largest for combined stimuli that evoke only small unimodal responses , is reflected by the model. [sent-65, score-0.668]
</p><p>39 1  The Maximum Likelihood Model of Multisensory Enhancement The decision rule  The maximum likelihood model (ML model, for short) incorporates the basic decision problem an organism is faced with in a typical environment: to discriminate between relevant stimuli (targets), i. [sent-67, score-0.447]
</p><p>40 , signals that require immediate reaction, and irrelevant stimuli (distractors), i. [sent-69, score-0.192]
</p><p>41 , signals that can be ignored in a given situation. [sent-71, score-0.026]
</p><p>42 [11]) , P(Yes IT = 1) denotes the probability that the organism (correctly) decides that a target is present (hit), while P(Yes IT = 0) denotes the probability of deciding that a target is present when in  fact only a distractor is present (false alarm). [sent-73, score-0.246]
</p><p>43 In order to maximize the probability of a correct response, P(C)  = P(Yes IT = 1) P(T = 1) + [1- P(Yes IT = O)]P(T = 0),  (3)  the following maximum likelihood decision rule must be adopted (cf. [sent-74, score-0.094]
</p><p>44 , the unimodal visual case: If P(T  = 11 V = v) > P(T = 0 IV = v), then decide "Yes", otherwise decide " No" . [sent-77, score-0.395]
</p><p>45 The above inequality is equivalent to P(T=IIV=v) P(T = 0 IV = v)  P(T=I)P(v=vIT=I) P(T = 0) P(V = v IT = 0)  > 1,  where the right-most ratio is a function of V , L(V), the likelihood ratio. [sent-78, score-0.043]
</p><p>46 Thus, the above rule is equivalent to: If L(v)  >  1 - P , then decide "Yes" , otherwise decide "No" , P  with p = P(T = 1). [sent-79, score-0.157]
</p><p>47 Since L(V) is a random variable, the probability to decide "Yes" , given a target is present, is P (Yes I T  = 1) =  P (L(V) > 1; PIT  = 1) . [sent-80, score-0.149]

</p><p>52 Multisensory response enhancement (last column) is computed using Eq. [sent-117, score-0.348]
</p><p>53 Otherwise, hit probabilities follow the distribution of a linear combination of two Poisson distributed variables. [sent-122, score-0.191]
</p><p>54 Table 1 presents 2 hit probabilities and multisensory response enhancement values for different levels of mean driven input. [sent-123, score-1.222]
</p><p>55 Obviously, the ML model imitates the inverse effectiveness relation: combining weak intensity unimodal stimuli leads to a much larger response enhancement than medium or high intensity stimuli. [sent-124, score-0.964]
</p><p>56 3  Predictions for discriminability measures  The ML model allows to assess the sensitivity of an individual DSC neuron to discriminate between target and distract or signals. [sent-126, score-0.449]
</p><p>57 Intuit ively, this sensitivity should be a (decreasing) function of the amount of overlap between the driven and the spontaneous likelihood (e. [sent-127, score-0.246]
</p><p>58 One possible appropriate measure of sensitivity for the Poisson observer is (cf. [sent-130, score-0.037]
</p><p>59 LO)l /4  (4)  for the visual and auditory unimodal inputs, resp. [sent-135, score-0.415]
</p><p>60 A natural choice for the bimodal measure of sensitivity then is  D  (AI  + J. [sent-136, score-0.188]
</p><p>61 (5)  Note that, unlike the hit probabilities, the relative increase in discriminability by combining two unimodal inputs does not decrease with the intensity of the driven input (see Table 2). [sent-141, score-0.711]
</p><p>62 Rather, the relation between bimodal and unimodal discriminability measures for the input values in Table 2 is approximately of Euclidean 2For input combinations with >'1 =I- J. [sent-142, score-0.552]

</p><p>67 The fact that the effectiveness rule should not hard to discriminate depends intensity. [sent-167, score-0.145]
</p><p>68 Obviously, no claim is made here that the neuron actually performs these computations, only that its behavior can be described approximately in this way. [sent-169, score-0.076]
</p><p>69 Similar to the Bayesian model suggested by Anastasio et al. [sent-170, score-0.022]
</p><p>70 [9], the neuron's behavior is solely based on the a-priori probability of a target and the likelihood function for the different sensory inputs. [sent-171, score-0.203]
</p><p>71 The ML model predicts the inverse effectiveness observed in neurophysiological experiments. [sent-172, score-0.202]
</p><p>72 Moreover, the model allows to derive a measure of the neuron's ability to discriminate between targets and non-targets. [sent-173, score-0.133]
</p><p>73 It makes specific predictions how un i- and bimodal discriminability measures are related and, thereby, opens up further avenues for testing the model assumptions . [sent-174, score-0.349]
</p><p>74 The ML model, like the Bayesian model, operates at the level of a single DSC neuron. [sent-175, score-0.022]
</p><p>75 However, an extension of the model to describe multisensory population responses is desirable: First, this would allow to relate the model predictions to numerous behavioral studies about multisensory effects (e. [sent-176, score-1.35]
</p><p>76 [1 5) suggests, the effects of multisensory spatial coincidence observed in behavioral experiments may only be reconcilable with the degree of spatial resolution achievable by a population of DSC neurons with overlapping receptive fields. [sent-179, score-0.838]

The maximum likelihood (ML) model presented here modifies the Bayesian model for MRE (Anastasio et al.) by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize the number of correct decisions. Thus the ML model can also deal with the important tasks of stimulus discrimination and identification in the presence of incongruent visual and auditory cues.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, M. J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic information is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hypothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are significant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells. The results suggest that the auditory system transforms low level representations that contain redundancies due to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, into a representation in which cortical neurons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic signals, that are useful for auditory scene analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.10422538 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>
<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>4 0.093349315 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Activity_Driven_Adaptive_Stochastic_Resonance.html">27 nips-2001-Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic Resonance</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>5 0.084645718 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

<p>Author: H. Colonius, A.

The maximum likelihood (ML) model presented here modifies the Bayesian model for MRE (Anastasio et al.) by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize the number of correct decisions. Thus the ML model can also deal with the important tasks of stimulus discrimination and identification in the presence of incongruent visual and auditory cues.

<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Michael D. Colagrosso, David E. Huber</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in the mechanisms by which individuals monitor and adjust their performance of simple cognitive tasks. We model a speeded discrimination task in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). Response conﬂict arises when one stimulus class is infrequent relative to another, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times for the infrequent class. How do control processes modulate behavior based on the relative class frequencies? We explain performance from a rational perspective that casts the goal of individuals as minimizing a cost that depends both on error rate and reaction time. With two additional assumptions of rationality—that class prior probabilities are accurately estimated and that inference is optimal subject to limitations on rate of information transmission—we obtain a good ﬁt to overall RT and error data, as well as trial-by-trial variations in performance. Consider the following scenario: While driving, you approach an intersection at which the trafﬁc light has already turned yellow, signaling that it is about to turn red. You also notice that a car is approaching you rapidly from behind, with no indication of slowing. Should you stop or speed through the intersection? The decision is difﬁcult due to the presence of two conﬂicting signals. Such response conﬂict can be produced in a psychological laboratory as well. For example, Stroop (1935) asked individuals to name the color of ink on which a word is printed. When the words are color names incongruous with the ink color— e.g., “blue” printed in red—reaction times are slower and error rates are higher. We are interested in the control mechanisms underlying performance of high-conﬂict tasks. Conﬂict requires individuals to monitor and adjust their behavior, possibly responding more slowly if errors are too frequent. In this paper, we model a speeded discrimination paradigm in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). The stimuli are letters of the alphabet, A–Z, presented in rapid succession. In a choice task, individuals are asked to press one response key if the letter is an X or another response key for any letter other than X (as a shorthand, we will refer to non-X stimuli as Y). In a go/no-go task, individuals are asked to press a response key when X is presented and to make no response otherwise. We address both tasks because they elicit slightly different decision-making behavior. In both tasks, Jones and Braver (2001) manipulated the relative frequency of the X and Y stimuli; the ratio of presentation frequency was either 17:83, 50:50, or 83:17. Response conﬂict arises when the two stimulus classes are unbalanced in frequency, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times. For example, when X’s are frequent but Y is presented, individuals are predisposed toward producing the X response, and this predisposition must be overcome by the perceptual evidence from the Y. Jones and Braver (2001) also performed an fMRI study of this task and found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) becomes activated in situations involving response conﬂict. Specifically, when one stimulus occurs infrequently relative to the other, event-related fMRI response in the ACC is greater for the low frequency stimulus. Jones and Braver also extended a neural network model of Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen (2001) to account for human performance in the two discrimination tasks. The heart of the model is a mechanism that monitors conﬂict—the posited role of the ACC—and adjusts response biases accordingly. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious alternative account of the role of the ACC and of how control processes modulate behavior when response conﬂict arises. 1 A RATIONAL ANALYSIS Our account is based on a rational analysis of human cognition, which views cognitive processes as being optimized with respect to certain task-related goals, and being adaptive to the structure of the environment (Anderson, 1990). We make three assumptions of rationality: (1) perceptual inference is optimal but is subject to rate limitations on information transmission, (2) response class prior probabilities are accurately estimated, and (3) the goal of individuals is to minimize a cost that depends both on error rate and reaction time. The heart of our account is an existing probabilistic model that explains a variety of facilitation effects that arise from long-term repetition priming (Colagrosso, in preparation; Mozer, Colagrosso, & Huber, 2000), and more broadly, that addresses changes in the nature of information transmission in neocortex due to experience. We give a brief overview of this model; the details are not essential for the present work. The model posits that neocortex can be characterized by a collection of informationprocessing pathways, and any act of cognition involves coordination among pathways. To model a simple discrimination task, we might suppose a perceptual pathway to map the visual input to a semantic representation, and a response pathway to map the semantic representation to a response. The choice and go/no-go tasks described earlier share a perceptual pathway, but require different response pathways. The model is framed in terms of probability theory: pathway inputs and outputs are random variables and microinference in a pathway is carried out by Bayesian belief revision.   To elaborate, consider a pathway whose input at time is a discrete random variable, denoted , which can assume values corresponding to alternative input states. Similarly, the output of the pathway at time is a discrete random variable, denoted , which can assume values . For example, the input to the perceptual pathway in the discrimination task is one of visual patterns corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, and the output is one of letter identities. (This model is highly abstract: the visual patterns are enumerated, but the actual pixel patterns are not explicitly represented in the model. Nonetheless, the similarity structure among inputs can be captured, but we skip a discussion of this issue because it is irrelevant for the current work.) To present a particular input alternative, , to the model for time steps, we clamp for . The model computes a probability distribution over given , i.e., P . ¡ # 4 0 ©2' &  0 ' ! 1)(</p><p>3 0.60881668 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Group_Redundancy_Measures_Reveal_Redundancy_Reduction_in_the_Auditory_Pathway.html">87 nips-2001-Group Redundancy Measures Reveal Redundancy Reduction in the Auditory Pathway</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, M. J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic information is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hypothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are significant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells. The results suggest that the auditory system transforms low level representations that contain redundancies due to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, into a representation in which cortical neurons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic signals, that are useful for auditory scene analysis. 1</p><p>4 0.60705924 <a title="11-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_the_Modulatory_Effect_of_Attention_on_Human_Spatial_Vision.html">124 nips-2001-Modeling the Modulatory Effect of Attention on Human Spatial Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Stuart N. Wrigley, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone. 1</p><p>6 0.52437711 <a title="11-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>

Our initial work on Cobot (Isbell et al.2000) provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users. Here we describe an application of RL allowing Cobot to take proactive actions in this complex social environment, and adapt behavior from multiple sources of human reward. After 5 months of training, and 3171 reward and punishment events from 254 different LambdaMOO users, Cobot learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users, modiﬁng his behavior based on his current state. Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.4935624 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Iterative_Double_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">100 nips-2001-Iterative Double Clustering for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Oren Souroujon</p><p>Abstract: We present a powerful meta-clustering technique called Iterative Double Clustering (IDC). The IDC method is a natural extension of the recent Double Clustering (DC) method of Slonim and Tishby that exhibited impressive performance on text categorization tasks [12]. Using synthetically generated data we empirically ﬁnd that whenever the DC procedure is successful in recovering some of the structure hidden in the data, the extended IDC procedure can incrementally compute a signiﬁcantly more accurate classiﬁcation. IDC is especially advantageous when the data exhibits high attribute noise. Our simulation results also show the eﬀectiveness of IDC in text categorization problems. Surprisingly, this unsupervised procedure can be competitive with a (supervised) SVM trained with a small training set. Finally, we propose a simple and natural extension of IDC for semi-supervised and transductive learning where we are given both labeled and unlabeled examples. 1</p><p>4 0.49088401 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">183 nips-2001-The Infinite Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew J. Beal, Zoubin Ghahramani, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably inﬁnite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the inﬁnitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters deﬁne a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a ﬁnite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be inﬁnite— consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.</p><p>5 0.48993698 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Efficiency_versus_Convergence_of_Boolean_Kernels_for_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">66 nips-2001-Efficiency versus Convergence of Boolean Kernels for On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Dan Roth, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning in Boolean domains using kernels which capture feature expansions equivalent to using conjunctions over basic features. We demonstrate a tradeoff between the computational efﬁciency with which these kernels can be computed and the generalization ability of the resulting classiﬁer. We ﬁrst describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efﬁciently run the Perceptron algorithm over an exponential number of conjunctions; however we also prove that using such kernels the Perceptron algorithm can make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We also consider an analogous use of kernel functions to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. While known upper bounds imply that Winnow can learn DNF formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnow’s behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set, and thus that such kernel functions for Winnow are not efﬁciently computable.</p><p>6 0.48937762 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-The_Fidelity_of_Local_Ordinal_Encoding.html">182 nips-2001-The Fidelity of Local Ordinal Encoding</a></p>

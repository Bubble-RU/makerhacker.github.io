<p>Author: Florence D'alché-buc, Yves Grandvalet, Christophe Ambroise</p><p>Abstract: In many discrimination problems a large amount of data is available but only a few of them are labeled. This provides a strong motivation to improve or develop methods for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, boosting is generalized to this task within the optimization framework of MarginBoost . We extend the margin definition to unlabeled data and develop the gradient descent algorithm that corresponds to the resulting margin cost function. This meta-learning scheme can be applied to any base classifier able to benefit from unlabeled data. We propose here to apply it to mixture models trained with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Promising results are presented on benchmarks with different rates of labeled data. 1</p><p>5 0.19860962 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Fast_and_Robust_Classification_using_Asymmetric_AdaBoost_and_a_Detector_Cascade.html">77 nips-2001-Fast and Robust Classification using Asymmetric AdaBoost and a Detector Cascade</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Viola, Michael Jones</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a new approach for extremely fast detection in domains where the distribution of positive and negative examples is highly skewed (e.g. face detection or database retrieval). In such domains a cascade of simple classiﬁers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a ﬁnal detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classiﬁers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields signiﬁcant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The ﬁnal face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000.</p><p>6 0.16737768 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Generalization_of_Principal_Components_Analysis_to_the_Exponential_Family.html">9 nips-2001-A Generalization of Principal Components Analysis to the Exponential Family</a></p>

PCA implicitly minimizes a squared loss function, which may be inappropriate for data that is not real-valued, such as binary-valued data. This paper draws on ideas from the Exponential family, Generalized linear models, and Bregman distances, to give a generalization of PCA to loss functions that we argue are better suited to other data types.

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Trausti T. Kristjansson, Li Deng, Alex Acero</p><p>Abstract: A challenging, unsolved problem in the speech recognition community is recognizing speech signals that are corrupted by loud, highly nonstationary noise. One approach to noisy speech recognition is to automatically remove the noise from the cepstrum sequence before feeding it in to a clean speech recognizer. In previous work published in Eurospeech, we showed how a probability model trained on clean speech and a separate probability model trained on noise could be combined for the purpose of estimating the noisefree speech from the noisy speech. We showed how an iterative 2nd order vector Taylor series approximation could be used for probabilistic inference in this model. In many circumstances, it is not possible to obtain examples of noise without speech. Noise statistics may change significantly during an utterance, so that speechfree frames are not sufficient for estimating the noise model. In this paper, we show how the noise model can be learned even when the data contains speech. In particular, the noise model can be learned from the test utterance and then used to de noise the test utterance. The approximate inference technique is used as an approximate E step in a generalized EM algorithm that learns the parameters of the noise model from a test utterance. For both Wall Street J ournal data with added noise samples and the Aurora benchmark, we show that the new noise adaptive technique performs as well as or significantly better than the non-adaptive algorithm, without the need for a separate training set of noise examples. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70365083 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Boosting_and_Maximum_Likelihood_for_Exponential_Models.html">45 nips-2001-Boosting and Maximum Likelihood for Exponential Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth, Gunnar Rätsch, Michael Mathieson, Jun Liao, Christian Lemmen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the following data mining problem from Computational Chemistry: From a large data set of compounds, ﬁnd those that bind to a target molecule in as few iterations of biological testing as possible. In each iteration a comparatively small batch of compounds is screened for binding to the target. We apply active learning techniques for selecting the successive batches. One selection strategy picks unlabeled examples closest to the maximum margin hyperplane. Another produces many weight vectors by running perceptrons over multiple permutations of the data. Each weight vector votes with its prediction and we pick the unlabeled examples for which the prediction is most evenly split between and . For a third selection strategy note that each unlabeled example bisects the version space of consistent weight vectors. We estimate the volume on both sides of the split by bouncing a billiard through the version space and select unlabeled examples that cause the most even split of the version space. We demonstrate that on two data sets provided by DuPont Pharmaceuticals that all three selection strategies perform comparably well and are much better than selecting random batches for testing. § © ¨</p><p>4 0.58345002 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Sequential_Noise_Compensation_by_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Method.html">168 nips-2001-Sequential Noise Compensation by Sequential Monte Carlo Method</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Yao, S. Nakamura</p><p>Abstract: We present a sequential Monte Carlo method applied to additive noise compensation for robust speech recognition in time-varying noise. The method generates a set of samples according to the prior distribution given by clean speech models and noise prior evolved from previous estimation. An explicit model representing noise effects on speech features is used, so that an extended Kalman ﬁlter is constructed for each sample, generating the updated continuous state estimate as the estimation of the noise parameter, and prediction likelihood for weighting each sample. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) inference of the time-varying noise parameter is carried out over these samples by fusion the estimation of samples according to their weights. A residual resampling selection step and a Metropolis-Hastings smoothing step are used to improve calculation eﬃciency. Experiments were conducted on speech recognition in simulated non-stationary noises, where noise power changed artiﬁcially, and highly non-stationary Machinegun noise. In all the experiments carried out, we observed that the method can have signiﬁcant recognition performance improvement, over that achieved by noise compensation with stationary noise assumption. 1</p><p>5 0.57440883 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Audio-Visual_Sound_Separation_Via_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">39 nips-2001-Audio-Visual Sound Separation Via Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Michael Casey</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that under noisy conditions we can hear speech much more clearly when we read the speaker's lips. This suggests the utility of audio-visual information for the task of speech enhancement. We propose a method to exploit audio-visual cues to enable speech separation under non-stationary noise and with a single microphone. We revise and extend HMM-based speech enhancement techniques, in which signal and noise models are factori ally combined, to incorporate visual lip information and employ novel signal HMMs in which the dynamics of narrow-band and wide band components are factorial. We avoid the combinatorial explosion in the factorial model by using a simple approximate inference technique to quickly estimate the clean signals in a mixture. We present a preliminary evaluation of this approach using a small-vocabulary audio-visual database, showing promising improvements in machine intelligibility for speech enhanced using audio and visual information. 1</p><p>6 0.5699653 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_with_Missing_Data_using_Recurrent_Neural_Nets.html">173 nips-2001-Speech Recognition with Missing Data using Recurrent Neural Nets</a></p>

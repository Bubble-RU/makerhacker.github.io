<p>Author: Bob Rehder</p><p>Abstract: A theory of categorization is presented in which knowledge of causal relationships between category features is represented as a Bayesian network. Referred to as causal-model theory, this theory predicts that objects are classified as category members to the extent they are likely to have been produced by a categorys causal model. On this view, people have models of the world that lead them to expect a certain distribution of features in category members (e.g., correlations between feature pairs that are directly connected by causal relationships), and consider exemplars good category members when they manifest those expectations. These expectations include sensitivity to higher-order feature interactions that emerge from the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships. Research on the topic of categorization has traditionally focused on the problem of learning new categories given observations of category members. In contrast, the theory-based view of categories emphasizes the influence of the prior theoretical knowledge that learners often contribute to their representations of categories [1]. However, in contrast to models accounting for the effects of empirical observations, there have been few models developed to account for the effects of prior knowledge. The purpose of this article is to present a model of categorization referred to as causal-model theory or CMT [2, 3]. According to CMT, people 's know ledge of many categories includes not only features, but also an explicit representation of the causal mechanisms that people believe link the features of many categories. In this article I apply CMT to the problem of establishing objects category membership. In the psychological literature one standard view of categorization is that objects are placed in a category to the extent they have features that have often been observed in members of that category. For example, an object that has most of the features of birds (e.g., wings, fly, build nests in trees, etc.) and few features of other categories is thought to be a bird. This view of categorization is formalized by prototype models in which classification is a function of the similarity (i.e. , number of shared features) between a mental representation of a category prototype and a to-be-classified object. However , a well-known difficulty with prototype models is that a features contribution to category membership is independent of the presence or absence of other features. In contrast , consideration of a categorys theoretical knowledge is likely to influence which combinations of features make for acceptable category members. For example , people believe that birds have nests in trees because they can fly , and in light of this knowledge an animal that doesnt fly and yet still builds nests in trees might be considered a less plausible bird than an animal that builds nests on the ground and doesnt fly (e.g., an ostrich) even though the latter animal has fewer features typical of birds. To assess whether knowledge in fact influences which feature combinations make for good category members , in the following experiment undergraduates were taught novel categories whose four binary features exhibited either a common-cause or a common-effect schema (Figure 1). In the common-cause schema, one category feature (PI) is described as causing the three other features (F 2, F 3, and F4). In the common-effect schema one feature (F4) is described as being caused by the three others (F I, F 2, and F3). CMT assumes that people represent causal knowledge such as that in Figure 1 as a kind of Bayesian network [4] in which nodes are variables representing binary category features and directed edges are causal relationships representing the presence of probabilistic causal mechanisms between features. Specifically , CMT assumes that when a cause feature is present it enables the operation of a causal mechanism that will, with some probability m , bring about the presence of the effect feature. CMT also allow for the possibility that effect features have potential background causes that are not explicitly represented in the network, as represented by parameter b which is the probability that an effect will be present even when its network causes are absent. Finally, each cause node has a parameter c that represents the probability that a cause feature will be present. ~ Common-Cause Schema ~ ® Common-Effect Schema Figure 1. ...(~~) @ ..... : ~~:f·</p><p>4 0.090613805 <a title="90-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Tommi Jaakkola, Hava T. Siegelmann</p><p>Abstract: In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>6 0.074988112 <a title="90-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Computing_Time_Lower_Bounds_for_Recurrent_Sigmoidal_Neural_Networks.html">52 nips-2001-Computing Time Lower Bounds for Recurrent Sigmoidal Neural Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Eran Segal, Daphne Koller, Dirk Ormoneit</p><p>Abstract: Many domains are naturally organized in an abstraction hierarchy or taxonomy, where the instances in “nearby” classes in the taxonomy are similar. In this paper, we provide a general probabilistic framework for clustering data into a set of classes organized as a taxonomy, where each class is associated with a probabilistic model from which the data was generated. The clustering algorithm simultaneously optimizes three things: the assignment of data instances to clusters, the models associated with the clusters, and the structure of the abstraction hierarchy. A unique feature of our approach is that it utilizes global optimization algorithms for both of the last two steps, reducing the sensitivity to noise and the propensity to local maxima that are characteristic of algorithms such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering that only take local steps. We provide a theoretical analysis for our algorithm, showing that it converges to a local maximum of the joint likelihood of model and data. We present experimental results on synthetic data, and on real data in the domains of gene expression and text.</p><p>5 0.42806011 <a title="90-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Causal_Categorization_with_Bayes_Nets.html">47 nips-2001-Causal Categorization with Bayes Nets</a></p>

<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: The Cluster Variation method is a class of approximation methods containing the Bethe and Kikuchi approximations as special cases. We derive two novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method. One is a fixed point iteration scheme which gives a significant improvement over loopy BP, mean field and TAP methods on directed graphical models. The other is a gradient based method, that is guaranteed to converge and is shown to give useful results on random graphs with mild frustration. We conclude that the methods are of significant practical value for large inference problems. 1</p><p>3 0.48786882 <a title="90-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Grammar_Transfer_in_a_Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network.html">85 nips-2001-Grammar Transfer in a Second Order Recurrent Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiro Negishi, Stephen J. Hanson</p><p>Abstract: It has been known that people, after being exposed to sentences generated by an artificial grammar, acquire implicit grammatical knowledge and are able to transfer the knowledge to inputs that are generated by a modified grammar. We show that a second order recurrent neural network is able to transfer grammatical knowledge from one language (generated by a Finite State Machine) to another language which differ both in vocabularies and syntax. Representation of the grammatical knowledge in the network is analyzed using linear discriminant analysis. 1</p><p>4 0.48614386 <a title="90-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Grouping_with_Bias.html">89 nips-2001-Grouping with Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: With the optimization of pattern discrimination as a goal, graph partitioning approaches often lack the capability to integrate prior knowledge to guide grouping. In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblema We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results. 1</p><p>5 0.48345447 <a title="90-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Means%2C_Correlations_and_Bounds.html">119 nips-2001-Means, Correlations and Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Martijn Leisink, Bert Kappen</p><p>Abstract: The partition function for a Boltzmann machine can be bounded from above and below. We can use this to bound the means and the correlations. For networks with small weights, the values of these statistics can be restricted to non-trivial regions (i.e. a subset of [-1 , 1]). Experimental results show that reasonable bounding occurs for weight sizes where mean field expansions generally give good results. 1</p><p>6 0.4829725 <a title="90-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Generating_velocity_tuning_by_asymmetric_recurrent_connections.html">82 nips-2001-Generating velocity tuning by asymmetric recurrent connections</a></p>

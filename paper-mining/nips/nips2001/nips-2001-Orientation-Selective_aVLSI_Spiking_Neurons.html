<p>Author: Julian Eggert, Berthold BĂ¤uml</p><p>Abstract: Mesoscopical, mathematical descriptions of dynamics of populations of spiking neurons are getting increasingly important for the understanding of large-scale processes in the brain using simulations. In our previous work, integral equation formulations for population dynamics have been derived for a special type of spiking neurons. For Integrate- and- Fire type neurons , these formulations were only approximately correct. Here, we derive a mathematically compact, exact population dynamics formulation for Integrate- and- Fire type neurons. It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Gregor Wenning, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements integrating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We analytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more realistic neuron model. 1</p><p>5 0.28400111 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>
<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>6 0.27837181 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Citcuits_for_VLSI_Implementation_of_Temporally_Asymmetric_Hebbian_Learning.html">49 nips-2001-Citcuits for VLSI Implementation of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Ádám Kepecs, S. Raghavachari</p><p>Abstract: Neurons receive excitatory inputs via both fast AMPA and slow NMDA type receptors. We find that neurons receiving input via NMDA receptors can have two stable membrane states which are input dependent. Action potentials can only be initiated from the higher voltage state. Similar observations have been made in several brain areas which might be explained by our model. The interactions between the two kinds of inputs lead us to suggest that some neurons may operate in 3 states: disabled, enabled and firing. Such enabled, but non-firing modes can be used to introduce context-dependent processing in neural networks. We provide a simple example and discuss possible implications for neuronal processing and response variability. 1</p><p>4 0.68399364 <a title="141-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Group_Redundancy_Measures_Reveal_Redundancy_Reduction_in_the_Auditory_Pathway.html">87 nips-2001-Group Redundancy Measures Reveal Redundancy Reduction in the Auditory Pathway</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, M. J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic information is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hypothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are significant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells. The results suggest that the auditory system transforms low level representations that contain redundancies due to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, into a representation in which cortical neurons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic signals, that are useful for auditory scene analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.67436779 <a title="141-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>

Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>6 0.66860777 <a title="141-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Citcuits_for_VLSI_Implementation_of_Temporally_Asymmetric_Hebbian_Learning.html">49 nips-2001-Citcuits for VLSI Implementation of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Jörg Kramer, Giacomo Indiveri, Tobi Delbrück, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models. The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-ﬁre neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture. The circuit on this multi-neuron chip approximates a cortical microcircuit. The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.</p><p>2 0.7638225 <a title="141-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Learning_a_Gaussian_Process_Prior_for_Automatically_Generating_Music_Playlists.html">113 nips-2001-Learning a Gaussian Process Prior for Automatically Generating Music Playlists</a></p>
<p>Author: John C. Platt, Christopher J. C. Burges, Steven Swenson, Christopher Weare, Alice Zheng</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AutoDJ: a system for automatically generating music playlists based on one or more seed songs selected by a user. AutoDJ uses Gaussian Process Regression to learn a user preference function over songs. This function takes music metadata as inputs. This paper further introduces Kernel Meta-Training, which is a method of learning a Gaussian Process kernel from a distribution of functions that generates the learned function. For playlist generation, AutoDJ learns a kernel from a large set of albums. This learned kernel is shown to be more effective at predicting users’ playlists than a reasonable hand-designed kernel.</p><p>3 0.75532848 <a title="141-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Sequence_Kernel_and_its_Application_to_Speaker_Recognition.html">20 nips-2001-A Sequence Kernel and its Application to Speaker Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach for comparing sequences of observations using an explicit-expansion kernel is demonstrated. The kernel is derived using the assumption of the independence of the sequence of observations and a mean-squared error training criterion. The use of an explicit expansion kernel reduces classiﬁer model size and computation dramatically, resulting in model sizes and computation one-hundred times smaller in our application. The explicit expansion also preserves the computational advantages of an earlier architecture based on mean-squared error training. Training using standard support vector machine methodology gives accuracy that signiﬁcantly exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art mean-squared error training for a speaker recognition task.</p><p>4 0.64482826 <a title="141-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>5 0.64146733 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-A_Generalization_of_Principal_Components_Analysis_to_the_Exponential_Family.html">9 nips-2001-A Generalization of Principal Components Analysis to the Exponential Family</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Collins, S. Dasgupta, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly applied technique for dimensionality reduction. PCA implicitly minimizes a squared loss function, which may be inappropriate for data that is not real-valued, such as binary-valued data. This paper draws on ideas from the Exponential family, Generalized linear models, and Bregman distances, to give a generalization of PCA to loss functions that we argue are better suited to other data types. We describe algorithms for minimizing the loss functions, and give examples on simulated data.</p><p>6 0.64092994 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Discriminative_Direction_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">60 nips-2001-Discriminative Direction for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>

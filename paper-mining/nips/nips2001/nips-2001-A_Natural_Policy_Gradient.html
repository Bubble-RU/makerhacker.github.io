<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>3 0.36768925 <a title="13-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Model-Free_Least-Squares_Policy_Iteration.html">121 nips-2001-Model-Free Least-Squares Policy Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Michail G. Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efﬁcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly inﬂuenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We have tested LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efﬁciently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials.</p><p>4 0.3669191 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Direct_value-approximation_for_factored_MDPs.html">59 nips-2001-Direct value-approximation for factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>5 0.33945101 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Rates_of_Convergence_of_Performance_Gradient_Estimates_Using_Function_Approximation_and_Bias_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">157 nips-2001-Rates of Convergence of Performance Gradient Estimates Using Function Approximation and Bias in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregory Z. Grudic, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We address two open theoretical questions in Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning.

Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of relative to when no function approximation of is used, where is the number of possible actions and is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function. Theory is presented showing that a non-zero bias term can improve the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by , where is the number of possible actions. Experimental evidence is presented showing that these theoretical results lead to signiﬁcant improvement in the convergence properties of Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning algorithms.       ¤ ¨ ¦ ¢ ©§¥¤£¡ ¦ ¤ ¨ £¡ ¨ ¤¢  ¢</p><p>6 0.27605608 <a title="13-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Batch_Value_Function_Approximation_via_Support_Vectors.html">40 nips-2001-Batch Value Function Approximation via Support Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Blankertz, Gabriel Curio, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Driven by the progress in the ﬁeld of single-trial analysis of EEG, there is a growing interest in brain computer interfaces (BCIs), i.e., systems that enable human subjects to control a computer only by means of their brain signals. In a pseudo-online simulation our BCI detects upcoming ﬁnger movements in a natural keyboard typing condition and predicts their laterality. This can be done on average 100–230 ms before the respective key is actually pressed, i.e., long before the onset of EMG. Our approach is appealing for its short response time and high classiﬁcation accuracy (>96%) in a binary decision where no human training is involved. We compare discriminative classiﬁers like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and different variants of Fisher Discriminant that possess favorable regularization properties for dealing with high noise cases (inter-trial variablity).</p><p>5 0.87278944 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Efficient_Resources_Allocation_for_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">67 nips-2001-Efficient Resources Allocation for Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: It is desirable that a complex decision-making problem in an uncertain world be adequately modeled by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) whose structural representation is adaptively designed by a parsimonious resources allocation process. Resources include time and cost of exploration, amount of memory and computational time allowed for the policy or value function representation. Concerned about making the best use of the available resources, we address the problem of efficiently estimating where adding extra resources is highly needed in order to improve the expected performance of the resulting policy. Possible application in reinforcement learning (RL) , when real-world exploration is highly costly, concerns the detection of those areas of the state-space that need primarily to be explored in order to improve the policy. Another application concerns approximation of continuous state-space stochastic control problems using adaptive discretization techniques for which highly efficient grid points allocation is mandatory to survive high dimensionality. Maybe surprisingly these two problems can be formulated under a common framework: for a given resource allocation, which defines a belief state over possible MDPs, find where adding new resources (thus decreasing the uncertainty of some parameters -transition probabilities or rewards) will most likely increase the expected performance of the new policy. To do so, we use sampling techniques for estimating the contribution of each parameter's probability distribution function (Pdf) to the expected loss of using an approximate policy (such as the optimal policy of the most probable MDP) instead of the true (but unknown) policy.</p><p>6 0.87138772 <a title="13-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Predictive_Representations_of_State.html">148 nips-2001-Predictive Representations of State</a></p>

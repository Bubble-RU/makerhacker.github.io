<p>Author: Hiroshi Shimodaira, Ken-ichi Noma, Mitsuru Nakai, Shigeki Sagayama</p><p>Abstract: A new class of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is applicable to sequential-pattern recognition such as speech recognition is developed by incorporating an idea of non-linear time alignment into the kernel function. Since the time-alignment operation of sequential pattern is embedded in the new kernel function, standard SVM training and classiﬁcation algorithms can be employed without further modiﬁcations. The proposed SVM (DTAK-SVM) is evaluated in speaker-dependent speech recognition experiments of hand-segmented phoneme recognition. Preliminary experimental results show comparable recognition performance with hidden Markov models (HMMs). 1</p><p>5 0.17486076 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Speech_Recognition_using_SVMs.html">172 nips-2001-Speech Recognition using SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: N. Smith, Mark Gales</p><p>Abstract: An important issue in applying SVMs to speech recognition is the ability to classify variable length sequences. This paper presents extensions to a standard scheme for handling this variable length data, the Fisher score. A more useful mapping is introduced based on the likelihood-ratio. The score-space defined by this mapping avoids some limitations of the Fisher score. Class-conditional generative models are directly incorporated into the definition of the score-space. The mapping, and appropriate normalisation schemes, are evaluated on a speaker-independent isolated letter task where the new mapping outperforms both the Fisher score and HMMs trained to maximise likelihood. 1</p><p>6 0.17166682 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Asymptotic_Universality_for_Learning_Curves_of_Support_Vector_Machines.html">38 nips-2001-Asymptotic Universality for Learning Curves of Support Vector Machines</a></p>

Felderhof</p><p>Abstract: Recently Hinton (1999) has introduced the Products of Experts (PoE) model in which several individual probabilistic models for data are combined to provide an overall model of the data. Below we consider PoE models in which each expert is a Gaussian. Although the product of Gaussians is also a Gaussian, if each Gaussian has a simple structure the product can have a richer structure. We examine (1) Products of Gaussian pancakes which give rise to probabilistic Minor Components Analysis, (2) products of I-factor PPCA models and (3) a products of experts construction for an AR(l) process. Recently Hinton (1999) has introduced the Products of Experts (PoE) model in which several individual probabilistic models for data are combined to provide an overall model of the data. In this paper we consider PoE models in which each expert is a Gaussian. It is easy to see that in this case the product model will also be Gaussian. However, if each Gaussian has a simple structure, the product can have a richer structure. Using Gaussian experts is attractive as it permits a thorough analysis of the product architecture, which can be difficult with other models , e.g. models defined over discrete random variables. Below we examine three cases of the products of Gaussians construction: (1) Products of Gaussian pancakes (PoGP) which give rise to probabilistic Minor Components Analysis (MCA), providing a complementary result to probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) obtained by Tipping and Bishop (1999); (2) Products of I-factor PPCA models; (3) A products of experts construction for an AR(l) process.

<p>Author: Nicolas Chapados, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Joumana Ghosn, Charles Dugas, Ichiro Takeuchi, Linyan Meng</p><p>Abstract: Estimating insurance premia from data is a difficult regression problem for several reasons: the large number of variables, many of which are .discrete, and the very peculiar shape of the noise distribution, asymmetric with fat tails, with a large majority zeros and a few unreliable and very large values. We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers. 1</p><p>5 0.45132625 <a title="16-lsi-5" href="./nips-2001-Categorization_by_Learning_and_Combining_Object_Parts.html">46 nips-2001-Categorization by Learning and Combining Object Parts</a></p>

Our work is different from all previous work in three important ways. First, like the input provided to V1 by LGN, the input to our computation is isotropic. That is, the input is composed of spots not edges. Second, our network computes a well deﬁned function of the input based on a distribution of closed contours characterized by a random process. Third, even though our computation is implemented in a discrete network, its output is invariant to continuous rotations and translations of the input pattern.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73225671 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-A_Parallel_Mixture_of_SVMs_for_Very_Large_Scale_Problems.html">16 nips-2001-A Parallel Mixture of SVMs for Very Large Scale Problems</a></p>

In this paper we address the problem of inferring predictive individual proﬁles from such historical transaction data. We describe a generative mixture model for count data and use an an approximate Bayesian estimation framework that eﬀectively combines an individual’s speciﬁc history with more general population patterns. We use a large real-world retail transaction data set to illustrate how these proﬁles consistently outperform non-mixture and non-Bayesian techniques in predicting customer behavior in out-of-sample data. 1</p><p>4 0.61909235 <a title="16-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Fast%2C_Large-Scale_Transformation-Invariant_Clustering.html">75 nips-2001-Fast, Large-Scale Transformation-Invariant Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: In previous work on “transformed mixtures of Gaussians” and “transformed hidden Markov models”, we showed how the EM algorithm in a discrete latent variable model can be used to jointly normalize data (e.g., center images, pitch-normalize spectrograms) and learn a mixture model of the normalized data. The only input to the algorithm is the data, a list of possible transformations, and the number of clusters to ﬁnd. The main criticism of this work was that the exhaustive computation of the posterior probabilities over transformations would make scaling up to large feature vectors and large sets of transformations intractable. Here, we describe how a tremendous speed-up is acheived through the use of a variational technique for decoupling transformations, and a fast Fourier transform method for computing posterior probabilities. For N ×N images, learning C clusters under N rotations, N scales, N x-translations and N y-translations takes only (C + 2 log N )N 2 scalar operations per iteration. In contrast, the original algorithm takes CN 6 operations to account for these transformations. We give results on learning a 4-component mixture model from a video sequence with frames of size 320 ×240. The model accounts for 360 rotations and 76,800 translations. Each iteration of EM takes only 10 seconds per frame in MATLAB, which is over 5 million times faster than the original algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.61415136 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Learning_Lateral_Interactions_for_Feature_Binding_and_Sensory_Segmentation.html">111 nips-2001-Learning Lateral Interactions for Feature Binding and Sensory Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Heiko Wersing</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to the supervised learning of lateral interactions for the competitive layer model (CLM) dynamic feature binding architecture. The method is based on consistency conditions, which were recently shown to characterize the attractor states of this linear threshold recurrent network. For a given set of training examples the learning problem is formulated as a convex quadratic optimization problem in the lateral interaction weights. An efﬁcient dimension reduction of the learning problem can be achieved by using a linear superposition of basis interactions. We show the successful application of the method to a medical image segmentation problem of ﬂuorescence microscope cell images.</p><p>6 0.60359544 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Bayesian_time_series_classification.html">43 nips-2001-Bayesian time series classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>3 0.14173371 <a title="161-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Rates_of_Convergence_of_Performance_Gradient_Estimates_Using_Function_Approximation_and_Bias_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">157 nips-2001-Rates of Convergence of Performance Gradient Estimates Using Function Approximation and Bias in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>5 0.10564001 <a title="161-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Generalizable_Relational_Binding_from_Coarse-coded_Distributed_Representations.html">80 nips-2001-Generalizable Relational Binding from Coarse-coded Distributed Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Randall C. O'Reilly, R. S. Busby</p><p>Abstract: We present a model of binding of relationship information in a spatial domain (e.g., square above triangle) that uses low-order coarse-coded conjunctive representations instead of more popular temporal synchrony mechanisms. Supporters of temporal synchrony argue that conjunctive representations lack both efﬁciency (i.e., combinatorial numbers of units are required) and systematicity (i.e., the resulting representations are overly speciﬁc and thus do not support generalization to novel exemplars). To counter these claims, we show that our model: a) uses far fewer hidden units than the number of conjunctions represented, by using coarse-coded, distributed representations where each unit has a broad tuning curve through high-dimensional conjunction space, and b) is capable of considerable generalization to novel inputs.</p><p>6 0.10384913 <a title="161-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Motivated_Reinforcement_Learning.html">126 nips-2001-Motivated Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Lee Isbell Jr., Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: We report on the use of reinforcement learning with Cobot, a software agent residing in the well-known online community LambdaMOO. Our initial work on Cobot (Isbell et al.2000) provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users. Here we describe an application of RL allowing Cobot to take proactive actions in this complex social environment, and adapt behavior from multiple sources of human reward. After 5 months of training, and 3171 reward and punishment events from 254 different LambdaMOO users, Cobot learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users, modiﬁng his behavior based on his current state. Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.64992446 <a title="161-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Motivated_Reinforcement_Learning.html">126 nips-2001-Motivated Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: The standard reinforcement learning view of the involvement of neuromodulatory systems in instrumental conditioning includes a rather straightforward conception of motivation as prediction of sum future reward. Competition between actions is based on the motivating characteristics of their consequent states in this sense. Substantial, careful, experiments reviewed in Dickinson & Balleine, 12,13 into the neurobiology and psychology of motivation shows that this view is incomplete. In many cases, animals are faced with the choice not between many different actions at a given state, but rather whether a single response is worth executing at all. Evidence suggests that the motivational process underlying this choice has different psychological and neural properties from that underlying action choice. We describe and model these motivational systems, and consider the way they interact.</p><p>4 0.58310688 <a title="161-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Multiagent_Planning_with_Factored_MDPs.html">128 nips-2001-Multiagent Planning with Factored MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>6 0.52556837 <a title="161-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Efficient_Resources_Allocation_for_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">67 nips-2001-Efficient Resources Allocation for Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

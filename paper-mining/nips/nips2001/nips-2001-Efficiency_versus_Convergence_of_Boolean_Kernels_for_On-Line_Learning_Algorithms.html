<p>Author: Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace-Beltrami op erator on a manifold , and the connections to the heat equation , we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for constructing a representation for data sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Several applications are considered. In many areas of artificial intelligence, information retrieval and data mining, one is often confronted with intrinsically low dimensional data lying in a very high dimensional space. For example, gray scale n x n images of a fixed object taken with a moving camera yield data points in rn: n2 . However , the intrinsic dimensionality of the space of all images of t he same object is the number of degrees of freedom of the camera - in fact the space has the natural structure of a manifold embedded in rn: n2 . While there is a large body of work on dimensionality reduction in general, most existing approaches do not explicitly take into account the structure of the manifold on which the data may possibly reside. Recently, there has been some interest (Tenenbaum et aI, 2000 ; Roweis and Saul, 2000) in the problem of developing low dimensional representations of data in this particular context. In this paper , we present a new algorithm and an accompanying framework of analysis for geometrically motivated dimensionality reduction. The core algorithm is very simple, has a few local computations and one sparse eigenvalu e problem. The solution reflects th e intrinsic geom etric structure of the manifold. Th e justification comes from the role of the Laplacian op erator in providing an optimal emb edding. Th e Laplacian of the graph obtained from the data points may be viewed as an approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the manifold. The emb edding maps for the data come from approximations to a natural map that is defined on the entire manifold. The framework of analysis presented here makes this connection explicit. While this connection is known to geometers and specialists in sp ectral graph theory (for example , see [1, 2]) to the best of our knowledge we do not know of any application to data representation yet. The connection of the Laplacian to the heat kernel enables us to choose the weights of the graph in a principled manner. The locality preserving character of the Laplacian Eigenmap algorithm makes it relatively insensitive to outliers and noise. A byproduct of this is that the algorithm implicitly emphasizes the natural clusters in the data. Connections to spectral clustering algorithms developed in learning and computer vision (see Shi and Malik , 1997) become very clear. Following the discussion of Roweis and Saul (2000) , and Tenenbaum et al (2000), we note that the biological perceptual apparatus is confronted with high dimensional stimuli from which it must recover low dimensional structure. One might argue that if the approach to recovering such low-dimensional structure is inherently local , then a natural clustering will emerge and thus might serve as the basis for the development of categories in biological perception. 1 The Algorithm Given k points Xl , ... , Xk in ]]{ I, we construct a weighted graph with k nodes, one for each point , and the set of edges connecting neighboring points to each other. 1.

<p>Author: Anita C. Faul, Michael E. Tipping</p><p>Abstract: The recent introduction of the 'relevance vector machine' has effectively demonstrated how sparsity may be obtained in generalised linear models within a Bayesian framework. Using a particular form of Gaussian parameter prior, 'learning' is the maximisation, with respect to hyperparameters, of the marginal likelihood of the data. This paper studies the properties of that objective function, and demonstrates that conditioned on an individual hyperparameter, the marginal likelihood has a unique maximum which is computable in closed form. It is further shown that if a derived 'sparsity criterion' is satisfied, this maximum is exactly equivalent to 'pruning' the corresponding parameter from the model. 1</p><p>4 0.62753475 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongyuan Zha, Xiaofeng He, Chris Ding, Ming Gu, Horst D. Simon</p><p>Abstract: The popular K-means clustering partitions a data set by minimizing a sum-of-squares cost function. A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by computing a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by computing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function. 1</p><p>5 0.6274606 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Global_Coordination_of_Local_Linear_Models.html">84 nips-2001-Global Coordination of Local Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Sam T. Roweis, Lawrence K. Saul, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be described by a collection of local linear models. Such a description, however, does not provide a global parameterization of the manifold—arguably an important goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a collection of local linear models that solves this more difﬁcult problem. Our local linear models are represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the “global coordination” of these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a degeneracy in the mixture model’s parameter space, favoring models whose internal coordinate systems are aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coordinates change smoothly and continuously as one traverses a connected path on the manifold—even when the path crosses the domains of many different local models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and illustrates an unexpected application of variational methods: not to perform approximate inference in intractable probabilistic models, but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones. 1 Manifold Learning Consider an ensemble of images, each of which contains a face against a neutral background. Each image can be represented by a point in the high dimensional vector space of pixel intensities. This representation, however, does not exploit the strong correlations between pixels of the same image, nor does it support many useful operations for reasoning about faces. If, for example, we select two images with faces in widely different locations and then average their pixel intensities, we do not obtain an image of a face at their average location. Images of faces lie on or near a low-dimensional, curved manifold, and we can represent them more usefully by the coordinates on this manifold than by pixel intensities. Using these “intrinsic coordinates”, the average of two faces is another face with the average of their locations, poses and expressions. To analyze and manipulate faces, it is helpful to imagine a “magic black box” with levers or dials corresponding to the intrinsic coordinates on this manifold. Given a setting of the levers and dials, the box generates an image of a face. Given an image of a face, the box deduces the appropriate setting of the levers and dials. In this paper, we describe a fairly general way to construct such a box automatically from an ensemble of high-dimensional vectors. We assume only that there exists an underlying manifold of low dimensionality and that the relationship between the raw data and the manifold coordinates is locally linear and smoothly varying. Thus our method applies not only to images of faces, but also to many other forms of highly distributed perceptual and scientiﬁc data (e.g., spectrograms of speech, robotic sensors, gene expression arrays, document collections). 2 Local Linear Models The global structure of perceptual manifolds (such as images of faces) tends to be highly nonlinear. Fortunately, despite their complicated global structure, we can usually characterize these manifolds as locally linear. Thus, to a good approximation, they can be represented by collections of simpler models, each of which describes a locally linear neighborhood[3, 6, 8]. For unsupervised learning tasks, a probabilistic model that nicely captures this intuition is a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA)[5]. The model is used to describe high dimensional data that lies on or near a lower dimensional manifold. MFAs parameterize a joint distribution over observed and hidden variables: (1) where the observed variable, , represents the high dimensional data; the discrete hidden variables, , indexes different neighborhoods on the manifold; and the continuous hidden variables, , represent low dimensional local coordinates. The model assumes that data is sampled from different neighborhoods on the manifold with prior probabilities , and that within each neighborhood, the data’s local coordinates are normally distributed1 as:  RP&¤§¢  Q  ¡ I 0 (  3HGF D C¥@@@¥ 8¥75 ( E¨BAA9¨©©64§ 2 0 ( 31)£ ¥ ¡    ¡   ¥ ¡     ¥ §¥ ¡ &¤§¢'&§ %#¤¢$#¨</p><p>6 0.60730815 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>

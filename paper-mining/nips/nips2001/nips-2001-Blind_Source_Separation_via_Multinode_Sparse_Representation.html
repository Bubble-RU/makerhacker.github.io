<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Andreas Ziehe, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: In kernel based learning the data is mapped to a kernel feature space of a dimension that corresponds to the number of training data points. In practice, however, the data forms a smaller submanifold in feature space, a fact that has been used e.g. by reduced set techniques for SVMs. We propose a new mathematical construction that permits to adapt to the intrinsic dimension and to ﬁnd an orthonormal basis of this submanifold. In doing so, computations get much simpler and more important our theoretical framework allows to derive elegant kernelized blind source separation (BSS) algorithms for arbitrary invertible nonlinear mixings. Experiments demonstrate the good performance and high computational efﬁciency of our kTDSEP algorithm for the problem of nonlinear BSS.</p><p>4 0.13700369 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-On_Spectral_Clustering%3A_Analysis_and_an_algorithm.html">135 nips-2001-On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methodsalgorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1</p><p>5 0.13198552 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Estimating_the_Reliability_of_ICA_Projections.html">71 nips-2001-Estimating the Reliability of ICA Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank C. Meinecke, Andreas Ziehe, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When applying unsupervised learning techniques like ICA or temporal decorrelation, a key question is whether the discovered projections are reliable. In other words: can we give error bars or can we assess the quality of our separation? We use resampling methods to tackle these questions and show experimentally that our proposed variance estimations are strongly correlated to the separation error. We demonstrate that this reliability estimation can be used to choose the appropriate ICA-model, to enhance significantly the separation performance, and, most important, to mark the components that have a actual physical meaning. Application to 49-channel-data from an magneto encephalography (MEG) experiment underlines the usefulness of our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.12294924 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Magnus Rattray, Gleb Basalyga</p><p>Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Hebbian ICA algorithm extracting a single non-Gaussian component from a high-dimensional Gaussian background. For both on-line and batch learning we ﬁnd that a surprisingly large number of examples are required to avoid trapping in a sub-optimal state close to the initial conditions. To extract a skewed signal at least examples are required for -dimensional data and examples are required to extract a symmetrical signal with non-zero kurtosis. § ¡ ©£¢  £ §¥ ¡ ¨¦¤£¢</p><p>6 0.40995127 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Relaxation_for_K-means_Clustering.html">171 nips-2001-Spectral Relaxation for K-means Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Roman Genov, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: A mixed-signal paradigm is presented for high-resolution parallel innerproduct computation in very high dimensions, suitable for efﬁcient implementation of kernels in image processing. At the core of the externally digital architecture is a high-density, low-power analog array performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication. Full digital resolution is maintained even with low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion, owing to random statistics in the analog summation of binary products. A random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics even for highly correlated inputs. The approach is validated with real image data, and with experimental results from a CID/DRAM analog array prototype in 0.5 m CMOS. ¢</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78320605 <a title="44-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Blind_Source_Separation_via_Multinode_Sparse_Representation.html">44 nips-2001-Blind Source Separation via Multinode Sparse Representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Xin Wang</p><p>Abstract: We present three ways of combining linear programming with the kernel trick to find value function approximations for reinforcement learning. One formulation is based on SVM regression; the second is based on the Bellman equation; and the third seeks only to ensure that good moves have an advantage over bad moves. All formulations attempt to minimize the number of support vectors while fitting the data. Experiments in a difficult, synthetic maze problem show that all three formulations give excellent performance, but the advantage formulation is much easier to train. Unlike policy gradient methods, the kernel methods described here can easily 'adjust the complexity of the function approximator to fit the complexity of the value function. 1</p><p>4 0.52484119 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Multi_Dimensional_ICA_to_Separate_Correlated_Sources.html">127 nips-2001-Multi Dimensional ICA to Separate Correlated Sources</a></p>

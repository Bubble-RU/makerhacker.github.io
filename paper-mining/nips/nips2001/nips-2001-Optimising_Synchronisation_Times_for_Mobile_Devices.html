<p>Author: Stuart N. Wrigley, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone. 1</p><p>4 0.090140551 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Causal_Categorization_with_Bayes_Nets.html">47 nips-2001-Causal Categorization with Bayes Nets</a></p>
<p>Author: Bob Rehder</p><p>Abstract: A theory of categorization is presented in which knowledge of causal relationships between category features is represented as a Bayesian network. Referred to as causal-model theory, this theory predicts that objects are classified as category members to the extent they are likely to have been produced by a categorys causal model. On this view, people have models of the world that lead them to expect a certain distribution of features in category members (e.g., correlations between feature pairs that are directly connected by causal relationships), and consider exemplars good category members when they manifest those expectations. These expectations include sensitivity to higher-order feature interactions that emerge from the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships. Research on the topic of categorization has traditionally focused on the problem of learning new categories given observations of category members. In contrast, the theory-based view of categories emphasizes the influence of the prior theoretical knowledge that learners often contribute to their representations of categories [1]. However, in contrast to models accounting for the effects of empirical observations, there have been few models developed to account for the effects of prior knowledge. The purpose of this article is to present a model of categorization referred to as causal-model theory or CMT [2, 3]. According to CMT, people 's know ledge of many categories includes not only features, but also an explicit representation of the causal mechanisms that people believe link the features of many categories. In this article I apply CMT to the problem of establishing objects category membership. In the psychological literature one standard view of categorization is that objects are placed in a category to the extent they have features that have often been observed in members of that category. For example, an object that has most of the features of birds (e.g., wings, fly, build nests in trees, etc.) and few features of other categories is thought to be a bird. This view of categorization is formalized by prototype models in which classification is a function of the similarity (i.e. , number of shared features) between a mental representation of a category prototype and a to-be-classified object. However , a well-known difficulty with prototype models is that a features contribution to category membership is independent of the presence or absence of other features. In contrast , consideration of a categorys theoretical knowledge is likely to influence which combinations of features make for acceptable category members. For example , people believe that birds have nests in trees because they can fly , and in light of this knowledge an animal that doesnt fly and yet still builds nests in trees might be considered a less plausible bird than an animal that builds nests on the ground and doesnt fly (e.g., an ostrich) even though the latter animal has fewer features typical of birds. To assess whether knowledge in fact influences which feature combinations make for good category members , in the following experiment undergraduates were taught novel categories whose four binary features exhibited either a common-cause or a common-effect schema (Figure 1). In the common-cause schema, one category feature (PI) is described as causing the three other features (F 2, F 3, and F4). In the common-effect schema one feature (F4) is described as being caused by the three others (F I, F 2, and F3). CMT assumes that people represent causal knowledge such as that in Figure 1 as a kind of Bayesian network [4] in which nodes are variables representing binary category features and directed edges are causal relationships representing the presence of probabilistic causal mechanisms between features. Specifically , CMT assumes that when a cause feature is present it enables the operation of a causal mechanism that will, with some probability m , bring about the presence of the effect feature. CMT also allow for the possibility that effect features have potential background causes that are not explicitly represented in the network, as represented by parameter b which is the probability that an effect will be present even when its network causes are absent. Finally, each cause node has a parameter c that represents the probability that a cause feature will be present. ~ Common-Cause Schema ~ ® Common-Effect Schema Figure 1. ...(~~) @ ..... : ~~:f·</p><p>5 0.071263045 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Quantizing_Density_Estimators.html">155 nips-2001-Quantizing Density Estimators</a></p>

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We consider noisy Euclidean traveling salesman problems in the plane, which are random combinatorial problems with underlying structure. Gibbs sampling is used to compute average trajectories, which estimate the underlying structure common to all instances. This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between permutations and tours. In a learning setting, the average trajectory is used as a model to construct solutions to new instances sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to a single instance. 1</p><p>6 0.43135229 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Model_Based_Population_Tracking_and_Automatic_Detection_of_Distribution_Changes.html">122 nips-2001-Model Based Population Tracking and Automatic Detection of Distribution Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Anand Rangarajan, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian belief propagation in graphical models has been recently shown to have very close ties to inference methods based in statistical physics. After Yedidia et al. demonstrated that belief propagation ﬁxed points correspond to extrema of the so-called Bethe free energy, Yuille derived a double loop algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Yuille’s algorithm is based on a certain decomposition of the Bethe free energy and he mentions that other decompositions are possible and may even be fruitful. In the present work, we begin with the Bethe free energy and show that it has a principled interpretation as pairwise mutual information minimization and marginal entropy maximization (MIME). Next, we construct a family of free energy functions from a spectrum of decompositions of the original Bethe free energy. For each free energy in this family, we develop a new algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. Preliminary computer simulations are in agreement with this theoretical development. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68736905 <a title="140-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Optimising_Synchronisation_Times_for_Mobile_Devices.html">140 nips-2001-Optimising Synchronisation Times for Mobile Devices</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Andreas Ziehe, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: In kernel based learning the data is mapped to a kernel feature space of a dimension that corresponds to the number of training data points. In practice, however, the data forms a smaller submanifold in feature space, a fact that has been used e.g. by reduced set techniques for SVMs. We propose a new mathematical construction that permits to adapt to the intrinsic dimension and to ﬁnd an orthonormal basis of this submanifold. In doing so, computations get much simpler and more important our theoretical framework allows to derive elegant kernelized blind source separation (BSS) algorithms for arbitrary invertible nonlinear mixings. Experiments demonstrate the good performance and high computational efﬁciency of our kTDSEP algorithm for the problem of nonlinear BSS.</p><p>4 0.50280434 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Convergence_of_Optimistic_and_Incremental_Q-Learning.html">55 nips-2001-Convergence of Optimistic and Incremental Q-Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: Vie sho,v the convergence of tV/O deterministic variants of Qlearning. The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>5 0.49842796 <a title="140-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>6 0.49788383 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

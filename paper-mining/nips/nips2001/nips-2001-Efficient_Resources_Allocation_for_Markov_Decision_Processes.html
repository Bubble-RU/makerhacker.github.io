<p>Author: Dale Schuurmans, Relu Patrascu</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the optimal value function can be approximated by a compact linear form. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that approximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterative solution method that tackles concise linear programs. This direct linear programming approach experimentally yields a significant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approximation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximation classes to achieve similar error in reasonable time. 1</p><p>3 0.23383781 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>4 0.21462354 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-The_Steering_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Reinforcement_Learning.html">187 nips-2001-The Steering Approach for Multi-Criteria Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Michail G. Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efﬁcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly inﬂuenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We have tested LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efﬁciently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials.</p><p>6 0.19032604 <a title="67-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Batch_Value_Function_Approximation_via_Support_Vectors.html">40 nips-2001-Batch Value Function Approximation via Support Vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Xin Wang</p><p>Abstract: We present three ways of combining linear programming with the kernel trick to find value function approximations for reinforcement learning. One formulation is based on SVM regression; the second is based on the Bellman equation; and the third seeks only to ensure that good moves have an advantage over bad moves. All formulations attempt to minimize the number of support vectors while fitting the data. Experiments in a difficult, synthetic maze problem show that all three formulations give excellent performance, but the advantage formulation is much easier to train. Unlike policy gradient methods, the kernel methods described here can easily 'adjust the complexity of the function approximator to fit the complexity of the value function. 1</p><p>6 0.65206182 <a title="67-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Stabilizing_Value_Function_Approximation_with_the_BFBP_Algorithm.html">175 nips-2001-Stabilizing Value Function Approximation with the BFBP Algorithm</a></p>

This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>4 0.46892762 <a title="67-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Convergence_of_Optimistic_and_Incremental_Q-Learning.html">55 nips-2001-Convergence of Optimistic and Incremental Q-Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: Vie sho,v the convergence of tV/O deterministic variants of Qlearning. The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>5 0.46650556 <a title="67-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Playing_is_believing%3A_The_role_of_beliefs_in_multi-agent_learning.html">146 nips-2001-Playing is believing: The role of beliefs in multi-agent learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Han Chang, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new classiﬁcation for multi-agent learning algorithms, with each league of players characterized by both their possible strategies and possible beliefs. Using this classiﬁcation, we review the optimality of existing algorithms, including the case of interleague play. We propose an incremental improvement to the existing algorithms that seems to achieve average payoffs that are at least the Nash equilibrium payoffs in the longrun against fair opponents.</p><p>6 0.45986637 <a title="67-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised_Particle_Filtering_via_Data_Augmentation.html">156 nips-2001-Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering via Data Augmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tommi Jaakkola, Hava T. Siegelmann</p><p>Abstract: In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the system responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of information that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1</p><p>3 0.10786738 <a title="184-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Small-World_Phenomena_and_the_Dynamics_of_Information.html">169 nips-2001-Small-World Phenomena and the Dynamics of Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlotta Domeniconi, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p><p>Abstract: The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classification problems. It relies on t he assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence of classification performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.09983243 <a title="184-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Fragment_Completion_in_Humans_and_Machines.html">78 nips-2001-Fragment Completion in Humans and Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: David Jacobs, Bas Rokers, Archisman Rudra, Zili Liu</p><p>Abstract: Partial information can trigger a complete memory. At the same time, human memory is not perfect. A cue can contain enough information to specify an item in memory, but fail to trigger that item. In the context of word memory, we present experiments that demonstrate some basic patterns in human memory errors. We use cues that consist of word fragments. We show that short and long cues are completed more accurately than medium length ones and study some of the factors that lead to this behavior. We then present a novel computational model that shows some of the ﬂexibility and patterns of errors that occur in human memory. This model iterates between bottom-up and top-down computations. These are tied together using a Markov model of words that allows memory to be accessed with a simple feature set, and enables a bottom-up process to compute a probability distribution of possible completions of word fragments, in a manner similar to models of visual perceptual completion.</p><p>6 0.083599821 <a title="184-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Concentration_of_Spectral_Properties.html">136 nips-2001-On the Concentration of Spectral Properties</a></p>

<p>Author: David M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a generative model for text and other collections of discrete data that generalizes or improves on several previous models including naive Bayes/unigram, mixture of unigrams [6], and Hofmann's aspect model , also known as probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI) [3]. In the context of text modeling, our model posits that each document is generated as a mixture of topics, where the continuous-valued mixture proportions are distributed as a latent Dirichlet random variable. Inference and learning are carried out efficiently via variational algorithms. We present empirical results on applications of this model to problems in text modeling, collaborative filtering, and text classification. 1</p><p>6 0.3279177 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Hyperbolic_Self-Organizing_Maps_for_Semantic_Navigation.html">90 nips-2001-Hyperbolic Self-Organizing Maps for Semantic Navigation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Oren Souroujon</p><p>Abstract: We present a powerful meta-clustering technique called Iterative Double Clustering (IDC). The IDC method is a natural extension of the recent Double Clustering (DC) method of Slonim and Tishby that exhibited impressive performance on text categorization tasks [12]. Using synthetically generated data we empirically ﬁnd that whenever the DC procedure is successful in recovering some of the structure hidden in the data, the extended IDC procedure can incrementally compute a signiﬁcantly more accurate classiﬁcation. IDC is especially advantageous when the data exhibits high attribute noise. Our simulation results also show the eﬀectiveness of IDC in text categorization problems. Surprisingly, this unsupervised procedure can be competitive with a (supervised) SVM trained with a small training set. Finally, we propose a simple and natural extension of IDC for semi-supervised and transductive learning where we are given both labeled and unlabeled examples. 1</p><p>3 0.38847151 <a title="184-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Multiagent_Planning_with_Factored_MDPs.html">128 nips-2001-Multiagent Planning with Factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a principled and efﬁcient planning algorithm for cooperative multiagent dynamic systems. A striking feature of our method is that the coordination and communication between the agents is not imposed, but derived directly from the system dynamics and function approximation architecture. We view the entire multiagent system as a single, large Markov decision process (MDP), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN. We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We show that our approach compares favorably with approaches based on reward sharing. We also show that our algorithm is an efﬁcient alternative to more complicated algorithms even in the single agent case.</p><p>4 0.37903237 <a title="184-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>5 0.37684566 <a title="184-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Rates_of_Convergence_of_Performance_Gradient_Estimates_Using_Function_Approximation_and_Bias_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">157 nips-2001-Rates of Convergence of Performance Gradient Estimates Using Function Approximation and Bias in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

The ﬁrst concerns the efﬁcacy of using function approximation to represent the state action value function, . Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of relative to when no function approximation of is used, where is the number of possible actions and is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function. Theory is presented showing that a non-zero bias term can improve the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by , where is the number of possible actions. Experimental evidence is presented showing that these theoretical results lead to signiﬁcant improvement in the convergence properties of Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning algorithms.       ¤ ¨ ¦ ¢ ©§¥¤£¡ ¦ ¤ ¨ £¡ ¨ ¤¢  ¢</p><p>6 0.37668771 <a title="184-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

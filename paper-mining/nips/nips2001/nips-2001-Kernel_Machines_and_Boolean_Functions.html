<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Dan Roth, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning in Boolean domains using kernels which capture feature expansions equivalent to using conjunctions over basic features. We demonstrate a tradeoff between the computational efﬁciency with which these kernels can be computed and the generalization ability of the resulting classiﬁer. We ﬁrst describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efﬁciently run the Perceptron algorithm over an exponential number of conjunctions; however we also prove that using such kernels the Perceptron algorithm can make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We also consider an analogous use of kernel functions to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. While known upper bounds imply that Winnow can learn DNF formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnow’s behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set, and thus that such kernel functions for Winnow are not efﬁciently computable.</p><p>3 0.24126856 <a title="105-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Online_Learning_with_Kernels.html">139 nips-2001-Online Learning with Kernels</a></p>

Our method is computationally efﬁcient and leads to simple algorithms. In particular we derive update equations for classiﬁcation, regression, and novelty detection. The inclusion of the -trick allows us to give a robust parameterization. Moreover, unlike in batch learning where the -trick only applies to the -insensitive loss function we are able to derive general trimmed-mean types of estimators such as for Huber’s robust loss.     ¡</p><p>4 0.21365136 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Convolution_Kernels_for_Natural_Language.html">56 nips-2001-Convolution Kernels for Natural Language</a></p>

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Robert Urbanczik</p><p>Abstract: Using methods of Statistical Physics, we investigate the rOle of model complexity in learning with support vector machines (SVMs). We show the advantages of using SVMs with kernels of infinite complexity on noisy target rules, which, in contrast to common theoretical beliefs, are found to achieve optimal generalization error although the training error does not converge to the generalization error. Moreover, we find a universal asymptotics of the learning curves which only depend on the target rule but not on the SVM kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.19640374 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2001-On the Generalization Ability of On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan L. Yuille, Anand Rangarajan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the Concave-Convex procedure (CCCP) which constructs discrete time iterative dynamical systems which are guaranteed to monotonically decrease global optimization/energy functions. It can be applied to (almost) any optimization problem and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of CCCP. In particular, we prove relationships to some applications of Legendre transform techniques. We then illustrate CCCP by applications to Potts models, linear assignment, EM algorithms, and Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS). CCCP can be used both as a new way to understand existing optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.49547353 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_On-Line_Learning_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2001-On the Generalization Ability of On-Line Learning Algorithms</a></p>

We propose a technique which extends earlier work and aims at incorporating invariances in nonlinear kernels. We show on a digit recognition task that the proposed approach is superior to the Virtual Support Vector method, which previously had been the method of choice. 1</p><p>3 0.86777949 <a title="105-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Products_of_Gaussians.html">154 nips-2001-Products of Gaussians</a></p>

Recently Hinton (1999) has introduced the Products of Experts (PoE) model in which several individual probabilistic models for data are combined to provide an overall model of the data. In this paper we consider PoE models in which each expert is a Gaussian. It is easy to see that in this case the product model will also be Gaussian. However, if each Gaussian has a simple structure, the product can have a richer structure. Using Gaussian experts is attractive as it permits a thorough analysis of the product architecture, which can be difficult with other models , e.g. models defined over discrete random variables. Below we examine three cases of the products of Gaussians construction: (1) Products of Gaussian pancakes (PoGP) which give rise to probabilistic Minor Components Analysis (MCA), providing a complementary result to probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) obtained by Tipping and Bishop (1999); (2) Products of I-factor PPCA models; (3) A products of experts construction for an AR(l) process.

Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We give an uniﬁed convergence analysis of ensemble learning methods including e.g. AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and the Least-SquareBoost algorithm for regression. These methods have in common that they iteratively call a base learning algorithm which returns hypotheses that are then linearly combined. We show that these methods are related to the Gauss-Southwell method known from numerical optimization and state non-asymptotical convergence results for all these methods. Our analysis includes -norm regularized cost functions leading to a clean and general way to regularize ensemble learning.</p><p>5 0.84828228 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Rates_of_Convergence_of_Performance_Gradient_Estimates_Using_Function_Approximation_and_Bias_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">157 nips-2001-Rates of Convergence of Performance Gradient Estimates Using Function Approximation and Bias in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregory Z. Grudic, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We address two open theoretical questions in Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning. The ﬁrst concerns the efﬁcacy of using function approximation to represent the state action value function, . Theory is presented showing that linear function approximation representations of can degrade the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by a factor of relative to when no function approximation of is used, where is the number of possible actions and is the number of basis functions in the function approximation representation. The second concerns the use of a bias term in estimating the state action value function. Theory is presented showing that a non-zero bias term can improve the rate of convergence of performance gradient estimates by , where is the number of possible actions. Experimental evidence is presented showing that these theoretical results lead to signiﬁcant improvement in the convergence properties of Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning algorithms.       ¤ ¨ ¦ ¢ ©§¥¤£¡ ¦ ¤ ¨ £¡ ¨ ¤¢  ¢</p><p>6 0.84811139 <a title="105-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Variance_Reduction_Techniques_for_Gradient_Estimates_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">195 nips-2001-Variance Reduction Techniques for Gradient Estimates in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to attain multiple goals in a dynamic environment, which is initially unknown. In addition, the environment may contain arbitrarily varying elements related to actions of other agents or to non-stationary moves of Nature. This problem is modelled as a stochastic (Markov) game between the learning agent and an arbitrary player, with a vector-valued reward function. The objective of the learning agent is to have its long-term average reward vector belong to a given target set. We devise an algorithm for achieving this task, which is based on the theory of approachability for stochastic games. This algorithm combines, in an appropriate way, a ﬁnite set of standard, scalar-reward learning algorithms. Suﬃcient conditions are given for the convergence of the learning algorithm to a general target set. The specialization of these results to the single-controller Markov decision problem are discussed as well. 1</p><p>3 0.28013265 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the parameter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1</p><p>5 0.13959876 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Intransitive_Likelihood-Ratio_Classifiers.html">99 nips-2001-Intransitive Likelihood-Ratio Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeff Bilmes, Gang Ji, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic based correction term to the likelihood ratio classiﬁcation method for multiple classes. Under certain conditions, the term is sufﬁcient for optimally correcting the difference between the true and estimated likelihood ratio, and we analyze this in the Gaussian case. We ﬁnd that the new correction term significantly improves the classiﬁcation results when tested on medium vocabulary speech recognition tasks. Moreover, the addition of this term makes the class comparisons analogous to an intransitive game and we therefore use several tournament-like strategies to deal with this issue. We ﬁnd that further small improvements are obtained by using an appropriate tournament. Lastly, we ﬁnd that intransitivity appears to be a good measure of classiﬁcation conﬁdence.</p><p>6 0.12665358 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Multiagent_Planning_with_Factored_MDPs.html">128 nips-2001-Multiagent Planning with Factored MDPs</a></p>

Our initial work on Cobot (Isbell et al.2000) provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users. Here we describe an application of RL allowing Cobot to take proactive actions in this complex social environment, and adapt behavior from multiple sources of human reward. After 5 months of training, and 3171 reward and punishment events from 254 different LambdaMOO users, Cobot learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users, modiﬁng his behavior based on his current state. Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment. 1</p><p>6 0.27775621 <a title="146-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Natural_Policy_Gradient.html">13 nips-2001-A Natural Policy Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Xin Wang, Thomas G. Dietterich</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of non-convergence of online reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q learning and SARSA(A)) by adopting an incremental-batch approach that separates the exploration process from the function fitting process. Our BFBP (Batch Fit to Best Paths) algorithm alternates between an exploration phase (during which trajectories are generated to try to find fragments of the optimal policy) and a function fitting phase (during which a function approximator is fit to the best known paths from start states to terminal states). An advantage of this approach is that batch value-function fitting is a global process, which allows it to address the tradeoffs in function approximation that cannot be handled by local, online algorithms. This approach was pioneered by Boyan and Moore with their GROWSUPPORT and ROUT algorithms. We show how to improve upon their work by applying a better exploration process and by enriching the function fitting procedure to incorporate Bellman error and advantage error measures into the objective function. The results show improved performance on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>2 0.89063215 <a title="146-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-A_Dynamic_HMM_for_On-line_Segmentation_of_Sequential_Data.html">7 nips-2001-A Dynamic HMM for On-line Segmentation of Sequential Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jens Kohlmorgen, Steven Lemm</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits an inherent mode switching. In particular, the data might be a non-stationary time series from a dynamical system that switches between multiple operating modes. Unlike other approaches, our method processes the data incrementally and without any training of internal parameters. We use an HMM with a dynamically changing number of states and an on-line variant of the Viterbi algorithm that performs an unsupervised segmentation and classification of the data on-the-fly, i.e. the method is able to process incoming data in real-time. The main idea of the approach is to track and segment changes of the probability density of the data in a sliding window on the incoming data stream. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application to a switching dynamical system. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.87988704 <a title="146-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Playing_is_believing%3A_The_role_of_beliefs_in_multi-agent_learning.html">146 nips-2001-Playing is believing: The role of beliefs in multi-agent learning</a></p>

Our method is computationally efﬁcient and leads to simple algorithms. In particular we derive update equations for classiﬁcation, regression, and novelty detection. The inclusion of the -trick allows us to give a robust parameterization. Moreover, unlike in batch learning where the -trick only applies to the -insensitive loss function we are able to derive general trimmed-mean types of estimators such as for Huber’s robust loss.     ¡</p><p>5 0.74152642 <a title="146-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Convergence_of_Optimistic_and_Incremental_Q-Learning.html">55 nips-2001-Convergence of Optimistic and Incremental Q-Learning</a></p>

The first is the widely used optimistic Q-learning, which initializes the Q-values to large initial values and then follows a greedy policy with respect to the Q-values. We show that setting the initial value sufficiently large guarantees the converges to an Eoptimal policy. The second is a new and novel algorithm incremental Q-learning, which gradually promotes the values of actions that are not taken. We show that incremental Q-learning converges, in the limit, to the optimal policy. Our incremental Q-learning algorithm can be viewed as derandomization of the E-greedy Q-learning. 1</p><p>6 0.6873076 <a title="146-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-An_Efficient%2C_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_Tree-Structured_Graphical_Games.html">32 nips-2001-An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving Tree-Structured Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: The Cluster Variation method is a class of approximation methods containing the Bethe and Kikuchi approximations as special cases. We derive two novel iteration schemes for the Cluster Variation Method. One is a fixed point iteration scheme which gives a significant improvement over loopy BP, mean field and TAP methods on directed graphical models. The other is a gradient based method, that is guaranteed to converge and is shown to give useful results on random graphs with mild frustration. We conclude that the methods are of significant practical value for large inference problems. 1</p><p>3 0.25778925 <a title="188-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Tree-based_reparameterization_for_approximate_inference_on_loopy_graphs.html">192 nips-2001-Tree-based reparameterization for approximate inference on loopy graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We develop a tree-based reparameterization framework that provides a new conceptual view of a large class of iterative algorithms for computing approximate marginals in graphs with cycles. It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP /BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP /BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g. , 1, 2]. 1</p><p>4 0.17943434 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-TAP_Gibbs_Free_Energy%2C_Belief_Propagation_and_Sparsity.html">178 nips-2001-TAP Gibbs Free Energy, Belief Propagation and Sparsity</a></p>

We show how a speciﬁc sequential minimization of the free energy leads to a generalization of Minka’s expectation propagation.

The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated on classiﬁcation and density estimation with Gaussian processes and on an independent component analysis problem.</p><p>5 0.16418254 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Information_Geometrical_Framework_for_Analyzing_Belief_Propagation_Decoder.html">98 nips-2001-Information Geometrical Framework for Analyzing Belief Propagation Decoder</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiro Ikeda, Toshiyuki Tanaka, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: The mystery of belief propagation (BP) decoder, especially of the turbo decoding, is studied from information geometrical viewpoint. The loopy belief network (BN) of turbo codes makes it difﬁcult to obtain the true “belief” by BP, and the characteristics of the algorithm and its equilibrium are not clearly understood. Our study gives an intuitive understanding of the mechanism, and a new framework for the analysis. Based on the framework, we reveal basic properties of the turbo decoding.</p><p>6 0.13538581 <a title="188-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Very_loopy_belief_propagation_for_unwrapping_phase_images.html">196 nips-2001-Very loopy belief propagation for unwrapping phase images</a></p>

<p>Author: Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years, particle ﬁlters have been applied with great success to a variety of state estimation problems. We present a statistical approach to increasing the efﬁciency of particle ﬁlters by adapting the size of sample sets on-the-ﬂy. The key idea of the KLD-sampling method is to bound the approximation error introduced by the sample-based representation of the particle ﬁlter. The name KLD-sampling is due to the fact that we measure the approximation error by the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our adaptation approach chooses a small number of samples if the density is focused on a small part of the state space, and it chooses a large number of samples if the state uncertainty is high. Both the implementation and computation overhead of this approach are small. Extensive experiments using mobile robot localization as a test application show that our approach yields drastic improvements over particle ﬁlters with ﬁxed sample set sizes and over a previously introduced adaptation technique.</p><p>4 0.67016643 <a title="188-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Risk_Sensitive_Particle_Filters.html">163 nips-2001-Risk Sensitive Particle Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun, John Langford, Vandi Verma</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new particle ﬁlter that incorporates a model of costs when generating particles. The approach is motivated by the observation that the costs of accidentally not tracking hypotheses might be signiﬁcant in some areas of state space, and next to irrelevant in others. By incorporating a cost model into particle ﬁltering, states that are more critical to the system performance are more likely to be tracked. Automatic calculation of the cost model is implemented using an MDP value function calculation that estimates the value of tracking a particular state. Experiments in two mobile robot domains illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.</p><p>5 0.63571066 <a title="188-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Very_loopy_belief_propagation_for_unwrapping_phase_images.html">196 nips-2001-Very loopy belief propagation for unwrapping phase images</a></p>

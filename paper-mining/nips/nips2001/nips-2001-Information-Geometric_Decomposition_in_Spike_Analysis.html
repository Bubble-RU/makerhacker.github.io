<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Jesper Tegnér, Ádám Kepecs</p><p>Abstract: Hebbian learning rules are generally formulated as static rules. Under changing condition (e.g. neuromodulation, input statistics) most rules are sensitive to parameters. In particular, recent work has focused on two different formulations of spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules. Additive STDP [1] is remarkably versatile but also very fragile, whereas multiplicative STDP [2, 3] is more robust but lacks attractive features such as synaptic competition and rate stabilization. Here we address the problem of robustness in the additive STDP rule. We derive an adaptive control scheme, where the learning function is under fast dynamic control by postsynaptic activity to stabilize learning under a variety of conditions. Such a control scheme can be implemented using known biophysical mechanisms of synapses. We show that this adaptive rule makes the addit ive STDP more robust. Finally, we give an example how meta plasticity of the adaptive rule can be used to guide STDP into different type of learning regimes. 1</p><p>4 0.27080598 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Orientational_and_Geometric_Determinants_of_Place_and_Head-direction.html">142 nips-2001-Orientational and Geometric Determinants of Place and Head-direction</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil Burgess, Tom Hartley</p><p>Abstract: We present a model of the firing of place and head-direction cells in rat hippocampus. The model can predict the response of individual cells and populations to parametric manipulations of both geometric (e.g. O'Keefe & Burgess, 1996) and orientational (Fenton et aI., 2000a) cues, extending a previous geometric model (Hartley et al., 2000). It provides a functional description of how these cells' spatial responses are derived from the rat's environment and makes easily testable quantitative predictions. Consideration of the phenomenon of remapping (Muller & Kubie, 1987; Bostock et aI., 1991) indicates that the model may also be consistent with nonparametric changes in firing, and provides constraints for its future development. 1</p><p>5 0.24109842 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2001-Exact_differential_equation_population_dynamics_for_integrate-and-fire_neurons.html">72 nips-2001-Exact differential equation population dynamics for integrate-and-fire neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Julian Eggert, Berthold BĂ¤uml</p><p>Abstract: Mesoscopical, mathematical descriptions of dynamics of populations of spiking neurons are getting increasingly important for the understanding of large-scale processes in the brain using simulations. In our previous work, integral equation formulations for population dynamics have been derived for a special type of spiking neurons. For Integrate- and- Fire type neurons , these formulations were only approximately correct. Here, we derive a mathematically compact, exact population dynamics formulation for Integrate- and- Fire type neurons. It can be shown quantitatively in simulations that the numerical correspondence with microscopically modeled neuronal populations is excellent. 1 Introduction and motivation The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the collective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons in a compact way, using a higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and spikes. The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is the populationaveraged instantaneous firing rate A(t), with A(t)6.t being the number of neurons in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t). Population dynamics are formulated in such a way, that they match quantitatively the time course of a given A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. At least three main reasons can be formulated which underline the importance of the population dynamics approach for computational neuroscience. First, it enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons and connections, which is typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic functional models that go beyond the single neuron level. Second, it increases the analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics , opening the way towards better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks. Third, it enables a systematic embedding of the numerous neuronal models operating at different descriptional scales into a generalized theoretic framework, explaining the relationships, dependencies and derivations of the respective models. Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the work of Wilson and Cowan [8] and Knight [4], which laid the basis for all current population-averaged graded-response models (see e.g. [6] for modeling work using these models). More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were developed, mainly by Gerstner [3, 2] and Knight [5]. In our own previous work [1], we have developed a theoretical framework which enables to systematize and simulate a wide range of models for population-based dynamics. It was shown that the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well with detailed simulations using spiking neurons, so that they can be used for realistic simulations involving networks with large numbers of spiking neurons. Nevertheless, for neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F;) neurons, this framework was only correct in an approximation. In this paper, we derive the exact population dynamics formulation for I&F; neurons. This is achieved by reducing the I&F; population dynamics to a point process and by taking advantage of the particular properties of I&F; neurons. 2 2.1 Background: Integrate-and-Fire dynamics Differential form We start with the standard Integrate- and- Fire (I&F;) model in form of the wellknown differential equation [7] (1) which describes the dynamics of the membrane potential Vi of a neuron i that is modeled as a single compartment with RC circuit characteristics. The membrane relaxation time is in this case T = RC with R being the membrane resistance and C the membrane capacitance. The resting potential v R est is the stationary potential that is approached in the no-input case. The input arriving from other neurons is described in form of a current ji. In addition to eq. (1), which describes the integrate part of the I&F; model, the neuronal dynamics are completed by a nonlinear step. Every time the membrane potential Vi reaches a fixed threshold () from below, Vi is lowered by a fixed amount Ll > 0, and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to eq. (1) starts again. if Vi(t) = () (from below) . (2) At the same time, it is said that the release of a spike occurred (i.e., the neuron fired), and the time ti = t of this singular event is stored. Here ti indicates the time of the most recent spike. Storing all the last firing times , we gain the sequence of spikes {t{} (spike ordering index j, neuronal index i). 2.2 Integral form Now we look at the single neuron in a neuronal compound. We assume that the input current contribution ji from presynaptic spiking neurons can be described using the presynaptic spike times tf, a response-function ~ and a connection weight WÂˇ .

<p>Author: Ádám Kepecs, S. Raghavachari</p><p>Abstract: Neurons receive excitatory inputs via both fast AMPA and slow NMDA type receptors. We find that neurons receiving input via NMDA receptors can have two stable membrane states which are input dependent. Action potentials can only be initiated from the higher voltage state. Similar observations have been made in several brain areas which might be explained by our model. The interactions between the two kinds of inputs lead us to suggest that some neurons may operate in 3 states: disabled, enabled and firing. Such enabled, but non-firing modes can be used to introduce context-dependent processing in neural networks. We provide a simple example and discuss possible implications for neuronal processing and response variability. 1</p><p>6 0.46765006 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-Exact_differential_equation_population_dynamics_for_integrate-and-fire_neurons.html">72 nips-2001-Exact differential equation population dynamics for integrate-and-fire neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Nakahara, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: We present an information-geometric measure to systematically investigate neuronal firing patterns, taking account not only of the second-order but also of higher-order interactions. We begin with the case of two neurons for illustration and show how to test whether or not any pairwise correlation in one period is significantly different from that in the other period. In order to test such a hypothesis of different firing rates, the correlation term needs to be singled out 'orthogonally' to the firing rates, where the null hypothesis might not be of independent firing. This method is also shown to directly associate neural firing with behavior via their mutual information, which is decomposed into two types of information, conveyed by mean firing rate and coincident firing, respectively. Then, we show that these results, using the 'orthogonal' decomposition, are naturally extended to the case of three neurons and n neurons in general. 1</p><p>2 0.56543165 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-Spectral_Kernel_Methods_for_Clustering.html">170 nips-2001-Spectral Kernel Methods for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor, Jaz S. Kandola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce new algorithms for unsupervised learning based on the use of a kernel matrix. All the information required by such algorithms is contained in the eigenvectors of the matrix or of closely related matrices. We use two different but related cost functions, the Alignment and the 'cut cost'. The first one is discussed in a companion paper [3], the second one is based on graph theoretic concepts. Both functions measure the level of clustering of a labeled dataset, or the correlation between data clusters and labels. We state the problem of unsupervised learning as assigning labels so as to optimize these cost functions. We show how the optimal solution can be approximated by slightly relaxing the corresponding optimization problem, and how this corresponds to using eigenvector information. The resulting simple algorithms are tested on real world data with positive results. 1</p><p>3 0.54033029 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2001-Discriminative_Direction_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">60 nips-2001-Discriminative Direction for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: In many scientiﬁc and engineering applications, detecting and understanding differences between two groups of examples can be reduced to a classical problem of training a classiﬁer for labeling new examples while making as few mistakes as possible. In the traditional classiﬁcation setting, the resulting classiﬁer is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. However, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the statistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we deﬁne a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classiﬁer function. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classiﬁers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and brieﬂy discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work.</p><p>4 0.53928953 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Gao, Michael J. Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to infer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides training data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a nonparametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a nonGaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is compared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications.</p><p>5 0.53564322 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Spike_timing_and_the_coding_of_naturalistic_sounds_in_a_central_auditory_area_of_songbirds.html">174 nips-2001-Spike timing and the coding of naturalistic sounds in a central auditory area of songbirds</a></p>
<p>Author: B. D. Wright, Kamal Sen, William Bialek, A. J. Doupe</p><p>Abstract: In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least % extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike timing may play a signiﬁcant role.   </p><p>6 0.53473979 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2001-Fragment_Completion_in_Humans_and_Machines.html">78 nips-2001-Fragment Completion in Humans and Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroyuki Nakahara, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: We present an information-geometric measure to systematically investigate neuronal firing patterns, taking account not only of the second-order but also of higher-order interactions. We begin with the case of two neurons for illustration and show how to test whether or not any pairwise correlation in one period is significantly different from that in the other period. In order to test such a hypothesis of different firing rates, the correlation term needs to be singled out 'orthogonally' to the firing rates, where the null hypothesis might not be of independent firing. This method is also shown to directly associate neural firing with behavior via their mutual information, which is decomposed into two types of information, conveyed by mean firing rate and coincident firing, respectively. Then, we show that these results, using the 'orthogonal' decomposition, are naturally extended to the case of three neurons and n neurons in general. 1</p><p>3 0.10421465 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2001-Eye_movements_and_the_maturation_of_cortical_orientation_selectivity.html">73 nips-2001-Eye movements and the maturation of cortical orientation selectivity</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>4 0.1019899 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Giorgio A. Ascoli, Alexei V. Samsonovich</p><p>Abstract: Visual inspection of neurons suggests that dendritic orientation may be determined both by internal constraints (e.g. membrane tension) and by external vector fields (e.g. neurotrophic gradients). For example, basal dendrites of pyramidal cells appear nicely fan-out. This regular orientation is hard to justify completely with a general tendency to grow straight, given the zigzags observed experimentally. Instead, dendrites could (A) favor a fixed (“external”) direction, or (B) repel from their own soma. To investigate these possibilities quantitatively, reconstructed hippocampal cells were subjected to Bayesian analysis. The statistical model combined linearly factors A and B, as well as the tendency to grow straight. For all morphological classes, B was found to be significantly positive and consistently greater than A. In addition, when dendrites were artificially re-oriented according to this model, the resulting structures closely resembled real morphologies. These results suggest that somatodendritic repulsion may play a role in determining dendritic orientation. Since hippocampal cells are very densely packed and their dendritic trees highly overlap, the repulsion must be cellspecific. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying such specificity. 1 I n t r od uc t i on The study of brain dynamics and development at the cellular level would greatly benefit from a standardized, accurate and yet succinct statistical model characterizing the morphology of major neuronal classes. Such model could also provide a basis for simulation of anatomically realistic virtual neurons [1]. The model should accurately distinguish among different neuronal classes: a morphological difference between classes would be captured by a difference in model parameters and reproduced in generated virtual neurons. In addition, the model should be self-consistent: there should be no statistical difference in model parameters measured from real neurons of a given class and from virtual neurons of the same class. The assumption that a simple statistical model of this sort exists relies on the similarity of average environmental and homeostatic conditions encountered by individual neurons during development and on the limited amount of genetic information that underlies differentiation of neuronal classes. Previous research in computational neuroanatomy has mainly focused on the topology and internal geometry of dendrites (i.e., the properties described in “dendrograms”) [2,3]. Recently, we attempted to include spatial orientation in the models, thus generating 2 virtual neurons in 3D [4]. Dendritic growth was assumed to deviate from the straight direction both randomly and based on a constant bias in a given direction, or “tropism”. Different models of tropism (e.g. along a fixed axis, towards a plane, or away from the soma) had dramatic effects on the shape of virtual neurons [5]. Our current strategy is to split the problem of finding a statistical model describing neuronal morphology in two parts. First, we maintain that the topology and the internal geometry of a particular dendritic tree can be described independently of its 3D embedding (i.e., the set of local dendritic orientations). At the same time, one and the same internal geometry (e.g., the experimental dendrograms obtained from real neurons) may have many equally plausible 3D embeddings that are statistically consistent with the anatomical characteristics of that neuronal class. The present work aims at finding a minimal statistical model describing local dendritic orientation in experimentally reconstructed hippocampal principal cells. Hippocampal neurons have a polarized shape: their dendrites tend to grow from the soma as if enclosed in cones. In pyramidal cells, basal and apical dendrites invade opposite hemispaces (fig. 1A), while granule cell dendrites all invade the same hemispace. This behavior could be caused by a tendency to grow towards the layers of incoming fibers to establish synapses. Such tendency would correspond to a tropism in a direction roughly parallel to the cell main axis. Alternatively, dendrites could initially stem in the appropriate (possibly genetically determined) directions, and then continue to grow approximately in a radial direction from the soma. A close inspection of pyramidal (basal) trees suggests that dendrites may indeed be repelled from their soma (Fig. 1B). A typical dendrite may reorient itself (arrow) to grow nearly straight along a radius from the soma. Remarkably, this happens even after many turns, when the initial direction is lost. Such behavior may be hard to explain without tropism. If the deviations from straight growth were random, one should be able to “remodel”th e trees by measuring and reproducing the statistics of local turn angles, assuming its independence of dendritic orientation and location. Figure 1C shows the cell from 1A after such remodeling. In this case basal and apical dendrites retain only their initial (stemming) orientations from the original data. The resulting “cotton ball” uggests that dendritic turns are not in dependent s of dendritic orientation. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to quantify the dendritic tropism. 2 M e t h od s Digital files of fully reconstructed rat hippocampal pyramidal cells (24 CA3 and 23 CA1 neurons) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Amaral. The overall morphology of these cells, as well as the experimental acquisition methods, were extensively described [6]. In these files, dendrites are represented as (branching) chains of cylindrical sections. Each section is connected to one other section in the path to the soma, and may be connected on the other extremity to two other sections (bifurcation), one other section (continuation point), or no other section (terminal tip). Each section is described in the file by its ending point coordinates, its diameter and its</p><p>6 0.090379529 <a title="142-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2001-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Hand_Motion_from_Neural_Activity_in_Motor_Cortex.html">150 nips-2001-Probabilistic Inference of Hand Motion from Neural Activity in Motor Cortex</a></p>

We discuss possible mechanisms underlying such specificity. 1 I n t r od uc t i on The study of brain dynamics and development at the cellular level would greatly benefit from a standardized, accurate and yet succinct statistical model characterizing the morphology of major neuronal classes. Such model could also provide a basis for simulation of anatomically realistic virtual neurons [1]. The model should accurately distinguish among different neuronal classes: a morphological difference between classes would be captured by a difference in model parameters and reproduced in generated virtual neurons. In addition, the model should be self-consistent: there should be no statistical difference in model parameters measured from real neurons of a given class and from virtual neurons of the same class. The assumption that a simple statistical model of this sort exists relies on the similarity of average environmental and homeostatic conditions encountered by individual neurons during development and on the limited amount of genetic information that underlies differentiation of neuronal classes. Previous research in computational neuroanatomy has mainly focused on the topology and internal geometry of dendrites (i.e., the properties described in “dendrograms”) [2,3]. Recently, we attempted to include spatial orientation in the models, thus generating 2 virtual neurons in 3D [4]. Dendritic growth was assumed to deviate from the straight direction both randomly and based on a constant bias in a given direction, or “tropism”. Different models of tropism (e.g. along a fixed axis, towards a plane, or away from the soma) had dramatic effects on the shape of virtual neurons [5]. Our current strategy is to split the problem of finding a statistical model describing neuronal morphology in two parts. First, we maintain that the topology and the internal geometry of a particular dendritic tree can be described independently of its 3D embedding (i.e., the set of local dendritic orientations). At the same time, one and the same internal geometry (e.g., the experimental dendrograms obtained from real neurons) may have many equally plausible 3D embeddings that are statistically consistent with the anatomical characteristics of that neuronal class. The present work aims at finding a minimal statistical model describing local dendritic orientation in experimentally reconstructed hippocampal principal cells. Hippocampal neurons have a polarized shape: their dendrites tend to grow from the soma as if enclosed in cones. In pyramidal cells, basal and apical dendrites invade opposite hemispaces (fig. 1A), while granule cell dendrites all invade the same hemispace. This behavior could be caused by a tendency to grow towards the layers of incoming fibers to establish synapses. Such tendency would correspond to a tropism in a direction roughly parallel to the cell main axis. Alternatively, dendrites could initially stem in the appropriate (possibly genetically determined) directions, and then continue to grow approximately in a radial direction from the soma. A close inspection of pyramidal (basal) trees suggests that dendrites may indeed be repelled from their soma (Fig. 1B). A typical dendrite may reorient itself (arrow) to grow nearly straight along a radius from the soma. Remarkably, this happens even after many turns, when the initial direction is lost. Such behavior may be hard to explain without tropism. If the deviations from straight growth were random, one should be able to “remodel”th e trees by measuring and reproducing the statistics of local turn angles, assuming its independence of dendritic orientation and location. Figure 1C shows the cell from 1A after such remodeling. In this case basal and apical dendrites retain only their initial (stemming) orientations from the original data. The resulting “cotton ball” uggests that dendritic turns are not in dependent s of dendritic orientation. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to quantify the dendritic tropism. 2 M e t h od s Digital files of fully reconstructed rat hippocampal pyramidal cells (24 CA3 and 23 CA1 neurons) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Amaral. The overall morphology of these cells, as well as the experimental acquisition methods, were extensively described [6]. In these files, dendrites are represented as (branching) chains of cylindrical sections. Each section is connected to one other section in the path to the soma, and may be connected on the other extremity to two other sections (bifurcation), one other section (continuation point), or no other section (terminal tip). Each section is described in the file by its ending point coordinates, its diameter and its</p><p>3 0.59657001 <a title="142-lsi-3" href="./nips-2001-Information-Geometric_Decomposition_in_Spike_Analysis.html">96 nips-2001-Information-Geometric Decomposition in Spike Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroyuki Nakahara, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: We present an information-geometric measure to systematically investigate neuronal firing patterns, taking account not only of the second-order but also of higher-order interactions. We begin with the case of two neurons for illustration and show how to test whether or not any pairwise correlation in one period is significantly different from that in the other period. In order to test such a hypothesis of different firing rates, the correlation term needs to be singled out 'orthogonally' to the firing rates, where the null hypothesis might not be of independent firing. This method is also shown to directly associate neural firing with behavior via their mutual information, which is decomposed into two types of information, conveyed by mean firing rate and coincident firing, respectively. Then, we show that these results, using the 'orthogonal' decomposition, are naturally extended to the case of three neurons and n neurons in general. 1</p><p>4 0.45746744 <a title="142-lsi-4" href="./nips-2001-Associative_memory_in_realistic_neuronal_networks.html">37 nips-2001-Associative memory in realistic neuronal networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Almost two decades ago , Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2, 3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to understand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simulations with analog neurons are presented. One of the most important features of the nervous system is its ability to perform associative memory. It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented using attractor networks - experimental studies point in that direction [4- 7], and there are virtually no competing theoretical models. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it is still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist in realistic neuronal networks.

<p>Author: Antonino Casile, Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity appears to be a crucial component for shaping the receptive ﬁelds of cortical simple cells into adjacent, oriented subregions alternately receiving ON- and OFF-center excitatory geniculate inputs. It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the presence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation between the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These results suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity.</p><p>6 0.42421362 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="./nips-2001-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Complex_Cells_in_Visual_Cortex_for_the_Binocular_Perception_of_Motion-in-Depth.html">10 nips-2001-A Hierarchical Model of Complex Cells in Visual Cortex for the Binocular Perception of Motion-in-Depth</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil Burgess, Tom Hartley</p><p>Abstract: We present a model of the firing of place and head-direction cells in rat hippocampus. The model can predict the response of individual cells and populations to parametric manipulations of both geometric (e.g. O'Keefe & Burgess, 1996) and orientational (Fenton et aI., 2000a) cues, extending a previous geometric model (Hartley et al., 2000). It provides a functional description of how these cells' spatial responses are derived from the rat's environment and makes easily testable quantitative predictions. Consideration of the phenomenon of remapping (Muller & Kubie, 1987; Bostock et aI., 1991) indicates that the model may also be consistent with nonparametric changes in firing, and provides constraints for its future development. 1</p><p>2 0.43880671 <a title="142-lda-2" href="./nips-2001-On_the_Convergence_of_Leveraging.html">137 nips-2001-On the Convergence of Leveraging</a></p>

The method is based on consistency conditions, which were recently shown to characterize the attractor states of this linear threshold recurrent network. For a given set of training examples the learning problem is formulated as a convex quadratic optimization problem in the lateral interaction weights. An efﬁcient dimension reduction of the learning problem can be achieved by using a linear superposition of basis interactions.

<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Dan Roth, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning in Boolean domains using kernels which capture feature expansions equivalent to using conjunctions over basic features. We demonstrate a tradeoff between the computational efﬁciency with which these kernels can be computed and the generalization ability of the resulting classiﬁer. We ﬁrst describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efﬁciently run the Perceptron algorithm over an exponential number of conjunctions; however we also prove that using such kernels the Perceptron algorithm can make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We also consider an analogous use of kernel functions to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. While known upper bounds imply that Winnow can learn DNF formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnow’s behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set, and thus that such kernel functions for Winnow are not efﬁciently computable.</p><p>5 0.38237557 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./nips-2001-Modeling_Temporal_Structure_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">123 nips-2001-Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

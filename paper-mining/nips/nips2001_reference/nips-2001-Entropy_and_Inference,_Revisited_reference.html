Shafee, William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: We study properties of popular near–uniform (Dirichlet) priors for learning undersampled probability distributions on discrete nonmetric spaces and show that they lead to disastrous results. However, an Occam–style phase space argument expands the priors into their inﬁnite mixture and resolves most of the observed problems. This leads to a surprisingly good estimator of entropies of discrete distributions. Learning a probability distribution from examples is one of the basic problems in data analysis. Common practical approaches introduce a family of parametric models, leading to questions about model selection. In Bayesian inference, computing the total probability of the data arising from a model involves an integration over parameter space, and the resulting “phase space volume” automatically discriminates against models with larger numbers of parameters—hence the description of these volume terms as Occam factors [1, 2]. As we move from ﬁnite parameterizations to models that are described by smooth functions, the integrals over parameter space become functional integrals and methods from quantum ﬁeld theory allow us to do these integrals asymptotically; again the volume in model space consistent with the data is larger for models that are smoother and hence less complex [3]. Further, at least under some conditions the relevant degree of smoothness can be determined self–consistently from the data, so that we approach something like a model independent method for learning a distribution [4]. The results emphasizing the importance of phase space factors in learning prompt us to look back at a seemingly much simpler problem, namely learning a distribution on a discrete, nonmetric space. Here the probability distribution is just a list of numbers {q i }, i = 1, 2, · · · , K, where K is the number of bins or possibilities. We do not assume any metric on the space, so that a priori there is no reason to believe that any q i and qj should be similar. The task is to learn this distribution from a set of examples, which we can describe as the number of times ni each possibility is observed in a set of N = K ni i=1 samples. This problem arises in the context of language, where the index i might label words or phrases, so that there is no natural way to place a metric on the space, nor is it even clear that our intuitions about similarity are consistent with the constraints of a metric space. Similarly, in bioinformatics the index i might label n–mers of the the DNA or amino acid sequence, and although most work in the ﬁeld is based on metrics for sequence comparison one might like an alternative approach that does not rest on such assumptions. In the analysis of neural responses, once we ﬁx our time resolution the response becomes a set of discrete “words,” and estimates of the information content in the response are de- termined by the probability distribution on this discrete space. What all of these examples have in common is that we often need to draw some conclusions with data sets that are not in the asymptotic limit N K. Thus, while we might use a large corpus to sample the distribution of words in English by brute force (reaching N K with K the size of the vocabulary), we can hardly do the same for three or four word phrases. In models described by continuous functions, the inﬁnite number of “possibilities” can never be overwhelmed by examples; one is saved by the notion of smoothness. Is there some nonmetric analog of this notion that we can apply in the discrete case? Our intuition is that information theoretic quantities may play this role. If we have a joint distribution of two variables, the analog of a smooth distribution would be one which does not have too much mutual information between these variables. Even more simply, we might say that smooth distributions have large entropy. While the idea of “maximum entropy inference” is common [5], the interplay between constraints on the entropy and the volume in the space of models seems not to have been considered. As we shall explain, phase space factors alone imply that seemingly sensible, more or less uniform priors on the space of discrete probability distributions correspond to disastrously singular prior hypotheses about the entropy of the underlying distribution. We argue that reliable inference outside the asymptotic regime N K requires a more uniform prior on the entropy, and we offer one way of doing this. While many distributions are consistent with the data when N ≤ K, we provide empirical evidence that this ﬂattening of the entropic prior allows us to make surprisingly reliable statements about the entropy itself in this regime. At the risk of being pedantic, we state very explicitly what we mean by uniform or nearly uniform priors on the space of distributions. The natural “uniform” prior is given by Pu ({qi }) = 1 δ Zu K 1− K qi i=1 , Zu = A dq1 dq2 · · · dqK δ 1− qi (1) i=1 where the delta function imposes the normalization, Zu is the total volume in the space of models, and the integration domain A is such that each qi varies in the range [0, 1]. Note that, because of the normalization constraint, an individual q i chosen from this distribution in fact is not uniformly distributed—this is also an example of phase space effects, since in choosing one qi we constrain all the other {qj=i }. What we mean by uniformity is that all distributions that obey the normalization constraint are equally likely a priori. Inference with this uniform prior is straightforward. If our examples come independently from {qi }, then we calculate the probability of the model {qi } with the usual Bayes rule: 1 K P ({qi }|{ni }) = P ({ni }|{qi })Pu ({qi }) , P ({ni }|{qi }) = (qi )ni . Pu ({ni }) i=1 (2) If we want the best estimate of the probability qi in the least squares sense, then we should compute the conditional mean, and this can be done exactly, so that [6, 7] qi = ni + 1 . N +K (3) Thus we can think of inference with this uniform prior as setting probabilities equal to the observed frequencies, but with an “extra count” in every bin. This sensible procedure was ﬁrst introduced by Laplace [8]. It has the desirable property that events which have not been observed are not automatically assigned probability zero. 1 If the data are unordered, extra combinatorial factors have to be included in P ({ni }|{qi }). However, these cancel immediately in later expressions. A natural generalization of these ideas is to consider priors that have a power–law dependence on the probabilities, the so called Dirichlet family of priors: K Pβ ({qi }) = 1 δ 1− qi Z(β) i=1 K β−1 qi , (4) i=1 It is interesting to see what typical distributions from these priors look like. Even though different qi ’s are not independent random variables due to the normalizing δ–function, generation of random distributions is still easy: one can show that if q i ’s are generated successively (starting from i = 1 and proceeding up to i = K) from the Beta–distribution j</p><br/>

<h1>23 nips-2001-A theory of neural integration in the head-direction system</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2001-23-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2099-a-theory-of-neural-integration-in-the-head-direction-system.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Richard Hahnloser, Xiaohui Xie, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: Integration in the head-direction system is a computation by which horizontal angular head velocity signals from the vestibular nuclei are integrated to yield a neural representation of head direction. In the thalamus, the postsubiculum and the mammillary nuclei, the head-direction representation has the form of a place code: neurons have a preferred head direction in which their ﬁring is maximal [Blair and Sharp, 1995, Blair et al., 1998, ?]. Integration is a difﬁcult computation, given that head-velocities can vary over a large range. Previous models of the head-direction system relied on the assumption that the integration is achieved in a ﬁring-rate-based attractor network with a ring structure. In order to correctly integrate head-velocity signals during high-speed head rotations, very fast synaptic dynamics had to be assumed. Here we address the question whether integration in the head-direction system is possible with slow synapses, for example excitatory NMDA and inhibitory GABA(B) type synapses. For neural networks with such slow synapses, rate-based dynamics are a good approximation of spiking neurons [Ermentrout, 1994]. We ﬁnd that correct integration during high-speed head rotations imposes strong constraints on possible network architectures.</p><br/>

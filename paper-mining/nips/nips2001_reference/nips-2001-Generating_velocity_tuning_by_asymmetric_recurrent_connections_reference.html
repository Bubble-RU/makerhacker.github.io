<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2001-82-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1995-generating-velocity-tuning-by-asymmetric-recurrent-connections.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Asymmetric lateral connections are one possible mechanism that can account for the direction selectivity of cortical neurons. We present a mathematical analysis for a class of these models. Contrasting with earlier theoretical work that has relied on methods from linear systems theory, we study the network’s nonlinear dynamic properties that arise when the threshold nonlinearity of the neurons is taken into account. We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatiotemporal periodicity. This predicts that if direction selectivity in the cortex is mainly achieved by asymmetric lateral connections lurching activity waves might be observable in ensembles of direction selective cortical neurons within appropriate regimes of the stimulus speed.</p><br/>

In the left side shown is the step activation function model, while the linear threshold model is drawn in the right. Panel (a) and (A) show the velocity tuning curves of the traveling pulse in terms of its peak activity in (a) or order parameters in (A). The solid lines indicate the results from calculation, and the dotted lines represents the results from simulaion. Panel (b) and (B) plot the largest real parts of eigenvalues of a stability matrix obtained from perturbed linear dynamics around the stationary solution. Outside certain range of stimulus velocities the largest real part of the eigenvalues become positive indicating a loss of stability of the form-stable solution. Panel (c) and (C) plots the average variations of peak activity, and order parameters (blue curve) and (green curve) respectively, over time during simulation. A nonzero variance signiﬁes a loss of stability for traveling pulse solutions, which is consistent with eigenvalue analysis in Panel (b) and (B). A color coded plot of spatialtemporal evolution of the activity is shown in panels (d) and (e), and in (D) and (E). Panel (e) and (E) show the propagation of the form-stable peak over time; panel (d) and (D) show the lurching activity wave that arises when stability is lost. The interaction kernel used in step function model is with and . The stimulus is a moving bar with width and amplitude . Parameters used in linear threshold model are , , and .        ¨  ¨ ¦ ¤ ¢ ©©5£¡  </p>

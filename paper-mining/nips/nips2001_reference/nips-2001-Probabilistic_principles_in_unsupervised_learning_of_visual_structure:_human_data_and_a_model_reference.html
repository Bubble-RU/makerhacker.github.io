<h1>151 nips-2001-Probabilistic principles in unsupervised learning of visual structure: human data and a model</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2001-151-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2119-probabilistic-principles-in-unsupervised-learning-of-visual-structure-human-data-and-a-model.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Shimon Edelman, Benjamin P. Hiles, Hwajin Yang, Nathan Intrator</p><p>Abstract: To ﬁnd out how the representations of structured visual objects depend on the co-occurrence statistics of their constituents, we exposed subjects to a set of composite images with tight control exerted over (1) the conditional probabilities of the constituent fragments, and (2) the value of Barlow’s criterion of “suspicious coincidence” (the ratio of joint probability to the product of marginals). We then compared the part veriﬁcation response times for various probe/target combinations before and after the exposure. For composite probes, the speedup was much larger for targets that contained pairs of fragments perfectly predictive of each other, compared to those that did not. This effect was modulated by the signiﬁcance of their co-occurrence as estimated by Barlow’s criterion. For lone-fragment probes, the speedup in all conditions was generally lower than for composites. These results shed light on the brain’s strategies for unsupervised acquisition of structural information in vision. 1 Motivation How does the human visual system decide for which objects it should maintain distinct and persistent internal representations of the kind typically postulated by theories of object recognition? Consider, for example, the image shown in Figure 1, left. This image can be represented as a monolithic hieroglyph, a pair of Chinese characters (which we shall refer to as and ), a set of strokes, or, trivially, as a collection of pixels. Note that the second option is only available to a system previously exposed to various combinations of Chinese characters. Indeed, a principled decision whether to represent this image as , or otherwise can only be made on the basis of prior exposure to related images. £ ¡ £¦ ¡ £ ¥¨§¢   ¥¤¢   ¢ According to Barlow’s [1] insight, one useful principle is tallying suspicious coincidences: two candidate fragments and should be combined into a composite object if the probability of their joint appearance is much higher than , which is the probability expected in the case of their statistical independence. This criterion may be compared to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which has been previously discussed in the context of object representation [2, 3]. In a simpliﬁed form [4], MDL calls for representing explicitly as a whole if , just as the principle of suspicious coincidences does. £ ©¢  £  ¢ ¥¤¥  £¦ ¢ ¥  £  ¢   £¦ ¢ ¥¤¥! ¨§¥ £ ¢ £ ©¢  £¦  £ ¨§¢¥ ¡ ¢   While the Barlow/MDL criterion certainly indicates a suspicious coincidence, there are additional probabilistic considerations that may be used and . One example is the possiin setting the degree of association between ble perfect predictability of from and vice versa, as measured by . If , then and are perfectly predictive of each other and should really be coded by a single symbol, whereas the MDL criterion may suggest merely that some association between the representation of and that of be established. In comparison, if and are not perfectly predictive of each other ( ), there is a case to be made in favor of coding them separately to allow for a maximally expressive representation, whereas MDL may actually suggest a high degree of association ). In this study we investigated whether the human (if visual system uses a criterion based on alongside MDL while learning (in an unsupervised manner) to represent composite objects. £ £  £ ¢  ¥  ¥ © §¥ ¡ ¢  ¨¦¤</p><br/>

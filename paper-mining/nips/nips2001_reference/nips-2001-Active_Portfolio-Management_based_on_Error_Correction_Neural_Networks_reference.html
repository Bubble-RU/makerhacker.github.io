<h1>26 nips-2001-Active Portfolio-Management based on Error Correction Neural Networks</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2001-26-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1969-active-portfolio-management-based-on-error-correction-neural-networks.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Hans-Georg Zimmermann, Ralph Neuneier, Ralph Grothmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with a neural network architecture which establishes a portfolio management system similar to the Black / Litterman approach. This allocation scheme distributes funds across various securities or ﬁnancial markets while simultaneously complying with speciﬁc allocation constraints which meet the requirements of an investor. The portfolio optimization algorithm is modeled by a feedforward neural network. The underlying expected return forecasts are based on error correction neural networks (ECNN), which utilize the last model error as an auxiliary input to evaluate their own misspeciﬁcation. The portfolio optimization is implemented such that (i.) the allocations comply with investor’s constraints and that (ii.) the risk of the portfolio can be controlled. We demonstrate the proﬁtability of our approach by constructing internationally diversiﬁed portfolios across different ﬁnancial markets of the G7 contries. It turns out, that our approach is superior to a preset benchmark portfolio. ¢ £¡ 1 Introduction: Portfolio-Management We integrate the portfolio optimization algorithm suggested by Black / Litterman [1] into a neural network architecture. Combining the mean-variance theory [5] with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [7], this approach utilizes excess returns of the CAPM equilibrium to deﬁne a neutral, well balanced benchmark portfolio. Deviations from the benchmark allocation are only allowed within preset boundaries. Hence, as an advantage, there are no unrealistic solutions (e. g. large short positions, huge portfolio changes). Moreover, there is no need of formulating return expectations for all assets. In contrast to Black / Litterman, excess return forecasts are estimated by time-delay recurrent error correction neural networks [8]. Investment decisions which comply with given allocation constraints are derived from these predictions. The risk exposure of the portfolio is implicitly controlled by a parameter-optimizing task over time (sec. 3 and 5). Our approach consists of the following three steps: (i.) Construction of forecast models on the basis of error correction neural networks (ECNN) for all assets (sec. 2).   ¤§© © © § ¥ ¦¨¦¤ To whom correspondence should be addressed: Georg.Zimmermann@mchp.siemens.de.  ¤ ¤ (ii.) Computation of excess returns by a higher-level feedforward network (sec. 3 and 4). By this, the proﬁtability of an asset with respect to all others is measured. on the basis of the excess returns. (iii.) Optimization of the investment proportions Allocation constraints ensure, that the investment proportions may deviate from a given benchmark only within predeﬁned intervals (sec. 3 and 4). £ § ¨¡ ¥ £¡ ¦¤¢  ¡ © ¡ © Finally, we apply our neural network based portfolio management system to an asset allocation problem concerning the G7 countries (sec. 6). 2 Forecasting by Error Correction Neural Networks Most dynamical systems are driven by a superposition of autonomous development and external inﬂuences [8]. For discrete time grids, such a dynamics can be described by a recurrent state transition and an output equation (Eq. 1). ¥   § § state transition eq. output eq. (1)  $</p><br/>

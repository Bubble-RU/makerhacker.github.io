Cadez, P. S. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic mixture models are used for a broad range of data analysis tasks such as clustering, classiﬁcation, predictive modeling, etc. Due to their inherent probabilistic nature, mixture models can easily be combined with other probabilistic or non-probabilistic techniques thus forming more complex data analysis systems. In the case of online data (where there is a stream of data available) models can be constantly updated to reﬂect the most current distribution of the incoming data. However, in many business applications the models themselves represent a parsimonious summary of the data and therefore it is not desirable to change models frequently, much less with every new data point. In such a framework it becomes crucial to track the applicability of the mixture model and detect the point in time when the model fails to adequately represent the data. In this paper we formulate the problem of change detection and propose a principled solution. Empirical results over both synthetic and real-life data sets are presented. 1 Introduction and Notation Consider a data set D = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } consisting of n independent, identically distributed (iid) data points. In context of this paper the data points could be vectors, sequences, etc. Further, consider a probabilistic mixture model that maps each data set to a real number, the probability of observing the data set: n P (D|Θ) = n K P (xi |Θ) = i=1 πk P (xi |θk ), (1) i=1 k=1 where the model is parameterized by Θ = {π1 , . . . , πK , θ1 , . . . , θK }. Each P (.|θk ) represents a mixture component, while πi represents mixture weights. It is often more convenient ∗ Work was done while author was at digiMine, Inc., Bellevue, WA. to operate with the log of the probability and deﬁne the log-likelihood function as: n l(Θ|D) = log P (D|Θ) = n log P (xi |Θ) = i=1 LogPi i=1 which is additive over data points rather than multiplicative. The LogPi terms we introduce in the notation represent each data point’s contribution to the overall log-likelihood and therefore describe how well a data point ﬁts under the model. For example, Figure 3 shows a distribution of LogP scores using a mixture of conditionally independent (CI) models. Maximizing probability1 of the data with respect to the parameters Θ can be accomplished by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [6] in linear time in both data complexity (e.g., number of dimensions) and data set size (e.g., number of data points). Although EM guarantees only local optimality, it is a preferred method for ﬁnding good solutions in linear time. We consider an arbitrary but ﬁxed parametric form of the model, therefore we sometimes refer to a speciﬁc set of parameters Θ as the model. Note that since the logarithm is a monotonic function, the optimal set of parameters is the same whether we use likelihood or log-likelihood. Consider an online data source where there are data sets Dt available at certain time intervals t (not necessarily equal time periods or number of data points). For example, there could be a data set generated on a daily basis, or it could represent a constant stream of data from a monitoring device. In addition, we assume that we have an initial model Θ0 that was built (optimized, ﬁtted) on some in-sample data D0 = {D1 , D2 , . . . , Dt0 }. We would like to be able to detect a change in the underlying distribution of data points within data sets Dt that would be sufﬁcient to require building of a new model Θ1 . The criterion for building a new model is loosely deﬁned as “the model does not adequately ﬁt the data anymore”. 2 Model Based Population Similarity In this section we formulate the problem of model-based population similarity and tracking. In case of mixture models we start with the following observations: • The mixture model deﬁnes the probability density function (PDF) that is used to score each data point (LogP scores), leading to the score for the overall population (log-likelihood or sum of LogP scores). • The optimal mixture model puts more PDF mass over dense regions in the data space. Different components allow the mixture model to distribute its PDF over disconnected dense regions in the data space. More PDF mass in a portion of the data space implies higher LogP scores for the data points lying in that region of the space. • If model is to generalize well (e.g., there is no signiﬁcant overﬁtting) it cannot put signiﬁcant PDF mass over regions of data space that are populated by data points solely due to the details of a speciﬁc data sample used to build the model. • Dense regions in the data space discovered by a non-overﬁtting model are the intrinsic property of the true data-generating distribution even if the functional form of the model is not well matched with the true data generating distribution. In the latter case, the model might not be able to discover all dense regions or might not model the correct shape of the regions, but the regions that are discovered (if any) are intrinsic to the data. 1 This approach is called maximum-likelihood estimation. If we included parameter priors we could equally well apply results in this paper to the maximum a posteriori estimation. • If there is conﬁ dence that the model is not overﬁ tting and that it generalizes well (e.g., cross-validation was used to determine the optimal number of mixture components), the new data from the same distribution as the in-sample data should be dense in the same regions that are predicted by the model. Given these observations, we seek to deﬁ a measure of data-distribution similarity based ne on how well the dense regions of the data space are preserved when new data is introduced. In model based clustering, dense regions are equivalent to higher LogP scores, hence we cast the problem of determining data distribution similarity into one of determining LogP distribution similarity (relative to the model). For example, Figure 3 (left) shows a histogram of one such distribution. It is important to note several properties of Figure 3: 1) there are several distinct peaks from which distribution tails off toward smaller LogP values, therefore simple summary scores fail to efﬁ ciently summarize the LogP distribution. For example, log-likelihood is proportional to the mean of LogP distribution in Figure 3, and the mean is not a very useful statistic when describing such a multimodal distribution (also conﬁ rmed experimentally); 2) the histogram itself is not a truly non-parametric representation of the underlying distribution, given that the results are dependent on bin width. In passing we also note that the shape of the histogram in Figure 3 is a consequence of the CI model we use: different peaks come from different discrete attributes, while the tails come from continuous Gaussians. It is a simple exercise to show that LogP scores for a 1-dimensional data set generated by a single Gaussian have an exponential distribution with a sharp cutoff on the right and tail toward the left. To deﬁ the similarity of the data distributions based on LogP scores in a purely nonne parametric way we have at our disposal the powerful formalism of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics [7]. KS statistics make use of empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) to estimate distance between two empirical 1-dimensional distributions, in our case distributions of LogP scores. In principle, we could compare the LogP distribution of the new data set Dt to that of the training set D0 and obtain the probability that the two came from the same distribution. In practice, however, this approach is not feasible since we do not assume that the estimated model and the true data generating process share the same functional form (see Section 3). Consequently, we need to consider the speciﬁ KS score c in relation to the natural variability of the true data generating distribution. In the situation with streaming data, the model is estimated over the in-sample data D0 . Then the individual in-sample data sets D1 , D2 , . . . , Dt0 are used to estimate the natural variability of the KS statistics. This variability needs to be quantiﬁ due to the fact that the model may not ed truly match the data distribution. When the natural variance of the KS statistics over the in-sample data has been determined, the LogP scores for a new dataset Dt , t > t0 are computed. Using principled heuristics, one can then determine whether or not the LogP signature for Dt is signiﬁ cantly different than the LogP signatures for the in-sample data. To clarify various steps, we provide an algorithmic description of the change detection process. Algorithm 1 (Quantifying Natural Variance of KS Statistics): Given an “in-sample” dataset D0 = {D1 , D2 , . . . , Dt0 }, proceed as follows: 1. Estimate the parameters Θ0 of the mixture model P (D|Θ) over D0 (see equation (1)). 2. Compute ni log P (xˆ|Θ0 ), xˆ ∈ Di , ni = |Di |, i = 1, . . . , t0 . i i LogP (Di ) = (2) ˆ i=1 3. For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t0 , compute LKS (i, j) = log [PKS (Di , Dj )]. See [7] for details on PKS computation. 4. For 1 ≤ i ≤ t0 , compute the KS measure MKS (i) as MKS (i) = t0 j=1 LKS (i, j) t0 . (3) 5. Compute µM = M ean[MKS (i)] and σM = ST D[MKS (i)] to quantify the natural variability of MKS over the “in-sample” data. Algorithm 2 (Evaluating New Data): Given a new dataset Dt , t > t0 , µM and σM proceed as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. Compute LogP (Dt ) as in (2). For 1 ≤ i ≤ t0 , compute LKS (i, t). Compute MKS (t) as in (3). Apply decision criteria using MKS (t), µM , σM to determine whether or not Θ0 is a good ﬁ for the new data. For example, if t |MKS (t) − µM | > 3, σM then Θ0 is not a good ﬁ any more. t (4) Note, however, that the 3-σ interval be interpreted as a conﬁ dence interval only in the limit when number of data sets goes to inﬁ nity. In applications presented in this paper we certainly do not have that condition satisﬁ and we consider this approach as an “educated ed heuristic” (gaining ﬁ statistical grounds in the limit). rm 2.1 Space and Time Complexity of the Methodology The proposed methodology was motivated by a business application with large data sets, hence it must have time complexity that is close to linear in order to scale well. In order to assess the time complexity, we use the following notation: nt = |Dt | is the number of data points in the data set Dt ; t0 is the index of the last in-sample data set, but is also the t0 number of in-sample data sets; n0 = |D0 | = t=1 nt is the total number of in-sample data points (in all the in-sample data sets); n = n0 /t0 is the average number of data points in the in-sample data sets. For simplicity of argument, we assume that all the data sets are approximately of the same size, that is nt ≈ n. The analysis presented here does not take into account the time and space complexity needed to estimated the parameters Θ of the mixture model (1). In the ﬁ phase of the rst methodology, we must score each of the in-sample data points under the model (to obtain the LogP distributions) which has time complexity of O(n0 ). Calculation of KS statistics for two data sets is done in one pass over the LogP distributions, but it requires that the LogP scores be sorted, hence it has time complexity of 2n + 2O(n log n) = O(n log n). Since we must calculate all the pairwise KS measures, this step has time complexity of t0 (t0 − 1)/2 O(n log n) = O(t2 n log n). In-sample mean and variance of the KS measure 0 are obtained in time which is linear in t0 hence the asymptotic time complexity does not change. In order to evaluate out-of-sample data sets we must keep LogP distributions for each of the in-sample data sets as well as several scalars (e.g., mean and variance of the in-sample KS measure) which requires O(n0 ) memory. To score an out-of-sample data set Dt , t > t0 , we must ﬁ obtain the LogP distribution rst of Dt which has time complexity of O(n) and then calculate the KS measure relative to each of the in-sample data sets which has time complexity O(n log n) per in-sample data set, or t0 O(n log n) = O(t0 n log n) for the full in-sample period. The LogP distribution for Dt can be discarded once the pairwise KS measures are obtained. 3000 3000 2500 2500 2000 2000 Count 3500 Count 3500 1500 1500 1000 1000 500 500 0 −5.5 −5 −4.5 −4 −3.5 −3 0 −2.5 −5.5 −5 −4.5 LogP −4 −3.5 −3 −2.5 −4 −3.5 −3 −2.5 LogP 3000 3000 2500 2500 2000 2000 Count 3500 Count 3500 1500 1500 1000 1000 500 500 0 −5.5 −5 −4.5 −4 −3.5 −3 LogP −2.5 0 −5.5 −5 −4.5 LogP Figure 1: Histograms of LogP scores for two data sets generated from the ﬁ model rst (top row) and two data sets generated from the second model (bottom row). Each data set contains 50,000 data points. All histograms are obtained from the model ﬁ tted on the in-sample period. Overall, the proposed methodology requires O(n0 ) memory, O(t2 n log n) time for prepro0 cessing and O(t0 n log n) time for out-of-sample evaluation. Further, since t0 is typically a small constant (e.g., t0 = 7 or t0 = 30), the out-of-sample evaluation practically has time complexity of O(n log n). 3 Experimental Setup Experiments presented consist of two parts: experiments on synthetic data and experiments on the aggregations over real web-log data. 3.1 Experiments on Synthetic Data Synthetic data is a valuable tool when determining both applicability and limitations of the proposed approach. Synthetic data was generated by sampling from a a two component CI model (the true model is not used in evaluations). The data consist of a two-state discrete dimension and a continuous dimension. First 100 data sets where generated by sampling from a mixture model with parameters: [π1 , π2 ] = [0.6, 0.4] as weights, θ1 = [0.8, 0.2] 2 2 and θ2 = [0.4, 0.6] as discrete state probabilities, [µ1 , σ1 ] = [10, 5] and [µ2 , σ2 ] = [0, 7] as mean and variance (Gaussian) for the continuous variable. Then the discrete dimension probability of the second cluster was changed from θ2 = [0.4, 0.6] to θ 2 = [0.5, 0.5] keeping the remaining parameters ﬁ and an additional 100 data sets were generated by xed sampling from this altered model. This is a fairly small change in the distribution and the underlying LogP scores appear to be very similar as can be seen in Figure 1. The ﬁ gure shows LogP distributions for the ﬁ two data sets generated from the ﬁ model (top row) rst rst and the ﬁ two data sets generated from the second model (bottom row).

The dotted vertical line separates in-sample and out-of-sample periods. Note that y-axes have different scales in order to show full variability of the data. row should be more similar than plots from different rows, but this is difﬁ cult to discern by visual inspection. Algorithms 1 and 2 were evaluated by using the ﬁ 10 data sets to estimate a two comrst ponent model. Then pairwise KS measures were calculated between all possible data set pairs relative to the estimated model. Figure 2 shows average KS measures over in-sample data sets (ﬁ 10) for four experiments varying the number of data points in each experirst ment. Note that the vertical axes are different in each of the plots to better show the range of values. As the number of data points in the data set increases, the change that occurs at t = 101 becomes more apparent. At 50,000 data points (bottom right plot of Figure 2) the change in the distribution becomes easily detectable. Since this number of data points is typically considered to be small compared to the number of data points in our real life applications we expect to be able to detect such slight distribution changes. 3.2 Experiments on Real Life Data Figure 3 shows a distribution for a typical day from a content web-site. There are almost 50,000 data points in the data set with over 100 dimensions each. The LogP score distribution is similar to that of synthetic data in Figure 1 which is a consequence of the CI model used. Note, however, that in this data set the true generating distribution is not known and is unlikely to be purely a CI model. Therefore, the average log KS measure over insample data has much lower values (see Figure 3 right, and plots in Figure 2). Another way to phrase this observation is to note that since the true generating data distribution is most likely not CI, the observed similarity of LogP distributions (the KS measure) is much lower since there are two factors of dissimilarity: 1) different data sets; 2) inability of the CI model to capture all the aspects of the true data distribution. Nonetheless, the ﬁ 31 rst −100 5000 −200 4500 4000 −300 3500 Count 3000 2500 2000 −400 −500 −600 1500 1000 −700 500 0 −100 −800 −80 −60 −40 −20 LogP 0 20 40 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 Data set D 60 70 80 90 100 t Figure 3: Left: distribution of 42655 LogP scores from mixture of conditional independence models.

The result is that in Figure 3 we clearly see a problem with the distribution on day 27 (a glitch in the data) and a permanent change in the distribution on day 43. Both of the detected changes correspond to real changes in the data, as veriﬁ by the commered cial website operators. Automatic description of changes in the distribution and criteria for automatic rebuilding of the model are beyond scope of this paper. 4 Related Work Automatic detection of various types of data changes appear in the literature in several different ﬂavors. For example, novelty detection ([4], [8]) is the task of determining unusual or novel data points relative to some model. This is closely related to the outlier detection problem ([1], [5]) where the goal is not only to ﬁ unusual data points, but the ones that nd appear not to have been generated by the data generating distribution. A related problem has been addressed by [2] in the context of time series modeling where outliers and trends can contaminate the model estimation. More recently mixture models have been applied more directly to outlier detection [3]. The method proposed in this paper addesses a different problem. We are not interested in new and unusual data points; on the contrary, the method is quite robust with respect to outliers. An outlier or two do not necessarily mean that the underlying data distribution has changed. Also, some of the distribution changes we are interested in detecting might be considered uninteresting and/or not-novel; for example, a slight shift of the population as a whole is something that we certainly detect as a change but it is rarely considered novel unless the shift is drastic. There is also a set of online learning algorithms that update model parameters as the new data becomes available (for variants and additional references, e.g. [6]). In that framework there is no such concept as a data distribution change since the models are constantly updated to reﬂect the most current distribution. For example, instead of detecting a slight shift of the population as a whole, online learning algorithms update the model to reﬂect the shift. 5 Conclusions In this paper we introduced a model-based method for automatic distribution change detection in an online data environment. Given the LogP distribution data signature we further showed how to compare different data sets relative to the model using KS statistics and how to obtain a single measure of similarity between the new data and the model. Finally, we discussed heuristics for change detection that become principled in the limit as the number of possible data sets increases. Experimental results over synthetic and real online data indicate that the proposed methodology is able to alert the analyst to slight distributional changes. This methodology may be used as the basis of a system to automatically re-estimate parameters of a mixture model on an “ as-needed” basis – when the model fails to adequately represent the data after a certain point in time.

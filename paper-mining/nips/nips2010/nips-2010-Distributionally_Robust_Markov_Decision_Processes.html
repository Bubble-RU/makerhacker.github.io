<p>Author: Tang Jie, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: Likelihood ratio policy gradient methods have been some of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for learning on physical systems. We describe how the likelihood ratio policy gradient can be derived from an importance sampling perspective. This derivation highlights how likelihood ratio methods under-use past experience by (i) using the past experience to estimate only the gradient of the expected return U (θ) at the current policy parameterization θ, rather than to obtain a more complete estimate of U (θ), and (ii) using past experience under the current policy only rather than using all past experience to improve the estimates. We present a new policy search method, which leverages both of these observations as well as generalized baselines—a new technique which generalizes commonly used baseline techniques for policy gradient methods. Our algorithm outperforms standard likelihood ratio policy gradient algorithms on several testbeds. 1</p><p>3 0.24842197 <a title="64-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Logged_Implicit_Exploration_Data.html">152 nips-2010-Learning from Logged Implicit Exploration Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Strehl, John Langford, Lihong Li, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a sound and consistent foundation for the use of nonrandom exploration data in “contextual bandit” or “partially labeled” settings where only the value of a chosen action is learned. The primary challenge in a variety of settings is that the exploration policy, in which “ofﬂine” data is logged, is not explicitly known. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during the learning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in a repeated manner. The techniques reported here lift these restrictions, allowing the learning of a policy for choosing actions given features from historical data where no randomization occurred or was logged. We empirically verify our solution on two reasonably sized sets of real-world data obtained from Yahoo!.</p><p>4 0.21719986 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Policy_Priors_for_Reinforcement_Learning.html">184 nips-2010-Nonparametric Bayesian Policy Priors for Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

Our nonparametric Bayesian approach combines model knowledge, inferred from expert information and independent exploration, with policy knowledge inferred from expert trajectories. We introduce priors that bias the agent towards models with both simple representations and simple policies, resulting in improved policy and model learning. 1</p><p>5 0.2137119 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Short-term_memory_in_neuronal_networks_through_dynamical_compressed_sensing.html">238 nips-2010-Short-term memory in neuronal networks through dynamical compressed sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Surya Ganguli, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that large, generic neuronal networks could store memory traces of past input sequences in their instantaneous state. Such a proposal raises important theoretical questions about the duration of these memory traces and their dependence on network size, connectivity and signal statistics. Prior work, in the case of gaussian input sequences and linear neuronal networks, shows that the duration of memory traces in a network cannot exceed the number of neurons (in units of the neuronal time constant), and that no network can out-perform an equivalent feedforward network. However a more ethologically relevant scenario is that of sparse input sequences. In this scenario, we show how linear neural networks can essentially perform compressed sensing (CS) of past inputs, thereby attaining a memory capacity that exceeds the number of neurons. This enhanced capacity is achieved by a class of “orthogonal” recurrent networks and not by feedforward networks or generic recurrent networks. We exploit techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically compute the decay of memory traces in such networks as a function of network size, signal sparsity and integration time. Alternately, viewed purely from the perspective of CS, this work introduces a new ensemble of measurement matrices derived from dynamical systems, and provides a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance. 1</p><p>6 0.20196635 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand, Csaba Szepesvári, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We address the question of how the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration of the Approximate Policy/Value Iteration algorithms inﬂuences the quality of the resulted policy. We quantify the performance loss as the Lp norm of the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum – as opposed to what has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the earlier iterations decays exponentially fast. 1</p><p>6 0.55985606 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Monte-Carlo_Planning_in_Large_POMDPs.html">168 nips-2010-Monte-Carlo Planning in Large POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Araya, Olivier Buffet, Vincent Thomas, Françcois Charpillet</p><p>Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty and partial observability. Unfortunately, some problems cannot be modeled with state-dependent reward functions, e.g., problems whose objective explicitly implies reducing the uncertainty on the state. To that end, we introduce ρPOMDPs, an extension of POMDPs where the reward function ρ depends on the belief state. We show that, under the common assumption that ρ is convex, the value function is also convex, what makes it possible to (1) approximate ρ arbitrarily well with a piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) function, and (2) use state-of-the-art exact or approximate solving algorithms with limited changes. 1</p><p>3 0.86396587 <a title="64-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Dynamic_Infinite_Relational_Model_for_Time-varying_Relational_Data_Analysis.html">67 nips-2010-Dynamic Infinite Relational Model for Time-varying Relational Data Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Byron Boots, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to value function approximation which combines linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identiﬁcation. In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by the fact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore, RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identiﬁcation (SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive state representations, PSTD ﬁnds a linear compression operator that projects a large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of predictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to estimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior approaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent, perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its potential on a difﬁcult optimal stopping problem. 1</p><p>5 0.85236752 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Feature_Construction_for_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.html">93 nips-2010-Feature Construction for Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Levine, Zoran Popovic, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: The goal of inverse reinforcement learning is to ﬁnd a reward function for a Markov decision process, given example traces from its optimal policy. Current IRL techniques generally rely on user-supplied features that form a concise basis for the reward. We present an algorithm that instead constructs reward features from a large collection of component features, by building logical conjunctions of those component features that are relevant to the example policy. Given example traces, the algorithm returns a reward function as well as the constructed features. The reward function can be used to recover a full, deterministic, stationary policy, and the features can be used to transplant the reward function into any novel environment on which the component features are well deﬁned. 1</p><p>6 0.85196429 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Linear_Complementarity_for_Regularized_Policy_Evaluation_and_Improvement.html">160 nips-2010-Linear Complementarity for Regularized Policy Evaluation and Improvement</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: A standard approach to learning object category detectors is to provide strong supervision in the form of a region of interest (ROI) specifying each instance of the object in the training images [17]. In this work are goal is to learn from heterogeneous labels, in which some images are only weakly supervised, specifying only the presence or absence of the object or a weak indication of object location, whilst others are fully annotated. To this end we develop a discriminative learning approach and make two contributions: (i) we propose a structured output formulation for weakly annotated images where full annotations are treated as latent variables; and (ii) we propose to optimize a ranking objective function, allowing our method to more effectively use negatively labeled images to improve detection average precision performance. The method is demonstrated on the benchmark INRIA pedestrian detection dataset of Dalal and Triggs [14] and the PASCAL VOC dataset [17], and it is shown that for a signiﬁcant proportion of weakly supervised images the performance achieved is very similar to the fully supervised (state of the art) results. 1</p><p>3 0.16153203 <a title="86-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Discriminative_Latent_Model_of_Image_Region_and_Object_Tag_Correspondence.html">6 nips-2010-A Discriminative Latent Model of Image Region and Object Tag Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth regionto-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.</p><p>4 0.16035154 <a title="86-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Co-regularization_Based_Semi-supervised_Domain_Adaptation.html">47 nips-2010-Co-regularization Based Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhishek Kumar, Avishek Saha, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a co-regularization based approach to semi-supervised domain adaptation. Our proposed approach (EA++) builds on the notion of augmented space (introduced in E ASYA DAPT (EA) [1]) and harnesses unlabeled data in target domain to further assist the transfer of information from source to target. This semi-supervised approach to domain adaptation is extremely simple to implement and can be applied as a pre-processing step to any supervised learner. Our theoretical analysis (in terms of Rademacher complexity) of EA and EA++ show that the hypothesis class of EA++ has lower complexity (compared to EA) and hence results in tighter generalization bounds. Experimental results on sentiment analysis tasks reinforce our theoretical ﬁndings and demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed method when compared to EA as well as few other representative baseline approaches.</p><p>5 0.15376969 <a title="86-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>6 0.1311754 <a title="86-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Object_Bank%3A_A_High-Level_Image_Representation_for_Scene_Classification_%26_Semantic_Feature_Sparsification.html">186 nips-2010-Object Bank: A High-Level Image Representation for Scene Classification & Semantic Feature Sparsification</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Chen, Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Learning from multi-view data is important in many applications, such as image classiﬁcation and annotation. In this paper, we present a large-margin learning framework to discover a predictive latent subspace representation shared by multiple views. Our approach is based on an undirected latent space Markov network that fulﬁlls a weak conditional independence assumption that multi-view observations and response variables are independent given a set of latent variables. We provide efﬁcient inference and parameter estimation methods for the latent subspace model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of large-margin learning on real video and web image data for discovering predictive latent representations and improving the performance on image classiﬁcation, annotation and retrieval.</p><p>5 0.63123107 <a title="86-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new supervised learning framework for visual object counting tasks, such as estimating the number of cells in a microscopic image or the number of humans in surveillance video frames. We focus on the practically-attractive case when the training images are annotated with dots (one dot per object). Our goal is to accurately estimate the count. However, we evade the hard task of learning to detect and localize individual object instances. Instead, we cast the problem as that of estimating an image density whose integral over any image region gives the count of objects within that region. Learning to infer such density can be formulated as a minimization of a regularized risk quadratic cost function. We introduce a new loss function, which is well-suited for such learning, and at the same time can be computed efﬁciently via a maximum subarray algorithm. The learning can then be posed as a convex quadratic program solvable with cutting-plane optimization. The proposed framework is very ﬂexible as it can accept any domain-speciﬁc visual features. Once trained, our system provides accurate object counts and requires a very small time overhead over the feature extraction step, making it a good candidate for applications involving real-time processing or dealing with huge amount of visual data. 1</p><p>6 0.62161106 <a title="86-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Discriminative_Latent_Model_of_Image_Region_and_Object_Tag_Correspondence.html">6 nips-2010-A Discriminative Latent Model of Image Region and Object Tag Correspondence</a></p>

In this paper we investigate and compare methods that learn image classiﬁers by combining very few manually annotated examples (e.g., 1-10 images per class) and a large number of weakly-labeled Web photos retrieved using keyword-based image search. We cast this as a domain adaptation problem: given a few stronglylabeled examples in a target domain (the manually annotated examples) and many source domain examples (the weakly-labeled Web photos), learn classiﬁers yielding small generalization error on the target domain. Our experiments demonstrate that, for the same number of strongly-labeled examples, our domain adaptation approach produces signiﬁcant recognition rate improvements over the best published results (e.g., 65% better when using 5 labeled training examples per class) and that our classiﬁers are one order of magnitude faster to learn and to evaluate than the best competing method, despite our use of large weakly-labeled data sets.</p><p>2 0.95596039 <a title="86-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: While clinicians can accurately identify different types of heartbeats in electrocardiograms (ECGs) from different patients, researchers have had limited success in applying supervised machine learning to the same task. The problem is made challenging by the variety of tasks, inter- and intra-patient differences, an often severe class imbalance, and the high cost of getting cardiologists to label data for individual patients. We address these difﬁculties using active learning to perform patient-adaptive and task-adaptive heartbeat classiﬁcation. When tested on a benchmark database of cardiologist annotated ECG recordings, our method had considerably better performance than other recently proposed methods on the two primary classiﬁcation tasks recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Additionally, our method required over 90% less patient-speciﬁc training data than the methods to which we compared it. 1</p><p>3 0.95476913 <a title="86-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov</p><p>Abstract: We present policy gradient results within the framework of linearly-solvable MDPs. For the ﬁrst time, compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients are obtained by estimating the cost-to-go function, rather than the (much larger) state-action advantage function as is necessary in traditional MDPs. We also develop the ﬁrst compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients for continuous-time stochastic systems.</p><p>4 0.95041817 <a title="86-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Deciphering_subsampled_data%3A_adaptive_compressive_sampling_as_a_principle_of_brain_communication.html">56 nips-2010-Deciphering subsampled data: adaptive compressive sampling as a principle of brain communication</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy Isely, Christopher Hillar, Fritz Sommer</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithm is proposed for a) unsupervised learning of sparse representations from subsampled measurements and b) estimating the parameters required for linearly reconstructing signals from the sparse codes. We verify that the new algorithm performs efﬁcient data compression on par with the recent method of compressive sampling. Further, we demonstrate that the algorithm performs robustly when stacked in several stages or when applied in undercomplete or overcomplete situations. The new algorithm can explain how neural populations in the brain that receive subsampled input through ﬁber bottlenecks are able to form coherent response properties. 1</p><p>5 0.95035076 <a title="86-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Interval_Estimation_for_Reinforcement-Learning_Algorithms_in_Continuous-State_Domains.html">130 nips-2010-Interval Estimation for Reinforcement-Learning Algorithms in Continuous-State Domains</a></p>
<p>Author: Martha White, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: The reinforcement learning community has explored many approaches to obtaining value estimates and models to guide decision making; these approaches, however, do not usually provide a measure of conﬁdence in the estimate. Accurate estimates of an agent’s conﬁdence are useful for many applications, such as biasing exploration and automatically adjusting parameters to reduce dependence on parameter-tuning. Computing conﬁdence intervals on reinforcement learning value estimates, however, is challenging because data generated by the agentenvironment interaction rarely satisﬁes traditional assumptions. Samples of valueestimates are dependent, likely non-normally distributed and often limited, particularly in early learning when conﬁdence estimates are pivotal. In this work, we investigate how to compute robust conﬁdences for value estimates in continuous Markov decision processes. We illustrate how to use bootstrapping to compute conﬁdence intervals online under a changing policy (previously not possible) and prove validity under a few reasonable assumptions. We demonstrate the applicability of our conﬁdence estimation algorithms with experiments on exploration, parameter estimation and tracking. 1</p><p>6 0.9496367 <a title="86-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

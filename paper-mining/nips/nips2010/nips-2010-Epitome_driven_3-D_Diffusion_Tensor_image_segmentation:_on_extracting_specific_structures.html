<p>Author: Remi Cuingnet, Marie Chupin, Habib Benali, Olivier Colliot</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) are increasingly used in brain image analyses since they allow capturing complex multivariate relationships in the data. Moreover, when the kernel is linear, SVMs can be used to localize spatial patterns of discrimination between two groups of subjects. However, the features’ spatial distribution is not taken into account. As a consequence, the optimal margin hyperplane is often scattered and lacks spatial coherence, making its anatomical interpretation difﬁcult. This paper introduces a framework to spatially regularize SVM for brain image analysis. We show that Laplacian regularization provides a ﬂexible framework to integrate various types of constraints and can be applied to both cortical surfaces and 3D brain images. The proposed framework is applied to the classiﬁcation of MR images based on gray matter concentration maps and cortical thickness measures from 30 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 30 elderly controls. The results demonstrate that the proposed method enables natural spatial and anatomical regularization of the classiﬁer. 1</p><p>3 0.30070049 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Infinite_Relational_Modeling_of_Functional_Connectivity_in_Resting_State_fMRI.html">128 nips-2010-Infinite Relational Modeling of Functional Connectivity in Resting State fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Morten Mørup, Kristoffer Madsen, Anne-marie Dogonowski, Hartwig Siebner, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the neural elements which form complex network at a whole brain level. Most analyses of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been based on the analysis of correlation between the temporal dynamics of various regions of the brain. While these models can identify coherently behaving groups in terms of correlation they give little insight into how these groups interact. In this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state networks. Starting from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups we search for functional units of the brain that communicate with other parts of the brain in a coherent manner as measured by mutual information. We use the inﬁnite relational model (IRM) to quantify functional coherent groups of resting state networks and demonstrate how the extracted component interactions can be used to discriminate between functional resting state activity in multiple sclerosis and normal subjects. 1</p><p>4 0.25642374 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Structural_epitome%3A_a_way_to_summarize_one%E2%80%99s_visual_experience.html">256 nips-2010-Structural epitome: a way to summarize one’s visual experience</a></p>
<p>Author: Nebojsa Jojic, Alessandro Perina, Vittorio Murino</p><p>Abstract: In order to study the properties of total visual input in humans, a single subject wore a camera for two weeks capturing, on average, an image every 20 seconds. The resulting new dataset contains a mix of indoor and outdoor scenes as well as numerous foreground objects. Our ﬁrst goal is to create a visual summary of the subject’s two weeks of life using unsupervised algorithms that would automatically discover recurrent scenes, familiar faces or common actions. Direct application of existing algorithms, such as panoramic stitching (e.g., Photosynth) or appearance-based clustering models (e.g., the epitome), is impractical due to either the large dataset size or the dramatic variations in the lighting conditions. As a remedy to these problems, we introduce a novel image representation, the ”structural element (stel) epitome,” and an associated efﬁcient learning algorithm. In our model, each image or image patch is characterized by a hidden mapping T which, as in previous epitome models, deﬁnes a mapping between the image coordinates and the coordinates in the large ”all-I-have-seen” epitome matrix. The limited epitome real-estate forces the mappings of different images to overlap which indicates image similarity. However, the image similarity no longer depends on direct pixel-to-pixel intensity/color/feature comparisons as in previous epitome models, but on spatial conﬁguration of scene or object parts, as the model is based on the palette-invariant stel models. As a result, stel epitomes capture structure that is invariant to non-structural changes, such as illumination changes, that tend to uniformly affect pixels belonging to a single scene or object part. 1</p><p>5 0.17396474 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Segmentation_as_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set.html">234 nips-2010-Segmentation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set</a></p>
<p>Author: William Brendel, Sinisa Todorovic</p><p>Abstract: Given an ensemble of distinct, low-level segmentations of an image, our goal is to identify visually “meaningful” segments in the ensemble. Knowledge about any speciﬁc objects and surfaces present in the image is not available. The selection of image regions occupied by objects is formalized as the maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem. MWIS is the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent nodes of an attributed graph. We construct such a graph from all segments in the ensemble. Then, MWIS selects maximally distinctive segments that together partition the image. A new MWIS algorithm is presented. The algorithm seeks a solution directly in the discrete domain, instead of relaxing MWIS to a continuous problem, as common in previous work. It iteratively ﬁnds a candidate discrete solution of the Taylor series expansion of the original MWIS objective function around the previous solution. The algorithm is shown to converge to an optimum. Our empirical evaluation on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset shows that the new algorithm eliminates the need for hand-picking optimal input parameters of the state-of-the-art segmenters, and outperforms their best, manually optimized results.</p><p>6 0.16298352 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Functional_Geometry_Alignment_and_Localization_of_Brain_Areas.html">97 nips-2010-Functional Geometry Alignment and Localization of Brain Areas</a></p>

<p>Author: Georg Langs, Yanmei Tie, Laura Rigolo, Alexandra Golby, Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: Matching functional brain regions across individuals is a challenging task, largely due to the variability in their location and extent. It is particularly difﬁcult, but highly relevant, for patients with pathologies such as brain tumors, which can cause substantial reorganization of functional systems. In such cases spatial registration based on anatomical data is only of limited value if the goal is to establish correspondences of functional areas among different individuals, or to localize potentially displaced active regions. Rather than rely on spatial alignment, we propose to perform registration in an alternative space whose geometry is governed by the functional interaction patterns in the brain. We ﬁrst embed each brain into a functional map that reﬂects connectivity patterns during a fMRI experiment. The resulting functional maps are then registered, and the obtained correspondences are propagated back to the two brains. In application to a language fMRI experiment, our preliminary results suggest that the proposed method yields improved functional correspondences across subjects. This advantage is pronounced for subjects with tumors that affect the language areas and thus cause spatial reorganization of the functional regions. 1</p><p>6 0.58574241 <a title="77-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Infinite_Relational_Modeling_of_Functional_Connectivity_in_Resting_State_fMRI.html">128 nips-2010-Infinite Relational Modeling of Functional Connectivity in Resting State fMRI</a></p>

<p>Author: Katsuhiko Ishiguro, Tomoharu Iwata, Naonori Ueda, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new probabilistic model for analyzing dynamic evolutions of relational data, such as additions, deletions and split & merge, of relation clusters like communities in social networks. Our proposed model abstracts observed timevarying object-object relationships into relationships between object clusters. We extend the inﬁnite Hidden Markov model to follow dynamic and time-sensitive changes in the structure of the relational data and to estimate a number of clusters simultaneously. We show the usefulness of the model through experiments with synthetic and real-world data sets.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76816255 <a title="77-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Epitome_driven_3-D_Diffusion_Tensor_image_segmentation%3A_on_extracting_specific_structures.html">77 nips-2010-Epitome driven 3-D Diffusion Tensor image segmentation: on extracting specific structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamiya Motwani, Nagesh Adluru, Chris Hinrichs, Andrew Alexander, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of segmenting speciﬁc white matter structures of interest from Diffusion Tensor (DT-MR) images of the human brain. This is an important requirement in many Neuroimaging studies: for instance, to evaluate whether a brain structure exhibits group level differences as a function of disease in a set of images. Typically, interactive expert guided segmentation has been the method of choice for such applications, but this is tedious for large datasets common today. To address this problem, we endow an image segmentation algorithm with “advice” encoding some global characteristics of the region(s) we want to extract. This is accomplished by constructing (using expert-segmented images) an epitome of a speciﬁc region – as a histogram over a bag of ‘words’ (e.g., suitable feature descriptors). Now, given such a representation, the problem reduces to segmenting a new brain image with additional constraints that enforce consistency between the segmented foreground and the pre-speciﬁed histogram over features. We present combinatorial approximation algorithms to incorporate such domain speciﬁc constraints for Markov Random Field (MRF) segmentation. Making use of recent results on image co-segmentation, we derive effective solution strategies for our problem. We provide an analysis of solution quality, and present promising experimental evidence showing that many structures of interest in Neuroscience can be extracted reliably from 3-D brain image volumes using our algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.67092526 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>
<p>Author: Kritika Muralidharan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justiﬁcation for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classiﬁcation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems. 1</p><p>4 0.66870201 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Multivariate_Dyadic_Regression_Trees_for_Sparse_Learning_Problems.html">178 nips-2010-Multivariate Dyadic Regression Trees for Sparse Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric learning method based on multivariate dyadic regression trees (MDRTs). Unlike traditional dyadic decision trees (DDTs) or classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs), MDRTs are constructed using penalized empirical risk minimization with a novel sparsity-inducing penalty. Theoretically, we show that MDRTs can simultaneously adapt to the unknown sparsity and smoothness of the true regression functions, and achieve the nearly optimal rates of convergence (in a minimax sense) for the class of (α, C)-smooth functions. Empirically, MDRTs can simultaneously conduct function estimation and variable selection in high dimensions. To make MDRTs applicable for large-scale learning problems, we propose a greedy heuristics. The superior performance of MDRTs are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.66730124 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>6 0.66723472 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Fast_detection_of_multiple_change-points_shared_by_many_signals_using_group_LARS.html">91 nips-2010-Fast detection of multiple change-points shared by many signals using group LARS</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohammad E. Khan, Guillaume Bouchard, Kevin P. Murphy, Benjamin M. Marlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new variational EM algorithm for ﬁtting factor analysis models with mixed continuous and categorical observations. The algorithm is based on a simple quadratic bound to the log-sum-exp function. In the special case of fully observed binary data, the bound we propose is signiﬁcantly faster than previous variational methods. We show that EM is signiﬁcantly more robust in the presence of missing data compared to treating the latent factors as parameters, which is the approach used by exponential family PCA and other related matrix-factorization methods. A further beneﬁt of the variational approach is that it can easily be extended to the case of mixtures of factor analyzers, as we show. We present results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrating several desirable properties of our proposed method. 1</p><p>3 0.13281177 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Spike_timing-dependent_plasticity_as_dynamic_filter.html">253 nips-2010-Spike timing-dependent plasticity as dynamic filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>4 0.11384588 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Near-Optimal_Bayesian_Active_Learning_with_Noisy_Observations.html">180 nips-2010-Near-Optimal Bayesian Active Learning with Noisy Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Golovin, Andreas Krause, Debajyoti Ray</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the fundamental problem of Bayesian active learning with noise, where we need to adaptively select from a number of expensive tests in order to identify an unknown hypothesis sampled from a known prior distribution. In the case of noise–free observations, a greedy algorithm called generalized binary search (GBS) is known to perform near–optimally. We show that if the observations are noisy, perhaps surprisingly, GBS can perform very poorly. We develop EC2 , a novel, greedy active learning algorithm and prove that it is competitive with the optimal policy, thus obtaining the ﬁrst competitiveness guarantees for Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Our bounds rely on a recently discovered diminishing returns property called adaptive submodularity, generalizing the classical notion of submodular set functions to adaptive policies. Our results hold even if the tests have non–uniform cost and their noise is correlated. We also propose E FF ECXTIVE , a particularly fast approximation of EC 2 , and evaluate it on a Bayesian experimental design problem involving human subjects, intended to tease apart competing economic theories of how people make decisions under uncertainty. 1</p><p>5 0.10134175 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Attractor_Dynamics_with_Synaptic_Depression.html">34 nips-2010-Attractor Dynamics with Synaptic Depression</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, He Wang, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Neuronal connection weights exhibit short-term depression (STD). The present study investigates the impact of STD on the dynamics of a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) and its potential roles in neural information processing. We ﬁnd that the network with STD can generate both static and traveling bumps, and STD enhances the performance of the network in tracking external inputs. In particular, we ﬁnd that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau behaviors, namely, the network being initially stimulated to an active state will decay to silence very slowly in the time scale of STD rather than that of neural signaling. We argue that this provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold short-term memory easily and shut off persistent activities naturally.</p><p>6 0.096757822 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-The_Neural_Costs_of_Optimal_Control.html">268 nips-2010-The Neural Costs of Optimal Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Anand Singh, Renaud Jolivet, Pierre Magistretti, Bruno Weber</p><p>Abstract: Sodium entry during an action potential determines the energy efﬁciency of a neuron. The classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation is notoriously inefﬁcient in that regard with about 4 times more charges ﬂowing through the membrane than the theoretical minimum required to achieve the observed depolarization. Yet, recent experimental results show that mammalian neurons are close to the optimal metabolic efﬁciency and that the dynamics of their voltage-gated channels is signiﬁcantly different than the one exhibited by the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model during the action potential. Nevertheless, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model is still widely used and rarely to model the squid giant axon from which it was extracted. Here, we introduce a novel family of HodgkinHuxley models that correctly account for sodium entry, action potential width and whose voltage-gated channels display a dynamics very similar to the most recent experimental observations in mammalian neurons. We speak here about a family of models because the model is parameterized by a unique parameter the variations of which allow to reproduce the entire range of experimental observations from cortical pyramidal neurons to Purkinje cells, yielding a very economical framework to model a wide range of different central neurons. The present paper demonstrates the performances and discuss the properties of this new family of models. 1</p><p>4 0.51555079 <a title="68-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Variational_bounds_for_mixed-data_factor_analysis.html">284 nips-2010-Variational bounds for mixed-data factor analysis</a></p>

In this paper, we introduce the minimum average cost criterion, and show that the theory of intersecting submodular functions can be used for clustering with submodular objective functions. The proposed algorithm does not require the number of clusters in advance, and it will be determined by the property of a given set of data points. The minimum average cost clustering problem is parameterized with a real variable, and surprisingly, we show that all information about optimal clusterings for all parameters can be computed in polynomial time in total. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through computational experiments. 1</p><p>3 0.59732002 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Layer-wise_analysis_of_deep_networks_with_Gaussian_kernels.html">140 nips-2010-Layer-wise analysis of deep networks with Gaussian kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Grégoire Montavon, Klaus-Robert Müller, Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: Deep networks can potentially express a learning problem more efﬁciently than local learning machines. While deep networks outperform local learning machines on some problems, it is still unclear how their nice representation emerges from their complex structure. We present an analysis based on Gaussian kernels that measures how the representation of the learning problem evolves layer after layer as the deep network builds higher-level abstract representations of the input. We use this analysis to show empirically that deep networks build progressively better representations of the learning problem and that the best representations are obtained when the deep network discriminates only in the last layers. 1</p><p>4 0.58997303 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Bounds_for_Importance_Weighting.html">142 nips-2010-Learning Bounds for Importance Weighting</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of importance weighting for learning from ﬁnite samples and gives a series of theoretical and algorithmic results. We point out simple cases where importance weighting can fail, which suggests the need for an analysis of the properties of this technique. We then give both upper and lower bounds for generalization with bounded importance weights and, more signiﬁcantly, give learning guarantees for the more common case of unbounded importance weights under the weak assumption that the second moment is bounded, a condition related to the R´ nyi divergence of the training and test distributions. e These results are based on a series of novel and general bounds we derive for unbounded loss functions, which are of independent interest. We use these bounds to guide the deﬁnition of an alternative reweighting algorithm and report the results of experiments demonstrating its beneﬁts. Finally, we analyze the properties of normalized importance weights which are also commonly used.</p><p>5 0.58234906 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-The_LASSO_risk%3A_asymptotic_results_and_real_world_examples.html">265 nips-2010-The LASSO risk: asymptotic results and real world examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, José Pereira, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector x0 ∈ RN from noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w ∈ Rn . In many contexts (ranging from model selection to image processing) it is desirable to construct a sparse estimator x. In this case, a popular approach consists in solving an ℓ1 -penalized least squares problem known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). For sequences of matrices A of increasing dimensions, with independent gaussian entries, we prove that the normalized risk of the LASSO converges to a limit, and we obtain an explicit expression for this limit. Our result is the ﬁrst rigorous derivation of an explicit formula for the asymptotic mean square error of the LASSO for random instances. The proof technique is based on the analysis of AMP, a recently developed efﬁcient algorithm, that is inspired from graphical models ideas. Through simulations on real data matrices (gene expression data and hospital medical records) we observe that these results can be relevant in a broad array of practical applications.</p><p>6 0.57915717 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Collaborative_Filtering_in_a_Non-Uniform_World%3A_Learning_with_the_Weighted_Trace_Norm.html">48 nips-2010-Collaborative Filtering in a Non-Uniform World: Learning with the Weighted Trace Norm</a></p>

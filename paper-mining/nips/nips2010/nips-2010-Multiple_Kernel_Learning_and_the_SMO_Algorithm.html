<p>Author: Serhat Bucak, Rong Jin, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that multiple kernel learning is very effective for object recognition, leading to the popularity of kernel learning in computer vision problems. In this work, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for multi-label multiple kernel learning (ML-MKL). We assume that all the classes under consideration share the same combination of kernel functions, and the objective is to ﬁnd the optimal kernel combination that beneﬁts all the classes. Although several algorithms have been developed for ML-MKL, their computational cost is linear in the number of classes, making them unscalable when the number of classes is large, a challenge frequently encountered in visual object recognition. We address this computational challenge by developing a framework for ML-MKL that combines the worst-case analysis with stochastic approximation. Our analysis √ shows that the complexity of our algorithm is O(m1/3 lnm), where m is the number of classes. Empirical studies with object recognition show that while achieving similar classiﬁcation accuracy, the proposed method is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the state-of-the-art algorithms for ML-MKL. 1</p><p>3 0.46345836 <a title="176-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Kernels_with_Radiuses_of_Minimum_Enclosing_Balls.html">145 nips-2010-Learning Kernels with Radiuses of Minimum Enclosing Balls</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Gai, Guangyun Chen, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we point out that there exist scaling and initialization problems in most existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) approaches, which employ the large margin principle to jointly learn both a kernel and an SVM classiﬁer. The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (e.g., L1 or L2 ) of norm constraints on combination coefﬁcients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms both SVM with the uniform combination of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.23377617 <a title="176-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_algorithms_for_learning_kernels_from_multiple_similarity_matrices_with_general_convex_loss_functions.html">72 nips-2010-Efficient algorithms for learning kernels from multiple similarity matrices with general convex loss functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Achintya Kundu, Vikram Tankasali, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Aharon Ben-tal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning an n × n kernel matrix from m(≥ 1) similarity matrices under general convex loss. Past research have extensively studied the m = 1 case and have derived several algorithms which require sophisticated techniques like ACCP, SOCP, etc. The existing algorithms do not apply if one uses arbitrary losses and often can not handle m > 1 case. We present several provably convergent iterative algorithms, where each iteration requires either an SVM or a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) solver for m > 1 case. One of the major contributions of the paper is to extend the well known Mirror Descent(MD) framework to handle Cartesian product of psd matrices. This novel extension leads to an algorithm, called EMKL, which solves the problem in 2 O( m ǫlog n ) iterations; in each iteration one solves an MKL involving m kernels 2 and m eigen-decomposition of n × n matrices. By suitably deﬁning a restriction on the objective function, a faster version of EMKL is proposed, called REKL, which avoids the eigen-decomposition. An alternative to both EMKL and REKL is also suggested which requires only an SVM solver. Experimental results on real world protein data set involving several similarity matrices illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithms.</p><p>5 0.14852725 <a title="176-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: The design of low-level image features is critical for computer vision algorithms. Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT [16] and HOG [3], are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a uniﬁed and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) [23]. Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classiﬁcation benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.13602047 <a title="176-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Inductive_Regularized_Learning_of_Kernel_Functions.html">124 nips-2010-Inductive Regularized Learning of Kernel Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of semi-supervised kernel function learning. We ﬁrst propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and then demonstrate an equivalence between our proposed kernel matrix learning framework and a general linear transformation learning problem. Our result shows that the learned kernel matrices parameterize a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points. Furthermore, our result gives a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. To make our results practical for large-scale data, we modify our framework to limit the number of parameters in the optimization process. We also consider the problem of kernelized inductive dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting. To this end, we introduce a novel method for this problem by considering a special case of our general kernel learning framework where we select the trace norm function as the regularizer. We empirically demonstrate that our framework learns useful kernel functions, improving the k-NN classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly in a variety of domains. Furthermore, our kernelized dimensionality reduction technique signiﬁcantly reduces the dimensionality of the feature space while achieving competitive classiﬁcation accuracies. 1</p><p>6 0.5569573 <a title="176-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Ping Li, Arnd Konig, Wenhao Gui</p><p>Abstract: Computing1 two-way and multi-way set similarities is a fundamental problem. This study focuses on estimating 3-way resemblance (Jaccard similarity) using b-bit minwise hashing. While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits, b-bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest b bits (where b ≥ 2 for 3-way). The extension to 3-way similarity from the prior work on 2-way similarity is technically non-trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simpliﬁed estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that b-bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 25-fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 3-way resemblance. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76787424 <a title="176-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Multiple_Kernel_Learning_and_the_SMO_Algorithm.html">176 nips-2010-Multiple Kernel Learning and the SMO Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhaonan Sun, Nawanol Ampornpunt, Manik Varma, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: Our objective is to train p-norm Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and, more generally, linear MKL regularised by the Bregman divergence, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. The SMO algorithm is simple, easy to implement and adapt, and efﬁciently scales to large problems. As a result, it has gained widespread acceptance and SVMs are routinely trained using SMO in diverse real world applications. Training using SMO has been a long standing goal in MKL for the very same reasons. Unfortunately, the standard MKL dual is not differentiable, and therefore can not be optimised using SMO style co-ordinate ascent. In this paper, we demonstrate that linear MKL regularised with the p-norm squared, or with certain Bregman divergences, can indeed be trained using SMO. The resulting algorithm retains both simplicity and efﬁciency and is signiﬁcantly faster than state-of-the-art specialised p-norm MKL solvers. We show that we can train on a hundred thousand kernels in approximately seven minutes and on ﬁfty thousand points in less than half an hour on a single core. 1</p><p>3 0.66935068 <a title="176-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Practical_Large-Scale_Optimization_for_Max-norm_Regularization.html">210 nips-2010-Practical Large-Scale Optimization for Max-norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ben Recht, Nathan Srebro, Joel Tropp, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: The max-norm was proposed as a convex matrix regularizer in [1] and was shown to be empirically superior to the trace-norm for collaborative ﬁltering problems. Although the max-norm can be computed in polynomial time, there are currently no practical algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems that incorporate the max-norm. The present work uses a factorization technique of Burer and Monteiro [2] to devise scalable ﬁrst-order algorithms for convex programs involving the max-norm. These algorithms are applied to solve huge collaborative ﬁltering, graph cut, and clustering problems. Empirically, the new methods outperform mature techniques from all three areas. 1</p><p>4 0.66874045 <a title="176-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-New_Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Online_Classification.html">182 nips-2010-New Adaptive Algorithms for Online Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Koby Crammer</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework to online learning for classiﬁcation problems with time-varying potential functions in the adversarial setting. This framework allows to design and prove relative mistake bounds for any generic loss function. The mistake bounds can be specialized for the hinge loss, allowing to recover and improve the bounds of known online classiﬁcation algorithms. By optimizing the general bound we derive a new online classiﬁcation algorithm, called NAROW, that hybridly uses adaptive- and ﬁxed- second order information. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance using synthetic dataset. 1</p><p>5 0.66393185 <a title="176-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_POMDP_Extension_with_Belief-dependent_Rewards.html">11 nips-2010-A POMDP Extension with Belief-dependent Rewards</a></p>
<p>Author: Mauricio Araya, Olivier Buffet, Vincent Thomas, Françcois Charpillet</p><p>Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty and partial observability. Unfortunately, some problems cannot be modeled with state-dependent reward functions, e.g., problems whose objective explicitly implies reducing the uncertainty on the state. To that end, we introduce ρPOMDPs, an extension of POMDPs where the reward function ρ depends on the belief state. We show that, under the common assumption that ρ is convex, the value function is also convex, what makes it possible to (1) approximate ρ arbitrarily well with a piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) function, and (2) use state-of-the-art exact or approximate solving algorithms with limited changes. 1</p><p>6 0.66280192 <a title="176-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Online_Classification_with_Specificity_Constraints.html">192 nips-2010-Online Classification with Specificity Constraints</a></p>

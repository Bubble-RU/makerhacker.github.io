<p>Author: Vibhav Gogate, William Webb, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning high-treewidth Markov networks where inference is still tractable. This is made possible by exploiting context-speciﬁc independence and determinism in the domain. The class of models our algorithm can learn has the same desirable properties as thin junction trees: polynomial inference, closed-form weight learning, etc., but is much broader. Our algorithm searches for a feature that divides the state space into subspaces where the remaining variables decompose into independent subsets (conditioned on the feature and its negation) and recurses on each subspace/subset of variables until no useful new features can be found. We provide probabilistic performance guarantees for our algorithm under the assumption that the maximum feature length is bounded by a constant k (the treewidth can be much larger) and dependences are of bounded strength. We also propose a greedy version of the algorithm that, while forgoing these guarantees, is much more efﬁcient. Experiments on a variety of domains show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art Markov network structure learners. 1</p><p>3 0.12618485 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.10406254 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Probabilistic_Multi-Task_Feature_Selection.html">217 nips-2010-Probabilistic Multi-Task Feature Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Zhang, Dit-Yan Yeung, Qian Xu</p><p>Abstract: Recently, some variants of the đ?&lsquo;&trade;1 norm, particularly matrix norms such as the đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,2 and đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,â&circ;ž norms, have been widely used in multi-task learning, compressed sensing and other related areas to enforce sparsity via joint regularization. In this paper, we unify the đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,2 and đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,â&circ;ž norms by considering a family of đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,đ?&lsquo;ž norms for 1 < đ?&lsquo;ž â&permil;¤ â&circ;ž and study the problem of determining the most appropriate sparsity enforcing norm to use in the context of multi-task feature selection. Using the generalized normal distribution, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of the general multi-task feature selection problem using the đ?&lsquo;&trade;1,đ?&lsquo;ž norm. Based on this probabilistic interpretation, we develop a probabilistic model using the noninformative Jeffreys prior. We also extend the model to learn and exploit more general types of pairwise relationships between tasks. For both versions of the model, we devise expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to learn all model parameters, including đ?&lsquo;ž, automatically. Experiments have been conducted on two cancer classiďŹ cation applications using microarray gene expression data. 1</p><p>5 0.0978847 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>6 0.089092143 <a title="74-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Candidate_Labeling_Sets.html">151 nips-2010-Learning from Candidate Labeling Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Qin, Xiubo Geng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with rank aggregation, which aims to combine multiple input rankings to get a better ranking. A popular approach to rank aggregation is based on probabilistic models on permutations, e.g., the Luce model and the Mallows model. However, these models have their limitations in either poor expressiveness or high computational complexity. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new model, which is deﬁned with a coset-permutation distance, and models the generation of a permutation as a stagewise process. We refer to the new model as coset-permutation distance based stagewise (CPS) model. The CPS model has rich expressiveness and can therefore be used in versatile applications, because many different permutation distances can be used to induce the coset-permutation distance. The complexity of the CPS model is low because of the stagewise decomposition of the permutation probability and the efﬁcient computation of most coset-permutation distances. We apply the CPS model to supervised rank aggregation, derive the learning and inference algorithms, and empirically study their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Experiments on public datasets show that the derived algorithms based on the CPS model can achieve state-ofthe-art ranking accuracy, and are much more efﬁcient than previous algorithms.</p><p>4 0.50378489 <a title="74-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>

<p>Author: Satyen Kale, Lev Reyzin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We consider bandit problems, motivated by applications in online advertising and news story selection, in which the learner must repeatedly select a slate, that is, a subset of size s from K possible actions, and then receives rewards for just the selected actions. The goal is to minimize the regret with respect to total reward of the best slate computed in hindsight. We consider unordered and ordered versions √ of the problem, and give efﬁcient algorithms which have regret O( T ), where the constant depends on the speciﬁc nature of the problem. We also consider versions of the problem where we have access to a number of policies which make recom√ mendations for slates in every round, and give algorithms with O( T ) regret for competing with the best such policy as well. We make use of the technique of relative entropy projections combined with the usual multiplicative weight update algorithm to obtain our algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.4280481 <a title="74-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements. 1</p><p>3 0.59776354 <a title="74-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Generative_Local_Metric_Learning_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">104 nips-2010-Generative Local Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Yung-kyun Noh, Byoung-tak Zhang, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a local metric to enhance the performance of nearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Conventional metric learning methods attempt to separate data distributions in a purely discriminative manner; here we show how to take advantage of information from parametric generative models. We focus on the bias in the information-theoretic error arising from ﬁnite sampling effects, and ﬁnd an appropriate local metric that maximally reduces the bias based upon knowledge from generative models. As a byproduct, the asymptotic theoretical analysis in this work relates metric learning with dimensionality reduction, which was not understood from previous discriminative approaches. Empirical experiments show that this learned local metric enhances the discriminative nearest neighbor performance on various datasets using simple class conditional generative models. 1</p><p>4 0.59282267 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>5 0.58977526 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>6 0.5856443 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-An_analysis_on_negative_curvature_induced_by_singularity_in_multi-layer_neural-network_learning.html">31 nips-2010-An analysis on negative curvature induced by singularity in multi-layer neural-network learning</a></p>

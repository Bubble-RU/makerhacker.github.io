<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, resulting in 17 million deaths each year. Despite the availability of various treatment options, existing techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge often fail to identify patients who might have beneﬁted from more aggressive therapy. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel unsupervised machine learning approach for cardiac risk stratiﬁcation. The key idea of our approach is to avoid specialized medical knowledge, and assess patient risk using symbolic mismatch, a new metric to assess similarity in long-term time-series activity. We hypothesize that high risk patients can be identiﬁed using symbolic mismatch, as individuals in a population with unusual long-term physiological activity. We describe related approaches that build on these ideas to provide improved medical decision making for patients who have recently suffered coronary attacks. We ﬁrst describe how to compute the symbolic mismatch between pairs of long term electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. This algorithm maps the original signals into a symbolic domain, and provides a quantitative assessment of the difference between these symbolic representations of the original signals. We then show how this measure can be used with each of a one-class SVM, a nearest neighbor classiﬁer, and hierarchical clustering to improve risk stratiﬁcation. We evaluated our methods on a population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data. In a univariate analysis, all of the methods provided a statistically signiﬁcant association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. In a multivariate analysis that incorporated the most widely used clinical risk variables, the nearest neighbor and hierarchical clustering approaches were able to statistically signiﬁcantly distinguish patients with a roughly two-fold risk of suffering a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. 1</p><p>3 0.07052426 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Adversarially_Missing_Label_Information.html">236 nips-2010-Semi-Supervised Learning with Adversarially Missing Label Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Umar Syed, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of semi-supervised learning in an adversarial setting. Instead of assuming that labels are missing at random, we analyze a less favorable scenario where the label information can be missing partially and arbitrarily, which is motivated by several practical examples. We present nearly matching upper and lower generalization bounds for learning in this setting under reasonable assumptions about available label information. Motivated by the analysis, we formulate a convex optimization problem for parameter estimation, derive an efﬁcient algorithm, and analyze its convergence. We provide experimental results on several standard data sets showing the robustness of our algorithm to the pattern of missing label information, outperforming several strong baselines. 1</p><p>4 0.067148045 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Agnostic_Active_Learning_Without_Constraints.html">27 nips-2010-Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, John Langford, Zhang Tong, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.065891512 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Property-Based_Classification_of_Clustering_Paradigms.html">273 nips-2010-Towards Property-Based Classification of Clustering Paradigms</a></p>
<p>Author: Margareta Ackerman, Shai Ben-David, David Loker</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a basic data mining task with a wide variety of applications. Not surprisingly, there exist many clustering algorithms. However, clustering is an ill deﬁned problem - given a data set, it is not clear what a “correct” clustering for that set is. Indeed, different algorithms may yield dramatically different outputs for the same input sets. Faced with a concrete clustering task, a user needs to choose an appropriate clustering algorithm. Currently, such decisions are often made in a very ad hoc, if not completely random, manner. Given the crucial effect of the choice of a clustering algorithm on the resulting clustering, this state of affairs is truly regrettable. In this paper we address the major research challenge of developing tools for helping users make more informed decisions when they come to pick a clustering tool for their data. This is, of course, a very ambitious endeavor, and in this paper, we make some ﬁrst steps towards this goal. We propose to address this problem by distilling abstract properties of the input-output behavior of different clustering paradigms. In this paper, we demonstrate how abstract, intuitive properties of clustering functions can be used to taxonomize a set of popular clustering algorithmic paradigms. On top of addressing deterministic clustering algorithms, we also propose similar properties for randomized algorithms and use them to highlight functional differences between different common implementations of k-means clustering. We also study relationships between the properties, independent of any particular algorithm. In particular, we strengthen Kleinberg’s famous impossibility result, while providing a simpler proof. 1</p><p>6 0.062203437 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuzong Liu, Mohit Sharma, Charles Gaona, Jonathan Breshears, Jarod Roland, Zachary Freudenburg, Eric Leuthardt, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Several motor related Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been developed over the years that use activity decoded from the contralateral hemisphere to operate devices. Contralateral primary motor cortex is also the region most severely affected by hemispheric stroke. Recent studies have identiﬁed ipsilateral cortical activity in planning of motor movements and its potential implications for a stroke relevant BCI. The most fundamental functional loss after a hemispheric stroke is the loss of ﬁne motor control of the hand. Thus, whether ipsilateral cortex encodes ﬁnger movements is critical to the potential feasibility of BCI approaches in the future. This study uses ipsilateral cortical signals from humans (using ECoG) to decode ﬁnger movements. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, successful ﬁnger movement detection using machine learning algorithms. Our results show high decoding accuracies in all cases which are always above chance. We also show that signiﬁcant accuracies can be achieved with the use of only a fraction of all the features recorded and that these core features are consistent with previous physiological ﬁndings. The results of this study have substantial implications for advancing neuroprosthetic approaches to stroke populations not currently amenable to existing BCI techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.31106168 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Probabilistic_Deterministic_Infinite_Automata.html">215 nips-2010-Probabilistic Deterministic Infinite Automata</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Bartlett, Frank Wood, David Tax</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to learning with probabilistic deterministic ﬁnite automata (PDFA). We deﬁne and develop a sampler for a PDFA with an inﬁnite number of states which we call the probabilistic deterministic inﬁnite automata (PDIA). Posterior predictive inference in this model, given a ﬁnite training sequence, can be interpreted as averaging over multiple PDFAs of varying structure, where each PDFA is biased towards having few states. We suggest that our method for averaging over PDFAs is a novel approach to predictive distribution smoothing. We test PDIA inference both on PDFA structure learning and on both natural language and DNA data prediction tasks. The results suggest that the PDIA presents an attractive compromise between the computational cost of hidden Markov models and the storage requirements of hierarchically smoothed Markov models. 1</p><p>5 0.29691109 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.28651798 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Repeated_Games_against_Budgeted_Adversaries.html">226 nips-2010-Repeated Games against Budgeted Adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: David Grangier, Iain Melvin</p><p>Abstract: We present a new learning strategy for classiﬁcation problems in which train and/or test data suffer from missing features. In previous work, instances are represented as vectors from some feature space and one is forced to impute missing values or to consider an instance-speciﬁc subspace. In contrast, our method considers instances as sets of (feature,value) pairs which naturally handle the missing value case. Building onto this framework, we propose a classiﬁcation strategy for sets. Our proposal maps (feature,value) pairs into an embedding space and then nonlinearly combines the set of embedded vectors. The embedding and the combination parameters are learned jointly on the ﬁnal classiﬁcation objective. This simple strategy allows great ﬂexibility in encoding prior knowledge about the features in the embedding step and yields advantageous results compared to alternative solutions over several datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.98192072 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Active_Instance_Sampling_via_Matrix_Partition.html">23 nips-2010-Active Instance Sampling via Matrix Partition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, batch-mode active learning has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning approach that selects a batch of queries in each iteration by maximizing a natural mutual information criterion between the labeled and unlabeled instances. By employing a Gaussian process framework, this mutual information based instance selection problem can be formulated as a matrix partition problem. Although matrix partition is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we show that a good local solution can be obtained by exploiting an effective local optimization technique on a relaxed continuous optimization problem. The proposed active learning approach is independent of employed classiﬁcation models. Our empirical studies show this approach can achieve comparable or superior performance to discriminative batch-mode active learning methods. 1</p><p>3 0.98179007 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsushi Miyamae, Yuichi Nagata, Isao Ono, Shigenobu Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm for estimating the natural policy gradient using parameter-based exploration; this algorithm samples directly in the parameter space. Unlike previous methods based on natural gradients, our algorithm calculates the natural policy gradient using the inverse of the exact Fisher information matrix. The computational cost of this algorithm is equal to that of conventional policy gradients whereas previous natural policy gradient methods have a prohibitive computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>4 0.97381216 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.96718353 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov</p><p>Abstract: We present policy gradient results within the framework of linearly-solvable MDPs. For the ﬁrst time, compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients are obtained by estimating the cost-to-go function, rather than the (much larger) state-action advantage function as is necessary in traditional MDPs. We also develop the ﬁrst compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients for continuous-time stochastic systems.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.95634496 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>

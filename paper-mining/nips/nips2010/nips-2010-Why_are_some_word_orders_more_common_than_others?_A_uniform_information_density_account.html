<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Katherine Demuth, Bevan Jones, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Bayesian non-parametric models that simultaneously learn to segment words from phoneme strings and learn the referents of some of those words, and shows that there is a synergistic interaction in the acquisition of these two kinds of linguistic information. The models themselves are novel kinds of Adaptor Grammars that are an extension of an embedding of topic models into PCFGs. These models simultaneously segment phoneme sequences into words and learn the relationship between non-linguistic objects to the words that refer to them. We show (i) that modelling inter-word dependencies not only improves the accuracy of the word segmentation but also of word-object relationships, and (ii) that a model that simultaneously learns word-object relationships and word segmentation segments more accurately than one that just learns word segmentation on its own. We argue that these results support an interactive view of language acquisition that can take advantage of synergies such as these. 1</p><p>3 0.13123159 <a title="285-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Word_Features_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">286 nips-2010-Word Features for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: James Petterson, Wray Buntine, Shravan M. Narayanamurthy, Tibério S. Caetano, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by explicitly allowing for the encoding of side information in the distribution over words. This results in a variety of new capabilities, such as improved estimates for infrequently occurring words, as well as the ability to leverage thesauri and dictionaries in order to boost topic cohesion within and across languages. We present experiments on multi-language topic synchronisation where dictionary information is used to bias corresponding words towards similar topics. Results indicate that our model substantially improves topic cohesion when compared to the standard LDA model. 1</p><p>4 0.094057754 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Sphere_Embedding%3A_An_Application_to_Part-of-Speech_Induction.html">251 nips-2010-Sphere Embedding: An Application to Part-of-Speech Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yariv Maron, Elie Bienenstock, Michael James</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application to unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, we present an algorithm for the Euclidean embedding of large sets of categorical data based on co-occurrence statistics. We use the CODE model of Globerson et al. but constrain the embedding to lie on a hig hdimensional unit sphere. This constraint allows for efficient optimization, even in the case of large datasets and high embedding dimensionality. Using k-means clustering of the embedded data, our approach efficiently produces state-of-the-art results. We analyze the reasons why the sphere constraint is beneficial in this application, and conjecture that these reasons might apply quite generally to other large-scale tasks. 1 In trod u cti on The embedding of objects in a low-dimensional Euclidean space is a form of dimensionality reduction that has been used in the past mostly to create 2D representations of data for the purpose of visualization and exploratory data analysis [10, 13]. Most methods work on objects of a single type, endowed with a measure of similarity. Other methods, such as [ 3], embed objects of heterogeneous types, based on their co-occurrence statistics. In this paper we demonstrate that the latter can be successfully applied to unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction, an extensively studied, challenging, problem in natural language processing [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The problem we address is distributional POS tagging, in which words are to be tagged based on the statistics of their immediate left and right context in a corpus (ignoring morphology and other features). The induction task is fully unsupervised, i.e., it uses no annotations. This task has been addressed in the past using a variety of methods. Some approaches, such as [1], combine a Markovian assumption with clustering. Many recent works use HMMs, perhaps due to their excellent performance on the supervised version of the task [7, 2, 5]. Using a latent-descriptor clustering approach, [15] obtain the best results to date for distributional-only unsupervised POS tagging of the widely-used WSJ corpus. Using a heterogeneous-data embedding approach for this task, we define separate embedding functions for the objects</p><p>5 0.090718195 <a title="285-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Fast_detection_of_multiple_change-points_shared_by_many_signals_using_group_LARS.html">91 nips-2010-Fast detection of multiple change-points shared by many signals using group LARS</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Xu, Charles Kemp</p><p>Abstract: Communication between a speaker and hearer will be most efﬁcient when both parties make accurate inferences about the other. We study inference and communication in a television game called Password, where speakers must convey secret words to hearers by providing one-word clues. Our working hypothesis is that human communication is relatively efﬁcient, and we use game show data to examine three predictions. First, we predict that speakers and hearers are both considerate, and that both take the other’s perspective into account. Second, we predict that speakers and hearers are calibrated, and that both make accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other. Finally, we predict that speakers and hearers are collaborative, and that they tend to share the cognitive burden of communication equally. We ﬁnd evidence in support of all three predictions, and demonstrate in addition that efﬁcient communication tends to break down when speakers and hearers are placed under time pressure.</p><p>4 0.59674412 <a title="285-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Word_Features_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">286 nips-2010-Word Features for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Fabian Triefenbach, Azarakhsh Jalalvand, Benjamin Schrauwen, Jean-pierre Martens</p><p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition has gradually improved over the years, but the reliable recognition of unconstrained speech is still not within reach. In order to achieve a breakthrough, many research groups are now investigating new methodologies that have potential to outperform the Hidden Markov Model technology that is at the core of all present commercial systems. In this paper, it is shown that the recently introduced concept of Reservoir Computing might form the basis of such a methodology. In a limited amount of time, a reservoir system that can recognize the elementary sounds of continuous speech has been built. The system already achieves a state-of-the-art performance, and there is evidence that the margin for further improvements is still signiﬁcant. 1</p><p>6 0.50619191 <a title="285-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Sphere_Embedding%3A_An_Application_to_Part-of-Speech_Induction.html">251 nips-2010-Sphere Embedding: An Application to Part-of-Speech Induction</a></p>

Here we present a novel formal methodology for identifying dendritic processing in a neural circuit consisting of a linear dendritic processing ﬁlter in cascade with a spiking neuron model. The input to the circuit is an analog signal that belongs to the space of bandlimited functions. The output is a time sequence associated with the spike train.

This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>4 0.56520092 <a title="285-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>5 0.5645566 <a title="285-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>6 0.5609923 <a title="285-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida_Regularization_for_Grouped_Tree_Structure_Learning.html">170 nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida Regularization for Grouped Tree Structure Learning</a></p>

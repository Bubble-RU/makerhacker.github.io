</p><p>2 edu  Abstract Score Matching is a recently-proposed criterion for training high-dimensional density models for which maximum likelihood training is intractable. [sent-8, score-0.143]
</p><p>3 It has been applied to learning natural image statistics but has so-far been limited to simple models due to the difﬁculty of differentiating the loss with respect to the model parameters. [sent-9, score-0.282]
</p><p>4 We show how this differentiation can be automated with an extended version of the double-backpropagation algorithm. [sent-10, score-0.234]
</p><p>5 In addition, we introduce a regularization term for the Score Matching loss that enables its use for a broader range of problem by suppressing instabilities that occur with ﬁnite training sample sizes and quantized input values. [sent-11, score-0.187]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction Consider the subject of density estimation for high-dimensional continuous random variables, like images. [sent-13, score-0.127]
</p><p>7 Approaches for normalized density estimation, like mixture models, often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. [sent-14, score-0.072]
</p><p>8 An alternative approach is Product-of-Experts (PoE) [7], where we model the density as a product, rather than a sum, of component (expert) densities. [sent-15, score-0.072]
</p><p>9 The multiplicative nature of PoE models make them able to form complex densities: in contrast to mixture models, each expert has the ability to have a strongly negative inﬂuence on the density at any point by assigning it a very low component density. [sent-16, score-0.106]
</p><p>10 However, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the model requires differentiation of a normalizing term, which is infeasible even for low data dimensionality. [sent-17, score-0.25]
</p><p>11 A recently introduced estimation method is Score Matching [10], which involves minimizing the square distance between the model log-density slope (score) and data log-density slope, which is independent of the normalizing term. [sent-18, score-0.208]
</p><p>12 Unfortunately, applications of SM estimation have thus far been limited. [sent-19, score-0.055]
</p><p>13 Differentiating the SM loss with respect to the parameters can be very challenging, which somewhat complicates the use of SM in many situations. [sent-21, score-0.089]
</p><p>14 Furthermore, the proof of the SM estimator [10] requires certain conditions that are often violated, like a smooth underlying density or an inﬁnite number of samples. [sent-22, score-0.101]
</p><p>15 CD and Basis Rotation estimation will be used as a basis for comparison. [sent-29, score-0.133]
</p><p>16 In section 3 we show how computation and differentiation of the SM loss can be performed in automated fashion. [sent-31, score-0.323]
</p><p>17 2 Regularized Score Matching Consider an energy-based [17] model E(x; w), where “energy” is the unnormalized negative logdensity such that the pdf is: p(x; w) = e−E(x;w) /Z(w), where Z(w) is the normalizing constant. [sent-33, score-0.253]
</p><p>18 In other words, low energies correspond to high probability density, and high energies correspond to low probability density. [sent-34, score-0.074]
</p><p>19 Score Matching works by ﬁtting the slope (score) of the model density to the slope of the true, underlying density at the data points, which is obviously independent of the vertical offset of the logdensity (the normalizing constant). [sent-35, score-0.381]
</p><p>20 Among the conditions 1 is (1) that px (x) is differentiable, and (2) that the log-density is ﬁnite everywhere. [sent-37, score-0.117]
</p><p>21 In practice, the true pdf is unknown, and we have a ﬁnite sample of T discrete data points. [sent-38, score-0.103]
</p><p>22 The sample version of the SM loss function is:  J S (w) =  1 T  T  N  t=1 i=1  1 2  ∂E(x(t) ; w) ∂xi  2  −  ∂ 2 E(x(t) ; w) (∂xi )2  (2)  which is asymptotically equivalent to the equation (1) as T approaches inﬁnity, due to the law of large numbers. [sent-39, score-0.089]
</p><p>23 This loss function was used in previous publications on SM [10, 12, 13, 15]. [sent-40, score-0.156]
</p><p>24 1 Issues Should these conditions be violated, then (theoretically) the pdf cannot be estimated using equation (1). [sent-42, score-0.132]
</p><p>25 Unfortunately, situations where the mentioned conditions are violated are not rare. [sent-46, score-0.069]
</p><p>26 For proper estimation with SM, data can be smoothened by whitening; however, common whitening methods (such as PCA or SVD) are computational infeasible for large data dimensionality, and generally destroy the local structure of spatial and temporal data such as image and audio. [sent-49, score-0.243]
</p><p>27 Some previous publications on Score Matching apply zero-phase whitening (ZCA) [13] which computes a weighed sum over an input patch which removes some of the original quantization, and can potentially be applied convolutionally. [sent-50, score-0.156]
</p><p>28 However, 1 The conditions are: the true (underlying) pdf px (x) is differentiable, the expectations E ∂ log px (x)/∂x 2 and E ∂E(x; w)/∂x 2 w. [sent-51, score-0.308]
</p><p>29 x are ﬁnite for any w, and px (x)∂E(x; w)/∂x goes to zero for any w when x → ∞. [sent-54, score-0.088]
</p><p>30 2  the amount of information removed from the input by such whitening is not parameterized and potentially large. [sent-55, score-0.089]
</p><p>31 By this replacement, the sample pdf becomes smooth and the conditions for proper SM estimation become satisﬁed. [sent-61, score-0.187]
</p><p>32 The expected value of the sample loss is: E J S (x + ǫ; w) =  1 2  N  i=1  N  2  ∂E(x + ǫ; w) ∂(xi + ǫi )  E  −  E i=1  ∂ 2 E(x + ǫ; w) (∂(xi + ǫi ))2  (3)  We approximate the ﬁrst and second term with a simple ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion. [sent-62, score-0.089]
</p><p>33 While minimization of above loss may be feasible in some situations, in general it requires differentiation of the full Hessian w. [sent-69, score-0.278]
</p><p>34 This regularized loss is computationally convenient: the added complexity is almost negligible since differentiation of the second derivative terms (∂ 2 E/(∂xi )2 ) w. [sent-75, score-0.329]
</p><p>35 the weights is already required for unregularized Score Matching. [sent-78, score-0.13]
</p><p>36 The regularizer is related to Tikhonov regularization [22] and curvature-driven smoothing [2] where the square of the curvature of the energy surface at the data points are also penalized. [sent-79, score-0.148]
</p><p>37 Black lines: computation of ′ quantities δj = ∂E/∂gj , δj = ∂ 2 E/(∂gi )2 and the SM loss J(x; w). [sent-82, score-0.089]
</p><p>38 Red lines indicate computational ﬂow for differentiation of the Score Matching loss: computation of e. [sent-83, score-0.189]
</p><p>39 The inﬂuence of weights are not shown, for which the derivatives are computed in the last step. [sent-86, score-0.106]
</p><p>40 3 Automatic differentiation of J(x; w) In most optimization methods for energy-based models [17], the sample loss is deﬁned in readily obtainable quantities obtained by forward inference in the model. [sent-87, score-0.374]
</p><p>41 the weights can be obtained in a straightforward and efﬁcient fashion by standard application of the backpropagation algorithm. [sent-91, score-0.165]
</p><p>42 For Score Matching, the situation is more complex since the (regularized) loss (equations 2,7) is deﬁned in terms of {∂E/∂xi } and {∂ 2 E/(∂xi )2 }, each term being some function of x and w. [sent-92, score-0.089]
</p><p>43 In earlier publications on Score Matching for continuous variables [10, 12, 13, 15], the authors rewrote {∂E/∂xi } and {∂ 2 E/(∂xi )2 } to their explicit forms in terms of x and w by manually differentiating the energy2. [sent-93, score-0.127]
</p><p>44 This manual differentiation was repeated for different models, and is arguably a rather inﬂexible approach. [sent-98, score-0.189]
</p><p>45 A procedure that could automatically (1) compute and (2) differentiate the loss would make SM estimation more accessible and ﬂexible in practice. [sent-99, score-0.144]
</p><p>46 Consequently, the terms {∂E/∂xi } and {∂ 2 E/(∂xi )2 } can be efﬁciently computed using a forward and backward pass: the ﬁrst pass performs forward inference (computation of E(x; w)) and the second pass applies the backpropagation algorithm [3] to obtain the derivatives of the energy w. [sent-103, score-0.505]
</p><p>47 However, only the loss J(x; w) is obtained by these two steps. [sent-107, score-0.089]
</p><p>48 For differentiation of this loss, one must perform an additional forward and backward pass. [sent-108, score-0.294]
</p><p>49 1 Obtaining the loss Consider a feed-forward neural network with input vector x and weights w and an ordered set of nodes indexed 1 . [sent-110, score-0.216]
</p><p>50 N , each node j with child nodes i ∈ children(j) with j < i and parent nodes k ∈ parents(j) with k < j. [sent-113, score-0.115]
</p><p>51 The ﬁrst D < N nodes are input nodes, for which the activation value is gj = xj . [sent-114, score-0.614]
</p><p>52 For the other nodes (hidden units and output unit), the activation value is determined by a differentiable scalar function gj ({gi }i∈parents(j) , w). [sent-115, score-0.616]
</p><p>53 However, backpropagation of the full Hessian scales like O(W 2 ), where W is the number of model weights. [sent-119, score-0.144]
</p><p>54 Here, we limit backpropagation to the diagonal approximation which scales like O(W ) [1]. [sent-120, score-0.144]
</p><p>55 This will still result in the correct gradients ∂ 2 E/(∂xj )2 for one-layer models and the models considered in this paper. [sent-121, score-0.068]
</p><p>56 The SM loss is split in D D 1 ′ ′ 2 two terms: J(x; w) = K + L with K = 2 j=1 δj and L = j=1 −δj + λ(δj )2 . [sent-124, score-0.089]
</p><p>57 The equations for inference and backpropagation are given as the ﬁrst two f or-loops in Algorithm 1. [sent-125, score-0.115]
</p><p>58 2  Most previous publications do not express unnormalized neg. [sent-126, score-0.1]
</p><p>59 log-density as “energy”  4  Input: x, w (data and weight vectors) for j ← D + 1 to N do compute gj (. [sent-127, score-0.504]
</p><p>60 The combined network can be differentiated by an extended version of the double-backpropagation procedure [5], with the main difference that the appended ′ network not only computes {δj }, but also {δj }. [sent-135, score-0.15]
</p><p>61 Automatic differentiation of the combined network consists of two phases, corresponding to reverse traversal of the appended and original network ′ respectively: (1) obtaining ∂K/∂δj , ∂L/∂δj and ∂L/∂δj for each node j in order 1 to N ; (2) obtaining ∂J/∂gj for each node j in order N to D + 1. [sent-136, score-0.413]
</p><p>62 4 Experiments Consider the following Product-of-Experts (PoE) model: M T αi g(wi x)  E(x; W, α) =  (8)  i=1  where M is the number of experts, wi is an image ﬁlter and the i-th row of W and αi are scaling parameters. [sent-139, score-0.163]
</p><p>63 1 MNIST The ﬁrst task is to estimate a density model of the MNIST handwritten digits [16]. [sent-146, score-0.072]
</p><p>64 Since a large number of models need to be learned, a 2× downsampled version of MNIST was used. [sent-147, score-0.076]
</p><p>65 The MNIST dataset is highly non-smooth: for each pixel, the extreme values (0 and 1) are highly frequent leading to sharp discontinuities in the data density at these points. [sent-148, score-0.072]
</p><p>66 It is well known that for models ∞ with square weight matrix W , normalized g(. [sent-149, score-0.066]
</p><p>67 ) (meaning −∞ exp(−g(x))dx = 1) and αi = 1, the normalizing constant can be computed [10]: Z(w) = | det W |. [sent-150, score-0.061]
</p><p>68 Unregularized, and regularized models for different choices of λ were estimated and log-likelihood values were computed. [sent-152, score-0.127]
</p><p>69 As expected, unregularized estimation did not result in an accurate model. [sent-159, score-0.135]
</p><p>70 2 Denoising Consider grayscale natural image data from the Berkeley dataset [18]. [sent-164, score-0.099]
</p><p>71 The data quantized and therefore non-smooth, so regularization is potentially beneﬁcial. [sent-165, score-0.098]
</p><p>72 In order to estimate the correct regularization magnitude, we again esimated a PoE model as in equation (8) with square W , such that Z(w) = | det W | and computed the log-likelihood of 10. [sent-166, score-0.075]
</p><p>73 This value is lower than for MNIST data since natural image data is “less unsmooth”. [sent-169, score-0.099]
</p><p>74 Subsequently, a convolutional PoE model known as Fields-of-Experts [21] (FoE) was estimated using regularized SM: M T αi g(wi x(p) )  E(x; W, α) = p  (9)  i=1  where p runs over image positions, and x(p) is a square image patch at p. [sent-170, score-0.281]
</p><p>75 This is approximately equivalent to ZCA whitening used in [15]. [sent-175, score-0.089]
</p><p>76 Models are evaluated by means of Bayesian denoising using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. [sent-176, score-0.158]
</p><p>77 As in a general Bayesian image restoration framework, the goal is to estimate the original input x given a noisy image y using the Bayesian proportionality p(x|y) ∝ p(y|x)p(x). [sent-177, score-0.198]
</p><p>78 The assumption is white Gaussian noise such that the likelihood is p(y|x) ∼ N (0, σ 2 I). [sent-178, score-0.083]
</p><p>79 The gradient of the log-posterior is: N  ∇x log p(x|y) = −∇x E(x; w) +  1 (yi − xi )2 ∇x 2σ 2 i=1  (10)  Denoising is performed by initializing x to a noise image, and 300 subsequent steps of steepest descent according to x′ ← x + α∇x log p(x|y), with α annealed from 2 · 10−2 to 5 · 10−4. [sent-180, score-0.205]
</p><p>80 For comparison, we ran the same denoising procedure with models estimated by CD-1 and Basis Rotation, from [21] and [23] respectively. [sent-181, score-0.192]
</p><p>81 The CD-1 model has been extensively applied to denoising before [21] and shown to compare favourably to specialized denoising methods. [sent-183, score-0.316]
</p><p>82 Regularization turns out to be important for optimal denoising (see ﬁgure 2[e-g]). [sent-186, score-0.158]
</p><p>83 See table 1 for denoising performance of the optimal model for speciﬁc standard images. [sent-187, score-0.158]

</p><p>91 A ﬁrst approximation x is computed by linearly scaling up xsmall and subsequent application of a low-pass ﬁlter to remove false high frequency information. [sent-267, score-0.121]
</p><p>92 The image is than ﬁne-tuned by 200 repetitions of two subsequent steps: (1) reﬁning the image slightly using x′ ← x + α∇x E(x; w) with α annealed from 2 · 10−2 to 5 · 10−4 ; (2) updating each k × k block of pixels such that their average corresponds to the down-sampled value. [sent-268, score-0.275]
</p><p>93 Note: the simple block-downsampling results in serious aliasing artifacts in the Barbara image, so the Castle image is used instead. [sent-269, score-0.099]
</p><p>94 The considered models made give slight improvements in terms of PSNR over the initial solution with low pass ﬁlter. [sent-272, score-0.097]

</p><p>96 31  5 Conclusion We have shown how the addition of a principled regularization term to the expression of the Score Matching loss lifts continuity assumptions on the data density, such that the estimation method becomes more generally applicable. [sent-295, score-0.187]
</p><p>97 The effectiveness of the regularizer was veriﬁed with the discontinuous MNIST and Berkeley datasets, with respect to likelihood of test data in the model. [sent-296, score-0.107]
</p><p>98 For both datasets, the optimal regularization parameter is approximately equal for both likelihood and subsequent classiﬁcation and denoising tasks. [sent-297, score-0.273]
</p><p>99 In addition, we showed how computation and differentiation of the Score Matching loss can be automated using an efﬁcient algorithm. [sent-298, score-0.323]

<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>3 0.13915032 <a title="224-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_Inference_by_Compilation_to_Arithmetic_Circuits.html">32 nips-2010-Approximate Inference by Compilation to Arithmetic Circuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Volodymyr Mnih, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of natural images are usually evaluated by measuring performance on rather indirect tasks, such as denoising and inpainting. A more direct way to evaluate a generative model is to draw samples from it and to check whether statistical properties of the samples match the statistics of natural images. This method is seldom used with high-resolution images, because current models produce samples that are very different from natural images, as assessed by even simple visual inspection. We investigate the reasons for this failure and we show that by augmenting existing models so that there are two sets of latent variables, one set modelling pixel intensities and the other set modelling image-speciﬁc pixel covariances, we are able to generate high-resolution images that look much more realistic than before. The overall model can be interpreted as a gated MRF where both pair-wise dependencies and mean intensities of pixels are modulated by the states of latent variables. Finally, we conﬁrm that if we disallow weight-sharing between receptive ﬁelds that overlap each other, the gated MRF learns more efﬁcient internal representations, as demonstrated in several recognition tasks. 1 Introduction and Prior Work The study of the statistical properties of natural images has a long history and has inﬂuenced many ﬁelds, from image processing to computational neuroscience [1]. In this work we focus on probabilistic models of natural images. These models are useful for extracting representations [2, 3, 4] that can be used for discriminative tasks and they can also provide adaptive priors [5, 6, 7] that can be used in applications like denoising and inpainting. Our main focus, however, will be on improving the quality of the generative model, rather than exploring its possible applications. Markov Random Fields (MRF’s) provide a very general framework for modelling natural images. In an MRF, an image is assigned a probability which is a normalized product of potential functions, with each function typically being deﬁned over a subset of the observed variables. In this work we consider a very versatile class of MRF’s in which potential functions are deﬁned over both pixels and latent variables, thus allowing the states of the latent variables to modulate or gate the effective interactions between the pixels. This type of MRF, that we dub gated MRF, was proposed as an image model by Geman and Geman [8]. Welling et al. [9] showed how an MRF in this family1 could be learned for small image patches and their work was extended to high-resolution images by Roth and Black [6] who also demonstrated its success in some practical applications [7]. Besides their practical use, these models were speciﬁcally designed to match the statistical properties of natural images, and therefore, it seems natural to evaluate them in those terms. Indeed, several authors [10, 7] have proposed that these models should be evaluated by generating images and 1 Product of Student’s t models (without pooling) may not appear to have latent variables but each potential can be viewed as an inﬁnite mixture of zero-mean Gaussians where the inverse variance of the Gaussian is the latent variable. 1 checking whether the samples match the statistical properties observed in natural images. It is, therefore, very troublesome that none of the existing models can generate good samples, especially for high-resolution images (see for instance ﬁg. 2 in [7] which is one of the best models of highresolution images reported in the literature so far). In fact, as our experiments demonstrate the generated samples from these models are more similar to random images than to natural images! When MRF’s with gated interactions are applied to small image patches, they actually seem to work moderately well, as demonstrated by several authors [11, 12, 13]. The generated patches have some coherent and elongated structure and, like natural image patches, they are predominantly very smooth with sudden outbreaks of strong structure. This is unsurprising because these models have a built-in assumption that images are very smooth with occasional strong violations of smoothness [8, 14, 15]. However, the extension of these patch-based models to high-resolution images by replicating ﬁlters across the image has proven to be difﬁcult. The receptive ﬁelds that are learned no longer resemble Gabor wavelets but look random [6, 16] and the generated images lack any of the long range structure that is so typical of natural images [7]. The success of these methods in applications such as denoising is a poor measure of the quality of the generative model that has been learned: Setting the parameters to random values works almost as well for eliminating independent Gaussian noise [17], because this can be done quite well by just using a penalty for high-frequency variation. In this work, we show that the generative quality of these models can be drastically improved by jointly modelling both pixel mean intensities and pixel covariances. This can be achieved by using two sets of latent variables, one that gates pair-wise interactions between pixels and another one that sets the mean intensities of pixels, as we already proposed in some earlier work [4]. Here, we show that this modelling choice is crucial to make the gated MRF work well on high-resolution images. Finally, we show that the most widely used method of sharing weights in MRF’s for high-resolution images is overly constrained. Earlier work considered homogeneous MRF’s in which each potential is replicated at all image locations. This has the subtle effect of making learning very difﬁcult because of strong correlations at nearby sites. Following Gregor and LeCun [18] and also Tang and Eliasmith [19], we keep the number of parameters under control by using local potentials, but unlike Roth and Black [6] we only share weights between potentials that do not overlap. 2 Augmenting Gated MRF’s with Mean Hidden Units A Product of Student’s t (PoT) model [15] is a gated MRF deﬁned on small image patches that can be viewed as modelling image-speciﬁc, pair-wise relationships between pixel values by using the states of its latent variables. It is very good at representing the fact that two-pixel have very similar intensities and no good at all at modelling what these intensities are. Failure to model the mean also leads to impoverished modelling of the covariances when the input images have nonzero mean intensity. The covariance RBM (cRBM) [20] is another model that shares the same limitation since it only differs from PoT in the distribution of its latent variables: The posterior over the latent variables is a product of Bernoulli distributions instead of Gamma distributions as in PoT. We explain the fundamental limitation of these models by using a simple toy example: Modelling two-pixel images using a cRBM with only one binary hidden unit, see ﬁg. 1. This cRBM assumes that the conditional distribution over the input is a zero-mean Gaussian with a covariance that is determined by the state of the latent variable. Since the latent variable is binary, the cRBM can be viewed as a mixture of two zero-mean full covariance Gaussians. The latent variable uses the pairwise relationship between pixels to decide which of the two covariance matrices should be used to model each image. When the input data is pre-proessed by making each image have zero mean intensity (the empirical histogram is shown in the ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column), most images lie near the origin because most of the times nearby pixels are strongly correlated. Less frequently we encounter edge images that exhibit strong anti-correlation between the pixels, as shown by the long tails along the anti-diagonal line. A cRBM could model this data by using two Gaussians (ﬁrst row and second column): one that is spherical and tight at the origin for smooth images and another one that has a covariance elongated along the anti-diagonal for structured images. If, however, the whole set of images is normalized by subtracting from every pixel the mean value of all pixels over all images (second row and ﬁrst column), the cRBM fails at modelling structured images (second row and second column). It can ﬁt a Gaussian to the smooth images by discovering 2 Figure 1: In the ﬁrst row, each image is zero mean. In the second row, the whole set of data points is centered but each image can have non-zero mean. The ﬁrst column shows 8x8 images picked at random from natural images. The images in the second column are generated by a model that does not account for mean intensity. The images in the third column are generated by a model that has both “mean” and “covariance” hidden units. The contours in the ﬁrst column show the negative log of the empirical distribution of (tiny) natural two-pixel images (x-axis being the ﬁrst pixel and the y-axis the second pixel). The plots in the other columns are toy examples showing how each model could represent the empirical distribution using a mixture of Gaussians with components that have one of two possible covariances (corresponding to the state of a binary “covariance” latent variable). Models that can change the means of the Gaussians (mPoT and mcRBM) can represent better structured images (edge images lie along the anti-diagonal and are ﬁtted by the Gaussians shown in red) while the other models (PoT and cRBM) fail, overall when each image can have non-zero mean. the direction of strong correlation along the main diagonal, but it is very likely to fail to discover the direction of anti-correlation, which is crucial to represent discontinuities, because structured images with different mean intensity appear to be evenly spread over the whole input space. If the model has another set of latent variables that can change the means of the Gaussian distributions in the mixture (as explained more formally below and yielding the mPoT and mcRBM models), then the model can represent both changes of mean intensity and the correlational structure of pixels (see last column). The mean latent variables effectively subtract off the relevant mean from each data-point, letting the covariance latent variable capture the covariance structure of the data. As before, the covariance latent variable needs only to select between two covariance matrices. In fact, experiments on real 8x8 image patches conﬁrm these conjectures. Fig. 1 shows samples drawn from PoT and mPoT. mPoT (and similarly mcRBM [4]) is not only better at modelling zero mean images but it can also represent images that have non zero mean intensity well. We now describe mPoT, referring the reader to [4] for a detailed description of mcRBM. In PoT [9] the energy function is: E PoT (x, hc ) = i 1 [hc (1 + (Ci T x)2 ) + (1 − γ) log hc ] i i 2 (1) where x is a vectorized image patch, hc is a vector of Gamma “covariance” latent variables, C is a ﬁlter bank matrix and γ is a scalar parameter. The joint probability over input pixels and latent variables is proportional to exp(−E PoT (x, hc )). Therefore, the conditional distribution over the input pixels is a zero-mean Gaussian with covariance equal to: Σc = (Cdiag(hc )C T )−1 . (2) In order to make the mean of the conditional distribution non-zero, we deﬁne mPoT as the normalized product of the above zero-mean Gaussian that models the covariance and a spherical covariance Gaussian that models the mean. The overall energy function becomes: E mPoT (x, hc , hm ) = E PoT (x, hc ) + E m (x, hm ) 3 (3) Figure 2: Illustration of different choices of weight-sharing scheme for a RBM.

Best viewed in color. where hm is another set of latent variables that are assumed to be Bernoulli distributed (but other distributions could be used). The new energy term is: E m (x, hm ) = 1 T x x− 2 hm Wj T x j (4) j yielding the following conditional distribution over the input pixels: p(x|hc , hm ) = N (Σ(W hm ), Σ), Σ = (Σc + I)−1 (5) with Σc deﬁned in eq. 2. As desired, the conditional distribution has non-zero mean2 . Patch-based models like PoT have been extended to high-resolution images by using spatially localized ﬁlters [6]. While we can subtract off the mean intensity from independent image patches to successfully train PoT, we cannot do that on a high-resolution image because overlapping patches might have different mean. Unfortunately, replicating potentials over the image ignoring variations of mean intensity has been the leading strategy to date [6]3 . This is the major reason why generation of high-resolution images is so poor. Sec. 4 shows that generation can be drastically improved by explicitly accounting for variations of mean intensity, as performed by mPoT and mcRBM. 3 Weight-Sharing Schemes By integrating out the latent variables, we can write the density function of any gated MRF as a normalized product of potential functions (for mPoT refer to eq. 6). In this section we investigate different ways of constraining the parameters of the potentials of a generic MRF. Global: The obvious way to extend a patch-based model like PoT to high-resolution images is to deﬁne potentials over the whole image; we call this scheme global. This is not practical because 1) the number of parameters grows about quadratically with the size of the image making training too slow, 2) we do not need to model interactions between very distant pairs of pixels since their dependence is negligible, and 3) we would not be able to use the model on images of different size. Conv: The most popular way to handle big images is to deﬁne potentials on small subsets of variables (e.g., neighborhoods of size 5x5 pixels) and to replicate these potentials across space while 2 The need to model the means was clearly recognized in [21] but they used conjunctive latent features that simultaneously represented a contribution to the “precision matrix” in a speciﬁc direction and the mean along that same direction. 3 The success of PoT-like models in Bayesian denoising is not surprising since the noisy image effectively replaces the reconstruction term from the mean hidden units (see eq. 5), providing a set of noisy mean intensities that are cleaned up by the patterns of correlation enforced by the covariance latent variables. 4 sharing their parameters at each image location [23, 24, 6]. This yields a convolutional weightsharing scheme, also called homogeneous ﬁeld in the statistics literature. This choice is justiﬁed by the stationarity of natural images. This weight-sharing scheme is extremely concise in terms of number of parameters, but also rather inefﬁcient in terms of latent representation. First, if there are N ﬁlters at each location and these ﬁlters are stepped by one pixel then the internal representation is about N times overcomplete. The internal representation has not only high computational cost, but it is also highly redundant. Since the input is mostly smooth and the parameters are the same across space, the latent variables are strongly correlated as well. This inefﬁciency turns out to be particularly harmful for a model like PoT causing the learned ﬁlters to become “random” looking (see ﬁg 3-iii). A simple intuition follows from the equivalence between PoT and square ICA [15]. If the ﬁlter matrix C of eq. 1 is square and invertible, we can marginalize out the latent variables and write: p(y) = i S(yi ), where yi = Ci T x and S is a Student’s t distribution. In other words, there is an underlying assumption that ﬁlter outputs are independent. However, if the ﬁlters of matrix C are shifted and overlapping versions of each other, this clearly cannot be true. Training PoT with the Conv weight-sharing scheme forces the model to ﬁnd ﬁlters that make ﬁlter outputs as independent as possible, which explains the very high-frequency patterns that are usually discovered [6]. Local: The Global and Conv weight-sharing schemes are at the two extremes of a spectrum of possibilities. For instance, we can deﬁne potentials on a small subset of input variables but, unlike Conv, each potential can have its own set of parameters, as shown in ﬁg. 2-B. This is called local, or inhomogeneous ﬁeld. Compared to Conv the number of parameters increases only slightly but the number of latent variables required and their redundancy is greatly reduced. In fact, the model learns different receptive ﬁelds at different locations as a better strategy for representing the input, overall when the number of potentials is limited (see also ﬁg. 2-F). TConv: Local would not allow the model to be trained and tested on images of different resolution, and it might seem wasteful not to exploit the translation invariant property of images. We therefore advocate the use of a weight-sharing scheme that we call tiled-convolutional (TConv) shown in ﬁg. 2-C and E [18]. Each ﬁlter tiles the image without overlaps with copies of itself (i.e. the stride equals the ﬁlter diameter). This reduces spatial redundancy of latent variables and allows the input images to have arbitrary size. At the same time, different ﬁlters do overlap with each other in order to avoid tiling artifacts. Fig. 2-F shows ﬁlters that were (jointly) learned by a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [29] with Gaussian input variables using the TConv weight-sharing scheme. 4 Experiments We train gated MRF’s with and without mean hidden units using different weight-sharing schemes. The training procedure is very similar in all cases. We perform approximate maximum likelihood by using Fast Persistence Contrastive Divergence (FPCD) [25] and we draw samples by using Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) [26]. Since all latent variables can be exactly marginalized out we can use HMC on the free energy (negative logarithm of the marginal distribution over the input pixels). For mPoT this is: F mPoT (x) = − log(p(x))+const. = k,i 1 1 γ log(1+ (Cik T xk )2 )+ xT x− 2 2 T log(1+exp(Wjk xk )) (6) k,j where the index k runs over spatial locations and xk is the k-th image patch. FPCD keeps samples, called negative particles, that it uses to represent the model distribution. These particles are all updated after each weight update. For each mini-batch of data-points a) we compute the derivative of the free energy w.r.t. the training samples, b) we update the negative particles by running HMC for one HMC step consisting of 20 leapfrog steps. We start at the previous set of negative particles and use as parameters the sum of the regular parameters and a small perturbation vector, c) we compute the derivative of the free energy at the negative particles, and d) we update the regular parameters by using the difference of gradients between step a) and c) while the perturbation vector is updated using the gradient from c) only. The perturbation is also strongly decayed to zero and is subject to a larger learning rate. The aim is to encourage the negative particles to explore the space more quickly by slightly and temporarily raising the energy at their current position. Note that the use of FPCD as opposed to other estimation methods (like Persistent Contrastive Divergence [27]) turns out to be crucial to achieve good mixing of the sampler even after training. We train on mini-batches of 32 samples using gray-scale images of approximate size 160x160 pixels randomly cropped from the Berkeley segmentation dataset [28]. We perform 160,000 weight updates decreasing the learning by a factor of 4 by the end of training. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 for the covariance 5 Figure 3: 160x160 samples drawn by A) mPoT-TConv, B) mHPoT-TConv, C) mcRBM-TConv and D) PoTTConv.

During training we condition on the borders and initialize the negative particles at zero in order to avoid artifacts at the border of the image. We learn 8x8 ﬁlters and pre-multiply the covariance ﬁlters by a whitening transform retaining 99% of the variance; we also normalize the norm of the covariance ﬁlters to prevent some of them from decaying to zero during training4 . Whenever we use the TConv weight-sharing scheme the model learns covariance ﬁlters that mostly resemble localized and oriented Gabor functions (see ﬁg. 3-i and iv), while the Conv weight-sharing scheme learns structured but poorly localized high-frequency patterns (see ﬁg. 3-iii) [6]. The TConv models re-use the same 8x8 ﬁlters every 8 pixels and apply a diagonal offset of 2 pixels between neighboring ﬁlters with different weights in order to reduce tiling artifacts. There are 4 sets of ﬁlters, each with 64 ﬁlters for a total of 256 covariance ﬁlters (see bottom plot of ﬁg. 3). Similarly, we have 4 sets of mean ﬁlters, each with 32 ﬁlters. These ﬁlters have usually non-zero mean and exhibit on-center off-surround and off-center on-surround patterns, see ﬁg. 3-ii. In order to draw samples from the learned models, we run HMC for a long time (10,000 iterations, each composed of 20 leap-frog steps). Some samples of size 160x160 pixels are reported in ﬁg. 3 A)D). Without modelling the mean intensity, samples lack structure and do not seem much different from those that would be generated by a simple Gaussian model merely ﬁtting the second order statistics (see ﬁg. 3 in [1] and also ﬁg. 2 in [7]). By contrast, structure, sharp boundaries and some simple texture emerge only from models that have mean latent variables, namely mcRBM, mPoT and mHPoT which differs from mPoT by having a second layer pooling matrix on the squared covariance ﬁlter outputs [11]. A more quantitative comparison is reported in table 1. We ﬁrst compute marginal statistics of ﬁlter responses using the generated images, natural images from the test set, and random images. The statistics are the normalized histogram of individual ﬁlter responses to 24 Gabor ﬁlters (8 orientations and 3 scales). We then calculate the KL divergence between the histograms on random images and generated images and the KL divergence between the histograms on natural images and generated images. The table also reports the average difference of energies between random images and natural images. All results demonstrate that models that account for mean intensity generate images 4 The code used in the experiments can be found at the ﬁrst author’s web-page. 6 MODEL F (R) − F (T ) (104 ) KL(R G) KL(T G) KL(R G) − KL(T PoT - Conv 2.9 0.3 0.6 PoT - TConv 2.8 0.4 1.0 -0.6 mPoT - TConv 5.2 1.0 0.2 0.8 mHPoT - TConv 4.9 1.7 0.8 0.9 mcRBM - TConv 3.5 1.5 1.0 G) -0.3 0.5 Table 1: Comparing MRF’s by measuring: difference of energy (negative log ratio of probabilities) between random images (R) and test natural images (T), the KL divergence between statistics of random images (R) and generated images (G), KL divergence between statistics of test natural images (T) and generated images (G), and difference of these two KL divergences. Statistics are computed using 24 Gabor ﬁlters. that are closer to natural images than to random images, whereas models that do not account for the mean (like the widely used PoT-Conv) produce samples that are actually closer to random images. 4.1 Discriminative Experiments on Weight-Sharing Schemes In future work, we intend to use the features discovered by the generative model for recognition. To understand how the different weight sharing schemes affect recognition performance we have done preliminary tests using the discriminative performance of a simpler model on simpler data. We consider one of the simplest and most versatile models, namely the RBM [29]. Since we also aim to test the Global weight-sharing scheme we are constrained to using fairly low resolution datasets such as the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits [30] and the CIFAR 10 dataset of generic object categories [22]. The MNIST dataset has soft binary images of size 28x28 pixels, while the CIFAR 10 dataset has color images of size 32x32 pixels. CIFAR 10 has 10 classes, 5000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. MNIST also has 10 classes with, on average, 6000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. The energy function of the RBM trained on the CIFAR 10 dataset, modelling input pixels with 3 (R,G,B) Gaussian variables [31], is exactly the one shown in eq. 4; while the RBM trained on MNIST uses logistic units for the pixels and the energy function is again the same as before but without any quadratic term. All models are trained in an unsupervised way to approximately maximize the likelihood in the training set using Contrastive Divergence [32]. They are then used to represent each input image with a feature vector (mean of the posterior over the latent variables) which is fed to a multinomial logistic classiﬁer for discrimination. Models are compared in terms of: 1) recognition accuracy, 2) convergence time and 3) dimensionality of the representation. In general, assuming ﬁlters much smaller than the input image and assuming equal number of latent variables, Conv, TConv and Local models process each sample faster than Global by a factor approximately equal to the ratio between the area of the image and the area of the ﬁlters, which can be very large in practice. In the ﬁrst set of experiments reported on the left of ﬁg. 4 we study the internal representation in terms of discrimination and dimensionality using the MNIST dataset. For each choice of dimensionality all models are trained using the same number of operations. This is set to the amount necessary to complete one epoch over the training set using the Global model. This experiment shows that: 1) Local outperforms all other weight-sharing schemes for a wide range of dimensionalities, 2) TConv does not perform as well as Local probably because the translation invariant assumption is clearly violated for these relatively small, centered, images, 3) Conv performs well only when the internal representation is very high dimensional (10 times overcomplete) otherwise it severely underﬁts, 4) Global performs well when the representation is compact but its performance degrades rapidly as this increases because it needs more than the allotted training time. The right hand side of ﬁg. 4 shows how the recognition performance evolves as we increase the number of operations (or training time) using models that produce a twice overcomplete internal representation. With only very few ﬁlters Conv still underﬁts and it does not improve its performance by training for longer, but Global does improve and eventually it reaches the performance of Local. If we look at the crossing of the error rate at 2% we can see that Local is about 4 times faster than Global. To summarize, Local provides more compact representations than Conv, is much faster than Global while achieving 7 6 2.4 error rate % 5 error rate % 2.6 Global Local TConv Conv 4 3 2 1 0 2.2 Global Local 2 Conv 1.8 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 dimensionality 6000 7000 1.6 0 8000 2 4 6 8 # flops (relative to # flops per epoch of Global model) 10 Figure 4: Experiments on MNIST using RBM’s with different weight-sharing schemes. Left: Error rate as a function of the dimensionality of the latent representation. Right: Error rate as a function of the number of operations (normalized to those needed to perform one epoch in the Global model); all models have a twice overcomplete latent representation. similar performance in discrimination. Also, Local can easily scale to larger images while Global cannot. Similar experiments are performed using the CIFAR 10 dataset [22] of natural images. Using the same protocol introduced in earlier work by Krizhevsky [22], the RBM’s are trained in an unsupervised way on a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset [33] and then “ﬁne-tuned” on the CIFAR 10 dataset by supervised back-propagation of the error through the linear classiﬁer and feature extractor. All models produce an approximately 10,000 dimensional internal representation to make a fair comparison. Models using local ﬁlters learn 16x16 ﬁlters that are stepped every pixel. Again, we do not experiment with the TConv weight-sharing scheme because the image is not large enough to allow enough replicas. Similarly to ﬁg. 3-iii the Conv weight-sharing scheme was very difﬁcult to train and did not produce Gabor-like features. Indeed, careful injection of sparsity and long training time seem necessary [31] for these RBM’s. By contrast, both Local and Global produce Gabor-like ﬁlters similar to those shown in ﬁg. 2 F). The model trained with Conv weight-sharing scheme yields an accuracy equal to 56.6%, while Local and Global yield much better performance, 63.6% and 64.8% [22], respectively. Although Local and Global have similar performance, training with the Local weight-sharing scheme took under an hour while using the Global weight-sharing scheme required more than a day. 5 Conclusions and Future Work This work is motivated by the poor generative quality of currently popular MRF models of natural images. These models generate images that are actually more similar to white noise than to natural images. Our contribution is to recognize that current models can beneﬁt from 1) the addition of a simple model of the mean intensities and from 2) the use of a less constrained weight-sharing scheme. By augmenting these models with an extra set of latent variables that model mean intensity we can generate samples that look much more realistic: they are characterized by smooth regions, sharp boundaries and some simple high frequency texture. We validate our approach by comparing the statistics of ﬁlter outputs on natural images and generated images. In the future, we plan to integrate these MRF’s into deeper hierarchical models and to use their internal representation to perform object recognition in high-resolution images. The hope is to further improve generation by capturing longer range dependencies and to exploit this to better cope with missing values and ambiguous sensory inputs. References [1] E.P. Simoncelli.

<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Christopher Zach, Marc Pollefeys, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a ”log-bilinear” model that computes class probabilities by combining an input vector multiplicatively with a vector of binary latent variables. Even though the latent variables can take on exponentially many possible combinations of values, we can efﬁciently compute the exact probability of each class by marginalizing over the latent variables. This makes it possible to get the exact gradient of the log likelihood. The bilinear score-functions are deﬁned using a three-dimensional weight tensor, and we show that factorizing this tensor allows the model to encode invariances inherent in a task by learning a dictionary of invariant basis functions. Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that this fully probabilistic model can achieve classiﬁcation performance that is competitive with (kernel) SVMs, backpropagation, and deep belief nets. 1</p><p>6 0.092045978 <a title="224-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition.html">143 nips-2010-Learning Convolutional Feature Hierarchies for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Diederik P. Kingma, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Score Matching is a recently-proposed criterion for training high-dimensional density models for which maximum likelihood training is intractable. It has been applied to learning natural image statistics but has so-far been limited to simple models due to the difﬁculty of differentiating the loss with respect to the model parameters. We show how this differentiation can be automated with an extended version of the double-backpropagation algorithm. In addition, we introduce a regularization term for the Score Matching loss that enables its use for a broader range of problem by suppressing instabilities that occur with ﬁnite training sample sizes and quantized input values. Results are reported for image denoising and super-resolution.</p><p>2 0.65406168 <a title="224-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-A_Bayesian_Framework_for_Figure-Ground_Interpretation.html">3 nips-2010-A Bayesian Framework for Figure-Ground Interpretation</a></p>
<p>Author: Vicky Froyen, Jacob Feldman, Manish Singh</p><p>Abstract: Figure/ground assignment, in which the visual image is divided into nearer (ﬁgural) and farther (ground) surfaces, is an essential step in visual processing, but its underlying computational mechanisms are poorly understood. Figural assignment (often referred to as border ownership) can vary along a contour, suggesting a spatially distributed process whereby local and global cues are combined to yield local estimates of border ownership. In this paper we model ﬁgure/ground estimation in a Bayesian belief network, attempting to capture the propagation of border ownership across the image as local cues (contour curvature and T-junctions) interact with more global cues to yield a ﬁgure/ground assignment. Our network includes as a nonlocal factor skeletal (medial axis) structure, under the hypothesis that medial structure “draws” border ownership so that borders are owned by the skeletal hypothesis that best explains them. We also brieﬂy present a psychophysical experiment in which we measured local border ownership along a contour at various distances from an inducing cue (a T-junction). Both the human subjects and the network show similar patterns of performance, converging rapidly to a similar pattern of spatial variation in border ownership along contours. Figure/ground assignment (further referred to as f/g), in which the visual image is divided into nearer (ﬁgural) and farther (ground) surfaces, is an essential step in visual processing. A number of factors are known to affect f/g assignment, including region size [9], convexity [7, 16], and symmetry [1, 7, 11]. Figural assignment (often referred to as border ownership, under the assumption that the ﬁgural side “owns” the border) is usually studied globally, meaning that entire surfaces and their enclosing boundaries are assumed to receive a globally consistent ﬁgural status. But recent psychophysical ﬁndings [8] have suggested that border ownership can vary locally along a boundary, even leading to a globally inconsistent ﬁgure/ground assignment—broadly consistent with electrophysiological evidence showing local coding for border ownership in area V2 as early as 68 msec after image onset [20]. This suggests a spatially distributed and potentially competitive process of ﬁgural assignment [15], in which adjacent surfaces compete to own their common boundary, with ﬁgural status propagating across the image as this competition proceeds. But both the principles and computational mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. ∗ V.F. was supported by a Fullbright Honorary fellowship and by the Rutgers NSF IGERT program in Perceptual Science, NSF DGE 0549115, J.F. by NIH R01 EY15888, and M.S. by NSF CCF-0541185 1 In this paper we consider how border ownership might propagate over both space and time—that is, across the image as well as over the progression of computation. Following Weiss et al. [18] we adopt a Bayesian belief network architecture, with nodes along boundaries representing estimated border ownership, and connections arranged so that both neighboring nodes and nonlocal integrating nodes combine to inﬂuence local estimates of border ownership. Our model is novel in two particular respects: (a) we combine both local and global inﬂuences on border ownership in an integrated and principled way; and (b) we include as a nonlocal factor skeletal (medial axis) inﬂuences on f/g assignment. Skeletal structure has not been previously considered as a factor on border ownership, but its relevance follows from a model [4] in which shapes are conceived of as generated by or “grown” from an internal skeleton, with the consequence that their boundaries are perceptually “owned” by the skeletal side. We also briey present a psychophysical experiment in which we measured local border ownership along a contour, at several distances from a strong local f/g inducing cue, and at several time delays after the onset of the cue. The results show measurable spatial differences in judged border ownership, with judgments varying with distance from the inducer; but no temporal effect, with essentially asymptotic judgments even after very brief exposures. Both results are consistent with the behavior of the network, which converges quickly to an asymptotic but spatially nonuniform f/g assignment. 1 The Model The Network. For simplicity, we take an edge map as input for the model, assuming that edges and T-junctions have already been detected. From this edge map we then create a Bayesian belief network consisting of four hierarchical levels. At the input level the model receives evidence E from the image, consisting of local contour curvature and T-junctions. The nodes for this level are placed at equidistant locations along the contour. At the ﬁrst level the model estimates local border ownership. The border ownership, or B-nodes at this level are at the same locations as the E-nodes, but are connected to their nearest neighbors, and are the parent of the E-node at their location. (As a simplifying assumption, such connections are broken at T-junctions in such a way that the occluded contour is disconnected from the occluder.) The highest level has skeletal nodes, S, whose positions are deﬁned by the circumcenters of the Delaunay triangulation on all the E-nodes, creating a coarse medial axis skeleton [13]. Because of the structure of the Delaunay, each S-node is connected to exactly three E-nodes from which they receive information about the position and the local tangent of the contour. In the current state of the model the S-nodes are “passive”, meaning their posteriors are computed before the model is initiated. Between the S nodes and the B nodes are the grouping nodes G. They have the same positions as the S-nodes and the same Delaunay connections, but to B-nodes that have the same image positions as the E-nodes. They will integrate information from distant B-nodes, applying an interiority cue that is inﬂuenced by the local strength of skeletal axes as computed by the S-nodes (Fig. 1). Although this is a multiply connected network, we have found that given reasonable parameters the model converges to intuitive posteriors for a variety of shapes (see below). Updating. Our goal is to compute the posterior p(Bi |I), where I is the whole image. Bi is a binary variable coding for the local direction of border ownership, that is, the side that owns the border. In order for border ownership estimates to be inﬂuenced by image structure elsewhere in the image, information has to propagate throughout the network. To achieve this propagation, we use standard equations for node updating [14, 12]. However while to all other connections being directed, connections at the B-node level are undirected, causing each node to be child and parent node at the same time. Considering only the B-node level, a node Bi is only separated from the rest of the network by its two neighbors. Hence the Markovian property applies, in that Bi only needs to get iterative information from its neighbors to eventually compute p(Bi |I). So considering the whole network, at each iteration t, Bi receives information from both its child, Ei and from its parents—that is neigbouring nodes (Bi+1 and Bi−1 )—as well as all grouping nodes connected to it (Gj , ..., Gm ). The latter encode for interiority versus exteriority, interiority meaning that the B-node’s estimated gural direction points towards the G-node in question, exteriority meaning that it points away. Integrating all this information creates a multidimensional likelihood function: p(Bi |Bi−1 , Bi+1 , Gj , ..., Gm ). Because of its complexity we choose to approximate it (assuming all nodes are marginally independent of each other when conditioned on Bi ) by 2 Figure 1: Basic network structure of the model. Both skeletal (S-nodes) and border-ownerhsip nodes (B-nodes) get evidence from E-nodes, though different types. S-nodes receive mere positional information, while B-nodes receive information about local curvature and the presence of T-junctions. Because of the structure of the Delaunay triangulation S-nodes and G-nodes (grouping nodes) always get input from exactly three nodes, respectively E and B-nodes. The gray color depicts the fact that this part of the network is computed before the model is initiated and does not thereafter interact with the dynamics of the model. m p(Bi |Pj , ..., Pm ) ∝ p(Bi |Pj ) (1) j where the Pj ’s are the parents of Bi . Given this, at each iteration, each node Bi performs the following computation: Bel(Bi ) ← cλ(Bi )π(Bi )α(Bi )β(Bi ) (2) where conceptually λ stands for bottom-up information, π for top down information and α and β for information received from within the same level. More formally, λ(Bi ) ← p(E|Bi ) (3) m π(Bi ) ← p(Bi |Gj )πGj (Bi ) j (4) Gj and analogously to equation 4 for α(Bi ) and β(Bi ), which compute information coming from Bi−1 and Bi+1 respectively. For these πBi−1 (Bi ), πBi+1 (Bi ), and πGj (Bi ): πGj (Bi ) ← c π(G) λBk (Gj ) (5) k=i πBi−1 (Bi ) ← c β(Bi−1 )λ(Bi−1 )π(Bi−1 ) 3 (6) and πBi+1 (Bi ) is analogous to πBi−1 (Bi ), with c and c being normalization constants. Finally for the G-nodes: Bel(Gi ) ← cλ(Gi )π(Gi ) λ(Gi ) ← (7) λBj (Gi ) (8) j m λBj (Gi ) ← λ(Bj )p(Bi |Gj )[α(Bj )β(Bj ) Bj p(Bi |Gk )πGk (Bi )] (9) k=i Gk The posteriors of the S-nodes are used to compute the π(Gi ). This posterior computes how well the S-node at each position explains the contour—that is, how well it accounts for the cues ﬂowing from the E-nodes it is connected to. Each Delaunay connection between S- and E-nodes can be seen as a rib that sprouts from the skeleton. More speciﬁcally each rib sprouts in a direction that is normal (perpendicular) to the tangent of the contour at the E-node plus a random error φi chosen independently for each rib from a von Mises distribution centered on zero, i.e. φi ∼ V (0, κS ) with spread parameter κS [4]. The rib lengths are drawn from an exponential decreasing density function p(ρi ) ∝ e−λS ρi [4]. We can now express how well this node “explains” the three E-nodes it is connected to via the probability that this S-node deserves to be a skeletal node or not, p(S = true|E1 , E2 , E3 ) ∝ p(ρi )p(φi ) (10) i with S = true depicting that this S-node deserves to be a skeletal node. From this we then compute the prior π(Gi ) in such a way that good (high posterior) skeletal nodes induce a high interiority bias, hence a stronger tendency to induce ﬁgural status. Conversely, bad (low posterior) skeletal nodes create a prior close to indifferent (uniform) and thus have less (or no) inﬂuence on ﬁgural status. Likelihood functions Finally we need to express the likelihood function necessary for the updating rules described above. The ﬁrst two likelihood functions are part of p(Ei |Bi ), one for each of the local cues. The ﬁrst one, reﬂecting local curvature, gives the probability of the orientations of the two vectors inherent to Ei (α1 and α2 ) given both direction of ﬁgure (θ) encoded in Bi as a von Mises density centered on θ, i.e. αi ∼ V (θ, κEB ). The second likelihood function, reﬂecting the presence of a T-junction, simply assumes a ﬁxed likelihood when a T-junction is present—that is p(T-junction = true|Bi ) = θT , where Bi places the direction of ﬁgure in the direction of the occluder. This likelihood function is only in effect when a T-junction is present, replacing the curvature cue at that node. The third likelihood function serves to keep consistency between nodes of the ﬁrst level. This function p(Bi |Bi−1 ) or p(Bi |Bi+1 ) is used to compute α(B) and β(B) and is deﬁned 2x2 conditional probability matrix with a single free parameter, θBB (the probability that ﬁgural direction at both B-nodes are the same). A fourth and ﬁnal likelihood function p(Bi |Gj ) serves to propagate information between level one and two. This likelihood function is 2x2 conditional probability matrix matrix with one free parameter, θBG . In this case θBG encodes the probability that the ﬁgural direction of the B-node is in the direction of the exterior or interior preference of the G-node. In total this brings us to six free parameters in the model: κS , λS , κEB , θT , θBB , and θBG . 2 Basic Simulations To evaluate the performance of the model, we ﬁrst tested it on several basic stimulus conﬁgurations in which the desired outcome is intuitively clear: a convex shape, a concave shape, a pair of overlapping shapes, and a pair of non-overlapping shapes (Fig. 2,3). The convex shape is the simplest in that curvature never changes sign. The concave shape includes a region with oppositely signed curvature. (The shape is naturally described as predominantly positively curved with a region of negative curvature, i.e. a concavity. But note that it can also be interpreted as predominantly negatively curved “window” with a region of positive curvature, although this is not the intuitive interpretation.) 4 The overlapping pair of shapes consists of two convex shapes with one partly occluding the other, creating a competition between the two shapes for the ownership of the common borderline. Finally the non-overlapping shapes comprise two simple convex shapes that do not touch—again setting up a competition for ownership of the two inner boundaries (i.e. between each shape and the ground space between them). Fig. 2 shows the network structures for each of these four cases. Figure 2: Network structure for the four shape categories (left to right: convex, concave, overlapping, non-overlapping shapes). Blue depict the locations of the B-nodes (and also the E-nodes), the red connections are the connections between B-nodes, the green connections are connections between B-nodes and G-nodes, and the G-nodes (and also the S-nodes) go from orange to dark red. This colour code depicts low (orange) to high (dark red) probability that this is a skeletal node, and hence the strength of the interiority cue. Running our model with hand-estimated parameter values yields highly intuitive posteriors (Fig. 3), an essential “sanity check” to ensure that the network approximates human judgments in simple cases. For the convex shape the model assigns ﬁgure to the interior just as one would expect even based solely on local curvature (Fig. 3A). In the concave ﬁgure (Fig. 3B), estimated border ownership begins to reverse inside the deep concavity. This may seem surprising, but actually closely matches empirical results obtained when local border ownership is probed psychophysically inside a similarly deep concavity, i.e. a “negative part” in which f/g seems to partly reverse [8]. For the overlapping shapes posteriors were also intuitive, with the occluding shape interpreted as in front and owning the common border (Fig. 3C). Finally, for the two non-overlapping shapes the model computed border-ownership just as one would expect if each shape were run separately, with each shape treated as ﬁgural along its entire boundary (Fig. 3D). That is, even though there is skeletal structure in the ground-region between the two shapes (see Fig. 2D), its posterior is weak compared to the skeletal structure inside the shapes, which thus loses the competition to own the boundary between them. For all these conﬁgurations, the model not only converged to intuitive estimates but did so rapidly (Fig. 4), always in fewer cycles than would be expected by pure lateral propagation, niterations < Nnodes [18] (with these parameters, typically about ﬁve times faster). Figure 3: Posteriors after convergence for the four shape categories (left to right: convex, concave, overlapping, non-overlapping). Arrows indicate estimated border ownership, with direction pointing to the perceived ﬁgural side, and length proportional to the magnitude of the posterior. All four simulations used the same parameters. 5 Figure 4: Convergence of the model for the basic shape categories. The vertical lines represent the point of convergence for each of the three shape categories. The posterior change is calculated as |p(Bi = 1|I)t − p(Bi = 1|I)t−1 | at each iteration. 3 Comparison to human data Beyond the simple cases reviewed above, we wished to submit our network to a more ﬁne-grained comparison with human data. To this end we compared its performance to that of human subjects in an experiment we conducted (to be presented in more detail in a future paper). Brieﬂy, our experiment involved ﬁnding evidence for propagation of f/g signals across the image. Subjects were ﬁrst shown a stimulus in which the f/g conﬁguration was globally and locally unambiguous and consistent: a smaller rectangle partly occluding a larger one (Fig. 5A), meaning that the smaller (front) one owns the common border. Then this conﬁguration was perturbed by adding two bars, of which one induced a local f/g reversal—making it now appear locally that the larger rectangle owned the border (Fig. 5B). (The other bar in the display does not alter f/g interpretation, but was included to control for the attentional affects of introducing a bar in the image.) The inducing bar creates T-junctions that serve as strong local f/g cues, in this case tending to reverse the prior global interpretation of the ﬁgure. We then measured subjective border ownership along the central contour at various distances from the inducing bar, and at different times after the onset of the bar (25ms, 100ms and 250ms). We measured border ownership locally using a method introduced in [8] in which a local motion probe is introduced at a point on the boundary between two color regions of different colors, and the subject is asked which color appeared to move. Because the ﬁgural side “owns” the border, the response reﬂects perceived ﬁgural status. The goal of the experiment was to actually measure the progression of the inﬂuence of the inducing T-junction as it (hypothetically) propagated along the boundary. Brieﬂy, we found no evidence of temporal differences, meaning that f/g judgments were essentially constant over time, suggesting rapid convergence of local f/g assignment. (This is consistent with the very rapid convergence of our network, which would suggest a lack of measurable temporal differences except at much shorter time scales than we measured.) But we did ﬁnd a progressive reduction of f/g reversal with increasing distance from the inducer—that is, the inﬂuence of the T-junction decayed with distance. Mean responses aggregated over subjects (shortest delay only) are shown in Fig. 6. In order to run our model on this stimulus (which has a much more complex structure than the simple ﬁgures tested above) we had to make some adjustments. We removed the bars from the edge map, leaving only the T-junctions as underlying cues. This was a necessary ﬁrst step because our model is not yet able to cope with skeletons that are split up by occluders. (The larger rectangle’s skeleton has been split up by the lower bar.) In this way all contours except those created by the bars were used to create the network (Fig. 7). Given this network we ran the model using hand-picked parameters that 6 Figure 5: Stimuli used in the experiment. A. Initial stimulus with locally and globally consistent and unambiguous f/g. B.

The ﬁtted model (green curve) shows very similar pattern. Horizontal black line indicates chance performance (ambiguous f/g). gave us the best possible qualitative similarity to the human data. The parameters used never entailed total elimination of the inﬂuence of any likelihood function (κS = 16, λS = .025, κEB = .5, θT = .9, θBB = .9, and θBG = .6). As can be seen in Fig. 6 the border-ownership estimates at the locations where we had data show compelling similarities to human judgments. Furthermore along the entire contour the model converged to intuitive border-ownership estimates (Fig. 7) very rapidly (within 36 iterations). The fact that our model yielded intuitive estimates for the current network in which not all contours were completed shows another strength of our model. Because our model included grouping nodes, it did not require contours to be amodally completed [6] in order for information to propagate. 4 Conclusion In this paper we proposed a model rooted in Bayesian belief networks to compute ﬁgure/ground. The model uses both local and global cues, combined in a principled way, to achieve a stable and apparently psychologically reasonable estimate of border ownership. Local cues included local curvature and T-junctions, both well-established cues to f/g. Global cues included skeletal structure, 7 Figure 7: (left) Node structure for the experimental stimulus. (right) The model’s local borderownership estimates after convergence. a novel cue motivated by the idea that strongly axial shapes tend to be ﬁgural and thus own their boundaries. We successfully tested this model on both simple displays, in which it gave intuitive results, and on a more complex experimental stimulus, in which it gave a close match to the pattern of f/g propagation found in our subjects. Speciﬁcally, the model, like the human subjects rapidly converged to a stable local f/g interpretation. Our model’s structure shows several interesting parallels to properties of neural coding of border ownership in visual cortex. Some cortical cells (end-stopped cells) appear to code for local curvature [3] and T-junctions [5]. The B-nodes in our model could be seen as corresponding to cells that code for border ownership [20]. Furthermore, some authors [2] have suggested that recurrent feedback loops between border ownership cells in V2 and cells in V4 (corresponding to G-nodes in our model) play a role in the rapid computation of border ownership. The very rapid convergence we observed in our model likewise appears to be due to the connections between B-nodes and G-nodes. Finally scale-invariant shape representations (such as, speculatively, those based on skeletons) are thought to be present in higher cortical regions such as IT [17], which project down to earlier areas in ways that are not yet understood. A number of parallels to past models of f/g should be mentioned. Weiss [18] pioneered the application of belief networks to the f/g problem, though their network only considered a more restricted set of local cues and no global ones, such that information only propagated along the contour. Furthermore it has not been systematically compared to human judgments. Kogo et al. [10] proposed an exponential decay of f/g signals as they spread throughout the image. Our model has a similar decay for information going through the G-nodes, though it is also inﬂuenced by an angular factor deﬁned by the position of the skeletal node. Like the model by Li Zhaoping [19], our model includes horizontal propagation between B-nodes, analogous to border-ownership cells in her model. A neurophysiological model by Craft et al. [2] deﬁnes grouping cells coding for an interiority preference that decays with the size of the receptive ﬁelds of these grouping cells. Our model takes this a step further by including shape (skeletal) structure as a factor in interiority estimates, rather than simply size of receptive ﬁelds (which is similar to the rib lengths in our model). Currently, our use of skeletons as shape representations is still limited to medial axis skeletons and surfaces that are not split up by occluders. Our future goals including integrating skeletons in a more robust way following the probabilistic account suggested by Feldman and Singh [4]. Eventually, we hope to fully integrate skeleton computation with f/g computation so that the more general problem of shape and surface estimation can be approached in a coherent and uniﬁed fashion. 8 References [1] P.

<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Volodymyr Mnih, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of natural images are usually evaluated by measuring performance on rather indirect tasks, such as denoising and inpainting. A more direct way to evaluate a generative model is to draw samples from it and to check whether statistical properties of the samples match the statistics of natural images. This method is seldom used with high-resolution images, because current models produce samples that are very different from natural images, as assessed by even simple visual inspection. We investigate the reasons for this failure and we show that by augmenting existing models so that there are two sets of latent variables, one set modelling pixel intensities and the other set modelling image-speciﬁc pixel covariances, we are able to generate high-resolution images that look much more realistic than before. The overall model can be interpreted as a gated MRF where both pair-wise dependencies and mean intensities of pixels are modulated by the states of latent variables. Finally, we conﬁrm that if we disallow weight-sharing between receptive ﬁelds that overlap each other, the gated MRF learns more efﬁcient internal representations, as demonstrated in several recognition tasks. 1 Introduction and Prior Work The study of the statistical properties of natural images has a long history and has inﬂuenced many ﬁelds, from image processing to computational neuroscience [1]. In this work we focus on probabilistic models of natural images. These models are useful for extracting representations [2, 3, 4] that can be used for discriminative tasks and they can also provide adaptive priors [5, 6, 7] that can be used in applications like denoising and inpainting. Our main focus, however, will be on improving the quality of the generative model, rather than exploring its possible applications. Markov Random Fields (MRF’s) provide a very general framework for modelling natural images. In an MRF, an image is assigned a probability which is a normalized product of potential functions, with each function typically being deﬁned over a subset of the observed variables. In this work we consider a very versatile class of MRF’s in which potential functions are deﬁned over both pixels and latent variables, thus allowing the states of the latent variables to modulate or gate the effective interactions between the pixels. This type of MRF, that we dub gated MRF, was proposed as an image model by Geman and Geman [8]. Welling et al. [9] showed how an MRF in this family1 could be learned for small image patches and their work was extended to high-resolution images by Roth and Black [6] who also demonstrated its success in some practical applications [7]. Besides their practical use, these models were speciﬁcally designed to match the statistical properties of natural images, and therefore, it seems natural to evaluate them in those terms. Indeed, several authors [10, 7] have proposed that these models should be evaluated by generating images and 1 Product of Student’s t models (without pooling) may not appear to have latent variables but each potential can be viewed as an inﬁnite mixture of zero-mean Gaussians where the inverse variance of the Gaussian is the latent variable. 1 checking whether the samples match the statistical properties observed in natural images. It is, therefore, very troublesome that none of the existing models can generate good samples, especially for high-resolution images (see for instance ﬁg. 2 in [7] which is one of the best models of highresolution images reported in the literature so far). In fact, as our experiments demonstrate the generated samples from these models are more similar to random images than to natural images! When MRF’s with gated interactions are applied to small image patches, they actually seem to work moderately well, as demonstrated by several authors [11, 12, 13]. The generated patches have some coherent and elongated structure and, like natural image patches, they are predominantly very smooth with sudden outbreaks of strong structure. This is unsurprising because these models have a built-in assumption that images are very smooth with occasional strong violations of smoothness [8, 14, 15]. However, the extension of these patch-based models to high-resolution images by replicating ﬁlters across the image has proven to be difﬁcult. The receptive ﬁelds that are learned no longer resemble Gabor wavelets but look random [6, 16] and the generated images lack any of the long range structure that is so typical of natural images [7]. The success of these methods in applications such as denoising is a poor measure of the quality of the generative model that has been learned: Setting the parameters to random values works almost as well for eliminating independent Gaussian noise [17], because this can be done quite well by just using a penalty for high-frequency variation. In this work, we show that the generative quality of these models can be drastically improved by jointly modelling both pixel mean intensities and pixel covariances. This can be achieved by using two sets of latent variables, one that gates pair-wise interactions between pixels and another one that sets the mean intensities of pixels, as we already proposed in some earlier work [4]. Here, we show that this modelling choice is crucial to make the gated MRF work well on high-resolution images. Finally, we show that the most widely used method of sharing weights in MRF’s for high-resolution images is overly constrained. Earlier work considered homogeneous MRF’s in which each potential is replicated at all image locations. This has the subtle effect of making learning very difﬁcult because of strong correlations at nearby sites. Following Gregor and LeCun [18] and also Tang and Eliasmith [19], we keep the number of parameters under control by using local potentials, but unlike Roth and Black [6] we only share weights between potentials that do not overlap. 2 Augmenting Gated MRF’s with Mean Hidden Units A Product of Student’s t (PoT) model [15] is a gated MRF deﬁned on small image patches that can be viewed as modelling image-speciﬁc, pair-wise relationships between pixel values by using the states of its latent variables. It is very good at representing the fact that two-pixel have very similar intensities and no good at all at modelling what these intensities are. Failure to model the mean also leads to impoverished modelling of the covariances when the input images have nonzero mean intensity. The covariance RBM (cRBM) [20] is another model that shares the same limitation since it only differs from PoT in the distribution of its latent variables: The posterior over the latent variables is a product of Bernoulli distributions instead of Gamma distributions as in PoT. We explain the fundamental limitation of these models by using a simple toy example: Modelling two-pixel images using a cRBM with only one binary hidden unit, see ﬁg. 1. This cRBM assumes that the conditional distribution over the input is a zero-mean Gaussian with a covariance that is determined by the state of the latent variable. Since the latent variable is binary, the cRBM can be viewed as a mixture of two zero-mean full covariance Gaussians. The latent variable uses the pairwise relationship between pixels to decide which of the two covariance matrices should be used to model each image. When the input data is pre-proessed by making each image have zero mean intensity (the empirical histogram is shown in the ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column), most images lie near the origin because most of the times nearby pixels are strongly correlated. Less frequently we encounter edge images that exhibit strong anti-correlation between the pixels, as shown by the long tails along the anti-diagonal line. A cRBM could model this data by using two Gaussians (ﬁrst row and second column): one that is spherical and tight at the origin for smooth images and another one that has a covariance elongated along the anti-diagonal for structured images. If, however, the whole set of images is normalized by subtracting from every pixel the mean value of all pixels over all images (second row and ﬁrst column), the cRBM fails at modelling structured images (second row and second column). It can ﬁt a Gaussian to the smooth images by discovering 2 Figure 1: In the ﬁrst row, each image is zero mean. In the second row, the whole set of data points is centered but each image can have non-zero mean. The ﬁrst column shows 8x8 images picked at random from natural images. The images in the second column are generated by a model that does not account for mean intensity. The images in the third column are generated by a model that has both “mean” and “covariance” hidden units. The contours in the ﬁrst column show the negative log of the empirical distribution of (tiny) natural two-pixel images (x-axis being the ﬁrst pixel and the y-axis the second pixel). The plots in the other columns are toy examples showing how each model could represent the empirical distribution using a mixture of Gaussians with components that have one of two possible covariances (corresponding to the state of a binary “covariance” latent variable). Models that can change the means of the Gaussians (mPoT and mcRBM) can represent better structured images (edge images lie along the anti-diagonal and are ﬁtted by the Gaussians shown in red) while the other models (PoT and cRBM) fail, overall when each image can have non-zero mean. the direction of strong correlation along the main diagonal, but it is very likely to fail to discover the direction of anti-correlation, which is crucial to represent discontinuities, because structured images with different mean intensity appear to be evenly spread over the whole input space. If the model has another set of latent variables that can change the means of the Gaussian distributions in the mixture (as explained more formally below and yielding the mPoT and mcRBM models), then the model can represent both changes of mean intensity and the correlational structure of pixels (see last column). The mean latent variables effectively subtract off the relevant mean from each data-point, letting the covariance latent variable capture the covariance structure of the data. As before, the covariance latent variable needs only to select between two covariance matrices. In fact, experiments on real 8x8 image patches conﬁrm these conjectures. Fig. 1 shows samples drawn from PoT and mPoT. mPoT (and similarly mcRBM [4]) is not only better at modelling zero mean images but it can also represent images that have non zero mean intensity well. We now describe mPoT, referring the reader to [4] for a detailed description of mcRBM. In PoT [9] the energy function is: E PoT (x, hc ) = i 1 [hc (1 + (Ci T x)2 ) + (1 − γ) log hc ] i i 2 (1) where x is a vectorized image patch, hc is a vector of Gamma “covariance” latent variables, C is a ﬁlter bank matrix and γ is a scalar parameter. The joint probability over input pixels and latent variables is proportional to exp(−E PoT (x, hc )). Therefore, the conditional distribution over the input pixels is a zero-mean Gaussian with covariance equal to: Σc = (Cdiag(hc )C T )−1 . (2) In order to make the mean of the conditional distribution non-zero, we deﬁne mPoT as the normalized product of the above zero-mean Gaussian that models the covariance and a spherical covariance Gaussian that models the mean. The overall energy function becomes: E mPoT (x, hc , hm ) = E PoT (x, hc ) + E m (x, hm ) 3 (3) Figure 2: Illustration of different choices of weight-sharing scheme for a RBM.

Best viewed in color. where hm is another set of latent variables that are assumed to be Bernoulli distributed (but other distributions could be used). The new energy term is: E m (x, hm ) = 1 T x x− 2 hm Wj T x j (4) j yielding the following conditional distribution over the input pixels: p(x|hc , hm ) = N (Σ(W hm ), Σ), Σ = (Σc + I)−1 (5) with Σc deﬁned in eq. 2. As desired, the conditional distribution has non-zero mean2 . Patch-based models like PoT have been extended to high-resolution images by using spatially localized ﬁlters [6]. While we can subtract off the mean intensity from independent image patches to successfully train PoT, we cannot do that on a high-resolution image because overlapping patches might have different mean. Unfortunately, replicating potentials over the image ignoring variations of mean intensity has been the leading strategy to date [6]3 . This is the major reason why generation of high-resolution images is so poor. Sec. 4 shows that generation can be drastically improved by explicitly accounting for variations of mean intensity, as performed by mPoT and mcRBM. 3 Weight-Sharing Schemes By integrating out the latent variables, we can write the density function of any gated MRF as a normalized product of potential functions (for mPoT refer to eq. 6). In this section we investigate different ways of constraining the parameters of the potentials of a generic MRF. Global: The obvious way to extend a patch-based model like PoT to high-resolution images is to deﬁne potentials over the whole image; we call this scheme global. This is not practical because 1) the number of parameters grows about quadratically with the size of the image making training too slow, 2) we do not need to model interactions between very distant pairs of pixels since their dependence is negligible, and 3) we would not be able to use the model on images of different size. Conv: The most popular way to handle big images is to deﬁne potentials on small subsets of variables (e.g., neighborhoods of size 5x5 pixels) and to replicate these potentials across space while 2 The need to model the means was clearly recognized in [21] but they used conjunctive latent features that simultaneously represented a contribution to the “precision matrix” in a speciﬁc direction and the mean along that same direction. 3 The success of PoT-like models in Bayesian denoising is not surprising since the noisy image effectively replaces the reconstruction term from the mean hidden units (see eq. 5), providing a set of noisy mean intensities that are cleaned up by the patterns of correlation enforced by the covariance latent variables. 4 sharing their parameters at each image location [23, 24, 6]. This yields a convolutional weightsharing scheme, also called homogeneous ﬁeld in the statistics literature. This choice is justiﬁed by the stationarity of natural images. This weight-sharing scheme is extremely concise in terms of number of parameters, but also rather inefﬁcient in terms of latent representation. First, if there are N ﬁlters at each location and these ﬁlters are stepped by one pixel then the internal representation is about N times overcomplete. The internal representation has not only high computational cost, but it is also highly redundant. Since the input is mostly smooth and the parameters are the same across space, the latent variables are strongly correlated as well. This inefﬁciency turns out to be particularly harmful for a model like PoT causing the learned ﬁlters to become “random” looking (see ﬁg 3-iii). A simple intuition follows from the equivalence between PoT and square ICA [15]. If the ﬁlter matrix C of eq. 1 is square and invertible, we can marginalize out the latent variables and write: p(y) = i S(yi ), where yi = Ci T x and S is a Student’s t distribution. In other words, there is an underlying assumption that ﬁlter outputs are independent. However, if the ﬁlters of matrix C are shifted and overlapping versions of each other, this clearly cannot be true. Training PoT with the Conv weight-sharing scheme forces the model to ﬁnd ﬁlters that make ﬁlter outputs as independent as possible, which explains the very high-frequency patterns that are usually discovered [6]. Local: The Global and Conv weight-sharing schemes are at the two extremes of a spectrum of possibilities. For instance, we can deﬁne potentials on a small subset of input variables but, unlike Conv, each potential can have its own set of parameters, as shown in ﬁg. 2-B. This is called local, or inhomogeneous ﬁeld. Compared to Conv the number of parameters increases only slightly but the number of latent variables required and their redundancy is greatly reduced. In fact, the model learns different receptive ﬁelds at different locations as a better strategy for representing the input, overall when the number of potentials is limited (see also ﬁg. 2-F). TConv: Local would not allow the model to be trained and tested on images of different resolution, and it might seem wasteful not to exploit the translation invariant property of images. We therefore advocate the use of a weight-sharing scheme that we call tiled-convolutional (TConv) shown in ﬁg. 2-C and E [18]. Each ﬁlter tiles the image without overlaps with copies of itself (i.e. the stride equals the ﬁlter diameter). This reduces spatial redundancy of latent variables and allows the input images to have arbitrary size. At the same time, different ﬁlters do overlap with each other in order to avoid tiling artifacts. Fig. 2-F shows ﬁlters that were (jointly) learned by a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [29] with Gaussian input variables using the TConv weight-sharing scheme. 4 Experiments We train gated MRF’s with and without mean hidden units using different weight-sharing schemes. The training procedure is very similar in all cases. We perform approximate maximum likelihood by using Fast Persistence Contrastive Divergence (FPCD) [25] and we draw samples by using Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) [26]. Since all latent variables can be exactly marginalized out we can use HMC on the free energy (negative logarithm of the marginal distribution over the input pixels). For mPoT this is: F mPoT (x) = − log(p(x))+const. = k,i 1 1 γ log(1+ (Cik T xk )2 )+ xT x− 2 2 T log(1+exp(Wjk xk )) (6) k,j where the index k runs over spatial locations and xk is the k-th image patch. FPCD keeps samples, called negative particles, that it uses to represent the model distribution. These particles are all updated after each weight update. For each mini-batch of data-points a) we compute the derivative of the free energy w.r.t. the training samples, b) we update the negative particles by running HMC for one HMC step consisting of 20 leapfrog steps. We start at the previous set of negative particles and use as parameters the sum of the regular parameters and a small perturbation vector, c) we compute the derivative of the free energy at the negative particles, and d) we update the regular parameters by using the difference of gradients between step a) and c) while the perturbation vector is updated using the gradient from c) only. The perturbation is also strongly decayed to zero and is subject to a larger learning rate. The aim is to encourage the negative particles to explore the space more quickly by slightly and temporarily raising the energy at their current position. Note that the use of FPCD as opposed to other estimation methods (like Persistent Contrastive Divergence [27]) turns out to be crucial to achieve good mixing of the sampler even after training. We train on mini-batches of 32 samples using gray-scale images of approximate size 160x160 pixels randomly cropped from the Berkeley segmentation dataset [28]. We perform 160,000 weight updates decreasing the learning by a factor of 4 by the end of training. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 for the covariance 5 Figure 3: 160x160 samples drawn by A) mPoT-TConv, B) mHPoT-TConv, C) mcRBM-TConv and D) PoTTConv.

During training we condition on the borders and initialize the negative particles at zero in order to avoid artifacts at the border of the image. We learn 8x8 ﬁlters and pre-multiply the covariance ﬁlters by a whitening transform retaining 99% of the variance; we also normalize the norm of the covariance ﬁlters to prevent some of them from decaying to zero during training4 . Whenever we use the TConv weight-sharing scheme the model learns covariance ﬁlters that mostly resemble localized and oriented Gabor functions (see ﬁg. 3-i and iv), while the Conv weight-sharing scheme learns structured but poorly localized high-frequency patterns (see ﬁg. 3-iii) [6]. The TConv models re-use the same 8x8 ﬁlters every 8 pixels and apply a diagonal offset of 2 pixels between neighboring ﬁlters with different weights in order to reduce tiling artifacts. There are 4 sets of ﬁlters, each with 64 ﬁlters for a total of 256 covariance ﬁlters (see bottom plot of ﬁg. 3). Similarly, we have 4 sets of mean ﬁlters, each with 32 ﬁlters. These ﬁlters have usually non-zero mean and exhibit on-center off-surround and off-center on-surround patterns, see ﬁg. 3-ii. In order to draw samples from the learned models, we run HMC for a long time (10,000 iterations, each composed of 20 leap-frog steps). Some samples of size 160x160 pixels are reported in ﬁg. 3 A)D). Without modelling the mean intensity, samples lack structure and do not seem much different from those that would be generated by a simple Gaussian model merely ﬁtting the second order statistics (see ﬁg. 3 in [1] and also ﬁg. 2 in [7]). By contrast, structure, sharp boundaries and some simple texture emerge only from models that have mean latent variables, namely mcRBM, mPoT and mHPoT which differs from mPoT by having a second layer pooling matrix on the squared covariance ﬁlter outputs [11]. A more quantitative comparison is reported in table 1. We ﬁrst compute marginal statistics of ﬁlter responses using the generated images, natural images from the test set, and random images. The statistics are the normalized histogram of individual ﬁlter responses to 24 Gabor ﬁlters (8 orientations and 3 scales). We then calculate the KL divergence between the histograms on random images and generated images and the KL divergence between the histograms on natural images and generated images. The table also reports the average difference of energies between random images and natural images.

To understand how the different weight sharing schemes affect recognition performance we have done preliminary tests using the discriminative performance of a simpler model on simpler data. We consider one of the simplest and most versatile models, namely the RBM [29]. Since we also aim to test the Global weight-sharing scheme we are constrained to using fairly low resolution datasets such as the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits [30] and the CIFAR 10 dataset of generic object categories [22]. The MNIST dataset has soft binary images of size 28x28 pixels, while the CIFAR 10 dataset has color images of size 32x32 pixels. CIFAR 10 has 10 classes, 5000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. MNIST also has 10 classes with, on average, 6000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. The energy function of the RBM trained on the CIFAR 10 dataset, modelling input pixels with 3 (R,G,B) Gaussian variables [31], is exactly the one shown in eq. 4; while the RBM trained on MNIST uses logistic units for the pixels and the energy function is again the same as before but without any quadratic term. All models are trained in an unsupervised way to approximately maximize the likelihood in the training set using Contrastive Divergence [32]. They are then used to represent each input image with a feature vector (mean of the posterior over the latent variables) which is fed to a multinomial logistic classiﬁer for discrimination. Models are compared in terms of: 1) recognition accuracy, 2) convergence time and 3) dimensionality of the representation. In general, assuming ﬁlters much smaller than the input image and assuming equal number of latent variables, Conv, TConv and Local models process each sample faster than Global by a factor approximately equal to the ratio between the area of the image and the area of the ﬁlters, which can be very large in practice. In the ﬁrst set of experiments reported on the left of ﬁg. 4 we study the internal representation in terms of discrimination and dimensionality using the MNIST dataset. For each choice of dimensionality all models are trained using the same number of operations. This is set to the amount necessary to complete one epoch over the training set using the Global model. This experiment shows that: 1) Local outperforms all other weight-sharing schemes for a wide range of dimensionalities, 2) TConv does not perform as well as Local probably because the translation invariant assumption is clearly violated for these relatively small, centered, images, 3) Conv performs well only when the internal representation is very high dimensional (10 times overcomplete) otherwise it severely underﬁts, 4) Global performs well when the representation is compact but its performance degrades rapidly as this increases because it needs more than the allotted training time. The right hand side of ﬁg. 4 shows how the recognition performance evolves as we increase the number of operations (or training time) using models that produce a twice overcomplete internal representation. With only very few ﬁlters Conv still underﬁts and it does not improve its performance by training for longer, but Global does improve and eventually it reaches the performance of Local. If we look at the crossing of the error rate at 2% we can see that Local is about 4 times faster than Global. To summarize, Local provides more compact representations than Conv, is much faster than Global while achieving 7 6 2.4 error rate % 5 error rate % 2.6 Global Local TConv Conv 4 3 2 1 0 2.2 Global Local 2 Conv 1.8 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 dimensionality 6000 7000 1.6 0 8000 2 4 6 8 # flops (relative to # flops per epoch of Global model) 10 Figure 4: Experiments on MNIST using RBM’s with different weight-sharing schemes. Left: Error rate as a function of the dimensionality of the latent representation. Right: Error rate as a function of the number of operations (normalized to those needed to perform one epoch in the Global model); all models have a twice overcomplete latent representation. similar performance in discrimination. Also, Local can easily scale to larger images while Global cannot. Similar experiments are performed using the CIFAR 10 dataset [22] of natural images. Using the same protocol introduced in earlier work by Krizhevsky [22], the RBM’s are trained in an unsupervised way on a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset [33] and then “ﬁne-tuned” on the CIFAR 10 dataset by supervised back-propagation of the error through the linear classiﬁer and feature extractor. All models produce an approximately 10,000 dimensional internal representation to make a fair comparison. Models using local ﬁlters learn 16x16 ﬁlters that are stepped every pixel. Again, we do not experiment with the TConv weight-sharing scheme because the image is not large enough to allow enough replicas. Similarly to ﬁg. 3-iii the Conv weight-sharing scheme was very difﬁcult to train and did not produce Gabor-like features. Indeed, careful injection of sparsity and long training time seem necessary [31] for these RBM’s. By contrast, both Local and Global produce Gabor-like ﬁlters similar to those shown in ﬁg. 2 F). The model trained with Conv weight-sharing scheme yields an accuracy equal to 56.6%, while Local and Global yield much better performance, 63.6% and 64.8% [22], respectively. Although Local and Global have similar performance, training with the Local weight-sharing scheme took under an hour while using the Global weight-sharing scheme required more than a day. 5 Conclusions and Future Work This work is motivated by the poor generative quality of currently popular MRF models of natural images. These models generate images that are actually more similar to white noise than to natural images. Our contribution is to recognize that current models can beneﬁt from 1) the addition of a simple model of the mean intensities and from 2) the use of a less constrained weight-sharing scheme. By augmenting these models with an extra set of latent variables that model mean intensity we can generate samples that look much more realistic: they are characterized by smooth regions, sharp boundaries and some simple high frequency texture. We validate our approach by comparing the statistics of ﬁlter outputs on natural images and generated images. In the future, we plan to integrate these MRF’s into deeper hierarchical models and to use their internal representation to perform object recognition in high-resolution images. The hope is to further improve generation by capturing longer range dependencies and to exploit this to better cope with missing values and ambiguous sensory inputs. References [1] E.P. Simoncelli.

<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.58599067 <a title="224-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_Inference_by_Compilation_to_Arithmetic_Circuits.html">32 nips-2010-Approximate Inference by Compilation to Arithmetic Circuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Lowd, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Arithmetic circuits (ACs) exploit context-speciﬁc independence and determinism to allow exact inference even in networks with high treewidth. In this paper, we introduce the ﬁrst ever approximate inference methods using ACs, for domains where exact inference remains intractable. We propose and evaluate a variety of techniques based on exact compilation, forward sampling, AC structure learning, Markov network parameter learning, variational inference, and Gibbs sampling. In experiments on eight challenging real-world domains, we ﬁnd that the methods based on sampling and learning work best: one such method (AC2 -F) is faster and usually more accurate than loopy belief propagation, mean ﬁeld, and Gibbs sampling; another (AC2 -G) has a running time similar to Gibbs sampling but is consistently more accurate than all baselines. 1</p><p>6 0.57019174 <a title="224-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exact_inference_and_learning_for_cumulative_distribution_functions_on_loopy_graphs.html">84 nips-2010-Exact inference and learning for cumulative distribution functions on loopy graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziv Bar-joseph, Hai-son P. Le</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies compare gene expression data across species to identify core and species speciﬁc genes in biological systems. To perform such comparisons researchers need to match genes across species. This is a challenging task since the correct matches (orthologs) are not known for most genes. Previous work in this area used deterministic matchings or reduced multidimensional expression data to binary representation. Here we develop a new method that can utilize soft matches (given as priors) to infer both, unique and similar expression patterns across species and a matching for the genes in both species. Our method uses a Dirichlet process mixture model which includes a latent data matching variable. We present learning and inference algorithms based on variational methods for this model. Applying our method to immune response data we show that it can accurately identify common and unique response patterns by improving the matchings between human and mouse genes. 1</p><p>2 0.90089279 <a title="224-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Policy_Priors_for_Reinforcement_Learning.html">184 nips-2010-Nonparametric Bayesian Policy Priors for Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Diederik P. Kingma, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Score Matching is a recently-proposed criterion for training high-dimensional density models for which maximum likelihood training is intractable. It has been applied to learning natural image statistics but has so-far been limited to simple models due to the difﬁculty of differentiating the loss with respect to the model parameters. We show how this differentiation can be automated with an extended version of the double-backpropagation algorithm. In addition, we introduce a regularization term for the Score Matching loss that enables its use for a broader range of problem by suppressing instabilities that occur with ﬁnite training sample sizes and quantized input values. Results are reported for image denoising and super-resolution.</p><p>4 0.84663016 <a title="224-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Group_Sparse_Coding_with_a_Laplacian_Scale_Mixture_Prior.html">109 nips-2010-Group Sparse Coding with a Laplacian Scale Mixture Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a class of sparse coding models that utilizes a Laplacian Scale Mixture (LSM) prior to model dependencies among coefﬁcients. Each coefﬁcient is modeled as a Laplacian distribution with a variable scale parameter, with a Gamma distribution prior over the scale parameter. We show that, due to the conjugacy of the Gamma prior, it is possible to derive efﬁcient inference procedures for both the coefﬁcients and the scale parameter. When the scale parameters of a group of coefﬁcients are combined into a single variable, it is possible to describe the dependencies that occur due to common amplitude ﬂuctuations among coefﬁcients, which have been shown to constitute a large fraction of the redundancy in natural images [1]. We show that, as a consequence of this group sparse coding, the resulting inference of the coefﬁcients follows a divisive normalization rule, and that this may be efﬁciently implemented in a network architecture similar to that which has been proposed to occur in primary visual cortex. We also demonstrate improvements in image coding and compressive sensing recovery using the LSM model. 1</p><p>5 0.84347469 <a title="224-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Sidestepping_Intractable_Inference_with_Structured_Ensemble_Cascades.html">239 nips-2010-Sidestepping Intractable Inference with Structured Ensemble Cascades</a></p>
<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: For many structured prediction problems, complex models often require adopting approximate inference techniques such as variational methods or sampling, which generally provide no satisfactory accuracy guarantees. In this work, we propose sidestepping intractable inference altogether by learning ensembles of tractable sub-models as part of a structured prediction cascade. We focus in particular on problems with high-treewidth and large state-spaces, which occur in many computer vision tasks. Unlike other variational methods, our ensembles do not enforce agreement between sub-models, but ﬁlter the space of possible outputs by simply adding and thresholding the max-marginals of each constituent model. Our framework jointly estimates parameters for all models in the ensemble for each level of the cascade by minimizing a novel, convex loss function, yet requires only a linear increase in computation over learning or inference in a single tractable sub-model. We provide a generalization bound on the ﬁltering loss of the ensemble as a theoretical justiﬁcation of our approach, and we evaluate our method on both synthetic data and the task of estimating articulated human pose from challenging videos. We ﬁnd that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms loopy belief propagation on the synthetic data and a state-of-the-art model on the pose estimation/tracking problem. 1</p><p>6 0.84345269 <a title="224-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Generating_more_realistic_images_using_gated_MRF%27s.html">103 nips-2010-Generating more realistic images using gated MRF's</a></p>

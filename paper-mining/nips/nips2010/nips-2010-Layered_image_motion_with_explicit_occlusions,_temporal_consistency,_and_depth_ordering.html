</p><p>5 The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Middlebury benchmark and produces meaningful scene segmentations as well as detected occlusion regions. [sent-11, score-0.316]
</p><p>6 Splitting the scene into layers enables the motion in each layer to be deﬁned more simply, and the estimation of motion boundaries to be separated from the problem of smooth ﬂow estimation. [sent-13, score-1.204]
</p><p>7 In practice, however, none of the current top performing optical ﬂow methods use a layered approach [2]. [sent-15, score-0.476]
</p><p>8 This paper formulates a new probabilistic, layered motion model that addresses the key problems of previous layered approaches. [sent-17, score-0.873]
</p><p>9 Note that the assumption of temporal layer consistency is much more realistic than previous assumptions of temporal motion consistency [4]; while the scene motion can change rapidly, scene structure persists. [sent-27, score-1.088]
</p><p>10 1  One of the main motivations for layered models is that, conditioned on the segmentation into layers, each layer can employ afﬁne, planar, or other strong models of optical ﬂow. [sent-28, score-0.917]
</p><p>11 Instead one can model the ﬂow within each layer as smoothly varying [26]. [sent-31, score-0.34]
</p><p>12 This roughness in layers model, which is similar in spirit to work on plane+parallax [10, 14, 19], encourages smooth ﬂow within layers but allows signiﬁcant local deviations. [sent-34, score-0.614]
</p><p>13 Because layers are temporally persistent, it is also possible to reason about their relative depth ordering. [sent-35, score-0.326]
</p><p>14 This also allows explicit reasoning about occlusions, which our model predicts at locations where the layer segmentations for consecutive frames disagree. [sent-38, score-0.49]
</p><p>15 Many previous layered approaches are not truly “layered”: while they segment the image into multiple regions with distinct motions, they do not model what is in front of what. [sent-39, score-0.391]
</p><p>16 In contrast, building on recent state-of-the-art results in static scene segmentation [21], our model determines layer support via an ordered sequence of occluding binary masks. [sent-41, score-0.569]
</p><p>17 Moreover, the continuous layer support functions play a key role in accurately modeling temporal layer consistency. [sent-44, score-0.762]
</p><p>18 The resulting model produces accurate layer segmentations that improve ﬂow accuracy at occlusion boundaries, and recover meaningful scene structure. [sent-45, score-0.627]
</p><p>19 By combining recent advances in dense ﬂow estimation and natural image segmentation, we develop an algorithm that simultaneously estimates accurate ﬂow ﬁelds, detects occlusions and disocclusions, and recovers the layered structure of realistic scenes. [sent-47, score-0.493]
</p><p>20 2 Previous Work Layered approaches to motion estimation have long been seen as elegant and promising, since spatial smoothness is separated from the modeling of discontinuities and occlusions. [sent-48, score-0.33]
</p><p>21 Wang and Adelson [25] clearly motivate layered models of image sequences, while Jepson and Black [11] formalize the problem using probabilistic mixture models. [sent-50, score-0.391]
</p><p>22 Early methods, which use simple parametric models of image motion within layers, are not highly accurate. [sent-52, score-0.309]
</p><p>23 Observing that rigid parametric models are too restrictive for real scenes, Weiss [26] uses a more ﬂexible Gaussian process to describe the motion within each layer. [sent-53, score-0.306]
</p><p>24 Allocating a separate layer for every small surface discontinuity is impractical and fails to capture important global scene structure. [sent-55, score-0.416]
</p><p>25 Our approach, which allows “roughness” within layers rather than “smoothness,” provides a compromise that captures coarse scene structure as well as ﬁne within-layer details. [sent-56, score-0.361]
</p><p>26 One key advantage of layered models is their ability to realistically model occlusion boundaries. [sent-57, score-0.507]
</p><p>27 Performing inference over the combinatorial range of possible occlusion relationships is challenging and, consequently, only a few layered ﬂow models explicitly encode relative depth [12, 30]. [sent-59, score-0.552]
</p><p>28 Recent work revisits the layered model to handle occlusions [9], but does not explicitly model the layer ordering or achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Middlebury benchmark. [sent-60, score-0.804]
</p><p>29 While most current optical ﬂow methods are “two-frame,” layered methods naturally extend to longer sequences [12, 29, 30]. [sent-61, score-0.502]
</p><p>30 Weiss and Adelson [27] introduce spatial coherence to these layer assignments using a spatial MRF 2  gtk  gt+1,k K−1  s t+1,k  s tk K  K  utk I t+1  It v tk K  Figure 1: Left: Graphical representation for the proposed layered model. [sent-63, score-1.588]
</p><p>31 The g and s images illustrate the reasoning about layer ownership (see text). [sent-67, score-0.38]
</p><p>32 The composite ﬂow ﬁeld (u, v) and layer labels (k) are also shown. [sent-68, score-0.34]
</p><p>33 Adapting recent work on static image segmentation by Sudderth and Jordan [21], we instead generate spatially coherent, ordered layers by thresholding a series of random continuous functions. [sent-71, score-0.467]
</p><p>34 For motion estimation there are additional advantages: it allows accurate reasoning about occlusion relationships and modeling of temporal layer consistency. [sent-73, score-0.825]
</p><p>35 3 A Layered Motion Model Building on this long sequence of prior work, our generative model of layered image motion is summarized in Figure 1. [sent-74, score-0.628]
</p><p>36 Below we describe how the generative model captures piecewise smooth deviation of the layer motion from parametric models (Sec. [sent-75, score-0.709]
</p><p>37 1 Roughness in Layers Our approach is inspired by Weiss’s model of smoothness in layers [26]. [sent-83, score-0.306]
</p><p>38 Let utk and vtk denote the horizontal and vertical ﬂow ﬁelds, respectively, for layer k at time t. [sent-85, score-0.676]
</p><p>39 The corresponding ﬂow ij vector for pixel (i, j) is then denoted by (uij , vtk ). [sent-86, score-0.316]
</p><p>40 tk tk  (1)  (i,j) (i′ ,j ′ )∈Γ(i,j)  Here, Γ(i, j) is the set of neighbors of pixel (i, j), often its four nearest neighbors. [sent-89, score-0.409]
</p><p>41 In contrast, real scenes exhibit coherent motion over large scales, due to the motion of (partially) rigid objects in the world. [sent-94, score-0.532]
</p><p>42 To capture this, we associate an afﬁne (or planar) motion model, with parameters θtk , to each layer k. [sent-95, score-0.551]
</p><p>43 We then use an MRF to allow piecewise smooth deformations from the globally rigid assumptions of afﬁne motion: Eaff (utk , θtk ) =  1 2  ′ ′  ′ ′  ¯θtk ¯θ j ρs (uij − uij ) − (ui j − ui tk ) . [sent-96, score-0.455]
</p><p>44 tk tk (i,j)  (i′ ,j ′ )∈Γ(i,j)  3  (2)  Here, uij denotes the horizontal motion predicted for pixel (i, j) by an afﬁne model with pa¯θtk rameters θtk . [sent-97, score-0.75]
</p><p>45 Unlike classical models that assume layers are globally well ﬁt by a single afﬁne motion [6, 25], this prior allows signiﬁcant, locally smooth deviations from rigidity. [sent-98, score-0.511]
</p><p>46 2 Layer Support and Spatial Contiguity The support for whether or not a pixel belongs to a given layer k is deﬁned using a hidden random ﬁeld gk . [sent-103, score-0.456]
</p><p>47 We associate each of the ﬁrst K − 1 layers at time t with a random continuous function gtk , deﬁned over the same domain as the image. [sent-104, score-0.538]
</p><p>48 We assume a single, unique layer is observable at each location and that the observed motion of that pixel is determined by its assigned layer. [sent-106, score-0.604]
</p><p>49 Analogous to level set representations, the discrete support of each layer is determined by thresholding gtk : pixel (i, j) is considered visible when gtk (i, j) ≥ 0. [sent-107, score-0.982]
</p><p>50 Let stk (i, j) equal one if layer k is visible at pixel (i, j), and zero otherwise; note that k stk (i, j) = 1. [sent-108, score-0.757]
</p><p>51 For pixels (i, j) for which gtk (i, j) < 0, we necessarily have stk (i, j) = 0. [sent-109, score-0.486]
</p><p>52 We deﬁne the layers to be ordered with respect to the camera, so that layer k occludes layers k ′ > k. [sent-110, score-0.856]
</p><p>53 ij Given the full set of support functions gtk , the unique layer kt∗ for which stkij (i, j) = 1 is then t∗  ij kt∗  = min ({k | 1 ≤ k ≤ K − 1, gtk (i, j) ≥ 0} ∪ {K}) . [sent-111, score-1.035]
</p><p>54 (3)  Note that layer K is essentially a background layer that captures all pixels not assigned to the ﬁrst K − 1 layers. [sent-112, score-0.731]
</p><p>55 For this reason, only K − 1 hidden ﬁelds gtk are needed (see Figure 1). [sent-113, score-0.314]
</p><p>56 Our use of thresholded, random continuous functions to deﬁne layer support is partially motivated by known shortcomings of discrete Ising/Potts MRF models for image partitions [15]. [sent-114, score-0.429]
</p><p>57 They also provide a convenient framework for modeling the temporal and spatial coherence observed in real motion sequences. [sent-115, score-0.35]
</p><p>58 Spatial coherence is captured via a Gaussian conditional random ﬁeld in which edge weights are modulated by local differences in Lab color vectors, Ic (i, j): t Espace (gtk ) =  1 2  ij wi′ j ′ (gtk (i, j) − gtk (i′ , j ′ ))2 , (i,j)  ij wi′ j ′ = max  (4)  1 ||Ic (i, j) − Ic (i′ , j ′ )||2 , δc . [sent-116, score-0.453]
</p><p>59 Temporal coherence of surfaces is then encouraged via a corresponding Gaussian MRF: ij (gtk (i, j) − gt+1,k (i + uij , j + vtk ))2 . [sent-118, score-0.436]
</p><p>60 tk  Etime (gtk , gt+1,k , utk , vtk ) =  (6)  (i,j)  Critically, this energy function uses the corresponding ﬂow ﬁeld to non-rigidly align the layers at subsequent frames. [sent-119, score-0.813]
</p><p>61 By allowing smooth deformation of the support functions gtk , we allow layer support to evolve over time, as opposed to transforming a single rigid template [12]. [sent-120, score-0.807]
</p><p>62 Our model of layer coherence is inspired by a recent method for image segmentation, based on spatially dependent Pitman-Yor processes [21]. [sent-121, score-0.468]
</p><p>63 That work makes connections between layered occlusion processes and stick breaking representations of nonparametric Bayesian models. [sent-122, score-0.484]
</p><p>64 By assigning appropriate stochastic priors to layer thresholds, the Pitman-Yor model captures the power law statistics of natural scene partitions and infers an appropriate number of segments for each image. [sent-123, score-0.443]
</p><p>65 3 Depth Ordering and Occlusion Reasoning The preceding generative process deﬁnes a set of K ordered layers, with corresponding ﬂow ﬁelds utk , vtk and segmentation masks stk . [sent-127, score-0.674]
</p><p>66 Recall that the layer assignment masks s are a 4  deterministic function (threshold) of the underlying continuous layer support functions g (see Eq. [sent-128, score-0.764]
</p><p>67 To consistently reason about occlusions, we examine the layer assignments stk (i, j) and ij st+1,k (i + uij , j + vtk ) at locations corresponded by the underlying ﬂow ﬁelds. [sent-130, score-0.941]
</p><p>68 This leads to a far tk richer occlusion model than standard spatially independent outlier processes: geometric consistency is enforced via the layered sequence of ﬂow ﬁelds. [sent-131, score-0.721]
</p><p>69 If ij stk (i, j) = st+1,k (i + uij , j + vtk ) = 1, the visible layer for pixel (i, j) at time t remains unoctk cluded at time t + 1, and the image observations are modeled using a standard brightness (or, here, feature) constancy assumption. [sent-133, score-1.028]
</p><p>70 With algebraic simpliﬁcations, the data error term can be written as Edata (ut , vt , gt , gt+1 ) = ij ij ρd (Is (i, j) − Is (i + uij , j + vtk )) − λd stk (i, j)st+1,k (i + uij , j + vtk ) (7) t t+1 tk tk k (i,j)  up to an additive, constant multiple of λd . [sent-136, score-1.45]
</p><p>71 Note that occlusions have higher likelihood only for sufﬁciently large discrepancies in matched image features and can only occur via a corresponding change in layer visibility. [sent-138, score-0.474]
</p><p>72 Simultaneously inferring ﬂow ﬁelds, layer support maps, and depth ordering is a challenging process; our approach is summarized below. [sent-142, score-0.496]
</p><p>73 (3), this induces the following soft layer assignments: stk (i, j) = ˜  σ(λe gtk (i, j)) K−1 k′ =1  k−1 k′ =1  σ(−λe gtk′ (i, j)),  σ(−λe gtk′ (i, j)), 5  1 ≤ k < K, k = K. [sent-151, score-0.825]
</p><p>74 The two background layers move faster than the two foreground layers, and the solution with the correct depth ordering has lower energy and smaller error. [sent-153, score-0.426]
</p><p>75 Note that σ(−g) = 1 − σ(g), and  K ˜ k=1 stk (i, j)  = 1 for any gtk and constant λe > 0. [sent-163, score-0.462]
</p><p>76 Substituting these soft assignments stk (i, j) for stk (i, j) in Eq. [sent-164, score-0.413]
</p><p>77 We would ideally like to compare layer initializations based on all permutations of the initial ﬂow vector clusters, but this would be computationally intensive for large K. [sent-181, score-0.34]
</p><p>78 1 Results on the Middlebury Benchmark Training Set As a baseline, we implement the smoothness in layers model [26] using modern techniques, and obtain an average training end-point error (EPE) of 0. [sent-189, score-0.306]
</p><p>79 It thus performs worse than the Classic+NL initialization; the performance improvements allowed by additional layers demonstrate the beneﬁts of a layered model. [sent-322, score-0.589]
</p><p>80 Accuracy is improved by applying a 15 × 15 weighted median ﬁlter (WMF) [22] to the ﬂow ﬁelds of each layer during the iterative warping step (EPE for 1 to 4 layers: 0. [sent-323, score-0.34]
</p><p>81 The “correct” number of layers for a real scene is not well deﬁned (consider the “Grove3” sequence, for example). [sent-329, score-0.334]
</p><p>82 We use a restricted number of layers, and model the remaining complexity of the ﬂow within each layer via the roughness-in-layers spatial term and the WMF. [sent-330, score-0.383]
</p><p>83 As the number of layers increases, the complexity of the ﬂow within each layer decreases, and consequently the need for WMF also decreases; note that the difference in EPE for the 4-layer model with and without WMF is insigniﬁcant. [sent-331, score-0.598]
</p><p>84 While the one-layer method gets stuck in poor local minima on the “Grove3” and “Urban3” sequences, models with additional layers are more robust to the initialization. [sent-339, score-0.301]
</p><p>85 The layered model is particularly accurate at motion boundaries, probably due to the use of layer-speciﬁc motion models, and the explicit modeling of occlusion in Edata (Eq. [sent-347, score-0.906]
</p><p>86 Notice that the layered model produces a motion segmentation that captures the major structure of the scene, and the layer boundaries correspond well to static image edges. [sent-351, score-1.131]
</p><p>87 It detects most occlusion regions and interpolates their motion reasonably well. [sent-352, score-0.394]
</p><p>88 Several sequences show signiﬁcant improvement due to the global reasoning provided by the layered model. [sent-353, score-0.397]
</p><p>89 As the branch moves beyond the image boundary, the layered model interpolates its motion using long-range correlation with the branches in the center. [sent-356, score-0.664]
</p><p>90 The “Schefﬂera” result illustrates how the layered method can separate foreground objects from the background (e. [sent-358, score-0.331]
</p><p>91 Left to right: First image frame, initial ﬂow ﬁeld from “Classic+NL”, ﬁnal ﬂow ﬁeld, motion segmentation (green front, blue middle, red back), and detected occlusions. [sent-363, score-0.372]
</p><p>92 6 Conclusion and Discussion We have described a new probabilistic formulation for layered image motion that explicitly models occlusion and disocclusion, depth ordering of layers, and the temporal consistency of the layer segmentation. [sent-365, score-1.309]
</p><p>93 The approach allows the ﬂow ﬁeld in each layer to have piecewise smooth deformation from a parametric motion model. [sent-366, score-0.686]
</p><p>94 Layer support is modeled using an image-dependent hidden ﬁeld prior that supports a model of temporal layer continuity over time. [sent-367, score-0.456]
</p><p>95 The image data error term takes into account layer occlusion relationships, resulting in increased ﬂow accuracy near motion boundaries. [sent-368, score-0.764]
</p><p>96 Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Middlebury optical ﬂow benchmark while producing meaningful segmentation and occlusion detection results. [sent-369, score-0.428]
</p><p>97 Future work will address better inference methods, especially a better scheme to infer the layer order, and the automatic estimation of the number of layers. [sent-370, score-0.368]
</p><p>98 Currently our method does not capture transparency, but this could be supported using a soft layer assignment and a different generative model. [sent-372, score-0.415]

For image motion estimation, such models have a long history but have not achieved the wide use or accuracy of non-layered methods. We present a new probabilistic model of optical ﬂow in layers that addresses many of the shortcomings of previous approaches. In particular, we deﬁne a probabilistic graphical model that explicitly captures: 1) occlusions and disocclusions; 2) depth ordering of the layers; 3) temporal consistency of the layer segmentation. Additionally the optical ﬂow in each layer is modeled by a combination of a parametric model and a smooth deviation based on an MRF with a robust spatial prior; the resulting model allows roughness in layers. Finally, a key contribution is the formulation of the layers using an imagedependent hidden ﬁeld prior based on recent models for static scene segmentation.

<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>4 0.19369505 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Network_Flow_Algorithms_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">181 nips-2010-Network Flow Algorithms for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis R. Bach, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems that involve a structured sparsityinducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas a lot of effort has been put in developing fast optimization methods when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a speciﬁc hierarchical structure, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is related to network ﬂow optimization. More precisely, the proximal problem associated with the norm we consider is dual to a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem. We propose an efﬁcient procedure which computes its solution exactly in polynomial time. Our algorithm scales up to millions of variables, and opens up a whole new range of applications for structured sparse models. We present several experiments on image and video data, demonstrating the applicability and scalability of our approach for various problems. 1</p><p>5 0.17819068 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Functional_form_of_motion_priors_in_human_motion_perception.html">98 nips-2010-Functional form of motion priors in human motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Tungyou Lin, Alan Lee, Luminita Vese, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>6 0.15073998 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>

<p>Author: J. Z. Kolter, Siddharth Batra, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Energy disaggregation is the task of taking a whole-home energy signal and separating it into its component appliances. Studies have shown that having devicelevel energy information can cause users to conserve signiﬁcant amounts of energy, but current electricity meters only report whole-home data. Thus, developing algorithmic methods for disaggregation presents a key technical challenge in the effort to maximize energy conservation. In this paper, we examine a large scale energy disaggregation task, and apply a novel extension of sparse coding to this problem. In particular, we develop a method, based upon structured prediction, for discriminatively training sparse coding algorithms speciﬁcally to maximize disaggregation performance. We show that this signiﬁcantly improves the performance of sparse coding algorithms on the energy task and illustrate how these disaggregation results can provide useful information about energy usage. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88836902 <a title="141-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Layered_image_motion_with_explicit_occlusions%2C_temporal_consistency%2C_and_depth_ordering.html">141 nips-2010-Layered image motion with explicit occlusions, temporal consistency, and depth ordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Volodymyr Mnih, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of natural images are usually evaluated by measuring performance on rather indirect tasks, such as denoising and inpainting. A more direct way to evaluate a generative model is to draw samples from it and to check whether statistical properties of the samples match the statistics of natural images. This method is seldom used with high-resolution images, because current models produce samples that are very different from natural images, as assessed by even simple visual inspection. We investigate the reasons for this failure and we show that by augmenting existing models so that there are two sets of latent variables, one set modelling pixel intensities and the other set modelling image-speciﬁc pixel covariances, we are able to generate high-resolution images that look much more realistic than before. The overall model can be interpreted as a gated MRF where both pair-wise dependencies and mean intensities of pixels are modulated by the states of latent variables. Finally, we conﬁrm that if we disallow weight-sharing between receptive ﬁelds that overlap each other, the gated MRF learns more efﬁcient internal representations, as demonstrated in several recognition tasks. 1 Introduction and Prior Work The study of the statistical properties of natural images has a long history and has inﬂuenced many ﬁelds, from image processing to computational neuroscience [1]. In this work we focus on probabilistic models of natural images. These models are useful for extracting representations [2, 3, 4] that can be used for discriminative tasks and they can also provide adaptive priors [5, 6, 7] that can be used in applications like denoising and inpainting. Our main focus, however, will be on improving the quality of the generative model, rather than exploring its possible applications. Markov Random Fields (MRF’s) provide a very general framework for modelling natural images. In an MRF, an image is assigned a probability which is a normalized product of potential functions, with each function typically being deﬁned over a subset of the observed variables. In this work we consider a very versatile class of MRF’s in which potential functions are deﬁned over both pixels and latent variables, thus allowing the states of the latent variables to modulate or gate the effective interactions between the pixels. This type of MRF, that we dub gated MRF, was proposed as an image model by Geman and Geman [8]. Welling et al. [9] showed how an MRF in this family1 could be learned for small image patches and their work was extended to high-resolution images by Roth and Black [6] who also demonstrated its success in some practical applications [7]. Besides their practical use, these models were speciﬁcally designed to match the statistical properties of natural images, and therefore, it seems natural to evaluate them in those terms. Indeed, several authors [10, 7] have proposed that these models should be evaluated by generating images and 1 Product of Student’s t models (without pooling) may not appear to have latent variables but each potential can be viewed as an inﬁnite mixture of zero-mean Gaussians where the inverse variance of the Gaussian is the latent variable. 1 checking whether the samples match the statistical properties observed in natural images. It is, therefore, very troublesome that none of the existing models can generate good samples, especially for high-resolution images (see for instance ﬁg. 2 in [7] which is one of the best models of highresolution images reported in the literature so far). In fact, as our experiments demonstrate the generated samples from these models are more similar to random images than to natural images! When MRF’s with gated interactions are applied to small image patches, they actually seem to work moderately well, as demonstrated by several authors [11, 12, 13]. The generated patches have some coherent and elongated structure and, like natural image patches, they are predominantly very smooth with sudden outbreaks of strong structure. This is unsurprising because these models have a built-in assumption that images are very smooth with occasional strong violations of smoothness [8, 14, 15]. However, the extension of these patch-based models to high-resolution images by replicating ﬁlters across the image has proven to be difﬁcult. The receptive ﬁelds that are learned no longer resemble Gabor wavelets but look random [6, 16] and the generated images lack any of the long range structure that is so typical of natural images [7]. The success of these methods in applications such as denoising is a poor measure of the quality of the generative model that has been learned: Setting the parameters to random values works almost as well for eliminating independent Gaussian noise [17], because this can be done quite well by just using a penalty for high-frequency variation. In this work, we show that the generative quality of these models can be drastically improved by jointly modelling both pixel mean intensities and pixel covariances. This can be achieved by using two sets of latent variables, one that gates pair-wise interactions between pixels and another one that sets the mean intensities of pixels, as we already proposed in some earlier work [4]. Here, we show that this modelling choice is crucial to make the gated MRF work well on high-resolution images. Finally, we show that the most widely used method of sharing weights in MRF’s for high-resolution images is overly constrained. Earlier work considered homogeneous MRF’s in which each potential is replicated at all image locations. This has the subtle effect of making learning very difﬁcult because of strong correlations at nearby sites. Following Gregor and LeCun [18] and also Tang and Eliasmith [19], we keep the number of parameters under control by using local potentials, but unlike Roth and Black [6] we only share weights between potentials that do not overlap. 2 Augmenting Gated MRF’s with Mean Hidden Units A Product of Student’s t (PoT) model [15] is a gated MRF deﬁned on small image patches that can be viewed as modelling image-speciﬁc, pair-wise relationships between pixel values by using the states of its latent variables. It is very good at representing the fact that two-pixel have very similar intensities and no good at all at modelling what these intensities are. Failure to model the mean also leads to impoverished modelling of the covariances when the input images have nonzero mean intensity. The covariance RBM (cRBM) [20] is another model that shares the same limitation since it only differs from PoT in the distribution of its latent variables: The posterior over the latent variables is a product of Bernoulli distributions instead of Gamma distributions as in PoT. We explain the fundamental limitation of these models by using a simple toy example: Modelling two-pixel images using a cRBM with only one binary hidden unit, see ﬁg. 1. This cRBM assumes that the conditional distribution over the input is a zero-mean Gaussian with a covariance that is determined by the state of the latent variable. Since the latent variable is binary, the cRBM can be viewed as a mixture of two zero-mean full covariance Gaussians. The latent variable uses the pairwise relationship between pixels to decide which of the two covariance matrices should be used to model each image. When the input data is pre-proessed by making each image have zero mean intensity (the empirical histogram is shown in the ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column), most images lie near the origin because most of the times nearby pixels are strongly correlated. Less frequently we encounter edge images that exhibit strong anti-correlation between the pixels, as shown by the long tails along the anti-diagonal line. A cRBM could model this data by using two Gaussians (ﬁrst row and second column): one that is spherical and tight at the origin for smooth images and another one that has a covariance elongated along the anti-diagonal for structured images. If, however, the whole set of images is normalized by subtracting from every pixel the mean value of all pixels over all images (second row and ﬁrst column), the cRBM fails at modelling structured images (second row and second column). It can ﬁt a Gaussian to the smooth images by discovering 2 Figure 1: In the ﬁrst row, each image is zero mean. In the second row, the whole set of data points is centered but each image can have non-zero mean. The ﬁrst column shows 8x8 images picked at random from natural images. The images in the second column are generated by a model that does not account for mean intensity. The images in the third column are generated by a model that has both “mean” and “covariance” hidden units. The contours in the ﬁrst column show the negative log of the empirical distribution of (tiny) natural two-pixel images (x-axis being the ﬁrst pixel and the y-axis the second pixel). The plots in the other columns are toy examples showing how each model could represent the empirical distribution using a mixture of Gaussians with components that have one of two possible covariances (corresponding to the state of a binary “covariance” latent variable). Models that can change the means of the Gaussians (mPoT and mcRBM) can represent better structured images (edge images lie along the anti-diagonal and are ﬁtted by the Gaussians shown in red) while the other models (PoT and cRBM) fail, overall when each image can have non-zero mean. the direction of strong correlation along the main diagonal, but it is very likely to fail to discover the direction of anti-correlation, which is crucial to represent discontinuities, because structured images with different mean intensity appear to be evenly spread over the whole input space. If the model has another set of latent variables that can change the means of the Gaussian distributions in the mixture (as explained more formally below and yielding the mPoT and mcRBM models), then the model can represent both changes of mean intensity and the correlational structure of pixels (see last column). The mean latent variables effectively subtract off the relevant mean from each data-point, letting the covariance latent variable capture the covariance structure of the data. As before, the covariance latent variable needs only to select between two covariance matrices. In fact, experiments on real 8x8 image patches conﬁrm these conjectures. Fig. 1 shows samples drawn from PoT and mPoT. mPoT (and similarly mcRBM [4]) is not only better at modelling zero mean images but it can also represent images that have non zero mean intensity well. We now describe mPoT, referring the reader to [4] for a detailed description of mcRBM. In PoT [9] the energy function is: E PoT (x, hc ) = i 1 [hc (1 + (Ci T x)2 ) + (1 − γ) log hc ] i i 2 (1) where x is a vectorized image patch, hc is a vector of Gamma “covariance” latent variables, C is a ﬁlter bank matrix and γ is a scalar parameter. The joint probability over input pixels and latent variables is proportional to exp(−E PoT (x, hc )). Therefore, the conditional distribution over the input pixels is a zero-mean Gaussian with covariance equal to: Σc = (Cdiag(hc )C T )−1 . (2) In order to make the mean of the conditional distribution non-zero, we deﬁne mPoT as the normalized product of the above zero-mean Gaussian that models the covariance and a spherical covariance Gaussian that models the mean. The overall energy function becomes: E mPoT (x, hc , hm ) = E PoT (x, hc ) + E m (x, hm ) 3 (3) Figure 2: Illustration of different choices of weight-sharing scheme for a RBM.

Best viewed in color. where hm is another set of latent variables that are assumed to be Bernoulli distributed (but other distributions could be used). The new energy term is: E m (x, hm ) = 1 T x x− 2 hm Wj T x j (4) j yielding the following conditional distribution over the input pixels: p(x|hc , hm ) = N (Σ(W hm ), Σ), Σ = (Σc + I)−1 (5) with Σc deﬁned in eq. 2. As desired, the conditional distribution has non-zero mean2 . Patch-based models like PoT have been extended to high-resolution images by using spatially localized ﬁlters [6]. While we can subtract off the mean intensity from independent image patches to successfully train PoT, we cannot do that on a high-resolution image because overlapping patches might have different mean. Unfortunately, replicating potentials over the image ignoring variations of mean intensity has been the leading strategy to date [6]3 . This is the major reason why generation of high-resolution images is so poor. Sec. 4 shows that generation can be drastically improved by explicitly accounting for variations of mean intensity, as performed by mPoT and mcRBM. 3 Weight-Sharing Schemes By integrating out the latent variables, we can write the density function of any gated MRF as a normalized product of potential functions (for mPoT refer to eq. 6). In this section we investigate different ways of constraining the parameters of the potentials of a generic MRF. Global: The obvious way to extend a patch-based model like PoT to high-resolution images is to deﬁne potentials over the whole image; we call this scheme global. This is not practical because 1) the number of parameters grows about quadratically with the size of the image making training too slow, 2) we do not need to model interactions between very distant pairs of pixels since their dependence is negligible, and 3) we would not be able to use the model on images of different size. Conv: The most popular way to handle big images is to deﬁne potentials on small subsets of variables (e.g., neighborhoods of size 5x5 pixels) and to replicate these potentials across space while 2 The need to model the means was clearly recognized in [21] but they used conjunctive latent features that simultaneously represented a contribution to the “precision matrix” in a speciﬁc direction and the mean along that same direction. 3 The success of PoT-like models in Bayesian denoising is not surprising since the noisy image effectively replaces the reconstruction term from the mean hidden units (see eq. 5), providing a set of noisy mean intensities that are cleaned up by the patterns of correlation enforced by the covariance latent variables. 4 sharing their parameters at each image location [23, 24, 6]. This yields a convolutional weightsharing scheme, also called homogeneous ﬁeld in the statistics literature. This choice is justiﬁed by the stationarity of natural images. This weight-sharing scheme is extremely concise in terms of number of parameters, but also rather inefﬁcient in terms of latent representation. First, if there are N ﬁlters at each location and these ﬁlters are stepped by one pixel then the internal representation is about N times overcomplete. The internal representation has not only high computational cost, but it is also highly redundant. Since the input is mostly smooth and the parameters are the same across space, the latent variables are strongly correlated as well. This inefﬁciency turns out to be particularly harmful for a model like PoT causing the learned ﬁlters to become “random” looking (see ﬁg 3-iii). A simple intuition follows from the equivalence between PoT and square ICA [15]. If the ﬁlter matrix C of eq. 1 is square and invertible, we can marginalize out the latent variables and write: p(y) = i S(yi ), where yi = Ci T x and S is a Student’s t distribution. In other words, there is an underlying assumption that ﬁlter outputs are independent. However, if the ﬁlters of matrix C are shifted and overlapping versions of each other, this clearly cannot be true. Training PoT with the Conv weight-sharing scheme forces the model to ﬁnd ﬁlters that make ﬁlter outputs as independent as possible, which explains the very high-frequency patterns that are usually discovered [6]. Local: The Global and Conv weight-sharing schemes are at the two extremes of a spectrum of possibilities. For instance, we can deﬁne potentials on a small subset of input variables but, unlike Conv, each potential can have its own set of parameters, as shown in ﬁg. 2-B. This is called local, or inhomogeneous ﬁeld. Compared to Conv the number of parameters increases only slightly but the number of latent variables required and their redundancy is greatly reduced. In fact, the model learns different receptive ﬁelds at different locations as a better strategy for representing the input, overall when the number of potentials is limited (see also ﬁg. 2-F). TConv: Local would not allow the model to be trained and tested on images of different resolution, and it might seem wasteful not to exploit the translation invariant property of images. We therefore advocate the use of a weight-sharing scheme that we call tiled-convolutional (TConv) shown in ﬁg. 2-C and E [18]. Each ﬁlter tiles the image without overlaps with copies of itself (i.e. the stride equals the ﬁlter diameter). This reduces spatial redundancy of latent variables and allows the input images to have arbitrary size. At the same time, different ﬁlters do overlap with each other in order to avoid tiling artifacts. Fig. 2-F shows ﬁlters that were (jointly) learned by a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [29] with Gaussian input variables using the TConv weight-sharing scheme. 4 Experiments We train gated MRF’s with and without mean hidden units using different weight-sharing schemes. The training procedure is very similar in all cases. We perform approximate maximum likelihood by using Fast Persistence Contrastive Divergence (FPCD) [25] and we draw samples by using Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) [26]. Since all latent variables can be exactly marginalized out we can use HMC on the free energy (negative logarithm of the marginal distribution over the input pixels). For mPoT this is: F mPoT (x) = − log(p(x))+const. = k,i 1 1 γ log(1+ (Cik T xk )2 )+ xT x− 2 2 T log(1+exp(Wjk xk )) (6) k,j where the index k runs over spatial locations and xk is the k-th image patch. FPCD keeps samples, called negative particles, that it uses to represent the model distribution. These particles are all updated after each weight update. For each mini-batch of data-points a) we compute the derivative of the free energy w.r.t. the training samples, b) we update the negative particles by running HMC for one HMC step consisting of 20 leapfrog steps. We start at the previous set of negative particles and use as parameters the sum of the regular parameters and a small perturbation vector, c) we compute the derivative of the free energy at the negative particles, and d) we update the regular parameters by using the difference of gradients between step a) and c) while the perturbation vector is updated using the gradient from c) only. The perturbation is also strongly decayed to zero and is subject to a larger learning rate. The aim is to encourage the negative particles to explore the space more quickly by slightly and temporarily raising the energy at their current position. Note that the use of FPCD as opposed to other estimation methods (like Persistent Contrastive Divergence [27]) turns out to be crucial to achieve good mixing of the sampler even after training. We train on mini-batches of 32 samples using gray-scale images of approximate size 160x160 pixels randomly cropped from the Berkeley segmentation dataset [28]. We perform 160,000 weight updates decreasing the learning by a factor of 4 by the end of training. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 for the covariance 5 Figure 3: 160x160 samples drawn by A) mPoT-TConv, B) mHPoT-TConv, C) mcRBM-TConv and D) PoTTConv. On the side also i) a subset of 8x8 “covariance” ﬁlters learned by mPoT-TConv (the plot below shows how the whole set of ﬁlters tile a small patch; each bar correspond to a Gabor ﬁt of a ﬁlter and colors identify ﬁlters applied at the same 8x8 location, each group is shifted by 2 pixels down the diagonal and a high-resolution image is tiled by replicating this pattern every 8 pixels horizontally and vertically), ii) a subset of 8x8 “mean” ﬁlters learned by the same mPoT-TConv, iii) ﬁlters learned by PoT-Conv and iv) by PoT-TConv. ﬁlters (matrix C of eq. 1), 0.01 for the mean parameters (matrix W of eq. 4), and 0.001 for the other parameters (γ of eq. 1). During training we condition on the borders and initialize the negative particles at zero in order to avoid artifacts at the border of the image. We learn 8x8 ﬁlters and pre-multiply the covariance ﬁlters by a whitening transform retaining 99% of the variance; we also normalize the norm of the covariance ﬁlters to prevent some of them from decaying to zero during training4 . Whenever we use the TConv weight-sharing scheme the model learns covariance ﬁlters that mostly resemble localized and oriented Gabor functions (see ﬁg. 3-i and iv), while the Conv weight-sharing scheme learns structured but poorly localized high-frequency patterns (see ﬁg. 3-iii) [6]. The TConv models re-use the same 8x8 ﬁlters every 8 pixels and apply a diagonal offset of 2 pixels between neighboring ﬁlters with different weights in order to reduce tiling artifacts. There are 4 sets of ﬁlters, each with 64 ﬁlters for a total of 256 covariance ﬁlters (see bottom plot of ﬁg. 3). Similarly, we have 4 sets of mean ﬁlters, each with 32 ﬁlters. These ﬁlters have usually non-zero mean and exhibit on-center off-surround and off-center on-surround patterns, see ﬁg. 3-ii. In order to draw samples from the learned models, we run HMC for a long time (10,000 iterations, each composed of 20 leap-frog steps). Some samples of size 160x160 pixels are reported in ﬁg. 3 A)D). Without modelling the mean intensity, samples lack structure and do not seem much different from those that would be generated by a simple Gaussian model merely ﬁtting the second order statistics (see ﬁg. 3 in [1] and also ﬁg. 2 in [7]). By contrast, structure, sharp boundaries and some simple texture emerge only from models that have mean latent variables, namely mcRBM, mPoT and mHPoT which differs from mPoT by having a second layer pooling matrix on the squared covariance ﬁlter outputs [11]. A more quantitative comparison is reported in table 1. We ﬁrst compute marginal statistics of ﬁlter responses using the generated images, natural images from the test set, and random images. The statistics are the normalized histogram of individual ﬁlter responses to 24 Gabor ﬁlters (8 orientations and 3 scales). We then calculate the KL divergence between the histograms on random images and generated images and the KL divergence between the histograms on natural images and generated images. The table also reports the average difference of energies between random images and natural images. All results demonstrate that models that account for mean intensity generate images 4 The code used in the experiments can be found at the ﬁrst author’s web-page. 6 MODEL F (R) − F (T ) (104 ) KL(R G) KL(T G) KL(R G) − KL(T PoT - Conv 2.9 0.3 0.6 PoT - TConv 2.8 0.4 1.0 -0.6 mPoT - TConv 5.2 1.0 0.2 0.8 mHPoT - TConv 4.9 1.7 0.8 0.9 mcRBM - TConv 3.5 1.5 1.0 G) -0.3 0.5 Table 1: Comparing MRF’s by measuring: difference of energy (negative log ratio of probabilities) between random images (R) and test natural images (T), the KL divergence between statistics of random images (R) and generated images (G), KL divergence between statistics of test natural images (T) and generated images (G), and difference of these two KL divergences. Statistics are computed using 24 Gabor ﬁlters. that are closer to natural images than to random images, whereas models that do not account for the mean (like the widely used PoT-Conv) produce samples that are actually closer to random images. 4.1 Discriminative Experiments on Weight-Sharing Schemes In future work, we intend to use the features discovered by the generative model for recognition. To understand how the different weight sharing schemes affect recognition performance we have done preliminary tests using the discriminative performance of a simpler model on simpler data. We consider one of the simplest and most versatile models, namely the RBM [29]. Since we also aim to test the Global weight-sharing scheme we are constrained to using fairly low resolution datasets such as the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits [30] and the CIFAR 10 dataset of generic object categories [22]. The MNIST dataset has soft binary images of size 28x28 pixels, while the CIFAR 10 dataset has color images of size 32x32 pixels. CIFAR 10 has 10 classes, 5000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. MNIST also has 10 classes with, on average, 6000 training samples per class and 1000 test samples per class. The energy function of the RBM trained on the CIFAR 10 dataset, modelling input pixels with 3 (R,G,B) Gaussian variables [31], is exactly the one shown in eq. 4; while the RBM trained on MNIST uses logistic units for the pixels and the energy function is again the same as before but without any quadratic term. All models are trained in an unsupervised way to approximately maximize the likelihood in the training set using Contrastive Divergence [32]. They are then used to represent each input image with a feature vector (mean of the posterior over the latent variables) which is fed to a multinomial logistic classiﬁer for discrimination. Models are compared in terms of: 1) recognition accuracy, 2) convergence time and 3) dimensionality of the representation. In general, assuming ﬁlters much smaller than the input image and assuming equal number of latent variables, Conv, TConv and Local models process each sample faster than Global by a factor approximately equal to the ratio between the area of the image and the area of the ﬁlters, which can be very large in practice. In the ﬁrst set of experiments reported on the left of ﬁg. 4 we study the internal representation in terms of discrimination and dimensionality using the MNIST dataset. For each choice of dimensionality all models are trained using the same number of operations. This is set to the amount necessary to complete one epoch over the training set using the Global model. This experiment shows that: 1) Local outperforms all other weight-sharing schemes for a wide range of dimensionalities, 2) TConv does not perform as well as Local probably because the translation invariant assumption is clearly violated for these relatively small, centered, images, 3) Conv performs well only when the internal representation is very high dimensional (10 times overcomplete) otherwise it severely underﬁts, 4) Global performs well when the representation is compact but its performance degrades rapidly as this increases because it needs more than the allotted training time. The right hand side of ﬁg. 4 shows how the recognition performance evolves as we increase the number of operations (or training time) using models that produce a twice overcomplete internal representation. With only very few ﬁlters Conv still underﬁts and it does not improve its performance by training for longer, but Global does improve and eventually it reaches the performance of Local. If we look at the crossing of the error rate at 2% we can see that Local is about 4 times faster than Global. To summarize, Local provides more compact representations than Conv, is much faster than Global while achieving 7 6 2.4 error rate % 5 error rate % 2.6 Global Local TConv Conv 4 3 2 1 0 2.2 Global Local 2 Conv 1.8 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 dimensionality 6000 7000 1.6 0 8000 2 4 6 8 # flops (relative to # flops per epoch of Global model) 10 Figure 4: Experiments on MNIST using RBM’s with different weight-sharing schemes. Left: Error rate as a function of the dimensionality of the latent representation. Right: Error rate as a function of the number of operations (normalized to those needed to perform one epoch in the Global model); all models have a twice overcomplete latent representation. similar performance in discrimination. Also, Local can easily scale to larger images while Global cannot. Similar experiments are performed using the CIFAR 10 dataset [22] of natural images. Using the same protocol introduced in earlier work by Krizhevsky [22], the RBM’s are trained in an unsupervised way on a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset [33] and then “ﬁne-tuned” on the CIFAR 10 dataset by supervised back-propagation of the error through the linear classiﬁer and feature extractor. All models produce an approximately 10,000 dimensional internal representation to make a fair comparison. Models using local ﬁlters learn 16x16 ﬁlters that are stepped every pixel. Again, we do not experiment with the TConv weight-sharing scheme because the image is not large enough to allow enough replicas. Similarly to ﬁg. 3-iii the Conv weight-sharing scheme was very difﬁcult to train and did not produce Gabor-like features. Indeed, careful injection of sparsity and long training time seem necessary [31] for these RBM’s. By contrast, both Local and Global produce Gabor-like ﬁlters similar to those shown in ﬁg. 2 F). The model trained with Conv weight-sharing scheme yields an accuracy equal to 56.6%, while Local and Global yield much better performance, 63.6% and 64.8% [22], respectively. Although Local and Global have similar performance, training with the Local weight-sharing scheme took under an hour while using the Global weight-sharing scheme required more than a day. 5 Conclusions and Future Work This work is motivated by the poor generative quality of currently popular MRF models of natural images. These models generate images that are actually more similar to white noise than to natural images. Our contribution is to recognize that current models can beneﬁt from 1) the addition of a simple model of the mean intensities and from 2) the use of a less constrained weight-sharing scheme. By augmenting these models with an extra set of latent variables that model mean intensity we can generate samples that look much more realistic: they are characterized by smooth regions, sharp boundaries and some simple high frequency texture. We validate our approach by comparing the statistics of ﬁlter outputs on natural images and generated images. In the future, we plan to integrate these MRF’s into deeper hierarchical models and to use their internal representation to perform object recognition in high-resolution images. The hope is to further improve generation by capturing longer range dependencies and to exploit this to better cope with missing values and ambiguous sensory inputs. References [1] E.P. Simoncelli.

<p>Author: Min Yang, Linli Xu, Martha White, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Robust regression and classiﬁcation are often thought to require non-convex loss functions that prevent scalable, global training. However, such a view neglects the possibility of reformulated training methods that can yield practically solvable alternatives. A natural way to make a loss function more robust to outliers is to truncate loss values that exceed a maximum threshold. We demonstrate that a relaxation of this form of “loss clipping” can be made globally solvable and applicable to any standard loss while guaranteeing robustness against outliers. We present a generic procedure that can be applied to standard loss functions and demonstrate improved robustness in regression and classiﬁcation problems. 1</p><p>5 0.81516016 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Exploiting_weakly-labeled_Web_images_to_improve_object_classification%3A_a_domain_adaptation_approach.html">86 nips-2010-Exploiting weakly-labeled Web images to improve object classification: a domain adaptation approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: Most current image categorization methods require large collections of manually annotated training examples to learn accurate visual recognition models. The time-consuming human labeling effort effectively limits these approaches to recognition problems involving a small number of different object classes. In order to address this shortcoming, in recent years several authors have proposed to learn object classiﬁers from weakly-labeled Internet images, such as photos retrieved by keyword-based image search engines. While this strategy eliminates the need for human supervision, the recognition accuracies of these methods are considerably lower than those obtained with fully-supervised approaches, because of the noisy nature of the labels associated to Web data. In this paper we investigate and compare methods that learn image classiﬁers by combining very few manually annotated examples (e.g., 1-10 images per class) and a large number of weakly-labeled Web photos retrieved using keyword-based image search. We cast this as a domain adaptation problem: given a few stronglylabeled examples in a target domain (the manually annotated examples) and many source domain examples (the weakly-labeled Web photos), learn classiﬁers yielding small generalization error on the target domain. Our experiments demonstrate that, for the same number of strongly-labeled examples, our domain adaptation approach produces signiﬁcant recognition rate improvements over the best published results (e.g., 65% better when using 5 labeled training examples per class) and that our classiﬁers are one order of magnitude faster to learn and to evaluate than the best competing method, despite our use of large weakly-labeled data sets.</p><p>6 0.81079489 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Predictive_State_Temporal_Difference_Learning.html">212 nips-2010-Predictive State Temporal Difference Learning</a></p>

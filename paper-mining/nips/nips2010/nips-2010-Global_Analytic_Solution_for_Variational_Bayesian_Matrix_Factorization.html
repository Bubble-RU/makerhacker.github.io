<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>3 0.11234578 <a title="106-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Gelfand, Yutian Chen, Laurens Maaten, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: The paper develops a connection between traditional perceptron algorithms and recently introduced herding algorithms. It is shown that both algorithms can be viewed as an application of the perceptron cycling theorem. This connection strengthens some herding results and suggests new (supervised) herding algorithms that, like CRFs or discriminative RBMs, make predictions by conditioning on the input attributes. We develop and investigate variants of conditional herding, and show that conditional herding leads to practical algorithms that perform better than or on par with related classiﬁers such as the voted perceptron and the discriminative RBM. 1</p><p>5 0.054783829 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Inter-time_segment_information_sharing_for_non-homogeneous_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">129 nips-2010-Inter-time segment information sharing for non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Dirk Husmeier, Frank Dondelinger, Sophie Lebre</p><p>Abstract: Conventional dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are based on the homogeneous Markov assumption, which is too restrictive in many practical applications. Various approaches to relax the homogeneity assumption have recently been proposed, allowing the network structure to change with time. However, unless time series are very long, this ﬂexibility leads to the risk of overﬁtting and inﬂated inference uncertainty. In the present paper we investigate three regularization schemes based on inter-segment information sharing, choosing different prior distributions and different coupling schemes between nodes. We apply our method to gene expression time series obtained during the Drosophila life cycle, and compare the predicted segmentation with other state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude our evaluation with an application to synthetic biology, where the objective is to predict a known in vivo regulatory network of ﬁve genes in yeast. 1</p><p>6 0.051991601 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Permutation_Complexity_Bound_on_Out-Sample_Error.html">205 nips-2010-Permutation Complexity Bound on Out-Sample Error</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Zhang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is often needed in many applications due to the high dimensionality of the data involved. In this paper, we ďŹ rst analyze the scatter measures used in the conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model and note that the formulation is based on the average-case view. Based on this analysis, we then propose a new dimensionality reduction method called worst-case linear discriminant analysis (WLDA) by deďŹ ning new between-class and within-class scatter measures. This new model adopts the worst-case view which arguably is more suitable for applications such as classiďŹ cation. When the number of training data points or the number of features is not very large, we relax the optimization problem involved and formulate it as a metric learning problem. Otherwise, we take a greedy approach by ďŹ nding one direction of the transformation at a time. Moreover, we also analyze a special case of WLDA to show its relationship with conventional LDA. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WLDA when compared with some related dimensionality reduction methods. 1</p><p>5 0.42499411 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Word_Features_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">286 nips-2010-Word Features for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: James Petterson, Wray Buntine, Shravan M. Narayanamurthy, Tibério S. Caetano, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by explicitly allowing for the encoding of side information in the distribution over words. This results in a variety of new capabilities, such as improved estimates for infrequently occurring words, as well as the ability to leverage thesauri and dictionaries in order to boost topic cohesion within and across languages. We present experiments on multi-language topic synchronisation where dictionary information is used to bias corresponding words towards similar topics. Results indicate that our model substantially improves topic cohesion when compared to the standard LDA model. 1</p><p>6 0.40817511 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Joint_Analysis_of_Time-Evolving_Binary_Matrices_and_Associated_Documents.html">131 nips-2010-Joint Analysis of Time-Evolving Binary Matrices and Associated Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuzong Liu, Mohit Sharma, Charles Gaona, Jonathan Breshears, Jarod Roland, Zachary Freudenburg, Eric Leuthardt, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Several motor related Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been developed over the years that use activity decoded from the contralateral hemisphere to operate devices. Contralateral primary motor cortex is also the region most severely affected by hemispheric stroke. Recent studies have identiﬁed ipsilateral cortical activity in planning of motor movements and its potential implications for a stroke relevant BCI. The most fundamental functional loss after a hemispheric stroke is the loss of ﬁne motor control of the hand. Thus, whether ipsilateral cortex encodes ﬁnger movements is critical to the potential feasibility of BCI approaches in the future. This study uses ipsilateral cortical signals from humans (using ECoG) to decode ﬁnger movements. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, successful ﬁnger movement detection using machine learning algorithms. Our results show high decoding accuracies in all cases which are always above chance. We also show that signiﬁcant accuracies can be achieved with the use of only a fraction of all the features recorded and that these core features are consistent with previous physiological ﬁndings. The results of this study have substantial implications for advancing neuroprosthetic approaches to stroke populations not currently amenable to existing BCI techniques. 1</p><p>3 0.40704897 <a title="106-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Lower_Bounds_on_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Cutting_Plane_Methods.html">163 nips-2010-Lower Bounds on Rate of Convergence of Cutting Plane Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Ankan Saha, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: In a recent paper Joachims [1] presented SVM-Perf, a cutting plane method (CPM) for training linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which converges to an accurate solution in O(1/ 2 ) iterations. By tightening the analysis, Teo et al. [2] showed that O(1/ ) iterations sufﬁce. Given the impressive convergence speed of CPM on a number of practical problems, it was conjectured that these rates could be further improved. In this paper we disprove this conjecture. We present counter examples which are not only applicable for training linear SVMs with hinge loss, but also hold for support vector methods which optimize a multivariate performance score. However, surprisingly, these problems are not inherently hard. By exploiting the structure of the objective function we can devise an algo√ rithm that converges in O(1/ ) iterations. 1</p><p>4 0.31718591 <a title="106-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research.

Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>6 0.313752 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Occlusion_Detection_and_Motion_Estimation_with_Convex_Optimization.html">187 nips-2010-Occlusion Detection and Motion Estimation with Convex Optimization</a></p>

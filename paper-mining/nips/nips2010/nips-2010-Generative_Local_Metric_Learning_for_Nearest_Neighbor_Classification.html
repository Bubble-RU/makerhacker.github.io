<p>Author: Shibin Parameswaran, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) improves the prediction performance on multiple, different but related, learning problems through shared parameters or representations. One of the most prominent multi-task learning algorithms is an extension to support vector machines (svm) by Evgeniou et al. [15]. Although very elegant, multi-task svm is inherently restricted by the fact that support vector machines require each class to be addressed explicitly with its own weight vector which, in a multi-task setting, requires the different learning tasks to share the same set of classes. This paper proposes an alternative formulation for multi-task learning by extending the recently published large margin nearest neighbor (lmnn) algorithm to the MTL paradigm. Instead of relying on separating hyperplanes, its decision function is based on the nearest neighbor rule which inherently extends to many classes and becomes a natural ﬁt for multi-task learning. We evaluate the resulting multi-task lmnn on real-world insurance data and speech classiﬁcation problems and show that it consistently outperforms single-task kNN under several metrics and state-of-the-art MTL classiﬁers. 1</p><p>3 0.20126797 <a title="104-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Divisive_Normalization%3A_Justification_and_Effectiveness_as_Efficient_Coding_Transform.html">65 nips-2010-Divisive Normalization: Justification and Effectiveness as Efficient Coding Transform</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Divisive normalization (DN) has been advocated as an effective nonlinear efﬁcient coding transform for natural sensory signals with applications in biology and engineering. In this work, we aim to establish a connection between the DN transform and the statistical properties of natural sensory signals. Our analysis is based on the use of multivariate t model to capture some important statistical properties of natural sensory signals. The multivariate t model justiﬁes DN as an approximation to the transform that completely eliminates its statistical dependency. Furthermore, using the multivariate t model and measuring statistical dependency with multi-information, we can precisely quantify the statistical dependency that is reduced by the DN transform. We compare this with the actual performance of the DN transform in reducing statistical dependencies of natural sensory signals. Our theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluations conﬁrm DN as an effective efﬁcient coding transform for natural sensory signals. On the other hand, we also observe a previously unreported phenomenon that DN may increase statistical dependencies when the size of pooling is small. 1</p><p>4 0.15412378 <a title="104-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>5 0.13970715 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Inductive_Regularized_Learning_of_Kernel_Functions.html">124 nips-2010-Inductive Regularized Learning of Kernel Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of semi-supervised kernel function learning. We ﬁrst propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and then demonstrate an equivalence between our proposed kernel matrix learning framework and a general linear transformation learning problem. Our result shows that the learned kernel matrices parameterize a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points. Furthermore, our result gives a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. To make our results practical for large-scale data, we modify our framework to limit the number of parameters in the optimization process. We also consider the problem of kernelized inductive dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting. To this end, we introduce a novel method for this problem by considering a special case of our general kernel learning framework where we select the trace norm function as the regularizer. We empirically demonstrate that our framework learns useful kernel functions, improving the k-NN classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly in a variety of domains. Furthermore, our kernelized dimensionality reduction technique signiﬁcantly reduces the dimensionality of the feature space while achieving competitive classiﬁcation accuracies. 1</p><p>6 0.13239639 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive_Embedding_by_Nonlinear_NCA_Regression.html">209 nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive Embedding by Nonlinear NCA Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi-da Wu, Shi-jie Lin, Hsin Chen</p><p>Abstract: The Diffusion Network(DN) is a stochastic recurrent network which has been shown capable of modeling the distributions of continuous-valued, continuoustime paths. However, the dynamics of the DN are governed by stochastic differential equations, making the DN unfavourable for simulation in a digital computer. This paper presents the implementation of the DN in analogue Very Large Scale Integration, enabling the DN to be simulated in real time. Moreover, the logdomain representation is applied to the DN, allowing the supply voltage and thus the power consumption to be reduced without limiting the dynamic ranges for diffusion processes. A VLSI chip containing a DN with two stochastic units has been designed and fabricated. The design of component circuits will be described, so will the simulation of the full system be presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the DN in VLSI is able to regenerate various types of continuous paths in real-time. 1</p><p>5 0.49677199 <a title="104-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Getting_lost_in_space%3A_Large_sample_analysis_of_the_resistance_distance.html">105 nips-2010-Getting lost in space: Large sample analysis of the resistance distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike V. Luxburg, Agnes Radl, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: The commute distance between two vertices in a graph is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from the ﬁrst to the second vertex and back. We study the behavior of the commute distance as the size of the underlying graph increases. We prove that the commute distance converges to an expression that does not take into account the structure of the graph at all and that is completely meaningless as a distance function on the graph. Consequently, the use of the raw commute distance for machine learning purposes is strongly discouraged for large graphs and in high dimensions. As an alternative we introduce the ampliﬁed commute distance that corrects for the undesired large sample effects. 1</p><p>6 0.48813605 <a title="104-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Worst-Case_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis.html">287 nips-2010-Worst-Case Linear Discriminant Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Peel, Sandrine Anthoine, Liva Ralaivola</p><p>Abstract: We present original empirical Bernstein inequalities for U-statistics with bounded symmetric kernels q. They are expressed with respect to empirical estimates of either the variance of q or the conditional variance that appears in the Bernsteintype inequality for U-statistics derived by Arcones [2]. Our result subsumes other existing empirical Bernstein inequalities, as it reduces to them when U-statistics of order 1 are considered. In addition, it is based on a rather direct argument using two applications of the same (non-empirical) Bernstein inequality for U-statistics. We discuss potential applications of our new inequalities, especially in the realm of learning ranking/scoring functions. In the process, we exhibit an efﬁcient procedure to compute the variance estimates for the special case of bipartite ranking that rests on a sorting argument. We also argue that our results may provide test set bounds and particularly interesting empirical racing algorithms for the problem of online learning of scoring functions. 1</p><p>2 0.80968654 <a title="104-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-A_Theory_of_Multiclass_Boosting.html">15 nips-2010-A Theory of Multiclass Boosting</a></p>

Although the case of binary classiﬁcation is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the “correct” requirements on the weak classiﬁer, or the notion of the most efﬁcient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78952944 <a title="104-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Generative_Local_Metric_Learning_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">104 nips-2010-Generative Local Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

We focus on the bias in the information-theoretic error arising from ﬁnite sampling effects, and ﬁnd an appropriate local metric that maximally reduces the bias based upon knowledge from generative models. As a byproduct, the asymptotic theoretical analysis in this work relates metric learning with dimensionality reduction, which was not understood from previous discriminative approaches. Empirical experiments show that this learned local metric enhances the discriminative nearest neighbor performance on various datasets using simple class conditional generative models. 1</p><p>4 0.76098818 <a title="104-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>5 0.75627166 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Robust_Clustering_as_Ensembles_of_Affinity_Relations.html">230 nips-2010-Robust Clustering as Ensembles of Affinity Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hairong Liu, Longin J. Latecki, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we regard clustering as ensembles of k-ary afﬁnity relations and clusters correspond to subsets of objects with maximal average afﬁnity relations. The average afﬁnity relation of a cluster is relaxed and well approximated by a constrained homogenous function. We present an efﬁcient procedure to solve this optimization problem, and show that the underlying clusters can be robustly revealed by using priors systematically constructed from the data. Our method can automatically select some points to form clusters, leaving other points un-grouped; thus it is inherently robust to large numbers of outliers, which has seriously limited the applicability of classical methods. Our method also provides a uniﬁed solution to clustering from k-ary afﬁnity relations with k ≥ 2, that is, it applies to both graph-based and hypergraph-based clustering problems. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show the superiority of our method over classical solutions to the clustering problem, especially when there exists a large number of outliers.</p><p>6 0.75576872 <a title="104-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Random_Conic_Pursuit_for_Semidefinite_Programming.html">219 nips-2010-Random Conic Pursuit for Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

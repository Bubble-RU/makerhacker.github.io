<p>Author: Oliver Stegle, Dominik Janzing, Kun Zhang, Joris M. Mooij, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for inferring whether X causes Y or vice versa from joint observations of X and Y . The basic idea is to model the observed data using probabilistic latent variable models, which incorporate the effects of unobserved noise. To this end, we consider the hypothetical effect variable to be a function of the hypothetical cause variable and an independent noise term (not necessarily additive). An important novel aspect of our work is that we do not restrict the model class, but instead put general non-parametric priors on this function and on the distribution of the cause. The causal direction can then be inferred by using standard Bayesian model selection. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and real-world data and report encouraging results. 1</p><p>3 0.096028045 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Random_Conic_Pursuit_for_Semidefinite_Programming.html">219 nips-2010-Random Conic Pursuit for Semidefinite Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Ariel Kleiner, Ali Rahimi, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm, Random Conic Pursuit, that solves semideﬁnite programs (SDPs) via repeated optimization over randomly selected two-dimensional subcones of the PSD cone. This scheme is simple, easily implemented, applicable to very general SDPs, scalable, and theoretically interesting. Its advantages are realized at the expense of an ability to readily compute highly exact solutions, though useful approximate solutions are easily obtained. This property renders Random Conic Pursuit of particular interest for machine learning applications, in which the relevant SDPs are generally based upon random data and so exact minima are often not a priority. Indeed, we present empirical results to this effect for various SDPs encountered in machine learning; these experiments demonstrate the potential practical usefulness of Random Conic Pursuit. We also provide a preliminary analysis that yields insight into the theoretical properties and convergence of the algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.085478149 <a title="41-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Causal_discovery_in_multiple_models_from_different_experiments.html">46 nips-2010-Causal discovery in multiple models from different experiments</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Claassen, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: A long-standing open research problem is how to use information from different experiments, including background knowledge, to infer causal relations. Recent developments have shown ways to use multiple data sets, provided they originate from identical experiments. We present the MCI-algorithm as the ﬁrst method that can infer provably valid causal relations in the large sample limit from different experiments. It is fast, reliable and produces very clear and easily interpretable output. It is based on a result that shows that constraint-based causal discovery is decomposable into a candidate pair identiﬁcation and subsequent elimination step that can be applied separately from different models. We test the algorithm on a variety of synthetic input model sets to assess its behavior and the quality of the output. The method shows promising signs that it can be adapted to suit causal discovery in real-world application areas as well, including large databases. 1</p><p>5 0.080292732 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Sufficient_Conditions_for_Generating_Group_Level_Sparsity_in_a_Robust_Minimax_Framework.html">260 nips-2010-Sufficient Conditions for Generating Group Level Sparsity in a Robust Minimax Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongbo Zhou, Qiang Cheng</p><p>Abstract: Regularization technique has become a principled tool for statistics and machine learning research and practice. However, in most situations, these regularization terms are not well interpreted, especially on how they are related to the loss function and data. In this paper, we propose a robust minimax framework to interpret the relationship between data and regularization terms for a large class of loss functions. We show that various regularization terms are essentially corresponding to different distortions to the original data matrix. This minimax framework includes ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, fused lasso, group lasso, local coordinate coding, multiple kernel learning, etc., as special cases. Within this minimax framework, we further give mathematically exact deﬁnition for a novel representation called sparse grouping representation (SGR), and prove a set of sufﬁcient conditions for generating such group level sparsity. Under these sufﬁcient conditions, a large set of consistent regularization terms can be designed. This SGR is essentially different from group lasso in the way of using class or group information, and it outperforms group lasso when there appears group label noise. We also provide some generalization bounds in a classiﬁcation setting. 1</p><p>6 0.077085756 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Robust_PCA_via_Outlier_Pursuit.html">231 nips-2010-Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul Mckeigue, Jon Krohn, Amos J. Storkey, Felix V. Agakov</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic framework for studying associations between multiple genotypes, biomarkers, and phenotypic traits in the presence of noise and unobserved confounders for large genetic studies. The framework builds on sparse linear methods developed for regression and modiﬁed here for inferring causal structures of richer networks with latent variables. The method is motivated by the use of genotypes as “instruments” to infer causal associations between phenotypic biomarkers and outcomes, without making the common restrictive assumptions of instrumental variable methods. The method may be used for an effective screening of potentially interesting genotype-phenotype and biomarker-phenotype associations in genome-wide studies, which may have important implications for validating biomarkers as possible proxy endpoints for early-stage clinical trials. Where the biomarkers are gene transcripts, the method can be used for ﬁne mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detected in genetic linkage studies. The method is applied for examining effects of gene transcript levels in the liver on plasma HDL cholesterol levels for a sample of sequenced mice from a heterogeneous stock, with ∼ 105 genetic instruments and ∼ 47 × 103 gene transcripts. 1</p><p>4 0.69403303 <a title="41-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Probabilistic_latent_variable_models_for_distinguishing_between_cause_and_effect.html">218 nips-2010-Probabilistic latent variable models for distinguishing between cause and effect</a></p>

<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>6 0.51521587 <a title="41-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-CUR_from_a_Sparse_Optimization_Viewpoint.html">45 nips-2010-CUR from a Sparse Optimization Viewpoint</a></p>

The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>3 0.58761066 <a title="41-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>

Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>4 0.58512545 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-An_analysis_on_negative_curvature_induced_by_singularity_in_multi-layer_neural-network_learning.html">31 nips-2010-An analysis on negative curvature induced by singularity in multi-layer neural-network learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Eiji Mizutani, Stuart Dreyfus</p><p>Abstract: In the neural-network parameter space, an attractive ﬁeld is likely to be induced by singularities. In such a singularity region, ﬁrst-order gradient learning typically causes a long plateau with very little change in the objective function value E (hence, a ﬂat region). Therefore, it may be confused with “attractive” local minima. Our analysis shows that the Hessian matrix of E tends to be indeﬁnite in the vicinity of (perturbed) singular points, suggesting a promising strategy that exploits negative curvature so as to escape from the singularity plateaus. For numerical evidence, we limit the scope to small examples (some of which are found in journal papers) that allow us to conﬁrm singularities and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, and for which computation using a descent direction of negative curvature encounters no plateau. Even for those small problems, no efﬁcient methods have been previously developed that avoided plateaus. 1</p><p>5 0.58309513 <a title="41-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>6 0.58107573 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Structured_Determinantal_Point_Processes.html">257 nips-2010-Structured Determinantal Point Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ernesto D. Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Alessandro Toigo</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning from data the support of a probability distribution when the distribution does not have a density (with respect to some reference measure). We propose a new class of regularized spectral estimators based on a new notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we call “completely regular”. Completely regular kernels allow to capture the relevant geometric and topological properties of an arbitrary probability space. In particular, they are the key ingredient to prove the universal consistency of the spectral estimators and in this respect they are the analogue of universal kernels for supervised problems. Numerical experiments show that spectral estimators compare favorably to state of the art machine learning algorithms for density support estimation.</p><p>3 0.34325382 <a title="279-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Inductive_Regularized_Learning_of_Kernel_Functions.html">124 nips-2010-Inductive Regularized Learning of Kernel Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of semi-supervised kernel function learning. We ﬁrst propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and then demonstrate an equivalence between our proposed kernel matrix learning framework and a general linear transformation learning problem. Our result shows that the learned kernel matrices parameterize a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points. Furthermore, our result gives a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. To make our results practical for large-scale data, we modify our framework to limit the number of parameters in the optimization process. We also consider the problem of kernelized inductive dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting. To this end, we introduce a novel method for this problem by considering a special case of our general kernel learning framework where we select the trace norm function as the regularizer. We empirically demonstrate that our framework learns useful kernel functions, improving the k-NN classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly in a variety of domains. Furthermore, our kernelized dimensionality reduction technique signiﬁcantly reduces the dimensionality of the feature space while achieving competitive classiﬁcation accuracies. 1</p><p>4 0.29008195 <a title="279-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: The design of low-level image features is critical for computer vision algorithms. Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT [16] and HOG [3], are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a uniﬁed and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) [23]. Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classiﬁcation benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet.</p><p>5 0.25486043 <a title="279-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Kernels_with_Radiuses_of_Minimum_Enclosing_Balls.html">145 nips-2010-Learning Kernels with Radiuses of Minimum Enclosing Balls</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Gai, Guangyun Chen, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we point out that there exist scaling and initialization problems in most existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) approaches, which employ the large margin principle to jointly learn both a kernel and an SVM classiﬁer. The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (e.g., L1 or L2 ) of norm constraints on combination coefﬁcients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms both SVM with the uniform combination of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.20100075 <a title="279-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Multi-label_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_by_Stochastic_Approximation%3A_Application_to_Visual_Object_Recognition.html">174 nips-2010-Multi-label Multiple Kernel Learning by Stochastic Approximation: Application to Visual Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Meihong Wang, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We apply the framework of kernel dimension reduction, originally designed for supervised problems, to unsupervised dimensionality reduction. In this framework, kernel-based measures of independence are used to derive low-dimensional representations that maximally capture information in covariates in order to predict responses. We extend this idea and develop similarly motivated measures for unsupervised problems where covariates and responses are the same. Our empirical studies show that the resulting compact representation yields meaningful and appealing visualization and clustering of data. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with supervised learners for classiﬁcation, our methods lead to lower classiﬁcation errors than state-of-the-art methods, especially when embedding data in spaces of very few dimensions.</p><p>5 0.80008423 <a title="279-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Kernels_with_Radiuses_of_Minimum_Enclosing_Balls.html">145 nips-2010-Learning Kernels with Radiuses of Minimum Enclosing Balls</a></p>

<p>Author: Sohan Seth, Park Il, Austin Brockmeier, Mulugeta Semework, John Choi, Joseph Francis, Jose Principe</p><p>Abstract: Hypothesis testing on point processes has several applications such as model ﬁtting, plasticity detection, and non-stationarity detection. Standard tools for hypothesis testing include tests on mean ﬁring rate and time varying rate function. However, these statistics do not fully describe a point process, and therefore, the conclusions drawn by these tests can be misleading. In this paper, we introduce a family of non-parametric divergence measures for hypothesis testing. A divergence measure compares the full probability structure and, therefore, leads to a more robust test of hypothesis. We extend the traditional Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Cram´ r–von-Mises tests to the space of spike trains via stratiﬁcation, and e show that these statistics can be consistently estimated from data without any free parameter. We demonstrate an application of the proposed divergences as a cost function to ﬁnd optimally matched point processes. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84447223 <a title="279-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>

So far, however, there are no kernels of practical interest known that satisfy these assumptions, if X Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Rd . We close this gap by providing a general technique based on Taylor-type kernels to explicitly construct universal kernels on compact metric spaces which are not subset of Rd . We apply this technique for the following special cases: universal kernels on the set of probability measures, universal kernels based on Fourier transforms, and universal kernels for signal processing. 1</p><p>3 0.83747274 <a title="279-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Stability_Approach_to_Regularization_Selection_%28StARS%29_for_High_Dimensional_Graphical_Models.html">254 nips-2010-Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>4 0.83220577 <a title="279-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.82789791 <a title="279-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Decomposing_Isotonic_Regression_for_Efficiently_Solving_Large_Problems.html">58 nips-2010-Decomposing Isotonic Regression for Efficiently Solving Large Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Saharon Rosset, Moni Shahar</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithm for isotonic regression is presented based on recursively partitioning the solution space. We develop efﬁcient methods for each partitioning subproblem through an equivalent representation as a network ﬂow problem, and prove that this sequence of partitions converges to the global solution. These network ﬂow problems can further be decomposed in order to solve very large problems. Success of isotonic regression in prediction and our algorithm’s favorable computational properties are demonstrated through simulated examples as large as 2 × 105 variables and 107 constraints.</p><p>6 0.82339263 <a title="279-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Lower_Bounds_on_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Cutting_Plane_Methods.html">163 nips-2010-Lower Bounds on Rate of Convergence of Cutting Plane Methods</a></p>

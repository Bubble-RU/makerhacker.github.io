<p>Author: Ping Li, Arnd Konig, Wenhao Gui</p><p>Abstract: Computing1 two-way and multi-way set similarities is a fundamental problem. This study focuses on estimating 3-way resemblance (Jaccard similarity) using b-bit minwise hashing. While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits, b-bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest b bits (where b ≥ 2 for 3-way). The extension to 3-way similarity from the prior work on 2-way similarity is technically non-trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simpliﬁed estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that b-bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 25-fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 3-way resemblance. 1</p><p>3 0.15376097 <a title="112-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.12532978 <a title="112-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Agnostic_Active_Learning_Without_Constraints.html">27 nips-2010-Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, John Langford, Zhang Tong, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.11913014 <a title="112-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive_Embedding_by_Nonlinear_NCA_Regression.html">209 nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive Embedding by Nonlinear NCA Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, George Williams, Ian Spiro, Christoph Bregler, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the complex problem of visually matching people in similar pose but with different clothes, background, and other appearance changes. We achieve this with a novel method for learning a nonlinear embedding based on several extensions to the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) framework. Our method is convolutional, enabling it to scale to realistically-sized images. By cheaply labeling the head and hands in large video databases through Amazon Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing service), we can use the task of localizing the head and hands as a proxy for determining body pose. We apply our method to challenging real-world data and show that it can generalize beyond hand localization to infer a more general notion of body pose. We evaluate our method quantitatively against other embedding methods. We also demonstrate that realworld performance can be improved through the use of synthetic data. 1</p><p>6 0.11729136 <a title="112-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>

Our algorithm solves an integer linear program in an online fashion. It exploits total unimodularity of the constraint matrix and a Lagrangian relaxation to solve the problem as a convex online game. The algorithm generates approximate solutions of max-ﬂow problems by performing stochastic gradient descent on a set of ﬂows. We apply the algorithm to optimize tier arrangement of over 84 million web pages on a layered set of caches to serve an incoming query stream optimally. 1</p><p>4 0.37293664 <a title="112-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>

<p>Author: Paolo Viappiani, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.</p><p>6 0.3175053 <a title="112-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Generative_Local_Metric_Learning_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">104 nips-2010-Generative Local Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Welinder, Steve Branson, Pietro Perona, Serge J. Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Distributing labeling tasks among hundreds or thousands of annotators is an increasingly important method for annotating large datasets. We present a method for estimating the underlying value (e.g. the class) of each image from (noisy) annotations provided by multiple annotators. Our method is based on a model of the image formation and annotation process. Each image has different characteristics that are represented in an abstract Euclidean space. Each annotator is modeled as a multidimensional entity with variables representing competence, expertise and bias. This allows the model to discover and represent groups of annotators that have different sets of skills and knowledge, as well as groups of images that differ qualitatively. We ﬁnd that our model predicts ground truth labels on both synthetic and real data more accurately than state of the art methods. Experiments also show that our model, starting from a set of binary labels, may discover rich information, such as different “schools of thought” amongst the annotators, and can group together images belonging to separate categories. 1</p><p>3 0.75308198 <a title="112-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-New_Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Online_Classification.html">182 nips-2010-New Adaptive Algorithms for Online Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Koby Crammer</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework to online learning for classiﬁcation problems with time-varying potential functions in the adversarial setting. This framework allows to design and prove relative mistake bounds for any generic loss function. The mistake bounds can be specialized for the hinge loss, allowing to recover and improve the bounds of known online classiﬁcation algorithms. By optimizing the general bound we derive a new online classiﬁcation algorithm, called NAROW, that hybridly uses adaptive- and ﬁxed- second order information. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance using synthetic dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.68230748 <a title="112-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Jason Weston, David Grangier</p><p>Abstract: Multi-class classiﬁcation becomes challenging at test time when the number of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a treestructure of classiﬁers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster. 1</p><p>5 0.68221354 <a title="112-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Convex_Multiple-Instance_Learning_by_Estimating_Likelihood_Ratio.html">52 nips-2010-Convex Multiple-Instance Learning by Estimating Likelihood Ratio</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to multiple-instance learning that reformulates the problem as a convex optimization on the likelihood ratio between the positive and the negative class for each training instance. This is casted as joint estimation of both a likelihood ratio predictor and the target (likelihood ratio variable) for instances. Theoretically, we prove a quantitative relationship between the risk estimated under the 0-1 classiﬁcation loss, and under a loss function for likelihood ratio. It is shown that likelihood ratio estimation is generally a good surrogate for the 0-1 loss, and separates positive and negative instances well. The likelihood ratio estimates provide a ranking of instances within a bag and are used as input features to learn a linear classiﬁer on bags of instances. Instance-level classiﬁcation is achieved from the bag-level predictions and the individual likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the approach.</p><p>6 0.68084979 <a title="112-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>

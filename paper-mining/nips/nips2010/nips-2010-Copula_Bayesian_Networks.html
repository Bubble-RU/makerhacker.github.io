<p>Author: Andrew Wilson, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We deﬁne a copula process which describes the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. As an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), to predict the latent standard deviations of a sequence of random variables. To make predictions we use Bayesian inference, with the Laplace approximation, and with Markov chain Monte Carlo as an alternative. We ﬁnd our model can outperform GARCH on simulated and ﬁnancial data. And unlike GARCH, GCPV can easily handle missing data, incorporate covariates other than time, and model a rich class of covariance structures. Imagine measuring the distance of a rocket as it leaves Earth, and wanting to know how these measurements correlate with one another. How much does the value of the measurement at ﬁfteen minutes depend on the measurement at ﬁve minutes? Once we’ve learned this correlation structure, suppose we want to compare it to the dependence between measurements of the rocket’s velocity. To do this, it is convenient to separate dependence from the marginal distributions of our measurements. At any given time, a rocket’s distance from Earth could have a Gamma distribution, while its velocity could have a Gaussian distribution. And separating dependence from marginal distributions is precisely what a copula function does. While copulas have recently become popular, especially in ﬁnancial applications [1, 2], as Nelsen [3] writes, “the study of copulas and the role they play in probability, statistics, and stochastic processes is a subject still in its infancy. There are many open problems. . . ” Typically only bivariate (and recently trivariate) copulas are being used and studied. In our introductory example, we are interested in learning the correlations in different stochastic processes, and comparing them. It would therefore be useful to have a copula process, which can describe the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We deﬁne such a process. And as an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV). In doing so, we provide a Bayesian framework for the learning the marginal distributions and dependency structure of what we call a Gaussian copula process. The volatility of a random variable is its standard deviation. Stochastic volatility models are used to predict the volatilities of a heteroscedastic sequence – a sequence of random variables with different variances, like distance measurements of a rocket as it leaves the Earth. As the rocket gets further away, the variance on the measurements increases. Heteroscedasticity is especially important in econometrics; the returns on equity indices, like the S&P; 500, or on currency exchanges, are heteroscedastic. Indeed, in 2003, Robert Engle won the Nobel Prize in economics “for methods of analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility”. GARCH [4], a generalized version of Engle’s ARCH, is arguably unsurpassed for predicting the volatility of returns on equity indices and currency exchanges [5, 6, 7]. GCPV can outperform GARCH, and is competitive on ﬁnancial data that especially suits GARCH [8, 9, 10]. Before discussing GCPV, we ﬁrst introduce copulas and the copula process. For a review of Gaussian processes, see Rasmussen and Williams [11]. ∗ † http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/andrew Also at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University. 1 1 Copulas Copulas are important because they separate the dependency structure between random variables from their marginal distributions. Intuitively, we can describe the dependency structure of any multivariate joint distribution H(x1 , . . . , xn ) = P (X1 ≤ x1 , . . . Xn ≤ xn ) through a two step process. First we take each univariate random variable Xi and transform it through its cumulative distribution function (cdf) Fi to get Ui = Fi (Xi ), a uniform random variable. We then express the dependencies between these transformed variables through the n-copula C(u1 , . . . , un ). Formally, an n-copula C : [0, 1]n → [0, 1] is a multivariate cdf with uniform univariate marginals: C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = P (U1 ≤ u1 , U2 ≤ u2 , . . . , Un ≤ un ), where U1 , U2 , . . . , Un are standard uniform random variables. Sklar [12] precisely expressed our intuition in the theorem below. Theorem 1.1. Sklar’s theorem Let H be an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . Then there exists an n-copula C such that for all (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ [−∞, ∞]n , H(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = C(F1 (x1 ), F2 (x2 ), . . . , Fn (xn )) = C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ). (1) If F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are all continuous then C is unique; otherwise C is uniquely determined on Range F1 × Range F2 × · · · × Range Fn . Conversely, if C is an n-copula and F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are distribution functions, then the function H is an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . (−1) As a corollary, if Fi (u) = inf{x : F (x) ≥ u}, the quasi-inverse of Fi , then for all u1 , u2 , . . . , un ∈ [0, 1]n , (−1) C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = H(F1 (−1) (u1 ), F2 (−1) (u2 ), . . . , Fn (un )). (2) In other words, (2) can be used to construct a copula. For example, the bivariate Gaussian copula is deﬁned as C(u, v) = Φρ (Φ−1 (u), Φ−1 (v)), (3) where Φρ is a bivariate Gaussian cdf with correlation coefﬁcient ρ, and Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf. Li [2] popularised the bivariate Gaussian copula, by showing how it could be used to study ﬁnancial risk and default correlation, using credit derivatives as an example. By substituting F (x) for u and G(y) for v in equation (3), we have a bivariate distribution H(x, y), with a Gaussian dependency structure, and marginals F and G. Regardless of F and G, the resulting H(x, y) can still be uniquely expressed as a Gaussian copula, so long as F and G are continuous. It is then a copula itself that captures the underlying dependencies between random variables, regardless of their marginal distributions. For this reason, copulas have been called dependence functions [13, 14]. Nelsen [3] contains an extensive discussion of copulas. 2 Copula Processes Imagine choosing a covariance function, and then drawing a sample function at some ﬁnite number of points from a Gaussian process. The result is a sample from a collection of Gaussian random variables, with a dependency structure encoded by the speciﬁed covariance function. Now, suppose we transform each of these values through a univariate Gaussian cdf, such that we have a sample from a collection of uniform random variables. These uniform random variables also have this underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. One might call the resulting values a draw from a Gaussian-Uniform Process. We could subsequently put these values through an inverse beta cdf, to obtain a draw from what could be called a Gaussian-Beta Process: the values would be a sample from beta random variables, again with an underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. We could also transform the uniform values with different inverse cdfs, which would give a sample from different random variables, with dependencies encoded by the Gaussian process. The above procedure is a means to generate samples from arbitrarily many random variables, with arbitrary marginal distributions, and desired dependencies. It is an example of how to use what we call a copula process – in this case, a Gaussian copula process, since a Gaussian copula describes the dependency structure of a ﬁnite number of samples. We now formally deﬁne a copula process. 2 Deﬁnition 2.1. Copula Process Let {Wt } be a collection of random variables indexed by t ∈ T , with marginal distribution functions Ft , and let Qt = Ft (Wt ). Further, let µ be a stochastic process measure with marginal distribution functions Gt , and joint distribution function H. Then Wt is copula process distributed with base measure µ, or Wt ∼ CP(µ), if and only if for all n ∈ N, ai ∈ R, n P( (−1) {Gti (Qti ) ≤ ai }) = Ht1 ,t2 ,...,tn (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ). (4) i=1 (−1) Each Qti ∼ Uniform(0, 1), and Gti is the quasi-inverse of Gti , as previously deﬁned. Deﬁnition 2.2. Gaussian Copula Process Wt is Gaussian copula process distributed if it is copula process distributed and the base measure µ is a Gaussian process. If there is a mapping Ψ such that Ψ(Wt ) ∼ GP(m(t), k(t, t )), then we write Wt ∼ GCP(Ψ, m(t), k(t, t )). For example, if we have Wt ∼ GCP with m(t) = 0 and k(t, t) = 1, then in the deﬁnition of a copula process, Gt = Φ, the standard univariate Gaussian cdf, and H is the usual GP joint distribution function. Supposing this GCP is a Gaussian-Beta process, then Ψ = Φ−1 ◦ FB , where FB is a univariate Beta cdf. One could similarly deﬁne other copula processes. We described generally how a copula process can be used to generate samples of arbitrarily many random variables with desired marginals and dependencies. We now develop a speciﬁc and practical application of this framework. We introduce a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), as an example of how to learn the joint distribution of arbitrarily many random variables, the marginals of these random variables, and to make predictions. To do this, we ﬁt a Gaussian copula process by using a type of Warped Gaussian Process [15]. However, our methodology varies substantially from Snelson et al. [15], since we are doing inference on latent variables as opposed to observations, which is a much greater undertaking that involves approximations, and we are doing so in a different context. 3 Gaussian Copula Process Volatility Assume we have a sequence of observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) at times t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) . The observations are random variables with different latent standard deviations. We therefore have n unobserved standard deviations, σ1 , . . . , σn , and want to learn the correlation structure between these standard deviations, and also to predict the distribution of σ∗ at some unrealised time t∗ . We model the standard deviation function as a Gaussian copula process: σt ∼ GCP(g −1 , 0, k(t, t )). (5) f (t) ∼ GP(m(t) = 0, k(t, t )) σ(t) = g(f (t), ω) (6) (7) y(t) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (t)), (8) Speciﬁcally, where g is a monotonic warping function, parametrized by ω. For each of the observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) we have corresponding GP latent function values f = (f1 , . . . , fn ) , where σ(ti ) = g(fi , ω), using the shorthand fi to mean f (ti ). σt ∼ GCP, because any ﬁnite sequence (σ1 , . . . , σp ) is distributed as a Gaussian copula: P (σ1 ≤ a1 , . . . , σp ≤ ap ) = P (g −1 (σ1 ) ≤ g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 (σp ) ≤ g −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (Φ = ΦΓ (Φ −1 (F (a1 )), . . . , Φ (u1 ), . . . , Φ −1 −1 (9) (F (ap ))) (up )) = C(u1 , . . . , up ), where Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf (supposing k(t, t) = 1), ΦΓ is a multivariate Gaussian cdf with covariance matrix Γij = cov(g −1 (σi ), g −1 (σj )), and F is the marginal distribution of 3 each σi . In (5), we have Ψ = g −1 , because it is g −1 which maps σt to a GP. The speciﬁcation in (5) is equivalently expressed by (6) and (7). With GCPV, the form of g is learned so that g −1 (σt ) is best modelled by a GP. By learning g, we learn the marginal of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)) for a ∈ R. Recently, a different sort of ‘kernel copula process’ has been used, where the marginals of the variables being modelled are not learned [16].1 Further, we also consider a more subtle and ﬂexible form of our model, where the function g itself is indexed by time: g = gt (f (t), ω). We only assume that the marginal distributions of σt are stationary over ‘small’ time periods, and for each of these time periods (5)-(7) hold true. We return to this in the ﬁnal discussion section. Here we have assumed that each observation, conditioned on knowing its variance, is normally distributed with zero mean. This is a common assumption in heteroscedastic models. The zero mean and normality assumptions can be relaxed and are not central to this paper. 4 Predictions with GCPV Ultimately, we wish to infer p(σ(t∗ )|y, z), where z = {θ, ω}, and θ are the hyperparameters of the GP covariance function. To do this, we sample from p(f∗ |y, z) = p(f∗ |f , θ)p(f |y, z)df (10) and then transform these samples by g. Letting (Cf )ij = δij g(fi , ω)2 , where δij is the Kronecker delta, Kij = k(ti , tj ), (k∗ )i = k(t∗ , ti ), we have p(f |y, z) = N (f ; 0, K)N (y; 0, Cf )/p(y|z), p(f∗ |f , θ) = N (k∗ K −1 f , k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ K −1 (11) k∗ ). (12) We also wish to learn z, which we can do by ﬁnding the z that maximizes the marginal likelihood, ˆ p(y|z) = p(y|f , ω)p(f |θ)df . (13) Unfortunately, for many functions g, (10) and (13) are intractable. Our methods of dealing with this can be used in very general circumstances, where one has a Gaussian process prior, but an (optionally parametrized) non-Gaussian likelihood. We use the Laplace approximation to estimate p(f |y, z) as a Gaussian. Then we can integrate (10) for a Gaussian approximation to p(f∗ |y, z), which we sample from to make predictions of σ∗ . Using Laplace, we can also ﬁnd an expression for an approximate marginal likelihood, which we maximize to determine z. Once we have found z with Laplace, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from p(f∗ |y, z), and compare that to using Laplace to sample from p(f∗ |y, z). In the supplement we relate this discussion to (9). 4.1 Laplace Approximation The goal is to approximate (11) with a Gaussian, so that we can evaluate (10) and (13) and make predictions. In doing so, we follow Rasmussen and Williams [11] in their treatment of Gaussian process classiﬁcation, except we use a parametrized likelihood, and modify Newton’s method. First, consider as an objective function the logarithm of an unnormalized (11): s(f |y, z) = log p(y|f , ω) + log p(f |θ). (14) ˆ The Laplace approximation uses a second order Taylor expansion about the f which maximizes ˆ, for which we use (14), to ﬁnd an approximate objective s(f |y, z). So the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd f ˜ Newton’s method. The Newton update is f new = f − ( s(f ))−1 s(f ). Differentiating (14), s(f |y, z) = s(f |y, z) = where W is the diagonal matrix − 1 log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 f log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 = −W − K −1 , log p(y|f , ω). Note added in proof : Also, for a very recent related model, see Rodr´guez et al. [17]. ı 4 (15) (16) If the likelihood function p(y|f , ω) is not log concave, then W may have negative entries. Vanhatalo et al. [18] found this to be problematic when doing Gaussian process regression with a Student-t ˆ likelihood. They instead use an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for ﬁnding f , and iterate ordered rank one Cholesky updates to evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. But EM can converge slowly, especially near a local optimum, and each of the rank one updates is vulnerable to numerical instability. With a small modiﬁcation of Newton’s method, we often get close to ˆ quadratic convergence for ﬁnding f , and can evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood in a numerically stable fashion, with no approximate Cholesky factors, and optimal computational requirements. Some comments are in the supplementary material but, in short, we use an approximate negative Hessian, − s ≈ M + K −1 , which is guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite, since M is formed on each iteration by zeroing the negative entries of W . For stability, we reformulate our 1 1 1 1 optimization in terms of B = I + M 2 KM 2 , and let Q = M 2 B −1 M 2 , b = M f + log p(y|f ), a = b − QKb. Since (K −1 + M )−1 = K − KQK, the Newton update becomes f new = Ka. ˆ With these updates we ﬁnd f and get an expression for s which we use to approximate (13) and ˜ (11). The approximate marginal likelihood q(y|z) is given by exp(˜)df . Taking its logarithm, s 1ˆ 1 ˆ log q(y|z) = − f af + log p(y|f ) − log |Bf |, (17) ˆ ˆ 2 2 ˆ ˆ where Bf is B evaluated at f , and af is a numerically stable evaluation of K −1 f . ˆ ˆ To learn the parameters z, we use conjugate gradient descent to maximize (17) with respect to z. ˆ ˆ Since f is a function of z, we initialize z, and update f every time we vary z. Once we have found an optimum z , we can make predictions. By exponentiating s, we ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to ˆ ˜ ˆ the posterior (11), q(f |y, z) = N (f , K − KQK). The product of this approximate posterior with p(f∗ |f ) is Gaussian. Integrating this product, we approximate p(f∗ |y, z) as ˆ q(f∗ |y, z) = N (k∗ log p(y|f ), k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ Qk∗ ). (18) Given n training observations, the cost of each Newton iteration is dominated by computing the cholesky decomposition of B, which takes O(n3 ) operations. The objective function typically changes by less than 10−6 after 3 iterations. Once Newton’s method has converged, it takes only O(1) operations to draw from q(f∗ |y, z) and make predictions. 4.2 Markov chain Monte Carlo We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from (11), so that we can later sample from p(σ∗ |y, z) to make predictions. Sampling from (11) is difﬁcult, because the variables f are strongly coupled by a Gaussian process prior. We use a new technique, Elliptical Slice Sampling [19], and ﬁnd it extremely effective for this purpose. It was speciﬁcally designed to sample from posteriors with correlated Gaussian priors. It has no free parameters, and jointly updates every element of f . For our setting, it is over 100 times as fast as axis aligned slice sampling with univariate updates. To make predictions, we take J samples of p(f |y, z), {f 1 , . . . , f J }, and then approximate (10) as a mixture of J Gaussians: J 1 p(f∗ |f i , θ). (19) p(f∗ |y, z) ≈ J i=1 Each of the Gaussians in this mixture have equal weight. So for each sample of f∗ |y, we uniformly choose a random p(f∗ |f i , θ) and draw a sample. In the limit J → ∞, we are sampling from the exact p(f∗ |y, z). Mapping these samples through g gives samples from p(σ∗ |y, z). After one O(n3 ) and one O(J) operation, a draw from (19) takes O(1) operations. 4.3 Warping Function The warping function, g, maps fi , a GP function value, to σi , a standard deviation. Since fi can take any value in R, and σi can take any non-negative real value, g : R → R+ . For each fi to correspond to a unique deviation, g must also be one-to-one. We use K g(x, ω) = aj log[exp[bj (x + cj )] + 1], j=1 5 aj , bj > 0. (20) This is monotonic, positive, inﬁnitely differentiable, asymptotic towards zero as x → −∞, and K tends to ( j=1 aj bj )x as x → ∞. In practice, it is useful to add a small constant to (20), to avoid rare situations where the parameters ω are trained to make g extremely small for certain inputs, at the expense of a good overall ﬁt; this can happen when the parameters ω are learned by optimizing a likelihood. A suitable constant could be one tenth the absolute value of the smallest nonzero observation. By inferring the parameters of the warping function, or distributions of these parameters, we are learning a transformation which will best model σt with a Gaussian process. The more ﬂexible the warping function, the more potential there is to improve the GCPV ﬁt – in other words, the better we can estimate the ‘perfect’ transformation. To test the importance of this ﬂexibility, we also try a simple unparametrized warping function, g(x) = ex . In related work, Goldberg et al. [20] place a GP prior on the log noise level in a standard GP regression model on observations, except for inference they use Gibbs sampling, and a high level of ‘jitter’ for conditioning. Once g is trained, we can infer the marginal distribution of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)), for a ∈ R. This suggests an alternate way to initialize g: we can initialize F as a mixture of Gaussians, and then map through Φ−1 to ﬁnd g −1 . Since mixtures of Gaussians are dense in the set of probability distributions, we could in principle ﬁnd the ‘perfect’ g using an inﬁnite mixture of Gaussians [21]. 5 Experiments In our experiments, we predict the latent standard deviations σ of observations y at times t, and also σ∗ at unobserved times t∗ . To do this, we use two versions of GCPV. The ﬁrst variant, which we simply refer to as GCPV, uses the warping function (20) with K = 1, and squared exponential covariance function, k(t, t ) = A exp(−(t−t )2 /l2 ), with A = 1. The second variant, which we call GP-EXP, uses the unparametrized warping function ex , and the same covariance function, except the amplitude A is a trained hyperparameter. The other hyperparameter l is called the lengthscale of the covariance function. The greater l, the greater the covariance between σt and σt+a for a ∈ R. We train hyperparameters by maximizing the Laplace approximate log marginal likelihood (17). We then sample from p(f∗ |y) using the Laplace approximation (18). We also do this using MCMC (19) with J = 10000, after discarding a previous 10000 samples of p(f |y) as burn-in. We pass 2 these samples of f∗ |y through g and g 2 to draw from p(σ∗ |y) and p(σ∗ |y), and compute the sample mean and variance of σ∗ |y. We use the sample mean as a point predictor, and the sample variance for error bounds on these predictions, and we use 10000 samples to compute these quantities. For GCPV we use Laplace and MCMC for inference, but for GP-EXP we only use Laplace. We compare predictions to GARCH(1,1), which has been shown in extensive and recent reviews to be competitive with other GARCH variants, and more sophisticated models [5, 6, 7]. GARCH(p,q) speciﬁes y(t) ∼ p 2 2 N (0, σ 2 (t)), and lets the variance be a deterministic function of the past: σt = a0 + i=1 ai yt−i + q 2 j=1 bj σt−j . We use the Matlab Econometrics Toolbox implementation of GARCH, where the parameters a0 , ai and bj are estimated using a constrained maximum likelihood. We make forecasts of volatility, and we predict historical volatility. By ‘historical volatility’ we mean the volatility at observed time points, or between these points. Uncovering historical volatility is important. It could, for instance, be used to study what causes ﬂuctuations in the stock market, or to understand physical systems. To evaluate our model, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the true variance, or proxy for the truth, and the predicted variance. Although likelihood has advantages, we are limited in space, and we wish to harmonize with the econometrics literature, and other assessments of volatility models, where MSE is the standard. In a similar assessment of volatility models, Brownlees et al. [7] found that MSE and quasi-likelihood rankings were comparable. When the true variance is unknown we follow Brownlees et al. [7] and use squared observations as a proxy for the truth, to compare our model to GARCH.2 The more observations, the more reliable these performance estimates will be. However, not many observations (e.g. 100) are needed for a stable ranking of competing models; in Brownlees et al. [7], the rankings derived from high frequency squared observations are similar to those derived using daily squared observations. 2 Since each observation y is assumed to have zero mean and variance σ 2 , E[y 2 ] = σ 2 . 6 5.1 Simulations We simulate observations from N (0, σ 2 (t)), using σ(t) = sin(t) cos(t2 ) + 1, at t = (0, 0.02, 0.04, . . . , 4) . We call this data set TRIG. We also simulate using a standard deviation that jumps from 0.1 to 7 and back, at times t = (0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 6) . We call this data set JUMP. To forecast, we use all observations up until the current time point, and make 1, 7, and 30 step ahead predictions. So, for example, in TRIG we start by observing t = 0, and make forecasts at t = 0.02, 0.14, 0.60. Then we observe t = 0, 0.02 and make forecasts at t = 0.04, 0.16, 0.62, and so on, until all data points have been observed. For historical volatility, we predict the latent σt at the observation times, which is safe since we are comparing to the true volatility, which is not used in training; the results are similar if we interpolate. Figure 1 panels a) and b) show the true volatility for TRIG and JUMP respectively, alongside GCPV Laplace, GCPV MCMC, GP-EXP Laplace, and GARCH(1,1) predictions of historical volatility. Table 1 shows the results for forecasting and historical volatility. In panel a) we see that GCPV more accurately captures the dependencies between σ at different times points than GARCH: if we manually decrease the lengthscale in the GCPV covariance function, we can replicate the erratic GARCH behaviour, which inaccurately suggests that the covariance between σt and σt+a decreases quickly with increases in a. We also see that GCPV with an unparametrized exponential warping function tends to overestimates peaks and underestimate troughs. In panel b), the volatility is extremely difﬁcult to reconstruct or forecast – with no warning it will immediately and dramatically increase or decrease. This behaviour is not suited to a smooth squared exponential covariance function. Nevertheless, GCPV outperforms GARCH, especially in regions of low volatility. We also see this in panel a) for t ∈ (1.5, 2). GARCH is known to respond slowly to large returns, and to overpredict volatility [22]. In JUMP, the greater the peaks, and the smaller the troughs, the more GARCH suffers, while GCPV is mostly robust to these changes. 5.2 Financial Data The returns on the daily exchange rate between the Deutschmark (DM) and the Great Britain Pound (GBP) from 1984 to 1992 have become a benchmark for assessing the performance of GARCH models [8, 9, 10]. This exchange data, which we refer to as DMGBP, can be obtained from www.datastream.com, and the returns are calculated as rt = log(Pt+1 /Pt ), where Pt is the number of DM to GBP on day t. The returns are assumed to have a zero mean function. We use a rolling window of the previous 120 days of returns to make 1, 7, and 30 day ahead volatility forecasts, starting at the beginning of January 1988, and ending at the beginning of January 1992 (659 trading days). Every 7 days, we retrain the parameters of GCPV and GARCH. Every time we retrain parameters, we predict historical volatility over the past 120 days. The average MSE for these historical predictions is given in Table 1, although they should be observed with caution; unlike with the simulations, the DMGBP historical predictions are trained using the same data they are assessed on. In Figure 1c), we see that the GARCH one day ahead forecasts are lifted above the GCPV forecasts, but unlike in the simulations, they are now operating on a similar lengthscale. This suggests that GARCH could still be overpredicting volatility, but that GCPV has adapted its estimation of how σt and σt+a correlate with one another. Since GARCH is suited to this ﬁnancial data set, it is reassuring that GCPV predictions have a similar time varying structure. Overall, GCPV and GARCH are competitive with one another for forecasting currency exchange returns, as seen in Table 1. Moreover, a learned warping function g outperforms an unparametrized one, and a full Laplace solution is comparable to using MCMC for inference, in accuracy and speed. This is also true for the simulations. Therefore we recommend whichever is more convenient to implement. 6 Discussion We deﬁned a copula process, and as an example, developed a stochastic volatility model, GCPV, which can outperform GARCH. With GCPV, the volatility σt is distributed as a Gaussian Copula Process, which separates the modelling of the dependencies between volatilities at different times from their marginal distributions – arguably the most useful property of a copula. Further, GCPV ﬁts the marginals in the Gaussian copula process by learning a warping function. If we had simply chosen an unparametrized exponential warping function, we would incorrectly be assuming that the log 7 Table 1: MSE for predicting volatility.

Indeed, for the DMGBP data, we trained the warping function g over a 120 day period, and mapped its inverse through the univariate standard Gaussian cdf Φ, and differenced, to estimate the marginal probability density function (pdf) of σt over this period. The learned marginal pdf, shown in Figure 1d), is similar to a Gamma(4.15,0.00045) distribution. However, in using a rolling window to retrain the parameters of g, we do not assume that the marginals of σt are stationary; we have a time changing warping function. While GARCH is successful, and its simplicity is attractive, our model is also simple and has a number of advantages. We can effortlessly handle missing data, we can easily incorporate covariates other than time (like interest rates) in our covariance function, and we can choose from a rich class of covariance functions – squared exponential, Brownian motion, Mat´ rn, periodic, etc. In fact, the e volatility of high frequency intradaily returns on equity indices and currency exchanges is cyclical [23], and GCPV with a periodic covariance function is uniquely well suited to this data. And the parameters of GCPV, like the covariance function lengthscale, or the learned warping function, provide insight into the underlying source of volatility, unlike the parameters of GARCH. Finally, copulas are rapidly becoming popular in applications, but often only bivariate copulas are being used. With our copula process one can learn the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We hope the Gaussian Copula Process Volatility model will encourage other applications of copula processes. More generally, we hope our work will help bring together the machine learning and econometrics communities.

The estimators are calculated as the sum of p-th powers of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of the ‘generalized nearest-neighbor’ graph of the sample and the empirical copula of the sample respectively. For the ﬁrst time, we prove the almost sure consistency of these estimators and upper bounds on their rates of convergence, the latter of which under the assumption that the density underlying the sample is Lipschitz continuous.

<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions are often used to enhance the robustness of regression and classiﬁcation methods to outliers in output space. Often, however, we are confronted with “outliers” in input space, which are isolated observations in sparsely populated regions. We show that heavy-tailed stochastic processes (which we construct from Gaussian processes via a copula), can be used to improve robustness of regression and classiﬁcation estimators to such outliers by selectively shrinking them more strongly in sparse regions than in dense regions. We carry out a theoretical analysis to show that selective shrinkage occurs when the marginals of the heavy-tailed process have sufﬁciently heavy tails. The analysis is complemented by experiments on biological data which indicate signiﬁcant improvements of estimates in sparse regions while producing competitive results in dense regions. 1</p><p>5 0.091641374 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_Inference_by_Compilation_to_Arithmetic_Circuits.html">32 nips-2010-Approximate Inference by Compilation to Arithmetic Circuits</a></p>

In this paper, we introduce the ﬁrst ever approximate inference methods using ACs, for domains where exact inference remains intractable. We propose and evaluate a variety of techniques based on exact compilation, forward sampling, AC structure learning, Markov network parameter learning, variational inference, and Gibbs sampling. In experiments on eight challenging real-world domains, we ﬁnd that the methods based on sampling and learning work best: one such method (AC2 -F) is faster and usually more accurate than loopy belief propagation, mean ﬁeld, and Gibbs sampling; another (AC2 -G) has a running time similar to Gibbs sampling but is consistently more accurate than all baselines. 1</p><p>6 0.063665316 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Inference_with_Multivariate_Heavy-Tails_in_Linear_Models.html">126 nips-2010-Inference with Multivariate Heavy-Tails in Linear Models</a></p>

Using a novel copula-based reparameterization of a conditional density, joined with a graph that encodes independencies, our model offers great ﬂexibility in modeling high-dimensional densities, while maintaining control over the form of the univariate marginals. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework for generalization over standard Bayesian networks as well as tree structured copula models for varied real-life domains that are of substantially higher dimension than those typically considered in the copula literature. 1</p><p>2 0.83350044 <a title="53-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-Copula_Processes.html">54 nips-2010-Copula Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Wilson, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We deﬁne a copula process which describes the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. As an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), to predict the latent standard deviations of a sequence of random variables. To make predictions we use Bayesian inference, with the Laplace approximation, and with Markov chain Monte Carlo as an alternative. We ﬁnd our model can outperform GARCH on simulated and ﬁnancial data. And unlike GARCH, GCPV can easily handle missing data, incorporate covariates other than time, and model a rich class of covariance structures. Imagine measuring the distance of a rocket as it leaves Earth, and wanting to know how these measurements correlate with one another. How much does the value of the measurement at ﬁfteen minutes depend on the measurement at ﬁve minutes? Once we’ve learned this correlation structure, suppose we want to compare it to the dependence between measurements of the rocket’s velocity. To do this, it is convenient to separate dependence from the marginal distributions of our measurements. At any given time, a rocket’s distance from Earth could have a Gamma distribution, while its velocity could have a Gaussian distribution. And separating dependence from marginal distributions is precisely what a copula function does. While copulas have recently become popular, especially in ﬁnancial applications [1, 2], as Nelsen [3] writes, “the study of copulas and the role they play in probability, statistics, and stochastic processes is a subject still in its infancy. There are many open problems. . . ” Typically only bivariate (and recently trivariate) copulas are being used and studied. In our introductory example, we are interested in learning the correlations in different stochastic processes, and comparing them. It would therefore be useful to have a copula process, which can describe the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We deﬁne such a process. And as an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV). In doing so, we provide a Bayesian framework for the learning the marginal distributions and dependency structure of what we call a Gaussian copula process. The volatility of a random variable is its standard deviation. Stochastic volatility models are used to predict the volatilities of a heteroscedastic sequence – a sequence of random variables with different variances, like distance measurements of a rocket as it leaves the Earth. As the rocket gets further away, the variance on the measurements increases. Heteroscedasticity is especially important in econometrics; the returns on equity indices, like the S&P; 500, or on currency exchanges, are heteroscedastic. Indeed, in 2003, Robert Engle won the Nobel Prize in economics “for methods of analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility”. GARCH [4], a generalized version of Engle’s ARCH, is arguably unsurpassed for predicting the volatility of returns on equity indices and currency exchanges [5, 6, 7]. GCPV can outperform GARCH, and is competitive on ﬁnancial data that especially suits GARCH [8, 9, 10]. Before discussing GCPV, we ﬁrst introduce copulas and the copula process. For a review of Gaussian processes, see Rasmussen and Williams [11]. ∗ † http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/andrew Also at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University. 1 1 Copulas Copulas are important because they separate the dependency structure between random variables from their marginal distributions. Intuitively, we can describe the dependency structure of any multivariate joint distribution H(x1 , . . . , xn ) = P (X1 ≤ x1 , . . . Xn ≤ xn ) through a two step process. First we take each univariate random variable Xi and transform it through its cumulative distribution function (cdf) Fi to get Ui = Fi (Xi ), a uniform random variable. We then express the dependencies between these transformed variables through the n-copula C(u1 , . . . , un ). Formally, an n-copula C : [0, 1]n → [0, 1] is a multivariate cdf with uniform univariate marginals: C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = P (U1 ≤ u1 , U2 ≤ u2 , . . . , Un ≤ un ), where U1 , U2 , . . . , Un are standard uniform random variables. Sklar [12] precisely expressed our intuition in the theorem below. Theorem 1.1. Sklar’s theorem Let H be an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . Then there exists an n-copula C such that for all (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ [−∞, ∞]n , H(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = C(F1 (x1 ), F2 (x2 ), . . . , Fn (xn )) = C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ). (1) If F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are all continuous then C is unique; otherwise C is uniquely determined on Range F1 × Range F2 × · · · × Range Fn . Conversely, if C is an n-copula and F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are distribution functions, then the function H is an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . (−1) As a corollary, if Fi (u) = inf{x : F (x) ≥ u}, the quasi-inverse of Fi , then for all u1 , u2 , . . . , un ∈ [0, 1]n , (−1) C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = H(F1 (−1) (u1 ), F2 (−1) (u2 ), . . . , Fn (un )). (2) In other words, (2) can be used to construct a copula. For example, the bivariate Gaussian copula is deﬁned as C(u, v) = Φρ (Φ−1 (u), Φ−1 (v)), (3) where Φρ is a bivariate Gaussian cdf with correlation coefﬁcient ρ, and Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf. Li [2] popularised the bivariate Gaussian copula, by showing how it could be used to study ﬁnancial risk and default correlation, using credit derivatives as an example. By substituting F (x) for u and G(y) for v in equation (3), we have a bivariate distribution H(x, y), with a Gaussian dependency structure, and marginals F and G. Regardless of F and G, the resulting H(x, y) can still be uniquely expressed as a Gaussian copula, so long as F and G are continuous. It is then a copula itself that captures the underlying dependencies between random variables, regardless of their marginal distributions. For this reason, copulas have been called dependence functions [13, 14]. Nelsen [3] contains an extensive discussion of copulas. 2 Copula Processes Imagine choosing a covariance function, and then drawing a sample function at some ﬁnite number of points from a Gaussian process. The result is a sample from a collection of Gaussian random variables, with a dependency structure encoded by the speciﬁed covariance function. Now, suppose we transform each of these values through a univariate Gaussian cdf, such that we have a sample from a collection of uniform random variables. These uniform random variables also have this underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. One might call the resulting values a draw from a Gaussian-Uniform Process. We could subsequently put these values through an inverse beta cdf, to obtain a draw from what could be called a Gaussian-Beta Process: the values would be a sample from beta random variables, again with an underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. We could also transform the uniform values with different inverse cdfs, which would give a sample from different random variables, with dependencies encoded by the Gaussian process. The above procedure is a means to generate samples from arbitrarily many random variables, with arbitrary marginal distributions, and desired dependencies. It is an example of how to use what we call a copula process – in this case, a Gaussian copula process, since a Gaussian copula describes the dependency structure of a ﬁnite number of samples. We now formally deﬁne a copula process. 2 Deﬁnition 2.1. Copula Process Let {Wt } be a collection of random variables indexed by t ∈ T , with marginal distribution functions Ft , and let Qt = Ft (Wt ). Further, let µ be a stochastic process measure with marginal distribution functions Gt , and joint distribution function H. Then Wt is copula process distributed with base measure µ, or Wt ∼ CP(µ), if and only if for all n ∈ N, ai ∈ R, n P( (−1) {Gti (Qti ) ≤ ai }) = Ht1 ,t2 ,...,tn (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ). (4) i=1 (−1) Each Qti ∼ Uniform(0, 1), and Gti is the quasi-inverse of Gti , as previously deﬁned. Deﬁnition 2.2. Gaussian Copula Process Wt is Gaussian copula process distributed if it is copula process distributed and the base measure µ is a Gaussian process. If there is a mapping Ψ such that Ψ(Wt ) ∼ GP(m(t), k(t, t )), then we write Wt ∼ GCP(Ψ, m(t), k(t, t )). For example, if we have Wt ∼ GCP with m(t) = 0 and k(t, t) = 1, then in the deﬁnition of a copula process, Gt = Φ, the standard univariate Gaussian cdf, and H is the usual GP joint distribution function. Supposing this GCP is a Gaussian-Beta process, then Ψ = Φ−1 ◦ FB , where FB is a univariate Beta cdf. One could similarly deﬁne other copula processes. We described generally how a copula process can be used to generate samples of arbitrarily many random variables with desired marginals and dependencies. We now develop a speciﬁc and practical application of this framework. We introduce a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), as an example of how to learn the joint distribution of arbitrarily many random variables, the marginals of these random variables, and to make predictions. To do this, we ﬁt a Gaussian copula process by using a type of Warped Gaussian Process [15]. However, our methodology varies substantially from Snelson et al. [15], since we are doing inference on latent variables as opposed to observations, which is a much greater undertaking that involves approximations, and we are doing so in a different context. 3 Gaussian Copula Process Volatility Assume we have a sequence of observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) at times t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) . The observations are random variables with different latent standard deviations. We therefore have n unobserved standard deviations, σ1 , . . . , σn , and want to learn the correlation structure between these standard deviations, and also to predict the distribution of σ∗ at some unrealised time t∗ . We model the standard deviation function as a Gaussian copula process: σt ∼ GCP(g −1 , 0, k(t, t )). (5) f (t) ∼ GP(m(t) = 0, k(t, t )) σ(t) = g(f (t), ω) (6) (7) y(t) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (t)), (8) Speciﬁcally, where g is a monotonic warping function, parametrized by ω. For each of the observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) we have corresponding GP latent function values f = (f1 , . . . , fn ) , where σ(ti ) = g(fi , ω), using the shorthand fi to mean f (ti ). σt ∼ GCP, because any ﬁnite sequence (σ1 , . . . , σp ) is distributed as a Gaussian copula: P (σ1 ≤ a1 , . . . , σp ≤ ap ) = P (g −1 (σ1 ) ≤ g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 (σp ) ≤ g −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (Φ = ΦΓ (Φ −1 (F (a1 )), . . . , Φ (u1 ), . . . , Φ −1 −1 (9) (F (ap ))) (up )) = C(u1 , . . . , up ), where Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf (supposing k(t, t) = 1), ΦΓ is a multivariate Gaussian cdf with covariance matrix Γij = cov(g −1 (σi ), g −1 (σj )), and F is the marginal distribution of 3 each σi . In (5), we have Ψ = g −1 , because it is g −1 which maps σt to a GP. The speciﬁcation in (5) is equivalently expressed by (6) and (7). With GCPV, the form of g is learned so that g −1 (σt ) is best modelled by a GP. By learning g, we learn the marginal of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)) for a ∈ R. Recently, a different sort of ‘kernel copula process’ has been used, where the marginals of the variables being modelled are not learned [16].1 Further, we also consider a more subtle and ﬂexible form of our model, where the function g itself is indexed by time: g = gt (f (t), ω). We only assume that the marginal distributions of σt are stationary over ‘small’ time periods, and for each of these time periods (5)-(7) hold true. We return to this in the ﬁnal discussion section. Here we have assumed that each observation, conditioned on knowing its variance, is normally distributed with zero mean. This is a common assumption in heteroscedastic models. The zero mean and normality assumptions can be relaxed and are not central to this paper. 4 Predictions with GCPV Ultimately, we wish to infer p(σ(t∗ )|y, z), where z = {θ, ω}, and θ are the hyperparameters of the GP covariance function. To do this, we sample from p(f∗ |y, z) = p(f∗ |f , θ)p(f |y, z)df (10) and then transform these samples by g. Letting (Cf )ij = δij g(fi , ω)2 , where δij is the Kronecker delta, Kij = k(ti , tj ), (k∗ )i = k(t∗ , ti ), we have p(f |y, z) = N (f ; 0, K)N (y; 0, Cf )/p(y|z), p(f∗ |f , θ) = N (k∗ K −1 f , k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ K −1 (11) k∗ ). (12) We also wish to learn z, which we can do by ﬁnding the z that maximizes the marginal likelihood, ˆ p(y|z) = p(y|f , ω)p(f |θ)df . (13) Unfortunately, for many functions g, (10) and (13) are intractable. Our methods of dealing with this can be used in very general circumstances, where one has a Gaussian process prior, but an (optionally parametrized) non-Gaussian likelihood. We use the Laplace approximation to estimate p(f |y, z) as a Gaussian. Then we can integrate (10) for a Gaussian approximation to p(f∗ |y, z), which we sample from to make predictions of σ∗ . Using Laplace, we can also ﬁnd an expression for an approximate marginal likelihood, which we maximize to determine z. Once we have found z with Laplace, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from p(f∗ |y, z), and compare that to using Laplace to sample from p(f∗ |y, z). In the supplement we relate this discussion to (9). 4.1 Laplace Approximation The goal is to approximate (11) with a Gaussian, so that we can evaluate (10) and (13) and make predictions. In doing so, we follow Rasmussen and Williams [11] in their treatment of Gaussian process classiﬁcation, except we use a parametrized likelihood, and modify Newton’s method. First, consider as an objective function the logarithm of an unnormalized (11): s(f |y, z) = log p(y|f , ω) + log p(f |θ). (14) ˆ The Laplace approximation uses a second order Taylor expansion about the f which maximizes ˆ, for which we use (14), to ﬁnd an approximate objective s(f |y, z). So the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd f ˜ Newton’s method. The Newton update is f new = f − ( s(f ))−1 s(f ). Differentiating (14), s(f |y, z) = s(f |y, z) = where W is the diagonal matrix − 1 log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 f log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 = −W − K −1 , log p(y|f , ω). Note added in proof : Also, for a very recent related model, see Rodr´guez et al. [17]. ı 4 (15) (16) If the likelihood function p(y|f , ω) is not log concave, then W may have negative entries. Vanhatalo et al. [18] found this to be problematic when doing Gaussian process regression with a Student-t ˆ likelihood. They instead use an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for ﬁnding f , and iterate ordered rank one Cholesky updates to evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. But EM can converge slowly, especially near a local optimum, and each of the rank one updates is vulnerable to numerical instability. With a small modiﬁcation of Newton’s method, we often get close to ˆ quadratic convergence for ﬁnding f , and can evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood in a numerically stable fashion, with no approximate Cholesky factors, and optimal computational requirements. Some comments are in the supplementary material but, in short, we use an approximate negative Hessian, − s ≈ M + K −1 , which is guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite, since M is formed on each iteration by zeroing the negative entries of W . For stability, we reformulate our 1 1 1 1 optimization in terms of B = I + M 2 KM 2 , and let Q = M 2 B −1 M 2 , b = M f + log p(y|f ), a = b − QKb. Since (K −1 + M )−1 = K − KQK, the Newton update becomes f new = Ka. ˆ With these updates we ﬁnd f and get an expression for s which we use to approximate (13) and ˜ (11). The approximate marginal likelihood q(y|z) is given by exp(˜)df . Taking its logarithm, s 1ˆ 1 ˆ log q(y|z) = − f af + log p(y|f ) − log |Bf |, (17) ˆ ˆ 2 2 ˆ ˆ where Bf is B evaluated at f , and af is a numerically stable evaluation of K −1 f . ˆ ˆ To learn the parameters z, we use conjugate gradient descent to maximize (17) with respect to z. ˆ ˆ Since f is a function of z, we initialize z, and update f every time we vary z. Once we have found an optimum z , we can make predictions. By exponentiating s, we ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to ˆ ˜ ˆ the posterior (11), q(f |y, z) = N (f , K − KQK). The product of this approximate posterior with p(f∗ |f ) is Gaussian. Integrating this product, we approximate p(f∗ |y, z) as ˆ q(f∗ |y, z) = N (k∗ log p(y|f ), k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ Qk∗ ). (18) Given n training observations, the cost of each Newton iteration is dominated by computing the cholesky decomposition of B, which takes O(n3 ) operations. The objective function typically changes by less than 10−6 after 3 iterations. Once Newton’s method has converged, it takes only O(1) operations to draw from q(f∗ |y, z) and make predictions. 4.2 Markov chain Monte Carlo We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from (11), so that we can later sample from p(σ∗ |y, z) to make predictions. Sampling from (11) is difﬁcult, because the variables f are strongly coupled by a Gaussian process prior. We use a new technique, Elliptical Slice Sampling [19], and ﬁnd it extremely effective for this purpose. It was speciﬁcally designed to sample from posteriors with correlated Gaussian priors. It has no free parameters, and jointly updates every element of f . For our setting, it is over 100 times as fast as axis aligned slice sampling with univariate updates. To make predictions, we take J samples of p(f |y, z), {f 1 , . . . , f J }, and then approximate (10) as a mixture of J Gaussians: J 1 p(f∗ |f i , θ). (19) p(f∗ |y, z) ≈ J i=1 Each of the Gaussians in this mixture have equal weight. So for each sample of f∗ |y, we uniformly choose a random p(f∗ |f i , θ) and draw a sample. In the limit J → ∞, we are sampling from the exact p(f∗ |y, z). Mapping these samples through g gives samples from p(σ∗ |y, z). After one O(n3 ) and one O(J) operation, a draw from (19) takes O(1) operations. 4.3 Warping Function The warping function, g, maps fi , a GP function value, to σi , a standard deviation. Since fi can take any value in R, and σi can take any non-negative real value, g : R → R+ . For each fi to correspond to a unique deviation, g must also be one-to-one. We use K g(x, ω) = aj log[exp[bj (x + cj )] + 1], j=1 5 aj , bj > 0. (20) This is monotonic, positive, inﬁnitely differentiable, asymptotic towards zero as x → −∞, and K tends to ( j=1 aj bj )x as x → ∞. In practice, it is useful to add a small constant to (20), to avoid rare situations where the parameters ω are trained to make g extremely small for certain inputs, at the expense of a good overall ﬁt; this can happen when the parameters ω are learned by optimizing a likelihood. A suitable constant could be one tenth the absolute value of the smallest nonzero observation. By inferring the parameters of the warping function, or distributions of these parameters, we are learning a transformation which will best model σt with a Gaussian process. The more ﬂexible the warping function, the more potential there is to improve the GCPV ﬁt – in other words, the better we can estimate the ‘perfect’ transformation. To test the importance of this ﬂexibility, we also try a simple unparametrized warping function, g(x) = ex . In related work, Goldberg et al. [20] place a GP prior on the log noise level in a standard GP regression model on observations, except for inference they use Gibbs sampling, and a high level of ‘jitter’ for conditioning. Once g is trained, we can infer the marginal distribution of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)), for a ∈ R. This suggests an alternate way to initialize g: we can initialize F as a mixture of Gaussians, and then map through Φ−1 to ﬁnd g −1 . Since mixtures of Gaussians are dense in the set of probability distributions, we could in principle ﬁnd the ‘perfect’ g using an inﬁnite mixture of Gaussians [21]. 5 Experiments In our experiments, we predict the latent standard deviations σ of observations y at times t, and also σ∗ at unobserved times t∗ . To do this, we use two versions of GCPV. The ﬁrst variant, which we simply refer to as GCPV, uses the warping function (20) with K = 1, and squared exponential covariance function, k(t, t ) = A exp(−(t−t )2 /l2 ), with A = 1. The second variant, which we call GP-EXP, uses the unparametrized warping function ex , and the same covariance function, except the amplitude A is a trained hyperparameter. The other hyperparameter l is called the lengthscale of the covariance function. The greater l, the greater the covariance between σt and σt+a for a ∈ R. We train hyperparameters by maximizing the Laplace approximate log marginal likelihood (17). We then sample from p(f∗ |y) using the Laplace approximation (18). We also do this using MCMC (19) with J = 10000, after discarding a previous 10000 samples of p(f |y) as burn-in. We pass 2 these samples of f∗ |y through g and g 2 to draw from p(σ∗ |y) and p(σ∗ |y), and compute the sample mean and variance of σ∗ |y. We use the sample mean as a point predictor, and the sample variance for error bounds on these predictions, and we use 10000 samples to compute these quantities. For GCPV we use Laplace and MCMC for inference, but for GP-EXP we only use Laplace. We compare predictions to GARCH(1,1), which has been shown in extensive and recent reviews to be competitive with other GARCH variants, and more sophisticated models [5, 6, 7]. GARCH(p,q) speciﬁes y(t) ∼ p 2 2 N (0, σ 2 (t)), and lets the variance be a deterministic function of the past: σt = a0 + i=1 ai yt−i + q 2 j=1 bj σt−j . We use the Matlab Econometrics Toolbox implementation of GARCH, where the parameters a0 , ai and bj are estimated using a constrained maximum likelihood. We make forecasts of volatility, and we predict historical volatility. By ‘historical volatility’ we mean the volatility at observed time points, or between these points. Uncovering historical volatility is important. It could, for instance, be used to study what causes ﬂuctuations in the stock market, or to understand physical systems. To evaluate our model, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the true variance, or proxy for the truth, and the predicted variance. Although likelihood has advantages, we are limited in space, and we wish to harmonize with the econometrics literature, and other assessments of volatility models, where MSE is the standard. In a similar assessment of volatility models, Brownlees et al. [7] found that MSE and quasi-likelihood rankings were comparable. When the true variance is unknown we follow Brownlees et al. [7] and use squared observations as a proxy for the truth, to compare our model to GARCH.2 The more observations, the more reliable these performance estimates will be. However, not many observations (e.g. 100) are needed for a stable ranking of competing models; in Brownlees et al. [7], the rankings derived from high frequency squared observations are similar to those derived using daily squared observations. 2 Since each observation y is assumed to have zero mean and variance σ 2 , E[y 2 ] = σ 2 . 6 5.1 Simulations We simulate observations from N (0, σ 2 (t)), using σ(t) = sin(t) cos(t2 ) + 1, at t = (0, 0.02, 0.04, . . . , 4) . We call this data set TRIG. We also simulate using a standard deviation that jumps from 0.1 to 7 and back, at times t = (0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 6) . We call this data set JUMP. To forecast, we use all observations up until the current time point, and make 1, 7, and 30 step ahead predictions. So, for example, in TRIG we start by observing t = 0, and make forecasts at t = 0.02, 0.14, 0.60. Then we observe t = 0, 0.02 and make forecasts at t = 0.04, 0.16, 0.62, and so on, until all data points have been observed. For historical volatility, we predict the latent σt at the observation times, which is safe since we are comparing to the true volatility, which is not used in training; the results are similar if we interpolate. Figure 1 panels a) and b) show the true volatility for TRIG and JUMP respectively, alongside GCPV Laplace, GCPV MCMC, GP-EXP Laplace, and GARCH(1,1) predictions of historical volatility. Table 1 shows the results for forecasting and historical volatility. In panel a) we see that GCPV more accurately captures the dependencies between σ at different times points than GARCH: if we manually decrease the lengthscale in the GCPV covariance function, we can replicate the erratic GARCH behaviour, which inaccurately suggests that the covariance between σt and σt+a decreases quickly with increases in a. We also see that GCPV with an unparametrized exponential warping function tends to overestimates peaks and underestimate troughs. In panel b), the volatility is extremely difﬁcult to reconstruct or forecast – with no warning it will immediately and dramatically increase or decrease. This behaviour is not suited to a smooth squared exponential covariance function. Nevertheless, GCPV outperforms GARCH, especially in regions of low volatility. We also see this in panel a) for t ∈ (1.5, 2). GARCH is known to respond slowly to large returns, and to overpredict volatility [22]. In JUMP, the greater the peaks, and the smaller the troughs, the more GARCH suffers, while GCPV is mostly robust to these changes. 5.2 Financial Data The returns on the daily exchange rate between the Deutschmark (DM) and the Great Britain Pound (GBP) from 1984 to 1992 have become a benchmark for assessing the performance of GARCH models [8, 9, 10]. This exchange data, which we refer to as DMGBP, can be obtained from www.datastream.com, and the returns are calculated as rt = log(Pt+1 /Pt ), where Pt is the number of DM to GBP on day t. The returns are assumed to have a zero mean function. We use a rolling window of the previous 120 days of returns to make 1, 7, and 30 day ahead volatility forecasts, starting at the beginning of January 1988, and ending at the beginning of January 1992 (659 trading days). Every 7 days, we retrain the parameters of GCPV and GARCH. Every time we retrain parameters, we predict historical volatility over the past 120 days. The average MSE for these historical predictions is given in Table 1, although they should be observed with caution; unlike with the simulations, the DMGBP historical predictions are trained using the same data they are assessed on. In Figure 1c), we see that the GARCH one day ahead forecasts are lifted above the GCPV forecasts, but unlike in the simulations, they are now operating on a similar lengthscale. This suggests that GARCH could still be overpredicting volatility, but that GCPV has adapted its estimation of how σt and σt+a correlate with one another. Since GARCH is suited to this ﬁnancial data set, it is reassuring that GCPV predictions have a similar time varying structure. Overall, GCPV and GARCH are competitive with one another for forecasting currency exchange returns, as seen in Table 1. Moreover, a learned warping function g outperforms an unparametrized one, and a full Laplace solution is comparable to using MCMC for inference, in accuracy and speed. This is also true for the simulations. Therefore we recommend whichever is more convenient to implement. 6 Discussion We deﬁned a copula process, and as an example, developed a stochastic volatility model, GCPV, which can outperform GARCH. With GCPV, the volatility σt is distributed as a Gaussian Copula Process, which separates the modelling of the dependencies between volatilities at different times from their marginal distributions – arguably the most useful property of a copula. Further, GCPV ﬁts the marginals in the Gaussian copula process by learning a warping function. If we had simply chosen an unparametrized exponential warping function, we would incorrectly be assuming that the log 7 Table 1: MSE for predicting volatility.

In d), a black line and a dashed blue line respectively show the GCPV learned marginal pdf of σt in DMGBP and a Gamma(4.15,0.00045) pdf. volatilities are marginally Gaussian distributed. Indeed, for the DMGBP data, we trained the warping function g over a 120 day period, and mapped its inverse through the univariate standard Gaussian cdf Φ, and differenced, to estimate the marginal probability density function (pdf) of σt over this period. The learned marginal pdf, shown in Figure 1d), is similar to a Gamma(4.15,0.00045) distribution. However, in using a rolling window to retrain the parameters of g, we do not assume that the marginals of σt are stationary; we have a time changing warping function. While GARCH is successful, and its simplicity is attractive, our model is also simple and has a number of advantages. We can effortlessly handle missing data, we can easily incorporate covariates other than time (like interest rates) in our covariance function, and we can choose from a rich class of covariance functions – squared exponential, Brownian motion, Mat´ rn, periodic, etc. In fact, the e volatility of high frequency intradaily returns on equity indices and currency exchanges is cyclical [23], and GCPV with a periodic covariance function is uniquely well suited to this data. And the parameters of GCPV, like the covariance function lengthscale, or the learned warping function, provide insight into the underlying source of volatility, unlike the parameters of GARCH. Finally, copulas are rapidly becoming popular in applications, but often only bivariate copulas are being used. With our copula process one can learn the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We hope the Gaussian Copula Process Volatility model will encourage other applications of copula processes. More generally, we hope our work will help bring together the machine learning and econometrics communities.

<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions are often used to enhance the robustness of regression and classiﬁcation methods to outliers in output space. Often, however, we are confronted with “outliers” in input space, which are isolated observations in sparsely populated regions. We show that heavy-tailed stochastic processes (which we construct from Gaussian processes via a copula), can be used to improve robustness of regression and classiﬁcation estimators to such outliers by selectively shrinking them more strongly in sparse regions than in dense regions. We carry out a theoretical analysis to show that selective shrinkage occurs when the marginals of the heavy-tailed process have sufﬁciently heavy tails.

Huang</p><p>Abstract: Many problem domains including climatology and epidemiology require models that can capture both heavy-tailed statistics and local dependencies. Specifying such distributions using graphical models for probability density functions (PDFs) generally lead to intractable inference and learning. Cumulative distribution networks (CDNs) provide a means to tractably specify multivariate heavy-tailed models as a product of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Existing algorithms for inference and learning in CDNs are limited to those with tree-structured (nonloopy) graphs. In this paper, we develop inference and learning algorithms for CDNs with arbitrary topology. Our approach to inference and learning relies on recursively decomposing the computation of mixed derivatives based on a junction trees over the cumulative distribution functions. We demonstrate that our systematic approach to utilizing the sparsity represented by the junction tree yields signiďŹ cant performance improvements over the general symbolic differentiation programs Mathematica and D*. Using two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that non-tree structured (loopy) CDNs are able to provide signiďŹ cantly better ďŹ ts to the data as compared to tree-structured and unstructured CDNs and other heavy-tailed multivariate distributions such as the multivariate copula and logistic models.</p><p>6 0.31085432 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Inference_with_Multivariate_Heavy-Tails_in_Linear_Models.html">126 nips-2010-Inference with Multivariate Heavy-Tails in Linear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Elidan</p><p>Abstract: We present the Copula Bayesian Network model for representing multivariate continuous distributions, while taking advantage of the relative ease of estimating univariate distributions. Using a novel copula-based reparameterization of a conditional density, joined with a graph that encodes independencies, our model offers great ﬂexibility in modeling high-dimensional densities, while maintaining control over the form of the univariate marginals. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework for generalization over standard Bayesian networks as well as tree structured copula models for varied real-life domains that are of substantially higher dimension than those typically considered in the copula literature. 1</p><p>2 0.4466705 <a title="53-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Copula_Processes.html">54 nips-2010-Copula Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Wilson, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We deﬁne a copula process which describes the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. As an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), to predict the latent standard deviations of a sequence of random variables. To make predictions we use Bayesian inference, with the Laplace approximation, and with Markov chain Monte Carlo as an alternative. We ﬁnd our model can outperform GARCH on simulated and ﬁnancial data. And unlike GARCH, GCPV can easily handle missing data, incorporate covariates other than time, and model a rich class of covariance structures. Imagine measuring the distance of a rocket as it leaves Earth, and wanting to know how these measurements correlate with one another. How much does the value of the measurement at ﬁfteen minutes depend on the measurement at ﬁve minutes? Once we’ve learned this correlation structure, suppose we want to compare it to the dependence between measurements of the rocket’s velocity. To do this, it is convenient to separate dependence from the marginal distributions of our measurements. At any given time, a rocket’s distance from Earth could have a Gamma distribution, while its velocity could have a Gaussian distribution. And separating dependence from marginal distributions is precisely what a copula function does. While copulas have recently become popular, especially in ﬁnancial applications [1, 2], as Nelsen [3] writes, “the study of copulas and the role they play in probability, statistics, and stochastic processes is a subject still in its infancy. There are many open problems. . . ” Typically only bivariate (and recently trivariate) copulas are being used and studied. In our introductory example, we are interested in learning the correlations in different stochastic processes, and comparing them. It would therefore be useful to have a copula process, which can describe the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We deﬁne such a process. And as an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV). In doing so, we provide a Bayesian framework for the learning the marginal distributions and dependency structure of what we call a Gaussian copula process. The volatility of a random variable is its standard deviation. Stochastic volatility models are used to predict the volatilities of a heteroscedastic sequence – a sequence of random variables with different variances, like distance measurements of a rocket as it leaves the Earth. As the rocket gets further away, the variance on the measurements increases. Heteroscedasticity is especially important in econometrics; the returns on equity indices, like the S&P; 500, or on currency exchanges, are heteroscedastic. Indeed, in 2003, Robert Engle won the Nobel Prize in economics “for methods of analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility”. GARCH [4], a generalized version of Engle’s ARCH, is arguably unsurpassed for predicting the volatility of returns on equity indices and currency exchanges [5, 6, 7]. GCPV can outperform GARCH, and is competitive on ﬁnancial data that especially suits GARCH [8, 9, 10]. Before discussing GCPV, we ﬁrst introduce copulas and the copula process. For a review of Gaussian processes, see Rasmussen and Williams [11]. ∗ † http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/andrew Also at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University. 1 1 Copulas Copulas are important because they separate the dependency structure between random variables from their marginal distributions. Intuitively, we can describe the dependency structure of any multivariate joint distribution H(x1 , . . . , xn ) = P (X1 ≤ x1 , . . . Xn ≤ xn ) through a two step process. First we take each univariate random variable Xi and transform it through its cumulative distribution function (cdf) Fi to get Ui = Fi (Xi ), a uniform random variable. We then express the dependencies between these transformed variables through the n-copula C(u1 , . . . , un ). Formally, an n-copula C : [0, 1]n → [0, 1] is a multivariate cdf with uniform univariate marginals: C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = P (U1 ≤ u1 , U2 ≤ u2 , . . . , Un ≤ un ), where U1 , U2 , . . . , Un are standard uniform random variables. Sklar [12] precisely expressed our intuition in the theorem below. Theorem 1.1. Sklar’s theorem Let H be an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . Then there exists an n-copula C such that for all (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ [−∞, ∞]n , H(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = C(F1 (x1 ), F2 (x2 ), . . . , Fn (xn )) = C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ). (1) If F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are all continuous then C is unique; otherwise C is uniquely determined on Range F1 × Range F2 × · · · × Range Fn . Conversely, if C is an n-copula and F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn are distribution functions, then the function H is an n-dimensional distribution function with marginal distribution functions F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn . (−1) As a corollary, if Fi (u) = inf{x : F (x) ≥ u}, the quasi-inverse of Fi , then for all u1 , u2 , . . . , un ∈ [0, 1]n , (−1) C(u1 , u2 , . . . , un ) = H(F1 (−1) (u1 ), F2 (−1) (u2 ), . . . , Fn (un )). (2) In other words, (2) can be used to construct a copula. For example, the bivariate Gaussian copula is deﬁned as C(u, v) = Φρ (Φ−1 (u), Φ−1 (v)), (3) where Φρ is a bivariate Gaussian cdf with correlation coefﬁcient ρ, and Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf. Li [2] popularised the bivariate Gaussian copula, by showing how it could be used to study ﬁnancial risk and default correlation, using credit derivatives as an example. By substituting F (x) for u and G(y) for v in equation (3), we have a bivariate distribution H(x, y), with a Gaussian dependency structure, and marginals F and G. Regardless of F and G, the resulting H(x, y) can still be uniquely expressed as a Gaussian copula, so long as F and G are continuous. It is then a copula itself that captures the underlying dependencies between random variables, regardless of their marginal distributions. For this reason, copulas have been called dependence functions [13, 14]. Nelsen [3] contains an extensive discussion of copulas. 2 Copula Processes Imagine choosing a covariance function, and then drawing a sample function at some ﬁnite number of points from a Gaussian process. The result is a sample from a collection of Gaussian random variables, with a dependency structure encoded by the speciﬁed covariance function. Now, suppose we transform each of these values through a univariate Gaussian cdf, such that we have a sample from a collection of uniform random variables. These uniform random variables also have this underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. One might call the resulting values a draw from a Gaussian-Uniform Process. We could subsequently put these values through an inverse beta cdf, to obtain a draw from what could be called a Gaussian-Beta Process: the values would be a sample from beta random variables, again with an underlying Gaussian process dependency structure. We could also transform the uniform values with different inverse cdfs, which would give a sample from different random variables, with dependencies encoded by the Gaussian process. The above procedure is a means to generate samples from arbitrarily many random variables, with arbitrary marginal distributions, and desired dependencies. It is an example of how to use what we call a copula process – in this case, a Gaussian copula process, since a Gaussian copula describes the dependency structure of a ﬁnite number of samples. We now formally deﬁne a copula process. 2 Deﬁnition 2.1. Copula Process Let {Wt } be a collection of random variables indexed by t ∈ T , with marginal distribution functions Ft , and let Qt = Ft (Wt ). Further, let µ be a stochastic process measure with marginal distribution functions Gt , and joint distribution function H. Then Wt is copula process distributed with base measure µ, or Wt ∼ CP(µ), if and only if for all n ∈ N, ai ∈ R, n P( (−1) {Gti (Qti ) ≤ ai }) = Ht1 ,t2 ,...,tn (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ). (4) i=1 (−1) Each Qti ∼ Uniform(0, 1), and Gti is the quasi-inverse of Gti , as previously deﬁned. Deﬁnition 2.2. Gaussian Copula Process Wt is Gaussian copula process distributed if it is copula process distributed and the base measure µ is a Gaussian process. If there is a mapping Ψ such that Ψ(Wt ) ∼ GP(m(t), k(t, t )), then we write Wt ∼ GCP(Ψ, m(t), k(t, t )). For example, if we have Wt ∼ GCP with m(t) = 0 and k(t, t) = 1, then in the deﬁnition of a copula process, Gt = Φ, the standard univariate Gaussian cdf, and H is the usual GP joint distribution function. Supposing this GCP is a Gaussian-Beta process, then Ψ = Φ−1 ◦ FB , where FB is a univariate Beta cdf. One could similarly deﬁne other copula processes. We described generally how a copula process can be used to generate samples of arbitrarily many random variables with desired marginals and dependencies. We now develop a speciﬁc and practical application of this framework. We introduce a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process Volatility (GCPV), as an example of how to learn the joint distribution of arbitrarily many random variables, the marginals of these random variables, and to make predictions. To do this, we ﬁt a Gaussian copula process by using a type of Warped Gaussian Process [15]. However, our methodology varies substantially from Snelson et al. [15], since we are doing inference on latent variables as opposed to observations, which is a much greater undertaking that involves approximations, and we are doing so in a different context. 3 Gaussian Copula Process Volatility Assume we have a sequence of observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) at times t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) . The observations are random variables with different latent standard deviations. We therefore have n unobserved standard deviations, σ1 , . . . , σn , and want to learn the correlation structure between these standard deviations, and also to predict the distribution of σ∗ at some unrealised time t∗ . We model the standard deviation function as a Gaussian copula process: σt ∼ GCP(g −1 , 0, k(t, t )). (5) f (t) ∼ GP(m(t) = 0, k(t, t )) σ(t) = g(f (t), ω) (6) (7) y(t) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (t)), (8) Speciﬁcally, where g is a monotonic warping function, parametrized by ω. For each of the observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) we have corresponding GP latent function values f = (f1 , . . . , fn ) , where σ(ti ) = g(fi , ω), using the shorthand fi to mean f (ti ). σt ∼ GCP, because any ﬁnite sequence (σ1 , . . . , σp ) is distributed as a Gaussian copula: P (σ1 ≤ a1 , . . . , σp ≤ ap ) = P (g −1 (σ1 ) ≤ g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 (σp ) ≤ g −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (g −1 (a1 ), . . . , g −1 −1 (ap )) = ΦΓ (Φ = ΦΓ (Φ −1 (F (a1 )), . . . , Φ (u1 ), . . . , Φ −1 −1 (9) (F (ap ))) (up )) = C(u1 , . . . , up ), where Φ is the standard univariate Gaussian cdf (supposing k(t, t) = 1), ΦΓ is a multivariate Gaussian cdf with covariance matrix Γij = cov(g −1 (σi ), g −1 (σj )), and F is the marginal distribution of 3 each σi . In (5), we have Ψ = g −1 , because it is g −1 which maps σt to a GP. The speciﬁcation in (5) is equivalently expressed by (6) and (7). With GCPV, the form of g is learned so that g −1 (σt ) is best modelled by a GP. By learning g, we learn the marginal of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)) for a ∈ R. Recently, a different sort of ‘kernel copula process’ has been used, where the marginals of the variables being modelled are not learned [16].1 Further, we also consider a more subtle and ﬂexible form of our model, where the function g itself is indexed by time: g = gt (f (t), ω). We only assume that the marginal distributions of σt are stationary over ‘small’ time periods, and for each of these time periods (5)-(7) hold true. We return to this in the ﬁnal discussion section. Here we have assumed that each observation, conditioned on knowing its variance, is normally distributed with zero mean. This is a common assumption in heteroscedastic models. The zero mean and normality assumptions can be relaxed and are not central to this paper. 4 Predictions with GCPV Ultimately, we wish to infer p(σ(t∗ )|y, z), where z = {θ, ω}, and θ are the hyperparameters of the GP covariance function. To do this, we sample from p(f∗ |y, z) = p(f∗ |f , θ)p(f |y, z)df (10) and then transform these samples by g. Letting (Cf )ij = δij g(fi , ω)2 , where δij is the Kronecker delta, Kij = k(ti , tj ), (k∗ )i = k(t∗ , ti ), we have p(f |y, z) = N (f ; 0, K)N (y; 0, Cf )/p(y|z), p(f∗ |f , θ) = N (k∗ K −1 f , k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ K −1 (11) k∗ ). (12) We also wish to learn z, which we can do by ﬁnding the z that maximizes the marginal likelihood, ˆ p(y|z) = p(y|f , ω)p(f |θ)df . (13) Unfortunately, for many functions g, (10) and (13) are intractable. Our methods of dealing with this can be used in very general circumstances, where one has a Gaussian process prior, but an (optionally parametrized) non-Gaussian likelihood. We use the Laplace approximation to estimate p(f |y, z) as a Gaussian. Then we can integrate (10) for a Gaussian approximation to p(f∗ |y, z), which we sample from to make predictions of σ∗ . Using Laplace, we can also ﬁnd an expression for an approximate marginal likelihood, which we maximize to determine z. Once we have found z with Laplace, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from p(f∗ |y, z), and compare that to using Laplace to sample from p(f∗ |y, z). In the supplement we relate this discussion to (9). 4.1 Laplace Approximation The goal is to approximate (11) with a Gaussian, so that we can evaluate (10) and (13) and make predictions. In doing so, we follow Rasmussen and Williams [11] in their treatment of Gaussian process classiﬁcation, except we use a parametrized likelihood, and modify Newton’s method. First, consider as an objective function the logarithm of an unnormalized (11): s(f |y, z) = log p(y|f , ω) + log p(f |θ). (14) ˆ The Laplace approximation uses a second order Taylor expansion about the f which maximizes ˆ, for which we use (14), to ﬁnd an approximate objective s(f |y, z). So the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd f ˜ Newton’s method. The Newton update is f new = f − ( s(f ))−1 s(f ). Differentiating (14), s(f |y, z) = s(f |y, z) = where W is the diagonal matrix − 1 log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 f log p(y|f , ω) − K −1 = −W − K −1 , log p(y|f , ω). Note added in proof : Also, for a very recent related model, see Rodr´guez et al. [17]. ı 4 (15) (16) If the likelihood function p(y|f , ω) is not log concave, then W may have negative entries. Vanhatalo et al. [18] found this to be problematic when doing Gaussian process regression with a Student-t ˆ likelihood. They instead use an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for ﬁnding f , and iterate ordered rank one Cholesky updates to evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. But EM can converge slowly, especially near a local optimum, and each of the rank one updates is vulnerable to numerical instability. With a small modiﬁcation of Newton’s method, we often get close to ˆ quadratic convergence for ﬁnding f , and can evaluate the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood in a numerically stable fashion, with no approximate Cholesky factors, and optimal computational requirements. Some comments are in the supplementary material but, in short, we use an approximate negative Hessian, − s ≈ M + K −1 , which is guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite, since M is formed on each iteration by zeroing the negative entries of W . For stability, we reformulate our 1 1 1 1 optimization in terms of B = I + M 2 KM 2 , and let Q = M 2 B −1 M 2 , b = M f + log p(y|f ), a = b − QKb. Since (K −1 + M )−1 = K − KQK, the Newton update becomes f new = Ka. ˆ With these updates we ﬁnd f and get an expression for s which we use to approximate (13) and ˜ (11). The approximate marginal likelihood q(y|z) is given by exp(˜)df . Taking its logarithm, s 1ˆ 1 ˆ log q(y|z) = − f af + log p(y|f ) − log |Bf |, (17) ˆ ˆ 2 2 ˆ ˆ where Bf is B evaluated at f , and af is a numerically stable evaluation of K −1 f . ˆ ˆ To learn the parameters z, we use conjugate gradient descent to maximize (17) with respect to z. ˆ ˆ Since f is a function of z, we initialize z, and update f every time we vary z. Once we have found an optimum z , we can make predictions. By exponentiating s, we ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to ˆ ˜ ˆ the posterior (11), q(f |y, z) = N (f , K − KQK). The product of this approximate posterior with p(f∗ |f ) is Gaussian. Integrating this product, we approximate p(f∗ |y, z) as ˆ q(f∗ |y, z) = N (k∗ log p(y|f ), k(t∗ , t∗ ) − k∗ Qk∗ ). (18) Given n training observations, the cost of each Newton iteration is dominated by computing the cholesky decomposition of B, which takes O(n3 ) operations. The objective function typically changes by less than 10−6 after 3 iterations. Once Newton’s method has converged, it takes only O(1) operations to draw from q(f∗ |y, z) and make predictions. 4.2 Markov chain Monte Carlo We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from (11), so that we can later sample from p(σ∗ |y, z) to make predictions. Sampling from (11) is difﬁcult, because the variables f are strongly coupled by a Gaussian process prior. We use a new technique, Elliptical Slice Sampling [19], and ﬁnd it extremely effective for this purpose. It was speciﬁcally designed to sample from posteriors with correlated Gaussian priors. It has no free parameters, and jointly updates every element of f . For our setting, it is over 100 times as fast as axis aligned slice sampling with univariate updates. To make predictions, we take J samples of p(f |y, z), {f 1 , . . . , f J }, and then approximate (10) as a mixture of J Gaussians: J 1 p(f∗ |f i , θ). (19) p(f∗ |y, z) ≈ J i=1 Each of the Gaussians in this mixture have equal weight. So for each sample of f∗ |y, we uniformly choose a random p(f∗ |f i , θ) and draw a sample. In the limit J → ∞, we are sampling from the exact p(f∗ |y, z). Mapping these samples through g gives samples from p(σ∗ |y, z). After one O(n3 ) and one O(J) operation, a draw from (19) takes O(1) operations. 4.3 Warping Function The warping function, g, maps fi , a GP function value, to σi , a standard deviation. Since fi can take any value in R, and σi can take any non-negative real value, g : R → R+ . For each fi to correspond to a unique deviation, g must also be one-to-one. We use K g(x, ω) = aj log[exp[bj (x + cj )] + 1], j=1 5 aj , bj > 0. (20) This is monotonic, positive, inﬁnitely differentiable, asymptotic towards zero as x → −∞, and K tends to ( j=1 aj bj )x as x → ∞. In practice, it is useful to add a small constant to (20), to avoid rare situations where the parameters ω are trained to make g extremely small for certain inputs, at the expense of a good overall ﬁt; this can happen when the parameters ω are learned by optimizing a likelihood. A suitable constant could be one tenth the absolute value of the smallest nonzero observation. By inferring the parameters of the warping function, or distributions of these parameters, we are learning a transformation which will best model σt with a Gaussian process. The more ﬂexible the warping function, the more potential there is to improve the GCPV ﬁt – in other words, the better we can estimate the ‘perfect’ transformation. To test the importance of this ﬂexibility, we also try a simple unparametrized warping function, g(x) = ex . In related work, Goldberg et al. [20] place a GP prior on the log noise level in a standard GP regression model on observations, except for inference they use Gibbs sampling, and a high level of ‘jitter’ for conditioning. Once g is trained, we can infer the marginal distribution of each σ: F (a) = Φ(g −1 (a)), for a ∈ R. This suggests an alternate way to initialize g: we can initialize F as a mixture of Gaussians, and then map through Φ−1 to ﬁnd g −1 . Since mixtures of Gaussians are dense in the set of probability distributions, we could in principle ﬁnd the ‘perfect’ g using an inﬁnite mixture of Gaussians [21]. 5 Experiments In our experiments, we predict the latent standard deviations σ of observations y at times t, and also σ∗ at unobserved times t∗ . To do this, we use two versions of GCPV. The ﬁrst variant, which we simply refer to as GCPV, uses the warping function (20) with K = 1, and squared exponential covariance function, k(t, t ) = A exp(−(t−t )2 /l2 ), with A = 1. The second variant, which we call GP-EXP, uses the unparametrized warping function ex , and the same covariance function, except the amplitude A is a trained hyperparameter. The other hyperparameter l is called the lengthscale of the covariance function. The greater l, the greater the covariance between σt and σt+a for a ∈ R. We train hyperparameters by maximizing the Laplace approximate log marginal likelihood (17). We then sample from p(f∗ |y) using the Laplace approximation (18). We also do this using MCMC (19) with J = 10000, after discarding a previous 10000 samples of p(f |y) as burn-in. We pass 2 these samples of f∗ |y through g and g 2 to draw from p(σ∗ |y) and p(σ∗ |y), and compute the sample mean and variance of σ∗ |y. We use the sample mean as a point predictor, and the sample variance for error bounds on these predictions, and we use 10000 samples to compute these quantities. For GCPV we use Laplace and MCMC for inference, but for GP-EXP we only use Laplace. We compare predictions to GARCH(1,1), which has been shown in extensive and recent reviews to be competitive with other GARCH variants, and more sophisticated models [5, 6, 7]. GARCH(p,q) speciﬁes y(t) ∼ p 2 2 N (0, σ 2 (t)), and lets the variance be a deterministic function of the past: σt = a0 + i=1 ai yt−i + q 2 j=1 bj σt−j . We use the Matlab Econometrics Toolbox implementation of GARCH, where the parameters a0 , ai and bj are estimated using a constrained maximum likelihood. We make forecasts of volatility, and we predict historical volatility. By ‘historical volatility’ we mean the volatility at observed time points, or between these points. Uncovering historical volatility is important. It could, for instance, be used to study what causes ﬂuctuations in the stock market, or to understand physical systems. To evaluate our model, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the true variance, or proxy for the truth, and the predicted variance. Although likelihood has advantages, we are limited in space, and we wish to harmonize with the econometrics literature, and other assessments of volatility models, where MSE is the standard. In a similar assessment of volatility models, Brownlees et al. [7] found that MSE and quasi-likelihood rankings were comparable. When the true variance is unknown we follow Brownlees et al. [7] and use squared observations as a proxy for the truth, to compare our model to GARCH.2 The more observations, the more reliable these performance estimates will be. However, not many observations (e.g. 100) are needed for a stable ranking of competing models; in Brownlees et al. [7], the rankings derived from high frequency squared observations are similar to those derived using daily squared observations. 2 Since each observation y is assumed to have zero mean and variance σ 2 , E[y 2 ] = σ 2 . 6 5.1 Simulations We simulate observations from N (0, σ 2 (t)), using σ(t) = sin(t) cos(t2 ) + 1, at t = (0, 0.02, 0.04, . . . , 4) . We call this data set TRIG. We also simulate using a standard deviation that jumps from 0.1 to 7 and back, at times t = (0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 6) . We call this data set JUMP. To forecast, we use all observations up until the current time point, and make 1, 7, and 30 step ahead predictions. So, for example, in TRIG we start by observing t = 0, and make forecasts at t = 0.02, 0.14, 0.60. Then we observe t = 0, 0.02 and make forecasts at t = 0.04, 0.16, 0.62, and so on, until all data points have been observed. For historical volatility, we predict the latent σt at the observation times, which is safe since we are comparing to the true volatility, which is not used in training; the results are similar if we interpolate. Figure 1 panels a) and b) show the true volatility for TRIG and JUMP respectively, alongside GCPV Laplace, GCPV MCMC, GP-EXP Laplace, and GARCH(1,1) predictions of historical volatility. Table 1 shows the results for forecasting and historical volatility. In panel a) we see that GCPV more accurately captures the dependencies between σ at different times points than GARCH: if we manually decrease the lengthscale in the GCPV covariance function, we can replicate the erratic GARCH behaviour, which inaccurately suggests that the covariance between σt and σt+a decreases quickly with increases in a. We also see that GCPV with an unparametrized exponential warping function tends to overestimates peaks and underestimate troughs. In panel b), the volatility is extremely difﬁcult to reconstruct or forecast – with no warning it will immediately and dramatically increase or decrease. This behaviour is not suited to a smooth squared exponential covariance function. Nevertheless, GCPV outperforms GARCH, especially in regions of low volatility. We also see this in panel a) for t ∈ (1.5, 2). GARCH is known to respond slowly to large returns, and to overpredict volatility [22]. In JUMP, the greater the peaks, and the smaller the troughs, the more GARCH suffers, while GCPV is mostly robust to these changes. 5.2 Financial Data The returns on the daily exchange rate between the Deutschmark (DM) and the Great Britain Pound (GBP) from 1984 to 1992 have become a benchmark for assessing the performance of GARCH models [8, 9, 10]. This exchange data, which we refer to as DMGBP, can be obtained from www.datastream.com, and the returns are calculated as rt = log(Pt+1 /Pt ), where Pt is the number of DM to GBP on day t. The returns are assumed to have a zero mean function. We use a rolling window of the previous 120 days of returns to make 1, 7, and 30 day ahead volatility forecasts, starting at the beginning of January 1988, and ending at the beginning of January 1992 (659 trading days). Every 7 days, we retrain the parameters of GCPV and GARCH. Every time we retrain parameters, we predict historical volatility over the past 120 days. The average MSE for these historical predictions is given in Table 1, although they should be observed with caution; unlike with the simulations, the DMGBP historical predictions are trained using the same data they are assessed on. In Figure 1c), we see that the GARCH one day ahead forecasts are lifted above the GCPV forecasts, but unlike in the simulations, they are now operating on a similar lengthscale. This suggests that GARCH could still be overpredicting volatility, but that GCPV has adapted its estimation of how σt and σt+a correlate with one another. Since GARCH is suited to this ﬁnancial data set, it is reassuring that GCPV predictions have a similar time varying structure. Overall, GCPV and GARCH are competitive with one another for forecasting currency exchange returns, as seen in Table 1. Moreover, a learned warping function g outperforms an unparametrized one, and a full Laplace solution is comparable to using MCMC for inference, in accuracy and speed. This is also true for the simulations. Therefore we recommend whichever is more convenient to implement. 6 Discussion We deﬁned a copula process, and as an example, developed a stochastic volatility model, GCPV, which can outperform GARCH. With GCPV, the volatility σt is distributed as a Gaussian Copula Process, which separates the modelling of the dependencies between volatilities at different times from their marginal distributions – arguably the most useful property of a copula. Further, GCPV ﬁts the marginals in the Gaussian copula process by learning a warping function. If we had simply chosen an unparametrized exponential warping function, we would incorrectly be assuming that the log 7 Table 1: MSE for predicting volatility.

Indeed, for the DMGBP data, we trained the warping function g over a 120 day period, and mapped its inverse through the univariate standard Gaussian cdf Φ, and differenced, to estimate the marginal probability density function (pdf) of σt over this period. The learned marginal pdf, shown in Figure 1d), is similar to a Gamma(4.15,0.00045) distribution. However, in using a rolling window to retrain the parameters of g, we do not assume that the marginals of σt are stationary; we have a time changing warping function. While GARCH is successful, and its simplicity is attractive, our model is also simple and has a number of advantages. We can effortlessly handle missing data, we can easily incorporate covariates other than time (like interest rates) in our covariance function, and we can choose from a rich class of covariance functions – squared exponential, Brownian motion, Mat´ rn, periodic, etc. In fact, the e volatility of high frequency intradaily returns on equity indices and currency exchanges is cyclical [23], and GCPV with a periodic covariance function is uniquely well suited to this data. And the parameters of GCPV, like the covariance function lengthscale, or the learned warping function, provide insight into the underlying source of volatility, unlike the parameters of GARCH. Finally, copulas are rapidly becoming popular in applications, but often only bivariate copulas are being used. With our copula process one can learn the dependencies between arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions. We hope the Gaussian Copula Process Volatility model will encourage other applications of copula processes. More generally, we hope our work will help bring together the machine learning and econometrics communities.

<p>Author: Shaul Druckmann, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: A striking aspect of cortical neural networks is the divergence of a relatively small number of input channels from the peripheral sensory apparatus into a large number of cortical neurons, an over-complete representation strategy. Cortical neurons are then connected by a sparse network of lateral synapses. Here we propose that such architecture may increase the persistence of the representation of an incoming stimulus, or a percept. We demonstrate that for a family of networks in which the receptive ﬁeld of each neuron is re-expressed by its outgoing connections, a represented percept can remain constant despite changing activity. We term this choice of connectivity REceptive FIeld REcombination (REFIRE) networks. The sparse REFIRE network may serve as a high-dimensional integrator and a biologically plausible model of the local cortical circuit. 1</p><p>4 0.44387409 <a title="53-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Dirty_Model_for_Multi-task_Learning.html">5 nips-2010-A Dirty Model for Multi-task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Sujay Sanghavi, Chao Ruan, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-task learning in the setting of multiple linear regression, and where some relevant features could be shared across the tasks. Recent research has studied the use of ℓ1 /ℓq norm block-regularizations with q > 1 for such blocksparse structured problems, establishing strong guarantees on recovery even under high-dimensional scaling where the number of features scale with the number of observations. However, these papers also caution that the performance of such block-regularized methods are very dependent on the extent to which the features are shared across tasks. Indeed they show [8] that if the extent of overlap is less than a threshold, or even if parameter values in the shared features are highly uneven, then block ℓ1 /ℓq regularization could actually perform worse than simple separate elementwise ℓ1 regularization. Since these caveats depend on the unknown true parameters, we might not know when and which method to apply. Even otherwise, we are far away from a realistic multi-task setting: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same across tasks, but their values have to as well. Here, we ask the question: can we leverage parameter overlap when it exists, but not pay a penalty when it does not ? Indeed, this falls under a more general question of whether we can model such dirty data which may not fall into a single neat structural bracket (all block-sparse, or all low-rank and so on). With the explosion of such dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to develop tools – dirty models – to perform biased statistical estimation tailored to such data. Here, we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on developing a dirty model for the multiple regression problem. Our method uses a very simple idea: we estimate a superposition of two sets of parameters and regularize them differently. We show both theoretically and empirically, our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both ℓ1 or ℓ1 /ℓq methods, under high-dimensional scaling and over the entire range of possible overlaps (except at boundary cases, where we match the best method). 1 Introduction: Motivation and Setup High-dimensional scaling. In ﬁelds across science and engineering, we are increasingly faced with problems where the number of variables or features p is larger than the number of observations n. Under such high-dimensional scaling, for any hope of statistically consistent estimation, it becomes vital to leverage any potential structure in the problem such as sparsity (e.g. in compressed sensing [3] and LASSO [14]), low-rank structure [13, 9], or sparse graphical model structure [12]. It is in such high-dimensional contexts in particular that multi-task learning [4] could be most useful. Here, 1 multiple tasks share some common structure such as sparsity, and estimating these tasks jointly by leveraging this common structure could be more statistically efﬁcient. Block-sparse Multiple Regression. A common multiple task learning setting, and which is the focus of this paper, is that of multiple regression, where we have r > 1 response variables, and a common set of p features or covariates. The r tasks could share certain aspects of their underlying distributions, such as common variance, but the setting we focus on in this paper is where the response variables have simultaneously sparse structure: the index set of relevant features for each task is sparse; and there is a large overlap of these relevant features across the different regression problems. Such “simultaneous sparsity” arises in a variety of contexts [15]; indeed, most applications of sparse signal recovery in contexts ranging from graphical model learning, kernel learning, and function estimation have natural extensions to the simultaneous-sparse setting [12, 2, 11]. It is useful to represent the multiple regression parameters via a matrix, where each column corresponds to a task, and each row to a feature. Having simultaneous sparse structure then corresponds to the matrix being largely “block-sparse” – where each row is either all zero or mostly non-zero, and the number of non-zero rows is small. A lot of recent research in this setting has focused on ℓ1 /ℓq norm regularizations, for q > 1, that encourage the parameter matrix to have such blocksparse structure. Particular examples include results using the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ norm [16, 5, 8], and the ℓ1 /ℓ2 norm [7, 10]. Dirty Models. Block-regularization is “heavy-handed” in two ways. By strictly encouraging sharedsparsity, it assumes that all relevant features are shared, and hence suffers under settings, arguably more realistic, where each task depends on features speciﬁc to itself in addition to the ones that are common. The second concern with such block-sparse regularizers is that the ℓ1 /ℓq norms can be shown to encourage the entries in the non-sparse rows taking nearly identical values. Thus we are far away from the original goal of multitask learning: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same, but their values have to as well. Indeed recent research into such regularized methods [8, 10] caution against the use of block-regularization in regimes where the supports and values of the parameters for each task can vary widely. Since the true parameter values are unknown, that would be a worrisome caveat. We thus ask the question: can we learn multiple regression models by leveraging whatever overlap of features there exist, and without requiring the parameter values to be near identical? Indeed this is an instance of a more general question on whether we can estimate statistical models where the data may not fall cleanly into any one structural bracket (sparse, block-sparse and so on). With the explosion of dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to investigate estimation of corresponding dirty models, which might require new approaches to biased high-dimensional estimation. In this paper we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on such dirty models for a speciﬁc problem: simultaneously sparse multiple regression. Our approach uses a simple idea: while any one structure might not capture the data, a superposition of structural classes might. Our method thus searches for a parameter matrix that can be decomposed into a row-sparse matrix (corresponding to the overlapping or shared features) and an elementwise sparse matrix (corresponding to the non-shared features). As we show both theoretically and empirically, with this simple ﬁx we are able to leverage any extent of shared features, while allowing disparities in support and values of the parameters, so that we are always better than both the Lasso or block-sparse regularizers (at times remarkably so). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec 2. basic deﬁnitions and setup of the problem are presented. Main results of the paper is discussed in sec 3. Experimental results and simulations are demonstrated in Sec 4. Notation: For any matrix M , we denote its j th row as Mj , and its k-th column as M (k) . The set of all non-zero rows (i.e. all rows with at least one non-zero element) is denoted by RowSupp(M ) (k) and its support by Supp(M ). Also, for any matrix M , let M 1,1 := j,k |Mj |, i.e. the sums of absolute values of the elements, and M 1,∞ := j 2 Mj ∞ where, Mj ∞ (k) := maxk |Mj |. 2 Problem Set-up and Our Method Multiple regression. We consider the following standard multiple linear regression model: ¯ y (k) = X (k) θ(k) + w(k) , k = 1, . . . , r, where y (k) ∈ Rn is the response for the k-th task, regressed on the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p (possibly different across tasks), while w(k) ∈ Rn is the noise vector. We assume each w(k) is drawn independently from N (0, σ 2 ). The total number of tasks or target variables is r, the number of features is p, while the number of samples we have for each task is n. For notational convenience, ¯ we collate these quantities into matrices Y ∈ Rn×r for the responses, Θ ∈ Rp×r for the regression n×r parameters and W ∈ R for the noise. ¯ Dirty Model. In this paper we are interested in estimating the true parameter Θ from data by lever¯ aging any (unknown) extent of simultaneous-sparsity. In particular, certain rows of Θ would have many non-zero entries, corresponding to features shared by several tasks (“shared” rows), while certain rows would be elementwise sparse, corresponding to those features which are relevant for some tasks but not all (“non-shared rows”), while certain rows would have all zero entries, corresponding to those features that are not relevant to any task. We are interested in estimators Θ that automatically adapt to different levels of sharedness, and yet enjoy the following guarantees: Support recovery: We say an estimator Θ successfully recovers the true signed support if ¯ sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign(Supp(Θ)). We are interested in deriving sufﬁcient conditions under which ¯ the estimator succeeds. We note that this is stronger than merely recovering the row-support of Θ, which is union of its supports for the different tasks. In particular, denoting Uk for the support of the ¯ k-th column of Θ, and U = k Uk . Error bounds: We are also interested in providing bounds on the elementwise ℓ∞ norm error of the estimator Θ, ¯ Θ−Θ 2.1 ∞ = max max j=1,...,p k=1,...,r (k) Θj (k) ¯ − Θj . Our Method Our method explicitly models the dirty block-sparse structure. We estimate a sum of two parameter matrices B and S with different regularizations for each: encouraging block-structured row-sparsity in B and elementwise sparsity in S. The corresponding “clean” models would either just use blocksparse regularizations [8, 10] or just elementwise sparsity regularizations [14, 18], so that either method would perform better in certain suited regimes. Interestingly, as we will see in the main results, by explicitly allowing to have both block-sparse and elementwise sparse component, we are ¯ able to outperform both classes of these “clean models”, for all regimes Θ. Algorithm 1 Dirty Block Sparse Solve the following convex optimization problem: (S, B) ∈ arg min S,B 1 2n r k=1 y (k) − X (k) S (k) + B (k) 2 2 + λs S 1,1 + λb B 1,∞ . (1) Then output Θ = B + S. 3 Main Results and Their Consequences We now provide precise statements of our main results. A number of recent results have shown that the Lasso [14, 18] and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization [8] methods succeed in recovering signed supports with controlled error bounds under high-dimensional scaling regimes. Our ﬁrst two theorems extend these results to our dirty model setting. In Theorem 1, we consider the case of deterministic design matrices X (k) , and provide sufﬁcient conditions guaranteeing signed support recovery, and elementwise ℓ∞ norm error bounds. In Theorem 2, we specialize this theorem to the case where the 3 rows of the design matrices are random from a general zero mean Gaussian distribution: this allows us to provide scaling on the number of observations required in order to guarantee signed support recovery and bounded elementwise ℓ∞ norm error. Our third result is the most interesting in that it explicitly quantiﬁes the performance gains of our method vis-a-vis Lasso and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization method. Since this entailed ﬁnding the precise constants underlying earlier theorems, and a correspondingly more delicate analysis, we follow Negahban and Wainwright [8] and focus on the case where there are two-tasks (i.e. r = 2), and where we have standard Gaussian design matrices as in Theorem 2. Further, while each of two tasks depends on s features, only a fraction α of these are common. It is then interesting to see how the behaviors of the different regularization methods vary with the extent of overlap α. Comparisons. Negahban and Wainwright [8] show that there is actually a “phase transition” in the scaling of the probability of successful signed support-recovery with the number of observations. n Denote a particular rescaling of the sample-size θLasso (n, p, α) = s log(p−s) . Then as Wainwright [18] show, when the rescaled number of samples scales as θLasso > 2 + δ for any δ > 0, Lasso succeeds in recovering the signed support of all columns with probability converging to one. But when the sample size scales as θLasso < 2−δ for any δ > 0, Lasso fails with probability converging to one. For the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -reguralized multiple linear regression, deﬁne a similar rescaled sample size n θ1,∞ (n, p, α) = s log(p−(2−α)s) . Then as Negahban and Wainwright [8] show there is again a transition in probability of success from near zero to near one, at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (4 − 3α). Thus, for α < 2/3 (“less sharing”) Lasso would perform better since its transition is at a smaller sample size, while for α > 2/3 (“more sharing”) the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method would perform better. As we show in our third theorem, the phase transition for our method occurs at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (2 − α), which is strictly before either the Lasso or the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method except for the boundary cases: α = 0, i.e. the case of no sharing, where we match Lasso, and for α = 1, i.e. full sharing, where we match ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . Everywhere else, we strictly outperform both methods. Figure 3 shows the empirical performance of each of the three methods; as can be seen, they agree very well with the theoretical analysis. (Further details in the experiments Section 4). 3.1 Sufﬁcient Conditions for Deterministic Designs We ﬁrst consider the case where the design matrices X (k) for k = 1, · · ·, r are deterministic, and start by specifying the assumptions we impose on the model. We note that similar sufﬁcient conditions for the deterministic X (k) ’s case were imposed in papers analyzing Lasso [18] and block-regularization methods [8, 10].

For a 2-task problem, the probability of success for different values of feature-overlap fraction α is plotted. As we can see in the regimes that Lasso is better than, as good as and worse than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer ((a), (b) and (c) respectively), the dirty model outperforms both of the methods, i.e., it requires less number of observations for successful recovery of the true signed support compared to Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Here p s = ⌊ 10 ⌋ always. Theorem 1. Suppose A0-A3 hold, and that we obtain estimate Θ from our algorithm with regularization parameters chosen according to (2). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) → 1, we are guaranteed that the convex program (1) has a unique optimum and (a) The estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ 4σ 2 log (pr) + λs Dmax . n Cmin ≤ bmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > bmin . Here the positive constants c1 , c2 depend only on γs , γb , λs , λb and σ, but are otherwise independent of n, p, r, the problem dimensions of interest. Remark: Condition (a) guarantees that the estimate will have no false inclusions; i.e. all included features will be relevant. If in addition, we require that it have no false exclusions and that recover the support exactly, we need to impose the assumption in (b) that the non-zero elements are large enough to be detectable above the noise. 3.2 General Gaussian Designs Often the design matrices consist of samples from a Gaussian ensemble. Suppose that for each task (k) k = 1, . . . , r the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p is such that each row Xi ∈ Rp is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix Σ(k) ∈ Rp×p , and is independent of every other (k) row. Let ΣV,U ∈ R|V|×|U | be the submatrix of Σ(k) with rows corresponding to V and columns to U . We require these covariance matrices to satisfy the following conditions: r C1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Σj,Uk , ΣUk ,Uk k=1 5 −1 >0 1 C2 Eigenvalue Condition Cmin := min λmin Σ(k),Uk Uk > 0 so that the minimum eigenvalue 1≤k≤r is bounded away from zero. C3 Boundedness Condition Dmax := (k) ΣUk ,Uk −1 ∞,1 < ∞. These conditions are analogues of the conditions for deterministic designs; they are now imposed on the covariance matrix of the (randomly generated) rows of the design matrix. Further, deﬁning s := maxk |Uk |, we require the regularization penalties be set as 1/2 λs > 1/2 4σ 2 Cmin log(pr) √ γs nCmin − 2s log(pr) and λb > 4σ 2 Cmin r(r log(2) + log(p)) . √ γb nCmin − 2sr(r log(2) + log(p)) (3) Theorem 2. Suppose assumptions C1-C3 hold, and that the number of samples scale as n > max 2s log(pr) 2sr r log(2)+log(p) 2 2 Cmin γs , Cmin γb . Suppose we obtain estimate Θ from algorithm (3). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp (−c2 (r log(2) + log(p))) − c3 exp(−c4 log(rs)) → 1 for some positive numbers c1 − c4 , we are guaranteed that the algorithm estimate Θ is unique and satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) the estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ ≤ 50σ 2 log(rs) + λs nCmin 4s √ + Dmax . Cmin n gmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that 3.3 min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > gmin . Sharp Transition for 2-Task Gaussian Designs This is one of the most important results of this paper. Here, we perform a more delicate and ﬁner analysis to establish precise quantitative gains of our method. We focus on the special case where r = 2 and the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ), so that C1 − C3 hold, with Cmin = Dmax = 1. As we will see both analytically and experimentally, our method strictly outperforms both Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -block-regularization over for all cases, except at the extreme endpoints of no support sharing (where it matches that of Lasso) and full support sharing (where it matches that of ℓ1 /ℓ∞ ). We now present our analytical results; the empirical comparisons are presented next in Section 4. The results will be in terms of a particular rescaling of the sample size n as θ(n, p, s, α) := n . (2 − α)s log (p − (2 − α)s) We will also require the assumptions that 4σ 2 (1 − F1 λs > F2 λb > s/n)(log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((2 − α) s (log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 4σ 2 (1 − s/n)r(r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) , 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((1 − α/2) sr (r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 . Theorem 3. Consider a 2-task regression problem (n, p, s, α), where the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ). 6 Suppose maxj∈B∗ ∗(1) Θj − ∗(2) Θj = o(λs ), where B ∗ is the submatrix of Θ∗ with rows where both entries are non-zero. Then the estimate Θ of the problem (1) satisﬁes the following: (Success) Suppose the regularization coefﬁcients satisfy F1 − F2. Further, assume that the number of samples scales as θ(n, p, s, α) > 1. Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) for some positive numbers c1 and c2 , we are guaranteed that Θ satisﬁes the support-recovery and ℓ∞ error bound conditions (a-b) in Theorem 2. ˆ ˆ (Failure) If θ(n, p, s, α) < 1 there is no solution (B, S) for any choices of λs and λb such that ¯ sign Supp(Θ) = sign Supp(Θ) . We note that we require the gap ∗(1) Θj ∗(2) − Θj to be small only on rows where both entries are non-zero. As we show in a more general theorem in the appendix, even in the case where the gap is large, the dependence of the sample scaling on the gap is quite weak. 4 Empirical Results In this section, we investigate the performance of our dirty block sparse estimator on synthetic and real-world data. The synthetic experiments explore the accuracy of Theorem 3, and compare our estimator with LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We see that Theorem 3 is very accurate indeed. Next, we apply our method to a real world datasets containing hand-written digits for classiﬁcation. Again we compare against LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . (a multi-task regression dataset) with r = 2 tasks. In both of this real world dataset, we show that dirty model outperforms both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ practically. For each method, the parameters are chosen via cross-validation; see supplemental material for more details. 4.1 Synthetic Data Simulation We consider a r = 2-task regression problem as discussed in Theorem 3, for a range of parameters (n, p, s, α). The design matrices X have each entry being i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. For each ﬁxed set of (n, s, p, α), we generate 100 instances of the problem. In each instance, ¯ given p, s, α, the locations of the non-zero entries of the true Θ are chosen at randomly; each nonzero entry is then chosen to be i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. n samples are then generated from this. We then attempt to estimate using three methods: our dirty model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer and LASSO. In each case, and for each instance, the penalty regularizer coefﬁcients are found by cross validation. After solving the three problems, we compare the signed support of the solution with the true signed support and decide whether or not the program was successful in signed support recovery. We describe these process in more details in this section. Performance Analysis: We ran the algorithm for ﬁve different values of the overlap ratio α ∈ 2 {0.3, 3 , 0.8} with three different number of features p ∈ {128, 256, 512}. For any instance of the ˆ ¯ problem (n, p, s, α), if the recovered matrix Θ has the same sign support as the true Θ, then we count it as success, otherwise failure (even if one element has different sign, we count it as failure). As Theorem 3 predicts and Fig 3 shows, the right scaling for the number of oservations is n s log(p−(2−α)s) , where all curves stack on the top of each other at 2 − α. Also, the number of observations required by dirty model for true signed support recovery is always less than both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Fig 1(a) shows the probability of success for the case α = 0.3 (when LASSO is better than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer) and that dirty model outperforms both methods. When α = 2 3 (see Fig 1(b)), LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer performs the same; but dirty model require almost 33% less observations for the same performance. As α grows toward 1, e.g. α = 0.8 as shown in Fig 1(c), ℓ1 /ℓ∞ performs better than LASSO. Still, dirty model performs better than both methods in this case as well. 7 4 p=128 p=256 p=512 Phase Transition Threshold 3.5 L1/Linf Regularizer 3 2.5 LASSO 2 Dirty Model 1.5 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Shared Support Parameter α 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 2: Veriﬁcation of the result of the Theorem 3 on the behavior of phase transition threshold by changing the parameter α in a 2-task (n, p, s, α) problem for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. The y-axis p n is s log(p−(2−α)s) , where n is the number of samples at which threshold was observed. Here s = ⌊ 10 ⌋. Our dirty model method shows a gain in sample complexity over the entire range of sharing α. The pre-constant in Theorem 3 is also validated. n 10 20 40 Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Our Model 8.6% 0.53% B:165 B + S:171 S:18 B + S:1651 3.0% 0.56% B:211 B + S:226 S:34 B + S:2118 2.2% 0.57% B:270 B + S:299 S:67 B + S:2761 ℓ1 /ℓ∞ 9.9% 0.64% 170 1700 3.5% 0.62% 217 2165 3.2% 0.68% 368 3669 LASSO 10.8% 0.51% 123 539 4.1% 0.68% 173 821 2.8% 0.85% 354 2053 Table 1: Handwriting Classiﬁcation Results for our model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ and LASSO Scaling Veriﬁcation: To verify that the phase transition threshold changes linearly with α as predicted by Theorem 3, we plot the phase transition threshold versus α. For ﬁve different values of 2 α ∈ {0.05, 0.3, 3 , 0.8, 0.95} and three different values of p ∈ {128, 256, 512}, we ﬁnd the phase transition threshold for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We consider the point where the probability of success in recovery of signed support exceeds 50% as the phase transition threshold. We ﬁnd this point by interpolation on the closest two points. Fig 2 shows that phase transition threshold for dirty model is always lower than the phase transition for LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. 4.2 Handwritten Digits Dataset We use the handwritten digit dataset [1], containing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. This dataset has been used by a number of papers [17, 6] as a reliable dataset for handwritten recognition algorithms. There are thus r = 10 tasks, and each handwritten sample consists of p = 649 features. Table 1 shows the results of our analysis for different sizes n of the training set . We measure the classiﬁcation error for each digit to get the 10-vector of errors. Then, we ﬁnd the average error and the variance of the error vector to show how the error is distributed over all tasks. We compare our method with ℓ1 /ℓ∞ reguralizer method and LASSO. Again, in all methods, parameters are chosen via cross-validation. For our method we separate out the B and S matrices that our method ﬁnds, so as to illustrate how many features it identiﬁes as “shared” and how many as “non-shared”. For the other methods we just report the straight row and support numbers, since they do not make such a separation.

<p>Author: Shengbo Guo, Scott Sanner, Edwin V. Bonilla</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to preference elicitation (PE) are particularly attractive due to their ability to explicitly model uncertainty in users’ latent utility functions. However, previous approaches to Bayesian PE have ignored the important problem of generalizing from previous users to an unseen user in order to reduce the elicitation burden on new users. In this paper, we address this deﬁciency by introducing a Gaussian Process (GP) prior over users’ latent utility functions on the joint space of user and item features. We learn the hyper-parameters of this GP on a set of preferences of previous users and use it to aid in the elicitation process for a new user. This approach provides a ﬂexible model of a multi-user utility function, facilitates an efﬁcient value of information (VOI) heuristic query selection strategy, and provides a principled way to incorporate the elicitations of multiple users back into the model. We show the effectiveness of our method in comparison to previous work on a real dataset of user preferences over sushi types. 1</p><p>6 0.44216323 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Structured_Determinantal_Point_Processes.html">257 nips-2010-Structured Determinantal Point Processes</a></p>

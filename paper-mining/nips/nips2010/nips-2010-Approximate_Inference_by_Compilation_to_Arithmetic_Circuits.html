Further, we demonstrate that the algorithm performs robustly when stacked in several stages or when applied in undercomplete or overcomplete situations.

<p>Author: Diederik P. Kingma, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Score Matching is a recently-proposed criterion for training high-dimensional density models for which maximum likelihood training is intractable. It has been applied to learning natural image statistics but has so-far been limited to simple models due to the difﬁculty of differentiating the loss with respect to the model parameters. We show how this differentiation can be automated with an extended version of the double-backpropagation algorithm. In addition, we introduce a regularization term for the Score Matching loss that enables its use for a broader range of problem by suppressing instabilities that occur with ﬁnite training sample sizes and quantized input values. Results are reported for image denoising and super-resolution.</p><p>4 0.12888595 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_inference_in_continuous_time_Gaussian-Jump_processes.html">33 nips-2010-Approximate inference in continuous time Gaussian-Jump processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Andreas Ruttor, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to inference in conditionally Gaussian continuous time stochastic processes, where the latent process is a Markovian jump process. We ﬁrst consider the case of jump-diffusion processes, where the drift of a linear stochastic differential equation can jump at arbitrary time points. We derive partial differential equations for exact inference and present a very efﬁcient mean ﬁeld approximation. By introducing a novel lower bound on the free energy, we then generalise our approach to Gaussian processes with arbitrary covariance, such as the non-Markovian RBF covariance. We present results on both simulated and real data, showing that the approach is very accurate in capturing latent dynamics and can be useful in a number of real data modelling tasks.</p><p>5 0.12584952 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Efficient_Markov_Networks.html">144 nips-2010-Learning Efficient Markov Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Vibhav Gogate, William Webb, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning high-treewidth Markov networks where inference is still tractable. This is made possible by exploiting context-speciﬁc independence and determinism in the domain. The class of models our algorithm can learn has the same desirable properties as thin junction trees: polynomial inference, closed-form weight learning, etc., but is much broader. Our algorithm searches for a feature that divides the state space into subspaces where the remaining variables decompose into independent subsets (conditioned on the feature and its negation) and recurses on each subspace/subset of variables until no useful new features can be found. We provide probabilistic performance guarantees for our algorithm under the assumption that the maximum feature length is bounded by a constant k (the treewidth can be much larger) and dependences are of bounded strength. We also propose a greedy version of the algorithm that, while forgoing these guarantees, is much more efﬁcient. Experiments on a variety of domains show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art Markov network structure learners. 1</p><p>6 0.11621945 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

Our derivations are based on precise deﬁnitions of the various processes that will also allow us to provide an elementary proof of the “mysterious” coagulation and fragmentation properties used in the original paper on the sequence memoizer by Wood et al.

<p>Author: Abhay Jha, Vibhav Gogate, Alexandra Meliou, Dan Suciu</p><p>Abstract: Lifted Inference algorithms for representations that combine ﬁrst-order logic and graphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All lifted algorithms developed to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standard probabilistic inference algorithm (e.g., variable elimination, belief propagation etc.) and improve its efﬁciency by exploiting repeated structure in the ﬁrst-order model. In this paper, we propose an approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic for probabilistic inference. In particular, we deﬁne a set of rules that look only at the logical representation to identify models for which exact efﬁcient inference is possible. Our rules yield new tractable classes that could not be solved efﬁciently by any of the existing techniques. 1</p><p>6 0.42415932 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Efficient_Markov_Networks.html">144 nips-2010-Learning Efficient Markov Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Seth Myers, Jure Leskovec</p><p>Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, it is nearly impossible to collect explicit social network data. In such cases, whole networks must be inferred from underlying observations. Here, we formulate the problem of inferring latent social networks based on network diffusion or disease propagation data. We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1 -like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78065842 <a title="32-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_Inference_by_Compilation_to_Arithmetic_Circuits.html">32 nips-2010-Approximate Inference by Compilation to Arithmetic Circuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Konrad Rawlik, Marc Toussaint, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on iterative local approximations present a practical approach to optimal control in robotic systems. However, they generally require the temporal parameters (for e.g. the movement duration or the time point of reaching an intermediate goal) to be speciﬁed a priori. Here, we present a methodology that is capable of jointly optimizing the temporal parameters in addition to the control command proﬁles. The presented approach is based on a Bayesian canonical time formulation of the optimal control problem, with the temporal mapping from canonical to real time parametrised by an additional control variable. An approximate EM algorithm is derived that efﬁciently optimizes both the movement duration and control commands offering, for the ﬁrst time, a practical approach to tackling generic via point problems in a systematic way under the optimal control framework. The proposed approach, which is applicable to plants with non-linear dynamics as well as arbitrary state dependent and quadratic control costs, is evaluated on realistic simulations of a redundant robotic plant.</p><p>4 0.72765869 <a title="32-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Random_Projections_for_%24k%24-means_Clustering.html">221 nips-2010-Random Projections for $k$-means Clustering</a></p>

Several provably convergent approaches have been successfully developed using linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MAP problem. We present an alternative approach, which transforms the MAP problem into that of inference in a mixture of simple Bayes nets. We then derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for this mixture that also monotonically increases a lower bound on the MAP assignment until convergence. The update equations for the EM algorithm are remarkably simple, both conceptually and computationally, and can be implemented using a graph-based message passing paradigm similar to max-product computation. Experiments on the real-world protein design dataset show that EM’s convergence rate is signiﬁcantly higher than the previous LP relaxation based approach MPLP. EM also achieves a solution quality within 95% of optimal for most instances. 1</p><p>6 0.67916512 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Short-term_memory_in_neuronal_networks_through_dynamical_compressed_sensing.html">238 nips-2010-Short-term memory in neuronal networks through dynamical compressed sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>3 0.14589411 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Gergely Neu, Andras Antos, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider online learning in ﬁnite stochastic Markovian environments where in each time step a new reward function is chosen by an oblivious adversary. The goal of the learning agent is to compete with the best stationary policy in terms of the total reward received. In each time step the agent observes the current state and the reward associated with the last transition, however, the agent does not observe the rewards associated with other state-action pairs. The agent is assumed to know the transition probabilities. The state of the art result for this setting is a no-regret algorithm. In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm and, assuming that stationary policies mix uniformly fast, we show that after T time steps, the expected regret of the new algorithm is O T 2/3 (ln T )1/3 , giving the ﬁrst rigorously proved regret bound for the problem. 1</p><p>4 0.14393103 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Interval_Estimation_for_Reinforcement-Learning_Algorithms_in_Continuous-State_Domains.html">130 nips-2010-Interval Estimation for Reinforcement-Learning Algorithms in Continuous-State Domains</a></p>
<p>Author: Martha White, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: The reinforcement learning community has explored many approaches to obtaining value estimates and models to guide decision making; these approaches, however, do not usually provide a measure of conﬁdence in the estimate. Accurate estimates of an agent’s conﬁdence are useful for many applications, such as biasing exploration and automatically adjusting parameters to reduce dependence on parameter-tuning. Computing conﬁdence intervals on reinforcement learning value estimates, however, is challenging because data generated by the agentenvironment interaction rarely satisﬁes traditional assumptions. Samples of valueestimates are dependent, likely non-normally distributed and often limited, particularly in early learning when conﬁdence estimates are pivotal. In this work, we investigate how to compute robust conﬁdences for value estimates in continuous Markov decision processes. We illustrate how to use bootstrapping to compute conﬁdence intervals online under a changing policy (previously not possible) and prove validity under a few reasonable assumptions. We demonstrate the applicability of our conﬁdence estimation algorithms with experiments on exploration, parameter estimation and tracking. 1</p><p>5 0.1229848 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>6 0.11693952 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Harold Pashler, Matthew Wilder, Robert Lindsey, Matt Jones, Michael C. Mozer, Michael P. Holmes</p><p>Abstract: For over half a century, psychologists have been struck by how poor people are at expressing their internal sensations, impressions, and evaluations via rating scales. When individuals make judgments, they are incapable of using an absolute rating scale, and instead rely on reference points from recent experience. This relativity of judgment limits the usefulness of responses provided by individuals to surveys, questionnaires, and evaluation forms. Fortunately, the cognitive processes that transform internal states to responses are not simply noisy, but rather are inﬂuenced by recent experience in a lawful manner. We explore techniques to remove sequential dependencies, and thereby decontaminate a series of ratings to obtain more meaningful human judgments. In our formulation, decontamination is fundamentally a problem of inferring latent states (internal sensations) which, because of the relativity of judgment, have temporal dependencies. We propose a decontamination solution using a conditional random ﬁeld with constraints motivated by psychological theories of relative judgment. Our exploration of decontamination models is supported by two experiments we conducted to obtain ground-truth rating data on a simple length estimation task. Our decontamination techniques yield an over 20% reduction in the error of human judgments. 1</p><p>3 0.63522965 <a title="66-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Stability_Approach_to_Regularization_Selection_%28StARS%29_for_High_Dimensional_Graphical_Models.html">254 nips-2010-Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Angela J. Yu, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: Intelligent agents are often faced with the need to choose actions with uncertain consequences, and to modify those actions according to ongoing sensory processing and changing task demands. The requisite ability to dynamically modify or cancel planned actions is known as inhibitory control in psychology. We formalize inhibitory control as a rational decision-making problem, and apply to it to the classical stop-signal task. Using Bayesian inference and stochastic control tools, we show that the optimal policy systematically depends on various parameters of the problem, such as the relative costs of different action choices, the noise level of sensory inputs, and the dynamics of changing environmental demands. Our normative model accounts for a range of behavioral data in humans and animals in the stop-signal task, suggesting that the brain implements statistically optimal, dynamically adaptive, and reward-sensitive decision-making in the context of inhibitory control problems. 1</p><p>6 0.44145578 <a title="66-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: David Silver, Joel Veness</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent’s belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, MonteCarlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan eﬀectively in signiﬁcantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 × 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 1018 and 1056 states respectively. Our MonteCarlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the ﬁrst general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs. 1</p><p>2 0.93556845 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">194 nips-2010-Online Learning for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>3 0.91864449 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Group_Sparse_Regularization_with_Overlapping_Groups.html">12 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Group Sparse Regularization with Overlapping Groups</a></p>
<p>Author: Sofia Mosci, Silvia Villa, Alessandro Verri, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of variable selection when variables must be selected group-wise, with possibly overlapping groups deﬁned a priori. In particular we propose a new optimization procedure for solving the regularized algorithm presented in [12], where the group lasso penalty is generalized to overlapping groups of variables. While in [12] the proposed implementation requires explicit replication of the variables belonging to more than one group, our iterative procedure is based on a combination of proximal methods in the primal space and projected Newton method in a reduced dual space, corresponding to the active groups. This procedure provides a scalable alternative with no need for data duplication, and allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction. The computational advantages of our scheme with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms using data duplication are shown empirically with numerical simulations. 1</p><p>4 0.88672692 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>
<p>Author: Issei Sato, Kenichi Kurihara, Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: We develop a deterministic single-pass algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in order to process received documents one at a time and then discard them in an excess text stream. Our algorithm does not need to store old statistics for all data. The proposed algorithm is much faster than a batch algorithm and is comparable to the batch algorithm in terms of perplexity in experiments.</p><p>5 0.87959808 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Parallelized_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.html">202 nips-2010-Parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Markus Weimer, Lihong Li, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the ﬁrst parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8]. 1</p><p>6 0.8552019 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Network_Flow_Algorithms_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">181 nips-2010-Network Flow Algorithms for Structured Sparsity</a></p>

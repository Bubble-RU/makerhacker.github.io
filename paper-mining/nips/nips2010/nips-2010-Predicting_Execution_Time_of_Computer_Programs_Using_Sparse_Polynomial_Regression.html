<p>Author: Hongbo Zhou, Qiang Cheng</p><p>Abstract: Regularization technique has become a principled tool for statistics and machine learning research and practice. However, in most situations, these regularization terms are not well interpreted, especially on how they are related to the loss function and data. In this paper, we propose a robust minimax framework to interpret the relationship between data and regularization terms for a large class of loss functions. We show that various regularization terms are essentially corresponding to different distortions to the original data matrix. This minimax framework includes ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, fused lasso, group lasso, local coordinate coding, multiple kernel learning, etc., as special cases. Within this minimax framework, we further give mathematically exact deﬁnition for a novel representation called sparse grouping representation (SGR), and prove a set of sufﬁcient conditions for generating such group level sparsity. Under these sufﬁcient conditions, a large set of consistent regularization terms can be designed. This SGR is essentially different from group lasso in the way of using class or group information, and it outperforms group lasso when there appears group label noise. We also provide some generalization bounds in a classiﬁcation setting. 1</p><p>3 0.11486816 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Dirty_Model_for_Multi-task_Learning.html">5 nips-2010-A Dirty Model for Multi-task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Sujay Sanghavi, Chao Ruan, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-task learning in the setting of multiple linear regression, and where some relevant features could be shared across the tasks. Recent research has studied the use of ℓ1 /ℓq norm block-regularizations with q > 1 for such blocksparse structured problems, establishing strong guarantees on recovery even under high-dimensional scaling where the number of features scale with the number of observations. However, these papers also caution that the performance of such block-regularized methods are very dependent on the extent to which the features are shared across tasks. Indeed they show [8] that if the extent of overlap is less than a threshold, or even if parameter values in the shared features are highly uneven, then block ℓ1 /ℓq regularization could actually perform worse than simple separate elementwise ℓ1 regularization. Since these caveats depend on the unknown true parameters, we might not know when and which method to apply. Even otherwise, we are far away from a realistic multi-task setting: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same across tasks, but their values have to as well. Here, we ask the question: can we leverage parameter overlap when it exists, but not pay a penalty when it does not ? Indeed, this falls under a more general question of whether we can model such dirty data which may not fall into a single neat structural bracket (all block-sparse, or all low-rank and so on). With the explosion of such dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to develop tools – dirty models – to perform biased statistical estimation tailored to such data. Here, we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on developing a dirty model for the multiple regression problem. Our method uses a very simple idea: we estimate a superposition of two sets of parameters and regularize them differently. We show both theoretically and empirically, our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both ℓ1 or ℓ1 /ℓq methods, under high-dimensional scaling and over the entire range of possible overlaps (except at boundary cases, where we match the best method). 1 Introduction: Motivation and Setup High-dimensional scaling. In ﬁelds across science and engineering, we are increasingly faced with problems where the number of variables or features p is larger than the number of observations n. Under such high-dimensional scaling, for any hope of statistically consistent estimation, it becomes vital to leverage any potential structure in the problem such as sparsity (e.g. in compressed sensing [3] and LASSO [14]), low-rank structure [13, 9], or sparse graphical model structure [12]. It is in such high-dimensional contexts in particular that multi-task learning [4] could be most useful. Here, 1 multiple tasks share some common structure such as sparsity, and estimating these tasks jointly by leveraging this common structure could be more statistically efﬁcient. Block-sparse Multiple Regression. A common multiple task learning setting, and which is the focus of this paper, is that of multiple regression, where we have r > 1 response variables, and a common set of p features or covariates. The r tasks could share certain aspects of their underlying distributions, such as common variance, but the setting we focus on in this paper is where the response variables have simultaneously sparse structure: the index set of relevant features for each task is sparse; and there is a large overlap of these relevant features across the different regression problems. Such “simultaneous sparsity” arises in a variety of contexts [15]; indeed, most applications of sparse signal recovery in contexts ranging from graphical model learning, kernel learning, and function estimation have natural extensions to the simultaneous-sparse setting [12, 2, 11]. It is useful to represent the multiple regression parameters via a matrix, where each column corresponds to a task, and each row to a feature. Having simultaneous sparse structure then corresponds to the matrix being largely “block-sparse” – where each row is either all zero or mostly non-zero, and the number of non-zero rows is small. A lot of recent research in this setting has focused on ℓ1 /ℓq norm regularizations, for q > 1, that encourage the parameter matrix to have such blocksparse structure. Particular examples include results using the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ norm [16, 5, 8], and the ℓ1 /ℓ2 norm [7, 10]. Dirty Models. Block-regularization is “heavy-handed” in two ways. By strictly encouraging sharedsparsity, it assumes that all relevant features are shared, and hence suffers under settings, arguably more realistic, where each task depends on features speciﬁc to itself in addition to the ones that are common. The second concern with such block-sparse regularizers is that the ℓ1 /ℓq norms can be shown to encourage the entries in the non-sparse rows taking nearly identical values. Thus we are far away from the original goal of multitask learning: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same, but their values have to as well. Indeed recent research into such regularized methods [8, 10] caution against the use of block-regularization in regimes where the supports and values of the parameters for each task can vary widely. Since the true parameter values are unknown, that would be a worrisome caveat. We thus ask the question: can we learn multiple regression models by leveraging whatever overlap of features there exist, and without requiring the parameter values to be near identical? Indeed this is an instance of a more general question on whether we can estimate statistical models where the data may not fall cleanly into any one structural bracket (sparse, block-sparse and so on). With the explosion of dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to investigate estimation of corresponding dirty models, which might require new approaches to biased high-dimensional estimation. In this paper we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on such dirty models for a speciﬁc problem: simultaneously sparse multiple regression. Our approach uses a simple idea: while any one structure might not capture the data, a superposition of structural classes might. Our method thus searches for a parameter matrix that can be decomposed into a row-sparse matrix (corresponding to the overlapping or shared features) and an elementwise sparse matrix (corresponding to the non-shared features). As we show both theoretically and empirically, with this simple ﬁx we are able to leverage any extent of shared features, while allowing disparities in support and values of the parameters, so that we are always better than both the Lasso or block-sparse regularizers (at times remarkably so). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec 2. basic deﬁnitions and setup of the problem are presented. Main results of the paper is discussed in sec 3. Experimental results and simulations are demonstrated in Sec 4. Notation: For any matrix M , we denote its j th row as Mj , and its k-th column as M (k) . The set of all non-zero rows (i.e. all rows with at least one non-zero element) is denoted by RowSupp(M ) (k) and its support by Supp(M ). Also, for any matrix M , let M 1,1 := j,k |Mj |, i.e. the sums of absolute values of the elements, and M 1,∞ := j 2 Mj ∞ where, Mj ∞ (k) := maxk |Mj |. 2 Problem Set-up and Our Method Multiple regression. We consider the following standard multiple linear regression model: ¯ y (k) = X (k) θ(k) + w(k) , k = 1, . . . , r, where y (k) ∈ Rn is the response for the k-th task, regressed on the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p (possibly different across tasks), while w(k) ∈ Rn is the noise vector. We assume each w(k) is drawn independently from N (0, σ 2 ). The total number of tasks or target variables is r, the number of features is p, while the number of samples we have for each task is n. For notational convenience, ¯ we collate these quantities into matrices Y ∈ Rn×r for the responses, Θ ∈ Rp×r for the regression n×r parameters and W ∈ R for the noise. ¯ Dirty Model. In this paper we are interested in estimating the true parameter Θ from data by lever¯ aging any (unknown) extent of simultaneous-sparsity. In particular, certain rows of Θ would have many non-zero entries, corresponding to features shared by several tasks (“shared” rows), while certain rows would be elementwise sparse, corresponding to those features which are relevant for some tasks but not all (“non-shared rows”), while certain rows would have all zero entries, corresponding to those features that are not relevant to any task. We are interested in estimators Θ that automatically adapt to different levels of sharedness, and yet enjoy the following guarantees: Support recovery: We say an estimator Θ successfully recovers the true signed support if ¯ sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign(Supp(Θ)). We are interested in deriving sufﬁcient conditions under which ¯ the estimator succeeds. We note that this is stronger than merely recovering the row-support of Θ, which is union of its supports for the different tasks. In particular, denoting Uk for the support of the ¯ k-th column of Θ, and U = k Uk . Error bounds: We are also interested in providing bounds on the elementwise ℓ∞ norm error of the estimator Θ, ¯ Θ−Θ 2.1 ∞ = max max j=1,...,p k=1,...,r (k) Θj (k) ¯ − Θj . Our Method Our method explicitly models the dirty block-sparse structure. We estimate a sum of two parameter matrices B and S with different regularizations for each: encouraging block-structured row-sparsity in B and elementwise sparsity in S. The corresponding “clean” models would either just use blocksparse regularizations [8, 10] or just elementwise sparsity regularizations [14, 18], so that either method would perform better in certain suited regimes. Interestingly, as we will see in the main results, by explicitly allowing to have both block-sparse and elementwise sparse component, we are ¯ able to outperform both classes of these “clean models”, for all regimes Θ. Algorithm 1 Dirty Block Sparse Solve the following convex optimization problem: (S, B) ∈ arg min S,B 1 2n r k=1 y (k) − X (k) S (k) + B (k) 2 2 + λs S 1,1 + λb B 1,∞ . (1) Then output Θ = B + S. 3 Main Results and Their Consequences We now provide precise statements of our main results. A number of recent results have shown that the Lasso [14, 18] and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization [8] methods succeed in recovering signed supports with controlled error bounds under high-dimensional scaling regimes. Our ﬁrst two theorems extend these results to our dirty model setting. In Theorem 1, we consider the case of deterministic design matrices X (k) , and provide sufﬁcient conditions guaranteeing signed support recovery, and elementwise ℓ∞ norm error bounds. In Theorem 2, we specialize this theorem to the case where the 3 rows of the design matrices are random from a general zero mean Gaussian distribution: this allows us to provide scaling on the number of observations required in order to guarantee signed support recovery and bounded elementwise ℓ∞ norm error. Our third result is the most interesting in that it explicitly quantiﬁes the performance gains of our method vis-a-vis Lasso and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization method. Since this entailed ﬁnding the precise constants underlying earlier theorems, and a correspondingly more delicate analysis, we follow Negahban and Wainwright [8] and focus on the case where there are two-tasks (i.e. r = 2), and where we have standard Gaussian design matrices as in Theorem 2. Further, while each of two tasks depends on s features, only a fraction α of these are common. It is then interesting to see how the behaviors of the different regularization methods vary with the extent of overlap α. Comparisons. Negahban and Wainwright [8] show that there is actually a “phase transition” in the scaling of the probability of successful signed support-recovery with the number of observations. n Denote a particular rescaling of the sample-size θLasso (n, p, α) = s log(p−s) . Then as Wainwright [18] show, when the rescaled number of samples scales as θLasso > 2 + δ for any δ > 0, Lasso succeeds in recovering the signed support of all columns with probability converging to one. But when the sample size scales as θLasso < 2−δ for any δ > 0, Lasso fails with probability converging to one. For the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -reguralized multiple linear regression, deﬁne a similar rescaled sample size n θ1,∞ (n, p, α) = s log(p−(2−α)s) . Then as Negahban and Wainwright [8] show there is again a transition in probability of success from near zero to near one, at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (4 − 3α). Thus, for α < 2/3 (“less sharing”) Lasso would perform better since its transition is at a smaller sample size, while for α > 2/3 (“more sharing”) the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method would perform better. As we show in our third theorem, the phase transition for our method occurs at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (2 − α), which is strictly before either the Lasso or the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method except for the boundary cases: α = 0, i.e. the case of no sharing, where we match Lasso, and for α = 1, i.e. full sharing, where we match ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . Everywhere else, we strictly outperform both methods. Figure 3 shows the empirical performance of each of the three methods; as can be seen, they agree very well with the theoretical analysis. (Further details in the experiments Section 4). 3.1 Sufﬁcient Conditions for Deterministic Designs We ﬁrst consider the case where the design matrices X (k) for k = 1, · · ·, r are deterministic, and start by specifying the assumptions we impose on the model. We note that similar sufﬁcient conditions for the deterministic X (k) ’s case were imposed in papers analyzing Lasso [18] and block-regularization methods [8, 10]. (k) A0 Column Normalization Xj 2 ≤ √ 2n for all j = 1, . . . , p, k = 1, . . . , r. ¯ Let Uk denote the support of the k-th column of Θ, and U = supports for each task. Then we require that k r A1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Xj , XUk (k) (k) XUk , XUk Uk denote the union of −1 c We will also ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne γs := 1−max1≤k≤r maxj∈Uk (k) > 0. 1 k=1 (k) Xj , XUk Note that by the incoherence condition A1, we have γs > 0.

Further, we require the regularization penalties be set as λs > 2(2 − γs )σ log(pr) √ γs n and 4 λb > 2(2 − γb )σ log(pr) √ . γb n (2) 1 0.9 0.8 0.8 Dirty Model L1/Linf Reguralizer Probability of Success Probability of Success 1 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 LASSO 0.3 0.2 0 0.5 1 1.5 1.7 2 2.5 Control Parameter θ 3 3.1 3.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.3 LASSO 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 Dirty Model 0.7 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 4 1 1.333 (a) α = 0.3 1.5 2 Control Parameter θ (b) α = 2.5 3 2 3 1 0.9 Dirty Model Probability of Success 0.8 0.7 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.6 0.5 LASSO 0.4 0.3 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 1 1.2 1.5 1.6 2 Control Parameter θ 2.5 (c) α = 0.8 Figure 1: Probability of success in recovering the true signed support using dirty model, Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. For a 2-task problem, the probability of success for different values of feature-overlap fraction α is plotted. As we can see in the regimes that Lasso is better than, as good as and worse than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer ((a), (b) and (c) respectively), the dirty model outperforms both of the methods, i.e., it requires less number of observations for successful recovery of the true signed support compared to Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Here p s = ⌊ 10 ⌋ always. Theorem 1. Suppose A0-A3 hold, and that we obtain estimate Θ from our algorithm with regularization parameters chosen according to (2). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) → 1, we are guaranteed that the convex program (1) has a unique optimum and (a) The estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ 4σ 2 log (pr) + λs Dmax . n Cmin ≤ bmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > bmin . Here the positive constants c1 , c2 depend only on γs , γb , λs , λb and σ, but are otherwise independent of n, p, r, the problem dimensions of interest. Remark: Condition (a) guarantees that the estimate will have no false inclusions; i.e. all included features will be relevant. If in addition, we require that it have no false exclusions and that recover the support exactly, we need to impose the assumption in (b) that the non-zero elements are large enough to be detectable above the noise. 3.2 General Gaussian Designs Often the design matrices consist of samples from a Gaussian ensemble. Suppose that for each task (k) k = 1, . . . , r the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p is such that each row Xi ∈ Rp is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix Σ(k) ∈ Rp×p , and is independent of every other (k) row. Let ΣV,U ∈ R|V|×|U | be the submatrix of Σ(k) with rows corresponding to V and columns to U . We require these covariance matrices to satisfy the following conditions: r C1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Σj,Uk , ΣUk ,Uk k=1 5 −1 >0 1 C2 Eigenvalue Condition Cmin := min λmin Σ(k),Uk Uk > 0 so that the minimum eigenvalue 1≤k≤r is bounded away from zero. C3 Boundedness Condition Dmax := (k) ΣUk ,Uk −1 ∞,1 < ∞. These conditions are analogues of the conditions for deterministic designs; they are now imposed on the covariance matrix of the (randomly generated) rows of the design matrix. Further, deﬁning s := maxk |Uk |, we require the regularization penalties be set as 1/2 λs > 1/2 4σ 2 Cmin log(pr) √ γs nCmin − 2s log(pr) and λb > 4σ 2 Cmin r(r log(2) + log(p)) . √ γb nCmin − 2sr(r log(2) + log(p)) (3) Theorem 2. Suppose assumptions C1-C3 hold, and that the number of samples scale as n > max 2s log(pr) 2sr r log(2)+log(p) 2 2 Cmin γs , Cmin γb . Suppose we obtain estimate Θ from algorithm (3). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp (−c2 (r log(2) + log(p))) − c3 exp(−c4 log(rs)) → 1 for some positive numbers c1 − c4 , we are guaranteed that the algorithm estimate Θ is unique and satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) the estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ ≤ 50σ 2 log(rs) + λs nCmin 4s √ + Dmax . Cmin n gmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that 3.3 min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > gmin . Sharp Transition for 2-Task Gaussian Designs This is one of the most important results of this paper. Here, we perform a more delicate and ﬁner analysis to establish precise quantitative gains of our method. We focus on the special case where r = 2 and the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ), so that C1 − C3 hold, with Cmin = Dmax = 1. As we will see both analytically and experimentally, our method strictly outperforms both Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -block-regularization over for all cases, except at the extreme endpoints of no support sharing (where it matches that of Lasso) and full support sharing (where it matches that of ℓ1 /ℓ∞ ). We now present our analytical results; the empirical comparisons are presented next in Section 4. The results will be in terms of a particular rescaling of the sample size n as θ(n, p, s, α) := n . (2 − α)s log (p − (2 − α)s) We will also require the assumptions that 4σ 2 (1 − F1 λs > F2 λb > s/n)(log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((2 − α) s (log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 4σ 2 (1 − s/n)r(r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) , 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((1 − α/2) sr (r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 . Theorem 3. Consider a 2-task regression problem (n, p, s, α), where the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ). 6 Suppose maxj∈B∗ ∗(1) Θj − ∗(2) Θj = o(λs ), where B ∗ is the submatrix of Θ∗ with rows where both entries are non-zero. Then the estimate Θ of the problem (1) satisﬁes the following: (Success) Suppose the regularization coefﬁcients satisfy F1 − F2. Further, assume that the number of samples scales as θ(n, p, s, α) > 1. Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) for some positive numbers c1 and c2 , we are guaranteed that Θ satisﬁes the support-recovery and ℓ∞ error bound conditions (a-b) in Theorem 2. ˆ ˆ (Failure) If θ(n, p, s, α) < 1 there is no solution (B, S) for any choices of λs and λb such that ¯ sign Supp(Θ) = sign Supp(Θ) . We note that we require the gap ∗(1) Θj ∗(2) − Θj to be small only on rows where both entries are non-zero. As we show in a more general theorem in the appendix, even in the case where the gap is large, the dependence of the sample scaling on the gap is quite weak. 4 Empirical Results In this section, we investigate the performance of our dirty block sparse estimator on synthetic and real-world data. The synthetic experiments explore the accuracy of Theorem 3, and compare our estimator with LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We see that Theorem 3 is very accurate indeed. Next, we apply our method to a real world datasets containing hand-written digits for classiﬁcation. Again we compare against LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . (a multi-task regression dataset) with r = 2 tasks. In both of this real world dataset, we show that dirty model outperforms both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ practically. For each method, the parameters are chosen via cross-validation; see supplemental material for more details. 4.1 Synthetic Data Simulation We consider a r = 2-task regression problem as discussed in Theorem 3, for a range of parameters (n, p, s, α). The design matrices X have each entry being i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. For each ﬁxed set of (n, s, p, α), we generate 100 instances of the problem. In each instance, ¯ given p, s, α, the locations of the non-zero entries of the true Θ are chosen at randomly; each nonzero entry is then chosen to be i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. n samples are then generated from this. We then attempt to estimate using three methods: our dirty model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer and LASSO. In each case, and for each instance, the penalty regularizer coefﬁcients are found by cross validation. After solving the three problems, we compare the signed support of the solution with the true signed support and decide whether or not the program was successful in signed support recovery. We describe these process in more details in this section. Performance Analysis: We ran the algorithm for ﬁve different values of the overlap ratio α ∈ 2 {0.3, 3 , 0.8} with three different number of features p ∈ {128, 256, 512}. For any instance of the ˆ ¯ problem (n, p, s, α), if the recovered matrix Θ has the same sign support as the true Θ, then we count it as success, otherwise failure (even if one element has different sign, we count it as failure). As Theorem 3 predicts and Fig 3 shows, the right scaling for the number of oservations is n s log(p−(2−α)s) , where all curves stack on the top of each other at 2 − α. Also, the number of observations required by dirty model for true signed support recovery is always less than both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Fig 1(a) shows the probability of success for the case α = 0.3 (when LASSO is better than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer) and that dirty model outperforms both methods. When α = 2 3 (see Fig 1(b)), LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer performs the same; but dirty model require almost 33% less observations for the same performance. As α grows toward 1, e.g. α = 0.8 as shown in Fig 1(c), ℓ1 /ℓ∞ performs better than LASSO. Still, dirty model performs better than both methods in this case as well. 7 4 p=128 p=256 p=512 Phase Transition Threshold 3.5 L1/Linf Regularizer 3 2.5 LASSO 2 Dirty Model 1.5 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Shared Support Parameter α 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 2: Veriﬁcation of the result of the Theorem 3 on the behavior of phase transition threshold by changing the parameter α in a 2-task (n, p, s, α) problem for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer.

For ﬁve different values of 2 α ∈ {0.05, 0.3, 3 , 0.8, 0.95} and three different values of p ∈ {128, 256, 512}, we ﬁnd the phase transition threshold for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We consider the point where the probability of success in recovery of signed support exceeds 50% as the phase transition threshold. We ﬁnd this point by interpolation on the closest two points. Fig 2 shows that phase transition threshold for dirty model is always lower than the phase transition for LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. 4.2 Handwritten Digits Dataset We use the handwritten digit dataset [1], containing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. This dataset has been used by a number of papers [17, 6] as a reliable dataset for handwritten recognition algorithms. There are thus r = 10 tasks, and each handwritten sample consists of p = 649 features. Table 1 shows the results of our analysis for different sizes n of the training set . We measure the classiﬁcation error for each digit to get the 10-vector of errors. Then, we ﬁnd the average error and the variance of the error vector to show how the error is distributed over all tasks. We compare our method with ℓ1 /ℓ∞ reguralizer method and LASSO. Again, in all methods, parameters are chosen via cross-validation. For our method we separate out the B and S matrices that our method ﬁnds, so as to illustrate how many features it identiﬁes as “shared” and how many as “non-shared”. For the other methods we just report the straight row and support numbers, since they do not make such a separation.

<p>Author: Nikos Karampatziakis</p><p>Abstract: We cast the problem of identifying basic blocks of code in a binary executable as learning a mapping from a byte sequence to a segmentation of the sequence. In general, inference in segmentation models, such as semi-CRFs, can be cubic in the length of the sequence. By taking advantage of the structure of our problem, we derive a linear-time inference algorithm which makes our approach practical, given that even small programs are tens or hundreds of thousands bytes long. Furthermore, we introduce two loss functions which are appropriate for our problem and show how to use structural SVMs to optimize the learned mapping for these losses. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of our method against a strong baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.11125296 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>6 0.10511136 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Adaptive_Multi-Task_Lasso%3A_with_Application_to_eQTL_Detection.html">26 nips-2010-Adaptive Multi-Task Lasso: with Application to eQTL Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Ling Huang, Jinzhu Jia, Bin Yu, Byung-gon Chun, Petros Maniatis, Mayur Naik</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the execution time of computer programs is an important but challenging problem in the community of computer systems. Existing methods require experts to perform detailed analysis of program code in order to construct predictors or select important features. We recently developed a new system to automatically extract a large number of features from program execution on sample inputs, on which prediction models can be constructed without expert knowledge. In this paper we study the construction of predictive models for this problem. We propose the SPORE (Sparse POlynomial REgression) methodology to build accurate prediction models of program performance using feature data collected from program execution on sample inputs. Our two SPORE algorithms are able to build relationships between responses (e.g., the execution time of a computer program) and features, and select a few from hundreds of the retrieved features to construct an explicitly sparse and non-linear model to predict the response variable. The compact and explicitly polynomial form of the estimated model could reveal important insights into the computer program (e.g., features and their non-linear combinations that dominate the execution time), enabling a better understanding of the program’s behavior. Our evaluation on three widely used computer programs shows that SPORE methods can give accurate prediction with relative error less than 7% by using a moderate number of training data samples. In addition, we compare SPORE algorithms to state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms, and show that SPORE methods, motivated by real applications, outperform the other methods in terms of both interpretability and prediction accuracy.</p><p>2 0.80629551 <a title="211-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-Adaptive_Multi-Task_Lasso%3A_with_Application_to_eQTL_Detection.html">26 nips-2010-Adaptive Multi-Task Lasso: with Application to eQTL Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Seunghak Lee, Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: To understand the relationship between genomic variations among population and complex diseases, it is essential to detect eQTLs which are associated with phenotypic effects. However, detecting eQTLs remains a challenge due to complex underlying mechanisms and the very large number of genetic loci involved compared to the number of samples. Thus, to address the problem, it is desirable to take advantage of the structure of the data and prior information about genomic locations such as conservation scores and transcription factor binding sites. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized regression approach for detecting eQTLs which takes into account related traits simultaneously while incorporating many regulatory features. We ﬁrst present a Bayesian network for a multi-task learning problem that includes priors on SNPs, making it possible to estimate the signiﬁcance of each covariate adaptively. Then we ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of regression coefﬁcients and estimate weights of covariates jointly. This optimization procedure is efﬁcient since it can be achieved by using a projected gradient descent and a coordinate descent procedure iteratively. Experimental results on simulated and real yeast datasets conﬁrm that our model outperforms previous methods for ﬁnding eQTLs.</p><p>3 0.77263218 <a title="211-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Dirty_Model_for_Multi-task_Learning.html">5 nips-2010-A Dirty Model for Multi-task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Sujay Sanghavi, Chao Ruan, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-task learning in the setting of multiple linear regression, and where some relevant features could be shared across the tasks. Recent research has studied the use of ℓ1 /ℓq norm block-regularizations with q > 1 for such blocksparse structured problems, establishing strong guarantees on recovery even under high-dimensional scaling where the number of features scale with the number of observations. However, these papers also caution that the performance of such block-regularized methods are very dependent on the extent to which the features are shared across tasks. Indeed they show [8] that if the extent of overlap is less than a threshold, or even if parameter values in the shared features are highly uneven, then block ℓ1 /ℓq regularization could actually perform worse than simple separate elementwise ℓ1 regularization. Since these caveats depend on the unknown true parameters, we might not know when and which method to apply. Even otherwise, we are far away from a realistic multi-task setting: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same across tasks, but their values have to as well. Here, we ask the question: can we leverage parameter overlap when it exists, but not pay a penalty when it does not ? Indeed, this falls under a more general question of whether we can model such dirty data which may not fall into a single neat structural bracket (all block-sparse, or all low-rank and so on). With the explosion of such dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to develop tools – dirty models – to perform biased statistical estimation tailored to such data. Here, we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on developing a dirty model for the multiple regression problem. Our method uses a very simple idea: we estimate a superposition of two sets of parameters and regularize them differently. We show both theoretically and empirically, our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both ℓ1 or ℓ1 /ℓq methods, under high-dimensional scaling and over the entire range of possible overlaps (except at boundary cases, where we match the best method). 1 Introduction: Motivation and Setup High-dimensional scaling. In ﬁelds across science and engineering, we are increasingly faced with problems where the number of variables or features p is larger than the number of observations n. Under such high-dimensional scaling, for any hope of statistically consistent estimation, it becomes vital to leverage any potential structure in the problem such as sparsity (e.g. in compressed sensing [3] and LASSO [14]), low-rank structure [13, 9], or sparse graphical model structure [12]. It is in such high-dimensional contexts in particular that multi-task learning [4] could be most useful. Here, 1 multiple tasks share some common structure such as sparsity, and estimating these tasks jointly by leveraging this common structure could be more statistically efﬁcient. Block-sparse Multiple Regression. A common multiple task learning setting, and which is the focus of this paper, is that of multiple regression, where we have r > 1 response variables, and a common set of p features or covariates. The r tasks could share certain aspects of their underlying distributions, such as common variance, but the setting we focus on in this paper is where the response variables have simultaneously sparse structure: the index set of relevant features for each task is sparse; and there is a large overlap of these relevant features across the different regression problems. Such “simultaneous sparsity” arises in a variety of contexts [15]; indeed, most applications of sparse signal recovery in contexts ranging from graphical model learning, kernel learning, and function estimation have natural extensions to the simultaneous-sparse setting [12, 2, 11]. It is useful to represent the multiple regression parameters via a matrix, where each column corresponds to a task, and each row to a feature. Having simultaneous sparse structure then corresponds to the matrix being largely “block-sparse” – where each row is either all zero or mostly non-zero, and the number of non-zero rows is small. A lot of recent research in this setting has focused on ℓ1 /ℓq norm regularizations, for q > 1, that encourage the parameter matrix to have such blocksparse structure. Particular examples include results using the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ norm [16, 5, 8], and the ℓ1 /ℓ2 norm [7, 10]. Dirty Models. Block-regularization is “heavy-handed” in two ways. By strictly encouraging sharedsparsity, it assumes that all relevant features are shared, and hence suffers under settings, arguably more realistic, where each task depends on features speciﬁc to itself in addition to the ones that are common. The second concern with such block-sparse regularizers is that the ℓ1 /ℓq norms can be shown to encourage the entries in the non-sparse rows taking nearly identical values. Thus we are far away from the original goal of multitask learning: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same, but their values have to as well. Indeed recent research into such regularized methods [8, 10] caution against the use of block-regularization in regimes where the supports and values of the parameters for each task can vary widely. Since the true parameter values are unknown, that would be a worrisome caveat. We thus ask the question: can we learn multiple regression models by leveraging whatever overlap of features there exist, and without requiring the parameter values to be near identical? Indeed this is an instance of a more general question on whether we can estimate statistical models where the data may not fall cleanly into any one structural bracket (sparse, block-sparse and so on). With the explosion of dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to investigate estimation of corresponding dirty models, which might require new approaches to biased high-dimensional estimation. In this paper we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on such dirty models for a speciﬁc problem: simultaneously sparse multiple regression. Our approach uses a simple idea: while any one structure might not capture the data, a superposition of structural classes might. Our method thus searches for a parameter matrix that can be decomposed into a row-sparse matrix (corresponding to the overlapping or shared features) and an elementwise sparse matrix (corresponding to the non-shared features). As we show both theoretically and empirically, with this simple ﬁx we are able to leverage any extent of shared features, while allowing disparities in support and values of the parameters, so that we are always better than both the Lasso or block-sparse regularizers (at times remarkably so). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec 2. basic deﬁnitions and setup of the problem are presented. Main results of the paper is discussed in sec 3. Experimental results and simulations are demonstrated in Sec 4. Notation: For any matrix M , we denote its j th row as Mj , and its k-th column as M (k) . The set of all non-zero rows (i.e. all rows with at least one non-zero element) is denoted by RowSupp(M ) (k) and its support by Supp(M ). Also, for any matrix M , let M 1,1 := j,k |Mj |, i.e. the sums of absolute values of the elements, and M 1,∞ := j 2 Mj ∞ where, Mj ∞ (k) := maxk |Mj |. 2 Problem Set-up and Our Method Multiple regression. We consider the following standard multiple linear regression model: ¯ y (k) = X (k) θ(k) + w(k) , k = 1, . . . , r, where y (k) ∈ Rn is the response for the k-th task, regressed on the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p (possibly different across tasks), while w(k) ∈ Rn is the noise vector. We assume each w(k) is drawn independently from N (0, σ 2 ). The total number of tasks or target variables is r, the number of features is p, while the number of samples we have for each task is n. For notational convenience, ¯ we collate these quantities into matrices Y ∈ Rn×r for the responses, Θ ∈ Rp×r for the regression n×r parameters and W ∈ R for the noise. ¯ Dirty Model. In this paper we are interested in estimating the true parameter Θ from data by lever¯ aging any (unknown) extent of simultaneous-sparsity. In particular, certain rows of Θ would have many non-zero entries, corresponding to features shared by several tasks (“shared” rows), while certain rows would be elementwise sparse, corresponding to those features which are relevant for some tasks but not all (“non-shared rows”), while certain rows would have all zero entries, corresponding to those features that are not relevant to any task. We are interested in estimators Θ that automatically adapt to different levels of sharedness, and yet enjoy the following guarantees: Support recovery: We say an estimator Θ successfully recovers the true signed support if ¯ sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign(Supp(Θ)). We are interested in deriving sufﬁcient conditions under which ¯ the estimator succeeds. We note that this is stronger than merely recovering the row-support of Θ, which is union of its supports for the different tasks. In particular, denoting Uk for the support of the ¯ k-th column of Θ, and U = k Uk . Error bounds: We are also interested in providing bounds on the elementwise ℓ∞ norm error of the estimator Θ, ¯ Θ−Θ 2.1 ∞ = max max j=1,...,p k=1,...,r (k) Θj (k) ¯ − Θj . Our Method Our method explicitly models the dirty block-sparse structure. We estimate a sum of two parameter matrices B and S with different regularizations for each: encouraging block-structured row-sparsity in B and elementwise sparsity in S. The corresponding “clean” models would either just use blocksparse regularizations [8, 10] or just elementwise sparsity regularizations [14, 18], so that either method would perform better in certain suited regimes. Interestingly, as we will see in the main results, by explicitly allowing to have both block-sparse and elementwise sparse component, we are ¯ able to outperform both classes of these “clean models”, for all regimes Θ. Algorithm 1 Dirty Block Sparse Solve the following convex optimization problem: (S, B) ∈ arg min S,B 1 2n r k=1 y (k) − X (k) S (k) + B (k) 2 2 + λs S 1,1 + λb B 1,∞ . (1) Then output Θ = B + S. 3 Main Results and Their Consequences We now provide precise statements of our main results. A number of recent results have shown that the Lasso [14, 18] and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization [8] methods succeed in recovering signed supports with controlled error bounds under high-dimensional scaling regimes. Our ﬁrst two theorems extend these results to our dirty model setting. In Theorem 1, we consider the case of deterministic design matrices X (k) , and provide sufﬁcient conditions guaranteeing signed support recovery, and elementwise ℓ∞ norm error bounds. In Theorem 2, we specialize this theorem to the case where the 3 rows of the design matrices are random from a general zero mean Gaussian distribution: this allows us to provide scaling on the number of observations required in order to guarantee signed support recovery and bounded elementwise ℓ∞ norm error. Our third result is the most interesting in that it explicitly quantiﬁes the performance gains of our method vis-a-vis Lasso and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization method. Since this entailed ﬁnding the precise constants underlying earlier theorems, and a correspondingly more delicate analysis, we follow Negahban and Wainwright [8] and focus on the case where there are two-tasks (i.e. r = 2), and where we have standard Gaussian design matrices as in Theorem 2. Further, while each of two tasks depends on s features, only a fraction α of these are common. It is then interesting to see how the behaviors of the different regularization methods vary with the extent of overlap α. Comparisons. Negahban and Wainwright [8] show that there is actually a “phase transition” in the scaling of the probability of successful signed support-recovery with the number of observations. n Denote a particular rescaling of the sample-size θLasso (n, p, α) = s log(p−s) . Then as Wainwright [18] show, when the rescaled number of samples scales as θLasso > 2 + δ for any δ > 0, Lasso succeeds in recovering the signed support of all columns with probability converging to one. But when the sample size scales as θLasso < 2−δ for any δ > 0, Lasso fails with probability converging to one. For the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -reguralized multiple linear regression, deﬁne a similar rescaled sample size n θ1,∞ (n, p, α) = s log(p−(2−α)s) . Then as Negahban and Wainwright [8] show there is again a transition in probability of success from near zero to near one, at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (4 − 3α). Thus, for α < 2/3 (“less sharing”) Lasso would perform better since its transition is at a smaller sample size, while for α > 2/3 (“more sharing”) the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method would perform better. As we show in our third theorem, the phase transition for our method occurs at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (2 − α), which is strictly before either the Lasso or the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method except for the boundary cases: α = 0, i.e. the case of no sharing, where we match Lasso, and for α = 1, i.e. full sharing, where we match ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . Everywhere else, we strictly outperform both methods. Figure 3 shows the empirical performance of each of the three methods; as can be seen, they agree very well with the theoretical analysis. (Further details in the experiments Section 4). 3.1 Sufﬁcient Conditions for Deterministic Designs We ﬁrst consider the case where the design matrices X (k) for k = 1, · · ·, r are deterministic, and start by specifying the assumptions we impose on the model. We note that similar sufﬁcient conditions for the deterministic X (k) ’s case were imposed in papers analyzing Lasso [18] and block-regularization methods [8, 10]. (k) A0 Column Normalization Xj 2 ≤ √ 2n for all j = 1, . . . , p, k = 1, . . . , r. ¯ Let Uk denote the support of the k-th column of Θ, and U = supports for each task. Then we require that k r A1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Xj , XUk (k) (k) XUk , XUk Uk denote the union of −1 c We will also ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne γs := 1−max1≤k≤r maxj∈Uk (k) > 0. 1 k=1 (k) Xj , XUk Note that by the incoherence condition A1, we have γs > 0. A2 Eigenvalue Condition Cmin := min λmin 1≤k≤r A3 Boundedness Condition Dmax := max 1≤k≤r 1 (k) (k) XUk , XUk n 1 (k) (k) XUk , XUk n (k) (k) XUk , XUk −1 . 1 > 0. −1 ∞,1 < ∞. Further, we require the regularization penalties be set as λs > 2(2 − γs )σ log(pr) √ γs n and 4 λb > 2(2 − γb )σ log(pr) √ . γb n (2) 1 0.9 0.8 0.8 Dirty Model L1/Linf Reguralizer Probability of Success Probability of Success 1 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 LASSO 0.3 0.2 0 0.5 1 1.5 1.7 2 2.5 Control Parameter θ 3 3.1 3.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.3 LASSO 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 Dirty Model 0.7 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 4 1 1.333 (a) α = 0.3 1.5 2 Control Parameter θ (b) α = 2.5 3 2 3 1 0.9 Dirty Model Probability of Success 0.8 0.7 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.6 0.5 LASSO 0.4 0.3 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 1 1.2 1.5 1.6 2 Control Parameter θ 2.5 (c) α = 0.8 Figure 1: Probability of success in recovering the true signed support using dirty model, Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. For a 2-task problem, the probability of success for different values of feature-overlap fraction α is plotted. As we can see in the regimes that Lasso is better than, as good as and worse than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer ((a), (b) and (c) respectively), the dirty model outperforms both of the methods, i.e., it requires less number of observations for successful recovery of the true signed support compared to Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Here p s = ⌊ 10 ⌋ always. Theorem 1. Suppose A0-A3 hold, and that we obtain estimate Θ from our algorithm with regularization parameters chosen according to (2). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) → 1, we are guaranteed that the convex program (1) has a unique optimum and (a) The estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ 4σ 2 log (pr) + λs Dmax . n Cmin ≤ bmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > bmin . Here the positive constants c1 , c2 depend only on γs , γb , λs , λb and σ, but are otherwise independent of n, p, r, the problem dimensions of interest. Remark: Condition (a) guarantees that the estimate will have no false inclusions; i.e. all included features will be relevant. If in addition, we require that it have no false exclusions and that recover the support exactly, we need to impose the assumption in (b) that the non-zero elements are large enough to be detectable above the noise. 3.2 General Gaussian Designs Often the design matrices consist of samples from a Gaussian ensemble. Suppose that for each task (k) k = 1, . . . , r the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p is such that each row Xi ∈ Rp is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix Σ(k) ∈ Rp×p , and is independent of every other (k) row. Let ΣV,U ∈ R|V|×|U | be the submatrix of Σ(k) with rows corresponding to V and columns to U . We require these covariance matrices to satisfy the following conditions: r C1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Σj,Uk , ΣUk ,Uk k=1 5 −1 >0 1 C2 Eigenvalue Condition Cmin := min λmin Σ(k),Uk Uk > 0 so that the minimum eigenvalue 1≤k≤r is bounded away from zero. C3 Boundedness Condition Dmax := (k) ΣUk ,Uk −1 ∞,1 < ∞. These conditions are analogues of the conditions for deterministic designs; they are now imposed on the covariance matrix of the (randomly generated) rows of the design matrix. Further, deﬁning s := maxk |Uk |, we require the regularization penalties be set as 1/2 λs > 1/2 4σ 2 Cmin log(pr) √ γs nCmin − 2s log(pr) and λb > 4σ 2 Cmin r(r log(2) + log(p)) . √ γb nCmin − 2sr(r log(2) + log(p)) (3) Theorem 2. Suppose assumptions C1-C3 hold, and that the number of samples scale as n > max 2s log(pr) 2sr r log(2)+log(p) 2 2 Cmin γs , Cmin γb . Suppose we obtain estimate Θ from algorithm (3). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp (−c2 (r log(2) + log(p))) − c3 exp(−c4 log(rs)) → 1 for some positive numbers c1 − c4 , we are guaranteed that the algorithm estimate Θ is unique and satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) the estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ ≤ 50σ 2 log(rs) + λs nCmin 4s √ + Dmax . Cmin n gmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that 3.3 min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > gmin . Sharp Transition for 2-Task Gaussian Designs This is one of the most important results of this paper. Here, we perform a more delicate and ﬁner analysis to establish precise quantitative gains of our method. We focus on the special case where r = 2 and the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ), so that C1 − C3 hold, with Cmin = Dmax = 1. As we will see both analytically and experimentally, our method strictly outperforms both Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -block-regularization over for all cases, except at the extreme endpoints of no support sharing (where it matches that of Lasso) and full support sharing (where it matches that of ℓ1 /ℓ∞ ). We now present our analytical results; the empirical comparisons are presented next in Section 4. The results will be in terms of a particular rescaling of the sample size n as θ(n, p, s, α) := n . (2 − α)s log (p − (2 − α)s) We will also require the assumptions that 4σ 2 (1 − F1 λs > F2 λb > s/n)(log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((2 − α) s (log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 4σ 2 (1 − s/n)r(r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) , 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((1 − α/2) sr (r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 . Theorem 3. Consider a 2-task regression problem (n, p, s, α), where the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ). 6 Suppose maxj∈B∗ ∗(1) Θj − ∗(2) Θj = o(λs ), where B ∗ is the submatrix of Θ∗ with rows where both entries are non-zero. Then the estimate Θ of the problem (1) satisﬁes the following: (Success) Suppose the regularization coefﬁcients satisfy F1 − F2. Further, assume that the number of samples scales as θ(n, p, s, α) > 1. Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) for some positive numbers c1 and c2 , we are guaranteed that Θ satisﬁes the support-recovery and ℓ∞ error bound conditions (a-b) in Theorem 2. ˆ ˆ (Failure) If θ(n, p, s, α) < 1 there is no solution (B, S) for any choices of λs and λb such that ¯ sign Supp(Θ) = sign Supp(Θ) . We note that we require the gap ∗(1) Θj ∗(2) − Θj to be small only on rows where both entries are non-zero. As we show in a more general theorem in the appendix, even in the case where the gap is large, the dependence of the sample scaling on the gap is quite weak. 4 Empirical Results In this section, we investigate the performance of our dirty block sparse estimator on synthetic and real-world data. The synthetic experiments explore the accuracy of Theorem 3, and compare our estimator with LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We see that Theorem 3 is very accurate indeed. Next, we apply our method to a real world datasets containing hand-written digits for classiﬁcation. Again we compare against LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . (a multi-task regression dataset) with r = 2 tasks. In both of this real world dataset, we show that dirty model outperforms both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ practically. For each method, the parameters are chosen via cross-validation; see supplemental material for more details. 4.1 Synthetic Data Simulation We consider a r = 2-task regression problem as discussed in Theorem 3, for a range of parameters (n, p, s, α). The design matrices X have each entry being i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. For each ﬁxed set of (n, s, p, α), we generate 100 instances of the problem. In each instance, ¯ given p, s, α, the locations of the non-zero entries of the true Θ are chosen at randomly; each nonzero entry is then chosen to be i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. n samples are then generated from this. We then attempt to estimate using three methods: our dirty model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer and LASSO. In each case, and for each instance, the penalty regularizer coefﬁcients are found by cross validation. After solving the three problems, we compare the signed support of the solution with the true signed support and decide whether or not the program was successful in signed support recovery. We describe these process in more details in this section. Performance Analysis: We ran the algorithm for ﬁve different values of the overlap ratio α ∈ 2 {0.3, 3 , 0.8} with three different number of features p ∈ {128, 256, 512}. For any instance of the ˆ ¯ problem (n, p, s, α), if the recovered matrix Θ has the same sign support as the true Θ, then we count it as success, otherwise failure (even if one element has different sign, we count it as failure). As Theorem 3 predicts and Fig 3 shows, the right scaling for the number of oservations is n s log(p−(2−α)s) , where all curves stack on the top of each other at 2 − α. Also, the number of observations required by dirty model for true signed support recovery is always less than both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Fig 1(a) shows the probability of success for the case α = 0.3 (when LASSO is better than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer) and that dirty model outperforms both methods. When α = 2 3 (see Fig 1(b)), LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer performs the same; but dirty model require almost 33% less observations for the same performance. As α grows toward 1, e.g. α = 0.8 as shown in Fig 1(c), ℓ1 /ℓ∞ performs better than LASSO. Still, dirty model performs better than both methods in this case as well. 7 4 p=128 p=256 p=512 Phase Transition Threshold 3.5 L1/Linf Regularizer 3 2.5 LASSO 2 Dirty Model 1.5 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Shared Support Parameter α 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 2: Veriﬁcation of the result of the Theorem 3 on the behavior of phase transition threshold by changing the parameter α in a 2-task (n, p, s, α) problem for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. The y-axis p n is s log(p−(2−α)s) , where n is the number of samples at which threshold was observed. Here s = ⌊ 10 ⌋. Our dirty model method shows a gain in sample complexity over the entire range of sharing α. The pre-constant in Theorem 3 is also validated. n 10 20 40 Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Average Classiﬁcation Error Variance of Error Average Row Support Size Average Support Size Our Model 8.6% 0.53% B:165 B + S:171 S:18 B + S:1651 3.0% 0.56% B:211 B + S:226 S:34 B + S:2118 2.2% 0.57% B:270 B + S:299 S:67 B + S:2761 ℓ1 /ℓ∞ 9.9% 0.64% 170 1700 3.5% 0.62% 217 2165 3.2% 0.68% 368 3669 LASSO 10.8% 0.51% 123 539 4.1% 0.68% 173 821 2.8% 0.85% 354 2053 Table 1: Handwriting Classiﬁcation Results for our model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ and LASSO Scaling Veriﬁcation: To verify that the phase transition threshold changes linearly with α as predicted by Theorem 3, we plot the phase transition threshold versus α. For ﬁve different values of 2 α ∈ {0.05, 0.3, 3 , 0.8, 0.95} and three different values of p ∈ {128, 256, 512}, we ﬁnd the phase transition threshold for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We consider the point where the probability of success in recovery of signed support exceeds 50% as the phase transition threshold. We ﬁnd this point by interpolation on the closest two points. Fig 2 shows that phase transition threshold for dirty model is always lower than the phase transition for LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. 4.2 Handwritten Digits Dataset We use the handwritten digit dataset [1], containing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. This dataset has been used by a number of papers [17, 6] as a reliable dataset for handwritten recognition algorithms. There are thus r = 10 tasks, and each handwritten sample consists of p = 649 features. Table 1 shows the results of our analysis for different sizes n of the training set . We measure the classiﬁcation error for each digit to get the 10-vector of errors. Then, we ﬁnd the average error and the variance of the error vector to show how the error is distributed over all tasks. We compare our method with ℓ1 /ℓ∞ reguralizer method and LASSO. Again, in all methods, parameters are chosen via cross-validation. For our method we separate out the B and S matrices that our method ﬁnds, so as to illustrate how many features it identiﬁes as “shared” and how many as “non-shared”. For the other methods we just report the straight row and support numbers, since they do not make such a separation.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ ∗ + where is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N (0, σ 2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β ∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β ∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability the difference between the solution ˆ β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β ∗ measured in terms of the lp norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N )1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β ∗ , ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of √ β ∗ larger than a certain value in the order of O(σ log m). The proposed method improves the estimation bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately √ √ from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N )1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β ∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. 1</p><p>5 0.73705482 <a title="211-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Sufficient_Conditions_for_Generating_Group_Level_Sparsity_in_a_Robust_Minimax_Framework.html">260 nips-2010-Sufficient Conditions for Generating Group Level Sparsity in a Robust Minimax Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongbo Zhou, Qiang Cheng</p><p>Abstract: Regularization technique has become a principled tool for statistics and machine learning research and practice. However, in most situations, these regularization terms are not well interpreted, especially on how they are related to the loss function and data. In this paper, we propose a robust minimax framework to interpret the relationship between data and regularization terms for a large class of loss functions. We show that various regularization terms are essentially corresponding to different distortions to the original data matrix. This minimax framework includes ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, fused lasso, group lasso, local coordinate coding, multiple kernel learning, etc., as special cases. Within this minimax framework, we further give mathematically exact deﬁnition for a novel representation called sparse grouping representation (SGR), and prove a set of sufﬁcient conditions for generating such group level sparsity. Under these sufﬁcient conditions, a large set of consistent regularization terms can be designed. This SGR is essentially different from group lasso in the way of using class or group information, and it outperforms group lasso when there appears group label noise. We also provide some generalization bounds in a classiﬁcation setting. 1</p><p>6 0.72553772 <a title="211-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano, Alex J. Smola, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm to perform multitask learning where each task has potentially distinct label sets and label correspondences are not readily available. This is in contrast with existing methods which either assume that the label sets shared by different tasks are the same or that there exists a label mapping oracle. Our method directly maximizes the mutual information among the labels, and we show that the resulting objective function can be efﬁciently optimized using existing algorithms. Our proposed approach has a direct application for data integration with different label spaces, such as integrating Yahoo! and DMOZ web directories. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84446317 <a title="211-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Predicting_Execution_Time_of_Computer_Programs_Using_Sparse_Polynomial_Regression.html">211 nips-2010-Predicting Execution Time of Computer Programs Using Sparse Polynomial Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Huang, Jinzhu Jia, Bin Yu, Byung-gon Chun, Petros Maniatis, Mayur Naik</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the execution time of computer programs is an important but challenging problem in the community of computer systems. Existing methods require experts to perform detailed analysis of program code in order to construct predictors or select important features. We recently developed a new system to automatically extract a large number of features from program execution on sample inputs, on which prediction models can be constructed without expert knowledge. In this paper we study the construction of predictive models for this problem. We propose the SPORE (Sparse POlynomial REgression) methodology to build accurate prediction models of program performance using feature data collected from program execution on sample inputs. Our two SPORE algorithms are able to build relationships between responses (e.g., the execution time of a computer program) and features, and select a few from hundreds of the retrieved features to construct an explicitly sparse and non-linear model to predict the response variable. The compact and explicitly polynomial form of the estimated model could reveal important insights into the computer program (e.g., features and their non-linear combinations that dominate the execution time), enabling a better understanding of the program’s behavior. Our evaluation on three widely used computer programs shows that SPORE methods can give accurate prediction with relative error less than 7% by using a moderate number of training data samples. In addition, we compare SPORE algorithms to state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms, and show that SPORE methods, motivated by real applications, outperform the other methods in terms of both interpretability and prediction accuracy.</p><p>3 0.83462745 <a title="211-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Candidate_Labeling_Sets.html">151 nips-2010-Learning from Candidate Labeling Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Luo, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: In many real world applications we do not have access to fully-labeled training data, but only to a list of possible labels. This is the case, e.g., when learning visual classiﬁers from images downloaded from the web, using just their text captions or tags as learning oracles. In general, these problems can be very difﬁcult. However most of the time there exist different implicit sources of information, coming from the relations between instances and labels, which are usually dismissed. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised framework to model this kind of problems. Each training sample is a bag containing multi-instances, associated with a set of candidate labeling vectors. Each labeling vector encodes the possible labels for the instances in the bag, with only one being fully correct. The use of the labeling vectors provides a principled way not to exclude any information. We propose a large margin discriminative formulation, and an efﬁcient algorithm to solve it. Experiments conducted on artiﬁcial datasets and a real-world images and captions dataset show that our approach achieves performance comparable to an SVM trained with the ground-truth labels, and outperforms other baselines.</p><p>4 0.82311606 <a title="211-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Relaxed_Clipping%3A_A_Global_Training_Method_for_Robust_Regression_and_Classification.html">225 nips-2010-Relaxed Clipping: A Global Training Method for Robust Regression and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Yang, Linli Xu, Martha White, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Robust regression and classiﬁcation are often thought to require non-convex loss functions that prevent scalable, global training. However, such a view neglects the possibility of reformulated training methods that can yield practically solvable alternatives. A natural way to make a loss function more robust to outliers is to truncate loss values that exceed a maximum threshold. We demonstrate that a relaxation of this form of “loss clipping” can be made globally solvable and applicable to any standard loss while guaranteeing robustness against outliers. We present a generic procedure that can be applied to standard loss functions and demonstrate improved robustness in regression and classiﬁcation problems. 1</p><p>5 0.79934031 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Message-Passing_Algorithm_for_Approximated_Large_Scale_Structured_Prediction.html">13 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Message-Passing Algorithm for Approximated Large Scale Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an approximated structured prediction framework for large scale graphical models and derive message-passing algorithms for learning their parameters efﬁciently. We ﬁrst relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as the soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on a local entropy approximation and derive an efﬁcient messagepassing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efﬁciently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.7926386 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida_Regularization_for_Grouped_Tree_Structure_Learning.html">170 nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida Regularization for Grouped Tree Structure Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural ﬁring rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron sufﬁces to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the online approximation of signals with a sum of powerlaw kernels is beneﬁcial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.28030494 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Novel_Kernel_for_Learning_a_Neuron_Model_from_Spike_Train_Data.html">10 nips-2010-A Novel Kernel for Learning a Neuron Model from Spike Train Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Fisher, Arunava Banerjee</p><p>Abstract: From a functional viewpoint, a spiking neuron is a device that transforms input spike trains on its various synapses into an output spike train on its axon. We demonstrate in this paper that the function mapping underlying the device can be tractably learned based on input and output spike train data alone. We begin by posing the problem in a classiﬁcation based framework. We then derive a novel kernel for an SRM0 model that is based on PSP and AHP like functions. With the kernel we demonstrate how the learning problem can be posed as a Quadratic Program. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.27813703 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrien Wohrer, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How much information does a neural population convey about a stimulus? Answers to this question are known to strongly depend on the correlation of response variability in neural populations. These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>6 0.23831514 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing?

<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>4 0.74403048 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Qin, Xiubo Geng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with rank aggregation, which aims to combine multiple input rankings to get a better ranking. A popular approach to rank aggregation is based on probabilistic models on permutations, e.g., the Luce model and the Mallows model. However, these models have their limitations in either poor expressiveness or high computational complexity. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new model, which is deﬁned with a coset-permutation distance, and models the generation of a permutation as a stagewise process. We refer to the new model as coset-permutation distance based stagewise (CPS) model. The CPS model has rich expressiveness and can therefore be used in versatile applications, because many different permutation distances can be used to induce the coset-permutation distance. The complexity of the CPS model is low because of the stagewise decomposition of the permutation probability and the efﬁcient computation of most coset-permutation distances. We apply the CPS model to supervised rank aggregation, derive the learning and inference algorithms, and empirically study their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Experiments on public datasets show that the derived algorithms based on the CPS model can achieve state-ofthe-art ranking accuracy, and are much more efﬁcient than previous algorithms.</p><p>3 0.73040313 <a title="21-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Trading_off_Mistakes_and_Don%27t-Know_Predictions.html">274 nips-2010-Trading off Mistakes and Don't-Know Predictions</a></p>
<p>Author: Amin Sayedi, Morteza Zadimoghaddam, Avrim Blum</p><p>Abstract: We discuss an online learning framework in which the agent is allowed to say “I don’t know” as well as making incorrect predictions on given examples. We analyze the trade off between saying “I don’t know” and making mistakes. If the number of don’t-know predictions is required to be zero, the model reduces to the well-known mistake-bound model introduced by Littlestone [Lit88]. On the other hand, if no mistakes are allowed, the model reduces to KWIK framework introduced by Li et. al. [LLW08]. We propose a general, though inefﬁcient, algorithm for general ﬁnite concept classes that minimizes the number of don’t-know predictions subject to a given bound on the number of allowed mistakes. We then present speciﬁc polynomial-time algorithms for the concept classes of monotone disjunctions and linear separators with a margin.</p><p>4 0.72125709 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Sparse_Coding_for_Learning_Interpretable_Spatio-Temporal_Primitives.html">246 nips-2010-Sparse Coding for Learning Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Primitives</a></p>
<p>Author: Taehwan Kim, Gregory Shakhnarovich, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding has recently become a popular approach in computer vision to learn dictionaries of natural images. In this paper we extend the sparse coding framework to learn interpretable spatio-temporal primitives. We formulated the problem as a tensor factorization problem with tensor group norm constraints over the primitives, diagonal constraints on the activations that provide interpretability as well as smoothness constraints that are inherent to human motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to learn interpretable representations of human motion from motion capture data, and show that our approach outperforms recently developed matching pursuit and sparse coding algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.71367741 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Functional_Geometry_Alignment_and_Localization_of_Brain_Areas.html">97 nips-2010-Functional Geometry Alignment and Localization of Brain Areas</a></p>
<p>Author: Georg Langs, Yanmei Tie, Laura Rigolo, Alexandra Golby, Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: Matching functional brain regions across individuals is a challenging task, largely due to the variability in their location and extent. It is particularly difﬁcult, but highly relevant, for patients with pathologies such as brain tumors, which can cause substantial reorganization of functional systems. In such cases spatial registration based on anatomical data is only of limited value if the goal is to establish correspondences of functional areas among different individuals, or to localize potentially displaced active regions. Rather than rely on spatial alignment, we propose to perform registration in an alternative space whose geometry is governed by the functional interaction patterns in the brain. We ﬁrst embed each brain into a functional map that reﬂects connectivity patterns during a fMRI experiment. The resulting functional maps are then registered, and the obtained correspondences are propagated back to the two brains. In application to a language fMRI experiment, our preliminary results suggest that the proposed method yields improved functional correspondences across subjects. This advantage is pronounced for subjects with tumors that affect the language areas and thus cause spatial reorganization of the functional regions. 1</p><p>6 0.67113233 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Multivariate_Dyadic_Regression_Trees_for_Sparse_Learning_Problems.html">178 nips-2010-Multivariate Dyadic Regression Trees for Sparse Learning Problems</a></p>

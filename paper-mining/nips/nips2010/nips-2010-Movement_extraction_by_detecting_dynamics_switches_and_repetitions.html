<p>Author: Konrad Rawlik, Marc Toussaint, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on iterative local approximations present a practical approach to optimal control in robotic systems. However, they generally require the temporal parameters (for e.g. the movement duration or the time point of reaching an intermediate goal) to be speciﬁed a priori. Here, we present a methodology that is capable of jointly optimizing the temporal parameters in addition to the control command proﬁles. The presented approach is based on a Bayesian canonical time formulation of the optimal control problem, with the temporal mapping from canonical to real time parametrised by an additional control variable. An approximate EM algorithm is derived that efﬁciently optimizes both the movement duration and control commands offering, for the ﬁrst time, a practical approach to tackling generic via point problems in a systematic way under the optimal control framework. The proposed approach, which is applicable to plants with non-linear dynamics as well as arbitrary state dependent and quadratic control costs, is evaluated on realistic simulations of a redundant robotic plant.</p><p>3 0.12190887 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

Unlike previous methods based on natural gradients, our algorithm calculates the natural policy gradient using the inverse of the exact Fisher information matrix. The computational cost of this algorithm is equal to that of conventional policy gradients whereas previous natural policy gradient methods have a prohibitive computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>4 0.10790236 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Random_Walk_Approach_to_Regret_Minimization.html">222 nips-2010-Random Walk Approach to Regret Minimization</a></p>

CST uses a changepoint detection method to segment each trajectory into a skill chain by detecting a change of appropriate abstraction, or that a segment is too complex to model as a single skill. The skill chains from each trajectory are then merged to form a skill tree. We demonstrate that CST constructs an appropriate skill tree that can be further reﬁned through learning in a challenging continuous domain, and that it can be used to segment demonstration trajectories on a mobile manipulator into chains of skills where each skill is assigned an appropriate abstraction. 1</p><p>4 0.63359845 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Mixture_of_time-warped_trajectory_models_for_movement_decoding.html">167 nips-2010-Mixture of time-warped trajectory models for movement decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Elaine Corbett, Eric Perreault, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: Applications of Brain-Machine-Interfaces typically estimate user intent based on biological signals that are under voluntary control. For example, we might want to estimate how a patient with a paralyzed arm wants to move based on residual muscle activity. To solve such problems it is necessary to integrate obtained information over time. To do so, state of the art approaches typically use a probabilistic model of how the state, e.g. position and velocity of the arm, evolves over time – a so-called trajectory model. We wanted to further develop this approach using two intuitive insights: (1) At any given point of time there may be a small set of likely movement targets, potentially identified by the location of objects in the workspace or by gaze information from the user. (2) The user may want to produce movements at varying speeds. We thus use a generative model with a trajectory model incorporating these insights. Approximate inference on that generative model is implemented using a mixture of extended Kalman filters. We find that the resulting algorithm allows us to decode arm movements dramatically better than when we use a trajectory model with linear dynamics. 1 In trod u cti on When patients have lost a limb or the ability to communicate with the outside world, brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are often used to enable robotic prostheses or restore communication. To achieve this, the user's intended state of the device must be decoded from biological signals. In the context of Bayesian statistics, two aspects are important for the design of an estimator of a temporally evolving state: the observation model, which describes how measured variables relate to the system’s state and the trajectory model which describes how the state changes over time in a probabilistic manner. Following this logic many recent BMI applications have relied on Bayesian estimation for a wide range of problems including the decoding of intended human [1] and animal [2] movements. In the context of BMIs, Bayesian approaches offer a principled way of formalizing the uncertainty about signals and thus often result in improvements over other signal processing techniques [1]-[3]. Most work on state estimation in dynamical systems has assumed linear dynamics and Gaussian noise. Under these circumstances, efficient algorithms result from belief propagation. The most frequent application uses the Kalman filter (KF), which recursively combines noisy state observations with the probabilistic evolution of state defined by the trajectory model to estimate the marginal distribution over states [4]. Such approaches have been used widely for applications including upper [1] and lower [5] extremity prosthetic 1 devices, functional electric stimulation [6] and human computer interactions [7]. As these algorithms are so commonly used, it seems promising to develop extensions to nonlinear trajectory models that may better describe the probabilistic distribution of movements in everyday life. One salient departure from the standard assumptions is that people tend to produce both slow and fast movements, depending on the situation. Models with linear dynamics only allow such deviation through the noise term, which makes these models poor at describing the natural variation of movement speeds during real world tasks. Explicitly incorporating movement speed into the trajectory model should lead to better movement estimates. Knowledge of the target position should also strongly affect trajectory models. After all , we tend to accelerate our arm early during movement and slow down later on. Target information can be linearly incorporated into the trajectory model, and this has greatly improved predictions [8]-[12]. Alternatively, if there are a small number of potential targets then a mixture of trajectory models approach [13] can be used. Here we are interested in the case where available data provide a prior over potential t argets but where movement targets may be anywhere. We want to incorporate target uncertainty and allow generalization to novel targets. Prior information about potential targets could come from a number of sources but would generally be noisy. For example, activity in the dorsal premotor cortex provides information about intended target location prior to movement and may be used where such recordings are available [14]. Target information may also be found noninvasively by tracking eye movements. However, such data will generally provide non-zero priors for a number of possible target locations as the subject saccades over the scene. While subjects almost always look at a target before reaching for it [15], there may be a delay of up to a second between looking at the target and the reach – a time interval over which up to 3 saccades are typically made. Each of these fixations could be the target. Hence, a probabilistic distribution of targets is appropriate when using either neural recordings or eye tracking to estimate potential reach targets Here we present an algorithm that uses a mixture of extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) to combine our insights related to the variation of movement speed and the availability of probabilistic target knowledge. Each of the mixture component s allows the speed of the movement to vary continuously over time. We tested how well we could use EMGs and eye movements to decode hand position of humans performing a three -dimensional large workspace reaching task. We find that using a trajectory model that allows for probabilistic target information and variation of speed leads to dramatic improvements in decoding quality. 2 Gen e ral Decod i n g S etti n g We wanted to test how well different decoding algorithms can decode human movement, over a wide range of dynamics. While many recent studies have looked at more restrictive, two-dimensional movements, a system to restore arm function should produce a wide range of 3D trajectories. We recorded arm kinematics and EMGs of healthy subjects during unconstrained 3D reaches to targets over a large workspace. Two healthy subjects were asked to reach at slow, normal and fast speeds, as they would in everyday life. Subjects were seated as they reached towards 16 LEDs in blocks of 150s, which were located on two planes positioned such that all targets were just reachable (Fig 1A). The target LED was lit for one second prior to an auditory go cue, at which time the subject would reach to the target at the appropriate speed. Slow, normal and fast reaches were allotted 3 s, 1.5s and 1s respectively; however, subjects determined the speed. An approximate total of 450 reaches were performed per subject. The subjects provided informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. EMG signals were measured from the pectoralis major, and the three deltoid muscles of the shoulder. This represents a small subset of the muscles involved in reaching, and approximates those muscles retaining some voluntary control following mid-level cervical spinal cord injuries. 2 The EMG signals were band-pass filtered between 10 and 1,000 Hz, and subsequently anti aliased filtered. Hand, wrist, shoulder and head positions were tracked using an Optotrak motion analysis system. We simultaneously recorded eye movements with an ASL EYETRAC-6 head mounted eye tracker. Approximately 25% of the reaches were assigned to the test set, and the rest were used for training. Reaches for which either the motion capture data was incomplete, or there was visible motion artifact on the EMG were removed. As the state we used hand positions and joint angles (3 shoulder, 2 elbow, position, velocity and acceleration, 24 dimensions). Joint angles were calculated from the shoulder and wrist marker data using digitized bony landmarks which defined a coordinate system for the upper limb as detailed by Wu et al. [16]. As the motion data were sampled at 60Hz, the mean absolute value o f the EMG in the corresponding 16.7ms windows was used as an observation of the state at each time-step. Algorithm accuracy was quantified by normalizing the root -mean-squared error by the straight line distance between the first and final position of the endpoint for each reach. We compared the algorithms statistically using repeated measures ANOVAs with Tukey post -hoc tests, treating reach and subject as random effects. In the rest of the paper we will ask how well these reaching movements can be decoded from EMG and eye-tracking data. Figure 1: A Experimental setup and B sample kinematics and processed EMGs for one reach 3 Kal man Fi l ters w i th Target i n f ormati on All models that we consider in this paper assume linear observations with Gaussian noise: (1) where x is the state, y is the observation and v is the measurement noise with p(v) ~ N(0,R), and R is the observation covariance matrix. The model fitted the measured EMGs with an average r2 of 0.55. This highlights the need to integrate information over time. The standard approach also assumes linear dynamics and Gaussian process noise: (2) where, x t represents the hand and joint angle positions, w is the process noise with p(w) ~ N(0,Q), and Q is the state covariance matrix. The Kalman filter does optimal inference for this generative model. This model can effectively capture the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to a single target by appropriately tuning its parameters. However, when used to describe reaches to multiple targets, the model cannot describe target dependent aspects of reaching but boils down to a random drift model. Fast velocities are underestimated as they are unlikely under the trajectory model and there is excessive drift close to the target (Fig. 2A). 3 In many decoding applications we may know the subject’s target. A range of recent studies have addressed the issue of incorporating this information into the trajectory model [8, 13], and we might assume the effect of the target on the dynamics to be linear. This naturally suggests adding the target to the state space, which works well in practice [9, 12]. By appending the target to the state vector (KFT), the simple linear format of the KF may be retained: (3) where xTt is the vector of target positions, with dimensionality less than or equal to that of xt. This trajectory model thus allows describing both the rapid acceleration that characterizes the beginning of a reach and the stabilization towards its end. We compared the accuracy of the KF and the KFT to the Single Target Model (STM), a KF trained only on reaches to the target being tested (Fig. 2). The STM represents the best possible prediction that could be obtained with a Kalman filter. Assuming the target is perfectly known, we implemented the KFT by correctly initializing the target state xT at the beginning of the reach. We will relax this assumption below. The initial hand and joint angle positions were also assumed to be known. Figure 2: A Sample reach and predictions and B average accuracies with standard errors for KFT, KF and MTM. Consistent with the recent literature, both methods that incorporated target information produced higher prediction accuracy than the standard KF (both p<0.0001). Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the KFT and the STM (p=0.9). It seems that when we have knowledge of the target, we do not lose much by training a single model over the whole workspace rather than modeling the targets individually. This is encouraging, as we desire a BMI system that can generalize to any target within the workspace, not just specifically to those that are available in the training data. Clearly, adding the target to the state space allows the dynamics of typical movements to be modeled effectively, resulting in dramatic increases in decoding performance. 4 Ti me Warp i n g 4.1 I m p l e m e n t i n g a t i m e - w a r p e d t r a j e c t o r y mo d e l While the KFT above can capture the general reach trajectory profile, it does not allow for natural variability in the speed of movements. Depending on our task objectives, which would not directly be observed by a BMI, we might lazily reach toward a target or move a t maximal speed. We aim to change the trajectory model to explicitly incorporate a warping factor by which the average movement speed is scaled, allowing for such variability. As the movement speed will be positive in all practical cases, we model the logarithm of this factor, 4 and append it to the state vector: (4) We create a time-warped trajectory model by noting that if the average rate of a trajectory is to be scaled by a factor S, the position at time t will equal that of the original trajectory at time St. Differentiating, the velocity will be multiplied by S, and the acceleration by S 2. For simplicity, the trajectory noise is assumed to be additive and Gaussian, and the model is assumed to be stationary: (5) where Ip is the p-dimensional identity matrix and is a p p matrix of zeros. Only the terms used to predict the acceleration states need to be estimated to build the state transition matrix, and they are scaled as a nonlinear function of xs. After adding the variable movement speed to the state space the system is no longer linear. Therefore we need a different solution strategy. Instead of the typical KFT we use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKFT) to implement a nonlinear trajectory model by linearizing the dynamics around the best estimate at each time-step [17]. With this approach we add only small computational overhead to the KFT recursions. 4.2 Tr a i n i n g t h e t i m e w a r p i n g mo d e l The filter parameters were trained using a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [18]. For extended Kalman filter learning the initialization for the variables may matter. S was initialized with the ground truth average reach speeds for each movement relative to the average speed across all movements. The state transition parameters were estimated using nonlinear least squares regression, while C, Q and R were estimated linearly for the new system, using the maximum likelihood solution [18] (M-step). For the E-step we used a standard extended Kalman smoother. We thus found the expected values for t he states given the current filter parameters. For this computation, and later when testing the algorithm, xs was initialized to its average value across all reaches while the remaining states were initialized to their true values. The smoothed estimate fo r xs was then used, along with the true values for the other states, to re-estimate the filter parameters in the M-step as before. We alternated between the E and M steps until the log likelihood converged (which it did in all cases). Following the training procedure, the diagonal of the state covariance matrix Q corresponding to xs was set to the variance of the smoothed xs over all reaches, according to how much this state should be allowed to change during prediction. This allowed the estimate of xs to develop over the course of the reach due to the evidence provided by the observations, better capturing the dynamics of reaches at different speeds. 4.3 P e r f o r ma n c e o f t h e t i m e - w a r p e d E K F T Incorporating time warping explicitly into the trajectory model pro duced a noticeable increase in decoding performance over the KFT. As the speed state xs is estimated throughout the course of the reach, based on the evidence provided by the observations, the trajectory model has the flexibility to follow the dynamics of the reach more accurately (Fig. 3). While at the normal self-selected speed the difference between the algorithms is small, for the slow and fast speeds, where the dynamics deviate from average, there i s a clear advantage to the time warping model. 5 Figure 3: Hand positions and predictions of the KFT and EKFT for sample reaches at A slow, B normal and C fast speeds. Note the different time scales between reaches. The models were first trained using data from all speeds (Fig. 4A). The EKFT was 1.8% more accurate on average (p<0.01), and the effect was significant at the slow (1.9%, p<0.05) and the fast (2.8%, p<0.01), but not at the normal (p=0.3) speed. We also trained the models from data using only reaches at the self-selected normal speed, as we wanted to see if there was enough variation to effectively train the EKFT (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the performance of the EKFT was reduced by only 0.6%, and the KFT by 1.1%. The difference in performance between the EKFT and KFT was even more pronounced on aver age (2.3%, p<0.001), and for the slow and fast speeds (3.6 and 4.1%, both p< 0.0001). At the normal speed, the algorithms again were not statistically different (p=0.6). This result demonstrates that the EKFT is a practical option for a real BMI system, as it is not necessary to greatly vary the speeds while collecting training data for the model to be effective over a wide range of intended speeds. Explicitly incorporating speed information into the trajectory model helps decoding, by modeling the natural variation in volitional speed. Figure 4: Mean and standard error of EKFT and KFT accuracy at the different subjectselected speeds. Models were trained on reaches at A all speeds and B just normal speed reaches. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the algorithms. 5 Mi xtu res of Target s So far, we have assumed that the targets of our reaches are perfectly known. In a real-world system, there will be uncertainty about the intended target of the reach. However, in typical applications there are a small number of possible objectives. Here we address this situation. Drawing on the recent literature, we use a mixture model to consider each of the possible targets [11, 13]. We condition the posterior probability for the state on the N possible targets, T: (6) 6 Using Bayes' Rule, this equation becomes: (7) As we are dealing with a mixture model, we perform the Kalman filter recursion for each possible target, xT, and our solution is a weighted sum of the outputs. The weights are proportional to the prior for that target, , and the likelihood of the model given that target . is independent of the target and does not need to be calculated. We tested mixtures of both algorithms, the mKFT and mEKFT, with real uncert ain priors obtained from eye-tracking in the one-second period preceding movement. As the targets were situated on two planes, the three-dimensional location of the eye gaze was found by projecting its direction onto those planes. The first, middle and last eye samples were selected, and all other samples were assigned to a group according to which of the three was closest. The mean and variance of these three groups were used to initialize three Kalman filters in the mixture model. The priors of the three groups were assigned proportional to the number of samples in them. If the subject looks at multiple positions prior to reaching, this method ensures with a high probability that the correct target was accounted for in one of the filters in the mixture. We also compared the MTM approach of Yu et al. [13], where a different KF model was generated for each target, and a mixture is performed over these models. This approach explicitly captures the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to specific targets. Given perfect target information, it would reduce to the STM described above. Priors for the MTM were found by assigning each valid eye sample to its closest two targets, and weighting the models proportional to the number of samples assigned to the corresponding target, divided by its distance from the mean of those samples. We tried other ways of assigning priors and the one presented gave the best results. We calculated the reduction in decoding quality when instead of perfect priors we provide eye-movement based noisy priors (Fig. 5). The accuracies of the mEKFT, the mKFT and the MTM were only degraded by 0.8, 1.9 and 2.1% respectively, compared to the perfect prior situation. The mEKFT was still close to 10% better than the KF. The mixture model framework is effective in accounting for uncertain priors. Figure 5: Mean and standard errors of accuracy for algorithms with perfect priors, and uncertain priors with full and partial training set. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant effects between the two training types, where real priors are used. Here, only reaches at normal speed were used to train the models, as this is a more realistic training set for a BMI application. This accounts for the degraded performance of the MTM with perfect priors relative to the STM from above (Fig. 2). With even more stereotyped training data for each target, the MTM doesn't generalize as well to new speeds. 7 We also wanted to know if the algorithms could generalize to new targets. In a real application, the available training data will generally not span the entire useable worksp ace. We compared the algorithms where reaches to all targets except the one being tested had been used to train the models. The performance of the MTM was significantly de graded unsurprisingly, as it was designed for reaches to a set of known targets. Performance of the mKFT and mEKFT degraded by about 1%, but not significantly (both p>0.7), demonstrating that the continuous approach to target information is preferable when the target could be anywhere in space, not just at locations for which training data is available. 6 Di scu ssi on and concl u si on s The goal of this work was to design a trajectory model that would improve decoding for BMIs with an application to reaching. We incorporated two features that prominently influence the dynamics of natural reach: the movement speed and the target location. Our approach is appropriate where uncertain target information is available. The model generalizes well to new regions of the workspace for which there is no training data, and across a broad range of reaching dynamics to widely spaced targets in three dimensions. The advantages over linear models in decoding precision we report here could be equally obtained using mixtures over many targets and speeds. While mixture models [11, 13] could allow for slow versus fast movements and any number of potential targets, this strategy will generally require many mixture components. Such an approach would require a lot more training data, as we have shown that it does not generalize well. It would also be run-time intensive which is problematic for prosthetic devices that rely on low power controllers. In contrast, the algorithm introduced here only takes a small amount of additional run-time in comparison to the standard KF approach. The EKF is only marginally slower than the standard KF and the algorithm will not generally need to consider more than 3 mixture components assuming the subject fixates the target within the second pre ceding the reach. In this paper we assumed that subjects always would fixate a reach target – along with other non-targets. While this is close to the way humans usually coordinate eyes and reaches [15], there might be cases where people do not fixate a reach target. Our approach could be easily extended to deal with such situations by adding a dummy mixture component that all ows the description of movements to any target. As an alternative to mixture approaches, a system can explicitly estimate the target position in the state vector [9]. This approach, however, would not straightforwardly allow for the rich target information available; we look at the target but also at other locations, strongly suggesting mixture distributions. A combination of the two approaches could further improve decoding quality. We could both estimate speed and target position for the EKFT in a continuous manner while retaining the mixture over target priors. We believe that the issues that we have addressed here are almost universal. Virtually all types of movements are executed at varying speed. A probabilistic distribution for a small number of action candidates may also be expected in most BMI applications – after all there are usually only a small number of actions that make sense in a given environment. While this work is presented in the context of decoding human reaching, it may be applied to a wide range of BMI applications including lower limb prosthetic devices and human computer interactions, as well as different signal sources such as electrode grid recordings and electroencephalograms. The increased user control in conveying their intended movements would significantly improve the functionality of a neuroprosthetic device.

<p>Author: William Brendel, Sinisa Todorovic</p><p>Abstract: Given an ensemble of distinct, low-level segmentations of an image, our goal is to identify visually “meaningful” segments in the ensemble. Knowledge about any speciﬁc objects and surfaces present in the image is not available. The selection of image regions occupied by objects is formalized as the maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem. MWIS is the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent nodes of an attributed graph. We construct such a graph from all segments in the ensemble. Then, MWIS selects maximally distinctive segments that together partition the image. A new MWIS algorithm is presented. The algorithm seeks a solution directly in the discrete domain, instead of relaxing MWIS to a continuous problem, as common in previous work. It iteratively ﬁnds a candidate discrete solution of the Taylor series expansion of the original MWIS objective function around the previous solution. The algorithm is shown to converge to an optimum. Our empirical evaluation on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset shows that the new algorithm eliminates the need for hand-picking optimal input parameters of the state-of-the-art segmenters, and outperforms their best, manually optimized results.</p><p>6 0.45449689 <a title="171-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Decoding_Ipsilateral_Finger_Movements_from_ECoG_Signals_in_Humans.html">57 nips-2010-Decoding Ipsilateral Finger Movements from ECoG Signals in Humans</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvia Chiappa, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Many time-series such as human movement data consist of a sequence of basic actions, e.g., forehands and backhands in tennis. Automatically extracting and characterizing such actions is an important problem for a variety of different applications. In this paper, we present a probabilistic segmentation approach in which an observed time-series is modeled as a concatenation of segments corresponding to different basic actions. Each segment is generated through a noisy transformation of one of a few hidden trajectories representing different types of movement, with possible time re-scaling. We analyze three different approximation methods for dealing with model intractability, and demonstrate how the proposed approach can successfully segment table tennis movements recorded using a robot arm as haptic input device. 1</p><p>2 0.71759212 <a title="171-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Active_Estimation_of_F-Measures.html">22 nips-2010-Active Estimation of F-Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Sawade, Niels Landwehr, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the Fα -measure of a given model as accurately as possible on a ﬁxed labeling budget. This problem occurs whenever an estimate cannot be obtained from held-out training data; for instance, when data that have been used to train the model are held back for reasons of privacy or do not reﬂect the test distribution. In this case, new test instances have to be drawn and labeled at a cost. An active estimation procedure selects instances according to an instrumental sampling distribution. An analysis of the sources of estimation error leads to an optimal sampling distribution that minimizes estimator variance. We explore conditions under which active estimates of Fα -measures are more accurate than estimates based on instances sampled from the test distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.6634652 <a title="171-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-An_Approximate_Inference_Approach_to_Temporal_Optimization_in_Optimal_Control.html">29 nips-2010-An Approximate Inference Approach to Temporal Optimization in Optimal Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad Rawlik, Marc Toussaint, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on iterative local approximations present a practical approach to optimal control in robotic systems. However, they generally require the temporal parameters (for e.g. the movement duration or the time point of reaching an intermediate goal) to be speciﬁed a priori. Here, we present a methodology that is capable of jointly optimizing the temporal parameters in addition to the control command proﬁles. The presented approach is based on a Bayesian canonical time formulation of the optimal control problem, with the temporal mapping from canonical to real time parametrised by an additional control variable. An approximate EM algorithm is derived that efﬁciently optimizes both the movement duration and control commands offering, for the ﬁrst time, a practical approach to tackling generic via point problems in a systematic way under the optimal control framework. The proposed approach, which is applicable to plants with non-linear dynamics as well as arbitrary state dependent and quadratic control costs, is evaluated on realistic simulations of a redundant robotic plant.</p><p>4 0.66164047 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Robust_PCA_via_Outlier_Pursuit.html">231 nips-2010-Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>5 0.66034055 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-More_data_means_less_inference%3A_A_pseudo-max_approach_to_structured_learning.html">169 nips-2010-More data means less inference: A pseudo-max approach to structured learning</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Ofer Meshi, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning to predict structured labels is of key importance in many applications. However, for general graph structure both learning and inference are intractable. Here we show that it is possible to circumvent this difﬁculty when the distribution of training examples is rich enough, via a method similar in spirit to pseudo-likelihood. We show that our new method achieves consistency, and illustrate empirically that it indeed approaches the performance of exact methods when sufﬁciently large training sets are used. Many prediction problems in machine learning applications are structured prediction tasks. For example, in protein folding we are given a protein sequence and the goal is to predict the protein’s native structure [14]. In parsing for natural language processing, we are given a sentence and the goal is to predict the most likely parse tree [2]. In these and many other applications, we can formalize the structured prediction problem as taking an input x (e.g., primary sequence, sentence) and predicting ˆ y (e.g., structure, parse) according to y = arg maxy∈Y θ · φ(x, y ), where φ(x, y) is a function that ˆ maps any input and a candidate assignment to a feature vector, Y denotes the space of all possible assignments to the vector y, and θ is a weight vector to be learned. This paper addresses the problem of learning structured prediction models from data. In particular, given a set of labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M , our goal is to ﬁnd a vector θ such that for each m=1 example m, y m = arg maxy∈Y θ · φ(xm , y), i.e. one which separates the training data. For many structured prediction models, maximization over Y is computationally intractable. This makes it difﬁcult to apply previous algorithms for learning structured prediction models, such as structured perceptron [2], stochastic subgradient [10], and cutting-plane algorithms [5], which require making a prediction at every iteration (equivalent to repeatedly solving an integer linear program). Given training data, we can consider the space of parameters Θ that separate the data. This space can be deﬁned by the intersection of a large number of linear inequalities. A recent approach to getting around the hardness of prediction is to use linear programming (LP) relaxations to approximate the maximization over Y [4, 6, 9]. However, separation with respect to a relaxation places stronger constraints on the parameters. The target solution, an integral vertex in the LP, must now distinguish itself also from possible fractional vertexes that arise due to the relaxation. The relaxations can therefore be understood as optimizing over an inner bound of Θ. This set may be empty even if the training data is separable with exact inference [6]. Another obstacle to using LP relaxations for learning is that solving the LPs can be very slow. In this paper we ask whether it is possible to learn while avoiding inference altogether. We propose a new learning algorithm, inspired by pseudo-likelihood [1], that optimizes over an outer bound of Θ. Learning involves optimizing over only a small number of constraints per data point, and thus can be performed quickly, even for complex structured prediction models. We show that, if the data available for learning is “nice”, this algorithm is consistent, i.e. it will ﬁnd some θ ∈ Θ. This is an example of how having the right data can circumvent the hardness of learning for structured prediction. 1 We also investigate the limitations of the proposed method. We show that the problem of even deciding whether a given data set is separable is NP-hard, and thus learning in a strict sense is no easier than prediction. Thus, we should not expect for our algorithm, or any other polynomial time algorithm, to always succeed at learning from an arbitrary ﬁnite data set. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst result characterizing the hardness of exact learning for structured prediction. Finally, we show empirically that our algorithm allows us to successfully learn the parameters for both multi-label prediction and protein side-chain placement. The performance of the algorithm is improved as more data becomes available, as our theoretical results anticipate. 1 Pseudo-Max method We consider the general structured prediction problem. The input space is denoted by X and the set of all possible assignments by Y. Each y ∈ Y corresponds to n variables y1 , . . . , yn , each with k possible states. The classiﬁer uses a (given) function φ(x, y) : X , Y → Rd and (learned) weights θ ∈ Rd , and is deﬁned as y(x; θ) = arg maxy∈Y f (ˆ ; x, θ) where f is the discriminant function y ˆ f (y; x, θ) = θ · φ(x, y). Our analysis will focus on functions φ whose scope is limited to small sets of the yi variables, but for now we keep the discussion general. Given a set of labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M , the goal of the typical learning problem is to ﬁnd m=1 weights θ that correctly classify the training examples. Consider ﬁrst the separable case. Deﬁne the set of separating weight vectors, Θ = θ | ∀m, y ∈ Y, f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y; xm , θ)+e(y, y m ) . e is a loss function (e.g., zero-one or Hamming) such that e(y m , y m ) = 0 and e(y, y m ) > 0 for y = y m , which serves to rule out the trivial solution θ = 0.1 The space Θ is deﬁned by exponentially many constraints per example, one for each competing assignment. In this work we consider a much simpler set of constraints where, for each example, we only consider the competing assignments obtained by modifying a single label yi , while ﬁxing the other labels to their value at y m . The pseudo-max set, which is an outer bound on Θ, is given by Here ym −i m Θps = θ | ∀m, i, yi , f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) . −i denotes the label y m (1) without the assignment to yi . When the data is not separable, Θ will be the empty set. Instead, we may choose to minimize the hinge loss, (θ) = m maxy f (y; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(y, y m ) , which can be shown to be an upper bound on the training error [13]. When the data is separable, minθ (θ) = 0. Note that regularization may be added to this objective. The corresponding pseudo-max objective replaces the maximization over all of y with maximization over a single variable yi while ﬁxing the other labels to their value at y m :2,3 M ps (θ) n = m=1 i=1 m max f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) . −i yi Analogous to before, we have minθ ps (θ) (2) = 0 if and only if θ ∈ Θps . The objective in Eq. 2 is similar in spirit to pseudo-likelihood objectives used for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters of Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs) [1]. The pseudo-likelihood estimate is provably consistent when the data generating distribution is a MRF of the same structure as used in the pseudo-likelihood objective. However, our setting is different since we only get to view the maximizing assignment of the MRF rather than samples from it. Thus, a particular x will always be paired with the same y rather than samples y drawn from the conditional distribution p(y|x; θ). The pseudo-max constraints in Eq. 1 are also related to cutting plane approaches to inference [4, 5]. In the latter, the learning problem is solved by repeatedly looking for assignments that violate the separability constraint (or its hinge version). Our constraints can be viewed as using a very small 1 An alternative formulation, which we use in the next section, is to break the symmetry by having part of the input not be multiplied by any weight. This will also rule out the trivial solution θ = 0. P 2 It is possible to use maxi instead of i , and some of our consistency results will still hold. 3 The pseudo-max approach is markedly different from a learning method which predicts each label yi independently, since the objective considers all i simultaneously (both at learning and test time). 2 x2 0.2 J ∗ + x1 = 0 y = (0, 1) y = (1, 1) g(J12) x2 = 0 x1 J ∗ + x1 + x2 = 0 y = (0, 0) c1=0 c1=1 c1= 1 0.15 0.1 J + x2 = 0 ∗ 0.05 y = (1, 0) x1 = 0 0 1 0.5 0 J 0.5 1 Figure 1: Illustrations for a model with two variables.

The function is shown for different values of c1 , the mean of the x1 variable. subset of assignments for the set of candidate constraint violators. We also note that when exact maximization over the discriminant function f (y; x, θ) is hard, the standard cutting plane algorithm cannot be employed since it is infeasible to ﬁnd a violated constraint. For the pseudo-max objective, ﬁnding a constraint violation is simple and linear in the number of variables.4 It is easy to see (as will be elaborated on next) that the pseudo-max method does not in general yield a consistent estimate of θ, even in the separable case. However, as we show, consistency can be shown to be achieved under particular assumptions on the data generating distribution p(x). 2 Consistency of the Pseudo-Max method In this section we show that if the feature generating distribution p(x) satisﬁes particular assumptions, then the pseudo-max approach yields a consistent estimate. In other words, if the training data is of the form {(xm , y(xm ; θ ∗ ))}M for some true parameter vector θ ∗ , then as M → ∞ the m=1 minimum of the pseudo-max objective will converge to θ ∗ (up to equivalence transformations). The section is organized as follows. First, we provide intuition for the consistency results by considering a model with only two variables. Then, in Sec. 2.1, we show that any parameter θ ∗ can be identiﬁed to within arbitrary accuracy by choosing a particular training set (i.e., choice of xm ). This in itself proves consistency, as long as there is a non-zero probability of sampling this set. In Sec. 2.2 we give a more direct proof of consistency by using strict convexity arguments. For ease of presentation, we shall work with a simpliﬁed instance of the structured learning setting. We focus on binary variables, yi ∈ {0, 1}, and consider discriminant functions corresponding to Ising models, a special case of pairwise MRFs (J denotes the vector of “interaction” parameters): f (y; x, J ) = ij∈E Jij yi yj + i yi xi (3) The singleton potential for variable yi is yi xi and is not dependent on the model parameters. We could have instead used Ji yi xi , which would be more standard. However, this would make the parameter vector J invariant to scaling, complicating the identiﬁability analysis. In the consistency analysis we will assume that the data is generated using a true parameter vector J ∗ . We will show that as the data size goes to inﬁnity, minimization of ps (J ) yields J ∗ . We begin with an illustrative analysis of the pseudo-max constraints for a model with only two variables, i.e. f (y; x, J) = Jy1 y2 + y1 x1 + y2 x2 . The purpose of the analysis is to demonstrate general principles for when pseudo-max constraints may succeed or fail. Assume that training samples are generated via y(x) = argmaxy f (y; x, J ∗ ). We can partition the input space X into four regions, ˆ ˆ {x ∈ X : y(x) = y } for each of the four conﬁgurations y , shown in Fig. 1 (left). The blue lines outline the exact decision boundaries of f (y; x, J ∗ ), with the lines being given by the constraints 4 The methods differ substantially in the non-separable setting where we minimize ps (θ), using a slack variable for every node and example, rather than just one slack variable per example as in (θ). 3 in Θ that hold with equality. The red lines denote the pseudo-max constraints in Θps that hold with equality. For x such that y(x) = (1, 0) or (0, 1), the pseudo-max and exact constraints are identical. We can identify J ∗ by obtaining samples x = (x1 , x2 ) that explore both sides of one of the decision boundaries that depends on J ∗ . The pseudo-max constraints will fail to identify J ∗ if the samples do not sufﬁciently explore the transitions between y = (0, 1) and y = (1, 1) or between y = (1, 0) and y = (1, 1). This can happen, for example, when the input samples are dependent, giving only rise to the conﬁgurations y = (0, 0) and y = (1, 1). For points labeled (1, 1) around the decision line J ∗ + x1 + x2 = 0, pseudo-max can only tell that they respect J ∗ + x1 ≥ 0 and J ∗ + x2 ≥ 0 (dashed red lines), or x1 ≤ 0 and x2 ≤ 0 for points labeled (0, 0). Only constraints that depend on the parameter are effective for learning. For pseudo-max to be able to identify J ∗ , the input samples must be continuous, densely populating the two parameter dependent decision lines that pseudo-max can use. The two point sets in the ﬁgure illustrate good and bad input distributions for pseudo-max. The diagonal set would work well with the exact constraints but badly with pseudo-max, and the difference can be arbitrarily large. However, the input distribution on the right, populating the J ∗ + x2 = 0 decision line, would permit pseudo-max to identify J ∗ . 2.1 Identiﬁability of True Parameters In this section, we show that it is possible to approximately identify the true model parameters, up to model equivalence, using the pseudo-max constraints and a carefully chosen linear number of data points. Consider the learning problem for structured prediction deﬁned on a ﬁxed graph G = (V, E) where the parameters to be learned are pairwise potential functions θij (yi , yj ) for ij ∈ E and single node ﬁelds θi (yi ) for i ∈ V . We consider discriminant functions of the form f (y; x, θ) = ij∈E θij (yi , yj ) + i θi (yi ) + i xi (yi ), (4) where the input space X = R|V |k speciﬁes the single node potentials. Without loss of generality, we remove the additional degrees of freedom in θ by restricting it to be in a canonical form: θ ∈ Θcan if for all edges θij (yi , yj ) = 0 whenever yi = 0 or yj = 0, and if for all nodes, θi (yi ) = 0 when yi = 0. As a result, assuming the training set comes from a model in this class, and the input ﬁelds xi (yi ) exercise the discriminant function appropriately, we can hope to identify θ ∗ ∈ Θcan . Indeed, we show that, for some data sets, the pseudo-max constraints are sufﬁcient to identify θ ∗ . Let Θps ({y m , xm }) be the set of parameters that satisfy the pseudo-max classiﬁcation constraints m Θps ({y m , xm }) = θ | ∀m, i, yi = yi , f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) . −i (5) m e(yi , yi ), For simplicity we omit the margin losses since the input ﬁelds xi (yi ) already sufﬁce to rule out the trivial solution θ = 0. Proposition 2.1. For any θ ∗ ∈ Θcan , there is a set of 2|V |(k − 1) + 2|E|(k − 1)2 examples, {xm , y(xm ; θ ∗ )}, such that any pseudo-max consistent θ ∈ Θps ({y m , xm }) ∩ Θcan is arbitrarily close to θ ∗ . The proof is given in the supplementary material. To illustrate the key ideas, we consider the simpler binary discriminant function discussed in Eq. 3. Note that the binary model is already in the canonical form since Jij yi yj = 0 whenever yi = 0 or yj = 0. For any ij ∈ E, we show how to choose two input examples x1 and x2 such that any J consistent with the pseudo-max constraints for these ∗ ∗ two examples will have Jij ∈ [Jij − , Jij + ]. Repeating this for all of the edge parameters then gives the complete set of examples. The input examples we need for this will depend on J ∗ . For the ﬁrst example, we set the input ﬁelds for all neighbors of i (except j) in such a way that ∗ we force the corresponding labels to be zero. More formally, we set x1 < −|N (k)| maxl |Jkl | for k 1 k ∈ N (i)\j, resulting in yk = 0, where y 1 = y(x1 ). In contrast, we set x1 to a large value, e.g. j ∗ 1 ∗ x1 > |N (j)| maxl |Jjl |, so that yj = 1. Finally, for node i, we set x1 = −Jij + so as to obtain a j i 1 slight preference for yi = 1. All other input ﬁelds can be set arbitrarily. As a result, the pseudo-max constraints pertaining to node i are f (y 1 ; x1 , J ) ≥ f (y 1 , yi ; x1 , J ) for yi = 0, 1. By taking into −i 1 account the label assignments for yi and its neighbors, and by removing terms that are the same on both sides of the equation, we get Jij + x1 + x1 ≥ Jij yi + yi x1 + x1 , which, for yi = 0, implies i j i j ∗ that Jij + x1 ≥ 0 or Jij − Jij + ≥ 0. The second example x2 differs only in terms of the input i ∗ 2 ∗ ﬁeld for i. In particular, we set x2 = −Jij − so that yi = 0. This gives Jij ≤ Jij + , as desired. i 4 2.2 Consistency via Strict Convexity In this section we prove the consistency of the pseudo-max approach by showing that it corresponds to minimizing a strictly convex function. Our proof only requires that p(x) be non-zero for all x ∈ Rn (a simple example being a multi-variate Gaussian) and that J ∗ is ﬁnite. We use a discriminant function as in Eq. 3. Now, assume the input points xm are distributed according to p(x) and that y m are obtained via y m = arg maxy f (y; xm , J ∗ ). We can write the ps (J ) objective for ﬁnite data, and its limit when M → ∞, compactly as: 1 m m = max (yi − yi ) xm + Jki yk ps (J ) i M m i yi k∈N (i) p(x) max (yi − yi (x)) xi + → yi i Jki yk (x) dx (6) k∈N (i) ∗ where yi (x) is the label of i for input x when using parameters J . Starting from the above, consider the terms separately for each i. We partition the integral over x ∈ Rn into exclusive regions according to the predicted labels of the neighbors of i (given x). Deﬁne Sij = {x : yj (x) = 1 and yk (x) = 0 for k ∈ N (i)\j}. Eq. 6 can then be written as ps (J ) = gi ({Jik }k∈N (i) ) + ˆ i gik (Jik ) , (7) k∈N (i) where gik (Jik ) = x∈Sik p(x) maxyi [(yi −yi (x))(xi +Jik )]dx and gi ({Jik }k∈N (i) ) contains all of ˆ the remaining terms, i.e. where either zero or more than one neighbor is set to one. The function gi ˆ is convex in J since it is a sum of integrals over convex functions. We proceed to show that gik (Jik ) is strictly convex for all choices of i and k ∈ N (i). This will show that ps (J ) is strictly convex since it is a sum over functions strictly convex in each one of the variables in J . For all values xi ∈ (−∞, ∞) there is some x in Sij . This is because for any ﬁnite xi and ﬁnite J ∗ , the other xj ’s can be chosen so as to give the y conﬁguration corresponding to Sij . Now, since p(x) has full support, we have P (Sij ) > 0 and p(x) > 0 for any x in Sij . As a result, this also holds for the marginal pi (xi |Sij ) over xi within Sij . After some algebra, we obtain: gij (Jij ) = P (Sij ) ∞ p(x)yi (x)(xi + Jij )dx pi (xi |Sij ) max [0, xi + Jij ] dxi − −∞ x∈Sij The integral over the yi (x)(xi + Jij ) expression just adds a linear term to gij (Jij ). The relevant remaining term is (for brevity we drop P (Sij ), a strictly positive constant, and the ij index): h(J) = ∞ pi (xi |Sij ) max [0, xi + J] dxi = −∞ ∞ ˆ pi (xi |Sij )h(xi , J)dxi (8) −∞ ˆ ˆ where we deﬁne h(xi , J) = max [0, xi + J]. Note that h(J) is convex since h(xi , J) is convex in J for all xi . We want to show that h(J) is strictly convex. Consider J < J and α ∈ (0, 1) and deﬁne ˆ ˆ the interval I = [−J, −αJ − (1 − α)J ]. For xi ∈ I it holds that: αh(xi , J) + (1 − α)h(xi , J ) > ˆ i , αJ + (1 − α)J ) (since the ﬁrst term is strictly positive and the rest are zero). For all other x, h(x ˆ this inequality holds but is not necessarily strict (since h is always convex in J). We thus have after integrating over x that αh(J) + (1 − α)h(J ) > h(αJ + (1 − α)J ), implying h is strictly convex, as required. Note that we used the fact that p(x) has full support when integrating over I. The function ps (J ) is thus a sum of strictly convex functions in all its variables (namely g(Jik )) plus other convex functions of J , hence strictly convex. We can now proceed to show consistency. By strict convexity, the pseudo-max objective is minimized at a unique point J . Since we know that ps (J ∗ ) = 0 and zero is a lower bound on the value of ps (J ), it follows that J ∗ is the unique minimizer. Thus we have that as M → ∞, the minimizer of the pseudo-max objective is the true parameter vector, and thus we have consistency. As an example, consider the case of two variables y1 , y2 , with x1 and x2 distributed according to ∗ N (c1 , 1), N (0, 1) respectively. Furthermore assume J12 = 0. Then simple direct calculation yields: 2 2 2 c1 + J12 −c1 1 1 √ (9) e−x /2 dx − √ e−c1 /2 + √ e−(J12 +c1 ) /2 2π 2π 2π −J12 −c1 which is indeed a strictly convex function that is minimized at J = 0 (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). g(J12 ) = 5 3 Hardness of Structured Learning Most structured prediction learning algorithms use some form of inference as a subroutine. However, the corresponding prediction task is generally NP-hard. For example, maximizing the discriminant function deﬁned in Eq. 3 is equivalent to solving Max-Cut, which is known to be NP-hard. This raises the question of whether it is possible to bypass prediction during learning. Although prediction may be intractable for arbitrary MRFs, what does this say about the difﬁculty of learning with a polynomial number of data points? In this section, we show that the problem of deciding whether there exists a parameter vector that separates the training data is NP-hard. Put in the context of the positive results in this paper, these hardness results show that, although in some cases the pseudo-max constraints yield a consistent estimate, we cannot hope for a certiﬁcate of optimality. Put differently, although the pseudo-max constraints in the separable case always give an outer bound on Θ (and may even be a single point), Θ could be the empty set – and we would never know the difference. Theorem 3.1. Given labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M for a ﬁxed but arbitrary graph G, it is m=1 NP-hard to decide whether there exists parameters θ such that ∀m, y m = arg maxy f (y; xm , θ). Proof. Any parameters θ have an equivalent parameterization in canonical form (see section Sec. 2.1, also supplementary). Thus, the examples will be separable if and only if they are separable by some θ ∈ Θcan . We reduce from unweighted Max-Cut. The Max-Cut problem is to decide, given an undirected graph G, whether there exists a cut of at least K edges. Let G be the same graph as G, with k = 3 states per variable. We construct a small set of examples where a parameter vector will exist that separates the data if and only if there is no cut of K or more edges in G. Let θ be parameters in canonical form equivalent to θij (yi , yj ) = 1 if (yi , yj ) ∈ {(1, 2), (2, 1)}, 0 if yi = yj , and −n2 if (yi , yj ) ∈ {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}. We ﬁrst construct 4n + 8|E| examples, using the technique described in Sec. 2.1 (also supplementary material), which when restricted to the space Θcan , constrain the parameters to equal θ. We then use one more example (xm , y m ) where y m = 3 (every node is in state 3) and, for all i, xm (3) = K−1 and xm (1) = xm (2) = 0. The ﬁrst i i i n two states encode the original Max-Cut instance, while the third state is used to construct a labeling y m that has value equal to K − 1, and is otherwise not used. Let K ∗ be the value of the maximum cut in G. If in any assignment to the last example there is a variable taking the state 3 and another variable taking the state 1 or 2, then the assignment’s value will be at most K ∗ − n2 , which is less than zero. By construction, the 3 assignment has value K − 1. Thus, the optimal assignment must either be 3 with value K − 1, or some combination of states 1 and 2, which has value at most K ∗ . If K ∗ > K − 1 then 3 is not optimal and the examples are not separable. If K ∗ ≤ K − 1, the examples are separable. This result illustrates the potential difﬁculty of learning in worst-case graphs. Nonetheless, many problems have a more restricted dependence on the input. For example, in computer vision, edge potentials may depend only on the difference in color between two adjacent pixels. Our results do not preclude positive results of learnability in such restricted settings. By establishing hardness of learning, we also close the open problem of relating hardness of inference and learning in structured prediction. If inference problems can be solved in polynomial time, then so can learning (using, e.g., structured perceptron). Thus, when learning is hard, inference must be hard as well. 4 Experiments To evaluate our learning algorithm, we test its performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that, as the number of training samples grows, the accuracy of the pseudo-max method improves and its speed-up gain over competing algorithms increases. Our learning algorithm corresponds to solving the following, where we add L2 regularization and use a scaled 0-1 loss, m m e(yi , yi ) = 1{yi = yi }/nm (nm is the number of labels in example m): min θ C m nm M nm m=1 i=1 m max f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) + θ −i yi 2 . (10) We will compare the pseudo-max method with learning using structural SVMs, both with exact inference and LP relaxations [see, e.g., 4]. We use exact inference for prediction at test time. 6 (a) Synthetic (b) Reuters 0.4 exact LP−relaxation pseudo−max 0.15 Test error Test error 0.2 0.1 0.05 0 1 10 2 10 0.2 0.1 0 1 10 3 10 Train size exact LP−relaxation pseudo−max 0.3 2 10 3 10 4 10 Train size Figure 2: Test error as a function of train size for various algorithms. Subﬁgure (a) shows results for a synthetic setting, while (b) shows performance on the Reuters data. In the synthetic setting we use the discriminant function f (y; x, θ) = ij∈E θij (yi , yj ) + xi θi (yi ), which is similar to Eq. 4. We take a fully connected graph over n = 10 binary labels. i For a weight vector θ ∗ (sampled once, uniformly in the range [−1, 1], and used for all train/test sets) we generate train and test instances by sampling xm uniformly in the range [−5, 5] and then computing the optimal labels y m = arg maxy∈Y f (y; xm , θ ∗ ). We generate train sets of increasing size (M = {10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000}), run the learning algorithms, and measure the test error for the learned weights (with 1000 test samples). For each train size we average the test error over 10 repeats of sampling and training. Fig. 2(a) shows a comparison of the test error for the three learning algorithms. For small numbers of training examples, the test error of pseudo-max is larger than that of the other algorithms. However, as the train size grows, the error converges to that of exact learning, as our consistency results predict. We also test the performance of our algorithm on a multi-label document classiﬁcation task from the Reuters dataset [7]. The data consists of M = 23149 training samples, and we use a reduction of the dataset to the 5 most frequent labels. The 5 label variables form a fully connected pairwise graph structure (see [4] for a similar setting). We use random subsamples of increasing size from the train set to learn the parameters, and then measure the test error using 20000 additional samples. For each sample size and learning algorithm, we optimize the trade-off parameter C using 30% of the training data as a hold-out set. Fig. 2(b) shows that for the large data regime the performance of pseudo-max learning gets close to that of the other methods. However, unlike the synthetic setting there is still a small gap, even after seeing the entire train set. This could be because the full dataset is not yet large enough to be in the consistent regime (note that exact learning has not ﬂattened either), or because the consistency conditions are not fully satisﬁed: the data might be non-separable or the support of the input distribution p(x) may be partial. We next apply our method to the problem of learning the energy function for protein side-chain placement, mirroring the learning setup of [14], where the authors train a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) using tree-reweighted belief propagation to maximize a lower bound on the likelihood.5 The prediction problem for side-chain placement corresponds to ﬁnding the most likely assignment in a pairwise MRF, and ﬁts naturally into our learning framework. There are only 8 parameters to be learned, corresponding to a reweighting of known energy terms. The dataset consists of 275 proteins, where each MRF has several hundred variables (one per residue of the protein) and each variable has on average 20 states. For prediction we use CPLEX’s ILP solver. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the pseudo-max method and a cutting-plane algorithm which uses an LP relaxation, solved with CPLEX, for ﬁnding violated constraints.6 We generate training sets of increasing size (M = {10, 50, 100, 274}), and measure the test error for the learned weights on the remaining examples.7 For M = 10, 50, 100 we average the test error over 3 random train/test splits, whereas for M = 274 we do 1-fold cross validation. We use C = 1 for both algorithms. 5 The authors’ data and results are available from: http://cyanover.fhcrc.org/recomb-2007/ We signiﬁcantly optimized the cutting-plane algorithm, e.g. including a large number of initial cuttingplanes and restricting the weight vector to be positive (which we know to hold at optimality). 7 Speciﬁcally, for each protein we compute the fraction of correctly predicted χ1 and χ2 angles for all residues (except when trivial, e.g. just 1 state). Then, we compute the median of this value across all proteins. 6 7 Time to train (minutes) Test error (χ1 and χ2) 0.27 0.265 pseudo−max LP−relaxation Soft rep 0.26 0.255 0.25 0 50 100 150 200 Train size 250 250 200 pseudo−max LP−relaxation 150 100 50 0 0 50 100 150 200 Train size 250 Figure 3: Training time (for one train/test split) and test error as a function of train size for both the pseudomax method and a cutting-plane algorithm which uses a LP relaxation for inference, applied to the problem of learning the energy function for protein side-chain placement. The pseudo-max method obtains better accuracy than both the LP relaxation and HCRF (given roughly ﬁve times more data) for a fraction of the training time. The original weights (“Soft rep” [3]) used for this energy function have 26.7% error across all 275 proteins. The best previously reported parameters, learned in [14] using a Hidden CRF, obtain 25.6% error (their training set included 55 of these 275 proteins, so this is an optimistic estimate). To get a sense of the difﬁculty of this learning task, we also tried a random positive weight vector, uniformly sampled from the range [0, 1], obtaining an error of 34.9% (results would be much worse if we allowed the weights to be negative). Training using pseudo-max with 50 examples, we learn parameters in under a minute that give better accuracy than the HCRF. The speed-up of training with pseudo-max (using CPLEX’s QP solver) versus cutting-plane is striking. For example, for M = 10, pseudo-max takes only 3 seconds, a 1000-fold speedup. Unfortunately the cutting-plane algorithm took a prohibitive amount of time to be able to run on the larger training sets. Since the data used in learning for protein side-chain placement is both highly non-separable and relatively little, these positive results illustrate the potential wide-spread applicability of the pseudo-max method. 5 Discussion The key idea of our method is to ﬁnd parameters that prefer the true assignment y m over assignments that differ from it in only one variable, in contrast to all other assignments. Perhaps surprisingly, this weak requirement is sufﬁcient to achieve consistency given a rich enough input distribution. One extension of our approach is to add constraints for assignments that differ from y m in more than one variable. This would tighten the outer bound on Θ and possibly result in improved performance, but would also increase computational complexity. We could also add such competing assignments via a cutting-plane scheme so that optimization is performed only over a subset of these constraints. Our work raises a number of important open problems: It would be interesting to derive generalization bounds to understand the convergence rate of our method, as well as understanding the effect of the distribution p(x) on these rates. The distribution p(x) needs to have two key properties. On the one hand, it needs to explore the space Y in the sense that a sufﬁcient number of labels need to be obtained as the correct label for the true parameters (this is indeed used in our consistency proofs). On the other hand, p(x) needs to be sufﬁciently sensitive close to the decision boundaries so that the true parameters can be inferred. We expect that generalization analysis will depend on these two properties of p(x). Note that [11] studied active learning schemes for structured data and may be relevant in the current context. How should one apply this learning algorithm to non-separable data sets? We suggested one approach, based on using a hinge loss for each of the pseudo constraints. One question in this context is, how resilient is this learning algorithm to label noise? Recent work has analyzed the sensitivity of pseudo-likelihood methods to model mis-speciﬁcation [8], and it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis here. Also, is it possible to give any guarantees for the empirical and expected risks (with respect to exact inference) obtained by outer bound learning versus exact learning? Finally, our algorithm demonstrates a phenomenon where more data can make computation easier. Such a scenario was recently analyzed in the context of supervised learning [12], and it would be interesting to combine the approaches.

<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak classiﬁers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classiﬁcation is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the “correct” requirements on the weak classiﬁer, or the notion of the most efﬁcient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements. 1</p><p>3 0.20640613 <a title="282-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Smoothness%2C_Low_Noise_and_Fast_Rates.html">243 nips-2010-Smoothness, Low Noise and Fast Rates</a></p>

For typical hypothesis classes where Rn = R/n, this translates to ˜ ˜ a learning rate of O (RH/n) in the separable (L∗ = 0) case and O RH/n + L∗ RH/n more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization of a smooth non-negative objective. 1</p><p>4 0.18466823 <a title="282-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Relaxed_Clipping%3A_A_Global_Training_Method_for_Robust_Regression_and_Classification.html">225 nips-2010-Relaxed Clipping: A Global Training Method for Robust Regression and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Yang, Linli Xu, Martha White, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Robust regression and classiﬁcation are often thought to require non-convex loss functions that prevent scalable, global training. However, such a view neglects the possibility of reformulated training methods that can yield practically solvable alternatives. A natural way to make a loss function more robust to outliers is to truncate loss values that exceed a maximum threshold. We demonstrate that a relaxation of this form of “loss clipping” can be made globally solvable and applicable to any standard loss while guaranteeing robustness against outliers. We present a generic procedure that can be applied to standard loss functions and demonstrate improved robustness in regression and classiﬁcation problems. 1</p><p>5 0.11974781 <a title="282-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-t-logistic_regression.html">290 nips-2010-t-logistic regression</a></p>

This gives rise to a regularized risk minimization problem with a non-convex loss function. An efﬁcient block coordinate descent optimization scheme can be derived for estimating the parameters. Because of the nature of the loss function, our algorithm is tolerant to label noise. Furthermore, unlike other algorithms which employ non-convex loss functions, our algorithm is fairly robust to the choice of initial values. We verify both these observations empirically on a number of synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.10432014 <a title="282-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Boosting_Classifier_Cascades.html">42 nips-2010-Boosting Classifier Cascades</a></p>

<p>Author: Uwe Dick, Peter Haider, Thomas Vanck, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We study a setting in which Poisson processes generate sequences of decisionmaking events. The optimization goal is allowed to depend on the rate of decision outcomes; the rate may depend on a potentially long backlog of events and decisions. We model the problem as a Poisson process with a throttling policy that enforces a data-dependent rate limit and reduce the learning problem to a convex optimization problem that can be solved efﬁciently. This problem setting matches applications in which damage caused by an attacker grows as a function of the rate of unsuppressed hostile events. We report on experiments on abuse detection for an email service. 1</p><p>6 0.65936893 <a title="282-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Theory_of_Multiclass_Boosting.html">15 nips-2010-A Theory of Multiclass Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhishek Kumar, Avishek Saha, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a co-regularization based approach to semi-supervised domain adaptation. Our proposed approach (EA++) builds on the notion of augmented space (introduced in E ASYA DAPT (EA) [1]) and harnesses unlabeled data in target domain to further assist the transfer of information from source to target. This semi-supervised approach to domain adaptation is extremely simple to implement and can be applied as a pre-processing step to any supervised learner. Our theoretical analysis (in terms of Rademacher complexity) of EA and EA++ show that the hypothesis class of EA++ has lower complexity (compared to EA) and hence results in tighter generalization bounds. Experimental results on sentiment analysis tasks reinforce our theoretical ﬁndings and demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed method when compared to EA as well as few other representative baseline approaches.</p><p>3 0.77488405 <a title="282-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Unsupervised_Kernel_Dimension_Reduction.html">280 nips-2010-Unsupervised Kernel Dimension Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Meihong Wang, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We apply the framework of kernel dimension reduction, originally designed for supervised problems, to unsupervised dimensionality reduction. In this framework, kernel-based measures of independence are used to derive low-dimensional representations that maximally capture information in covariates in order to predict responses. We extend this idea and develop similarly motivated measures for unsupervised problems where covariates and responses are the same. Our empirical studies show that the resulting compact representation yields meaningful and appealing visualization and clustering of data. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with supervised learners for classiﬁcation, our methods lead to lower classiﬁcation errors than state-of-the-art methods, especially when embedding data in spaces of very few dimensions.</p><p>4 0.72325134 <a title="282-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning%3A_Random_Averages%2C_Combinatorial_Parameters%2C_and_Learnability.html">193 nips-2010-Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, José Pereira, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector x0 ∈ RN from noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w ∈ Rn . In many contexts (ranging from model selection to image processing) it is desirable to construct a sparse estimator x. In this case, a popular approach consists in solving an ℓ1 -penalized least squares problem known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). For sequences of matrices A of increasing dimensions, with independent gaussian entries, we prove that the normalized risk of the LASSO converges to a limit, and we obtain an explicit expression for this limit. Our result is the ﬁrst rigorous derivation of an explicit formula for the asymptotic mean square error of the LASSO for random instances. The proof technique is based on the analysis of AMP, a recently developed efﬁcient algorithm, that is inspired from graphical models ideas. Through simulations on real data matrices (gene expression data and hospital medical records) we observe that these results can be relevant in a broad array of practical applications.</p><p>6 0.71942437 <a title="282-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-The_Neural_Costs_of_Optimal_Control.html">268 nips-2010-The Neural Costs of Optimal Control</a></p>

Among them are analogues of Rademacher complexity, covering numbers and fatshattering dimension from statistical learning theory. Relationship among these complexity measures, their connection to online learning, and tools for bounding them are provided. We apply these results to various learning problems.

<p>Author: Gergely Neu, Andras Antos, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider online learning in ﬁnite stochastic Markovian environments where in each time step a new reward function is chosen by an oblivious adversary. The goal of the learning agent is to compete with the best stationary policy in terms of the total reward received. In each time step the agent observes the current state and the reward associated with the last transition, however, the agent does not observe the rewards associated with other state-action pairs. The agent is assumed to know the transition probabilities. The state of the art result for this setting is a no-regret algorithm. In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm and, assuming that stationary policies mix uniformly fast, we show that after T time steps, the expected regret of the new algorithm is O T 2/3 (ln T )1/3 , giving the ﬁrst rigorously proved regret bound for the problem. 1</p><p>4 0.20789017 <a title="222-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Online_Classification_with_Specificity_Constraints.html">192 nips-2010-Online Classification with Specificity Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrey Bernstein, Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online binary classiﬁcation problem, where we are given m classiﬁers. At each stage, the classiﬁers map the input to the probability that the input belongs to the positive class. An online classiﬁcation meta-algorithm is an algorithm that combines the outputs of the classiﬁers in order to attain a certain goal, without having prior knowledge on the form and statistics of the input, and without prior knowledge on the performance of the given classiﬁers. In this paper, we use sensitivity and speciﬁcity as the performance metrics of the meta-algorithm. In particular, our goal is to design an algorithm that satisﬁes the following two properties (asymptotically): (i) its average false positive rate (fp-rate) is under some given threshold; and (ii) its average true positive rate (tp-rate) is not worse than the tp-rate of the best convex combination of the m given classiﬁers that satisﬁes fprate constraint, in hindsight. We show that this problem is in fact a special case of the regret minimization problem with constraints, and therefore the above goal is not attainable. Hence, we pose a relaxed goal and propose a corresponding practical online learning meta-algorithm that attains it. In the case of two classiﬁers, we show that this algorithm takes a very simple form. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that addresses the problem of the average tp-rate maximization under average fp-rate constraints in the online setting. 1</p><p>5 0.16088288 <a title="222-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Parametric_Bandits%3A_The_Generalized_Linear_Case.html">203 nips-2010-Parametric Bandits: The Generalized Linear Case</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Filippi, Olivier Cappe, Aurélien Garivier, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider structured multi-armed bandit problems based on the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework of statistics. For these bandits, we propose a new algorithm, called GLM-UCB. We derive ﬁnite time, high probability bounds on the regret of the algorithm, extending previous analyses developed for the linear bandits to the non-linear case. The analysis highlights a key difﬁculty in generalizing linear bandit algorithms to the non-linear case, which is solved in GLM-UCB by focusing on the reward space rather than on the parameter space. Moreover, as the actual effectiveness of current parameterized bandit algorithms is often poor in practice, we provide a tuning method based on asymptotic arguments, which leads to signiﬁcantly better practical performance. We present two numerical experiments on real-world data that illustrate the potential of the GLM-UCB approach.

<p>Author: Satyen Kale, Lev Reyzin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We consider bandit problems, motivated by applications in online advertising and news story selection, in which the learner must repeatedly select a slate, that is, a subset of size s from K possible actions, and then receives rewards for just the selected actions. The goal is to minimize the regret with respect to total reward of the best slate computed in hindsight. We consider unordered and ordered versions √ of the problem, and give efﬁcient algorithms which have regret O( T ), where the constant depends on the speciﬁc nature of the problem. We also consider versions of the problem where we have access to a number of policies which make recom√ mendations for slates in every round, and give algorithms with O( T ) regret for competing with the best such policy as well. We make use of the technique of relative entropy projections combined with the usual multiplicative weight update algorithm to obtain our algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.66756582 <a title="222-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: James Sharpnack, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying an activation pattern in a complex, largescale network that is embedded in very noisy measurements. This problem is relevant to several applications, such as identifying traces of a biochemical spread by a sensor network, expression levels of genes, and anomalous activity or congestion in the Internet. Extracting such patterns is a challenging task specially if the network is large (pattern is very high-dimensional) and the noise is so excessive that it masks the activity at any single node. However, typically there are statistical dependencies in the network activation process that can be leveraged to fuse the measurements of multiple nodes and enable reliable extraction of highdimensional noisy patterns. In this paper, we analyze an estimator based on the graph Laplacian eigenbasis, and establish the limits of mean square error recovery of noisy patterns arising from a probabilistic (Gaussian or Ising) model based on an arbitrary graph structure. We consider both deterministic and probabilistic network evolution models, and our results indicate that by leveraging the network interaction structure, it is possible to consistently recover high-dimensional patterns even when the noise variance increases with network size. 1</p><p>3 0.80750173 <a title="222-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Rates_of_convergence_for_the_cluster_tree.html">223 nips-2010-Rates of convergence for the cluster tree</a></p>

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ ∗ + where is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N (0, σ 2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β ∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β ∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability the difference between the solution ˆ β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β ∗ measured in terms of the lp norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N )1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β ∗ , ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of √ β ∗ larger than a certain value in the order of O(σ log m). The proposed method improves the estimation bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately √ √ from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N )1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β ∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. 1</p><p>5 0.7531147 <a title="222-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

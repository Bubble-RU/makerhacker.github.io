<p>Author: Albert X. Jiang, Kevin Leyton-brown</p><p>Abstract: Games of incomplete information, or Bayesian games, are an important gametheoretic model and have many applications in economics. We propose Bayesian action-graph games (BAGGs), a novel graphical representation for Bayesian games. BAGGs can represent arbitrary Bayesian games, and furthermore can compactly express Bayesian games exhibiting commonly encountered types of structure including symmetry, action- and type-speciﬁc utility independence, and probabilistic independence of type distributions. We provide an algorithm for computing expected utility in BAGGs, and discuss conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Bayes-Nash equilibria of BAGGs can be computed by adapting existing algorithms for complete-information normal form games and leveraging our expected utility algorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approaches improve signiﬁcantly on the state of the art. 1</p><p>3 0.17547601 <a title="226-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning%3A_Random_Averages%2C_Combinatorial_Parameters%2C_and_Learnability.html">193 nips-2010-Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Markus Weimer, Lihong Li, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the ﬁrst parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8]. 1</p><p>5 0.11124011 <a title="226-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Adversarially_Missing_Label_Information.html">236 nips-2010-Semi-Supervised Learning with Adversarially Missing Label Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Umar Syed, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of semi-supervised learning in an adversarial setting. Instead of assuming that labels are missing at random, we analyze a less favorable scenario where the label information can be missing partially and arbitrarily, which is motivated by several practical examples. We present nearly matching upper and lower generalization bounds for learning in this setting under reasonable assumptions about available label information. Motivated by the analysis, we formulate a convex optimization problem for parameter estimation, derive an efﬁcient algorithm, and analyze its convergence. We provide experimental results on several standard data sets showing the robustness of our algorithm to the pattern of missing label information, outperforming several strong baselines. 1</p><p>6 0.10470962 <a title="226-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Theory_of_Multiclass_Boosting.html">15 nips-2010-A Theory of Multiclass Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak classiﬁers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classiﬁcation is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the “correct” requirements on the weak classiﬁer, or the notion of the most efﬁcient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements. 1</p><p>5 0.4829098 <a title="226-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Classification_with_Specificity_Constraints.html">192 nips-2010-Online Classification with Specificity Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrey Bernstein, Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online binary classiﬁcation problem, where we are given m classiﬁers. At each stage, the classiﬁers map the input to the probability that the input belongs to the positive class. An online classiﬁcation meta-algorithm is an algorithm that combines the outputs of the classiﬁers in order to attain a certain goal, without having prior knowledge on the form and statistics of the input, and without prior knowledge on the performance of the given classiﬁers. In this paper, we use sensitivity and speciﬁcity as the performance metrics of the meta-algorithm. In particular, our goal is to design an algorithm that satisﬁes the following two properties (asymptotically): (i) its average false positive rate (fp-rate) is under some given threshold; and (ii) its average true positive rate (tp-rate) is not worse than the tp-rate of the best convex combination of the m given classiﬁers that satisﬁes fprate constraint, in hindsight. We show that this problem is in fact a special case of the regret minimization problem with constraints, and therefore the above goal is not attainable. Hence, we pose a relaxed goal and propose a corresponding practical online learning meta-algorithm that attains it. In the case of two classiﬁers, we show that this algorithm takes a very simple form. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that addresses the problem of the average tp-rate maximization under average fp-rate constraints in the online setting. 1</p><p>6 0.42934182 <a title="226-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Parallelized_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.html">202 nips-2010-Parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent</a></p>

<p>Author: Paolo Viappiani, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.</p><p>3 0.79083925 <a title="226-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Generalized_roof_duality_and_bisubmodular_functions.html">102 nips-2010-Generalized roof duality and bisubmodular functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: ˆ Consider a convex relaxation f of a pseudo-boolean function f . We say that ˆ the relaxation is totally half-integral if f (x) is a polyhedral function with halfintegral extreme points x, and this property is preserved after adding an arbitrary combination of constraints of the form xi = xj , xi = 1 − xj , and xi = γ where 1 γ ∈ {0, 1, 2 } is a constant. A well-known example is the roof duality relaxation for quadratic pseudo-boolean functions f . We argue that total half-integrality is a natural requirement for generalizations of roof duality to arbitrary pseudo-boolean functions. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a complete characterization ˆ of totally half-integral relaxations f by establishing a one-to-one correspondence with bisubmodular functions. Second, we give a new characterization of bisubmodular functions. Finally, we show some relationships between general totally half-integral relaxations and relaxations based on the roof duality. 1</p><p>4 0.73867226 <a title="226-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida_Regularization_for_Grouped_Tree_Structure_Learning.html">170 nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida Regularization for Grouped Tree Structure Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Liu, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the tree structured group Lasso where the structure over the features can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as features and internal nodes as clusters of the features. The structured regularization with a pre-deﬁned tree structure is based on a group-Lasso penalty, where one group is deﬁned for each node in the tree. Such a regularization can help uncover the structured sparsity, which is desirable for applications with some meaningful tree structures on the features. However, the tree structured group Lasso is challenging to solve due to the complex regularization. In this paper, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for the tree structured group Lasso. One of the key steps in the proposed algorithm is to solve the Moreau-Yosida regularization associated with the grouped tree structure. The main technical contributions of this paper include (1) we show that the associated Moreau-Yosida regularization admits an analytical solution, and (2) we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for determining the effective interval for the regularization parameter. Our experimental results on the AR and JAFFE face data sets demonstrate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>5 0.73263264 <a title="226-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Linear_readout_from_a_neural_population_with_partial_correlation_data.html">161 nips-2010-Linear readout from a neural population with partial correlation data</a></p>

These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>6 0.72085798 <a title="226-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Structural_epitome%3A_a_way_to_summarize_one%E2%80%99s_visual_experience.html">256 nips-2010-Structural epitome: a way to summarize one’s visual experience</a></p>

<p>Author: Margareta Ackerman, Shai Ben-David, David Loker</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a basic data mining task with a wide variety of applications. Not surprisingly, there exist many clustering algorithms. However, clustering is an ill deﬁned problem - given a data set, it is not clear what a “correct” clustering for that set is. Indeed, different algorithms may yield dramatically different outputs for the same input sets. Faced with a concrete clustering task, a user needs to choose an appropriate clustering algorithm. Currently, such decisions are often made in a very ad hoc, if not completely random, manner. Given the crucial effect of the choice of a clustering algorithm on the resulting clustering, this state of affairs is truly regrettable. In this paper we address the major research challenge of developing tools for helping users make more informed decisions when they come to pick a clustering tool for their data. This is, of course, a very ambitious endeavor, and in this paper, we make some ﬁrst steps towards this goal. We propose to address this problem by distilling abstract properties of the input-output behavior of different clustering paradigms. In this paper, we demonstrate how abstract, intuitive properties of clustering functions can be used to taxonomize a set of popular clustering algorithmic paradigms. On top of addressing deterministic clustering algorithms, we also propose similar properties for randomized algorithms and use them to highlight functional differences between different common implementations of k-means clustering. We also study relationships between the properties, independent of any particular algorithm. In particular, we strengthen Kleinberg’s famous impossibility result, while providing a simpler proof. 1</p><p>3 0.13722901 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Gaussian_Process_Preference_Elicitation.html">100 nips-2010-Gaussian Process Preference Elicitation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shengbo Guo, Scott Sanner, Edwin V. Bonilla</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to preference elicitation (PE) are particularly attractive due to their ability to explicitly model uncertainty in users’ latent utility functions. However, previous approaches to Bayesian PE have ignored the important problem of generalizing from previous users to an unseen user in order to reduce the elicitation burden on new users. In this paper, we address this deﬁciency by introducing a Gaussian Process (GP) prior over users’ latent utility functions on the joint space of user and item features. We learn the hyper-parameters of this GP on a set of preferences of previous users and use it to aid in the elicitation process for a new user. This approach provides a ﬂexible model of a multi-user utility function, facilitates an efﬁcient value of information (VOI) heuristic query selection strategy, and provides a principled way to incorporate the elicitations of multiple users back into the model. We show the effectiveness of our method in comparison to previous work on a real dataset of user preferences over sushi types. 1</p><p>4 0.13116899 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Minimum_Average_Cost_Clustering.html">166 nips-2010-Minimum Average Cost Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kiyohito Nagano, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Satoru Iwata</p><p>Abstract: A number of objective functions in clustering problems can be described with submodular functions. In this paper, we introduce the minimum average cost criterion, and show that the theory of intersecting submodular functions can be used for clustering with submodular objective functions. The proposed algorithm does not require the number of clusters in advance, and it will be determined by the property of a given set of data points. The minimum average cost clustering problem is parameterized with a real variable, and surprisingly, we show that all information about optimal clusterings for all parameters can be computed in polynomial time in total. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through computational experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.12788701 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Robust_Clustering_as_Ensembles_of_Affinity_Relations.html">230 nips-2010-Robust Clustering as Ensembles of Affinity Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hairong Liu, Longin J. Latecki, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we regard clustering as ensembles of k-ary afﬁnity relations and clusters correspond to subsets of objects with maximal average afﬁnity relations. The average afﬁnity relation of a cluster is relaxed and well approximated by a constrained homogenous function. We present an efﬁcient procedure to solve this optimization problem, and show that the underlying clusters can be robustly revealed by using priors systematically constructed from the data. Our method can automatically select some points to form clusters, leaving other points un-grouped; thus it is inherently robust to large numbers of outliers, which has seriously limited the applicability of classical methods. Our method also provides a uniﬁed solution to clustering from k-ary afﬁnity relations with k ≥ 2, that is, it applies to both graph-based and hypergraph-based clustering problems. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show the superiority of our method over classical solutions to the clustering problem, especially when there exists a large number of outliers.</p><p>6 0.12234879 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Supervised_Clustering.html">261 nips-2010-Supervised Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziv Bar-joseph, Hai-son P. Le</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies compare gene expression data across species to identify core and species speciﬁc genes in biological systems. To perform such comparisons researchers need to match genes across species. This is a challenging task since the correct matches (orthologs) are not known for most genes. Previous work in this area used deterministic matchings or reduced multidimensional expression data to binary representation. Here we develop a new method that can utilize soft matches (given as priors) to infer both, unique and similar expression patterns across species and a matching for the genes in both species. Our method uses a Dirichlet process mixture model which includes a latent data matching variable. We present learning and inference algorithms based on variational methods for this model. Applying our method to immune response data we show that it can accurately identify common and unique response patterns by improving the matchings between human and mouse genes. 1</p><p>4 0.60569 <a title="155-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Discriminative_Clustering_by_Regularized_Information_Maximization.html">62 nips-2010-Discriminative Clustering by Regularized Information Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona, Ryan G. Gomes</p><p>Abstract: Is there a principled way to learn a probabilistic discriminative classiﬁer from an unlabeled data set? We present a framework that simultaneously clusters the data and trains a discriminative classiﬁer. We call it Regularized Information Maximization (RIM). RIM optimizes an intuitive information-theoretic objective function which balances class separation, class balance and classiﬁer complexity. The approach can ﬂexibly incorporate different likelihood functions, express prior assumptions about the relative size of different classes and incorporate partial labels for semi-supervised learning. In particular, we instantiate the framework to unsupervised, multi-class kernelized logistic regression. Our empirical evaluation indicates that RIM outperforms existing methods on several real data sets, and demonstrates that RIM is an effective model selection method. 1</p><p>5 0.60436314 <a title="155-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Property-Based_Classification_of_Clustering_Paradigms.html">273 nips-2010-Towards Property-Based Classification of Clustering Paradigms</a></p>

<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric learning method based on multivariate dyadic regression trees (MDRTs). Unlike traditional dyadic decision trees (DDTs) or classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs), MDRTs are constructed using penalized empirical risk minimization with a novel sparsity-inducing penalty. Theoretically, we show that MDRTs can simultaneously adapt to the unknown sparsity and smoothness of the true regression functions, and achieve the nearly optimal rates of convergence (in a minimax sense) for the class of (α, C)-smooth functions. Empirically, MDRTs can simultaneously conduct function estimation and variable selection in high dimensions. To make MDRTs applicable for large-scale learning problems, we propose a greedy heuristics. The superior performance of MDRTs are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.84599078 <a title="155-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-MAP_Estimation_for_Graphical_Models_by_Likelihood_Maximization.html">164 nips-2010-MAP Estimation for Graphical Models by Likelihood Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Akshat Kumar, Shlomo Zilberstein</p><p>Abstract: Computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment in graphical models is a crucial inference problem for many practical applications. Several provably convergent approaches have been successfully developed using linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MAP problem. We present an alternative approach, which transforms the MAP problem into that of inference in a mixture of simple Bayes nets. We then derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for this mixture that also monotonically increases a lower bound on the MAP assignment until convergence. The update equations for the EM algorithm are remarkably simple, both conceptually and computationally, and can be implemented using a graph-based message passing paradigm similar to max-product computation. Experiments on the real-world protein design dataset show that EM’s convergence rate is signiﬁcantly higher than the previous LP relaxation based approach MPLP. EM also achieves a solution quality within 95% of optimal for most instances. 1</p><p>5 0.84433419 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Layer-wise_analysis_of_deep_networks_with_Gaussian_kernels.html">140 nips-2010-Layer-wise analysis of deep networks with Gaussian kernels</a></p>

We present an analysis based on Gaussian kernels that measures how the representation of the learning problem evolves layer after layer as the deep network builds higher-level abstract representations of the input. We use this analysis to show empirically that deep networks build progressively better representations of the learning problem and that the best representations are obtained when the deep network discriminates only in the last layers. 1</p><p>6 0.84265643 <a title="155-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Over-complete_representations_on_recurrent_neural_networks_can_support_persistent_percepts.html">200 nips-2010-Over-complete representations on recurrent neural networks can support persistent percepts</a></p>

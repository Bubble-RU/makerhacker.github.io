<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural ﬁring rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron sufﬁces to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the online approximation of signals with a sum of powerlaw kernels is beneﬁcial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.40696016 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing? On goodness-of-fit procedures for point process models and Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Gerhard, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an increasingly popular framework for modeling neural spike trains. They have been linked to the theory of stochastic point processes and researchers have used this relation to assess goodness-of-ﬁt using methods from point-process theory, e.g. the time-rescaling theorem. However, high neural ﬁring rates or coarse discretization lead to a breakdown of the assumptions necessary for this connection. Here, we show how goodness-of-ﬁt tests from point-process theory can still be applied to GLMs by constructing equivalent surrogate point processes out of time-series observations. Furthermore, two additional tests based on thinning and complementing point processes are introduced. They augment the instruments available for checking model adequacy of point processes as well as discretized models. 1</p><p>4 0.3581903 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-A_VLSI_Implementation_of_the_Adaptive_Exponential_Integrate-and-Fire_Neuron_Model.html">16 nips-2010-A VLSI Implementation of the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model</a></p>

Firing patterns of the membrane stimulated by a step current are analyzed in transistor level simulations and in silicon on a prototype chip. The neuron is destined to be the hardware neuron of a highly integrated wafer-scale system reaching out for new computational paradigms and opening new experimentation possibilities. As the neuron is dedicated as a universal device for neuroscientiﬁc experiments, the focus lays on parameterizability and reproduction of the analytical model. 1</p><p>5 0.32140666 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-A_novel_family_of_non-parametric_cumulative_based_divergences_for_point_processes.html">18 nips-2010-A novel family of non-parametric cumulative based divergences for point processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Sohan Seth, Park Il, Austin Brockmeier, Mulugeta Semework, John Choi, Joseph Francis, Jose Principe</p><p>Abstract: Hypothesis testing on point processes has several applications such as model ﬁtting, plasticity detection, and non-stationarity detection. Standard tools for hypothesis testing include tests on mean ﬁring rate and time varying rate function. However, these statistics do not fully describe a point process, and therefore, the conclusions drawn by these tests can be misleading. In this paper, we introduce a family of non-parametric divergence measures for hypothesis testing. A divergence measure compares the full probability structure and, therefore, leads to a more robust test of hypothesis. We extend the traditional Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Cram´ r–von-Mises tests to the space of spike trains via stratiﬁcation, and e show that these statistics can be consistently estimated from data without any free parameter. We demonstrate an application of the proposed divergences as a cost function to ﬁnd optimally matched point processes. 1</p><p>6 0.31524131 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-SpikeAnts%2C_a_spiking_neuron_network_modelling_the_emergence_of_organization_in_a_complex_system.html">252 nips-2010-SpikeAnts, a spiking neuron network modelling the emergence of organization in a complex system</a></p>

<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>3 0.8800863 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Sylvain Chevallier, Hél\`ene Paugam-moisy, Michele Sebag</p><p>Abstract: Many complex systems, ranging from neural cell assemblies to insect societies, involve and rely on some division of labor. How to enforce such a division in a decentralized and distributed way, is tackled in this paper, using a spiking neuron network architecture. Speciﬁcally, a spatio-temporal model called SpikeAnts is shown to enforce the emergence of synchronized activities in an ant colony. Each ant is modelled from two spiking neurons; the ant colony is a sparsely connected spiking neuron network. Each ant makes its decision (among foraging, sleeping and self-grooming) from the competition between its two neurons, after the signals received from its neighbor ants. Interestingly, three types of temporal patterns emerge in the ant colony: asynchronous, synchronous, and synchronous periodic foraging activities − similar to the actual behavior of some living ant colonies. A phase diagram of the emergent activity patterns with respect to two control parameters, respectively accounting for ant sociability and receptivity, is presented and discussed. 1</p><p>5 0.85227585 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_Dendritic_Processing.html">115 nips-2010-Identifying Dendritic Processing</a></p>

Here we present a novel formal methodology for identifying dendritic processing in a neural circuit consisting of a linear dendritic processing ﬁlter in cascade with a spiking neuron model. The input to the circuit is an analog signal that belongs to the space of bandlimited functions. The output is a time sequence associated with the spike train. We derive an algorithm for identiﬁcation of the dendritic processing ﬁlter and reconstruct its kernel with arbitrary precision. 1</p><p>6 0.82382244 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing?

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Li-jia Li, Li Fei-fei, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Upstream supervised topic models have been widely used for complicated scene understanding. However, existing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) schemes can make the prediction model learning independent of latent topic discovery and result in an imbalanced prediction rule for scene classiﬁcation. This paper presents a joint max-margin and max-likelihood learning method for upstream scene understanding models, in which latent topic discovery and prediction model estimation are closely coupled and well-balanced. The optimization problem is efﬁciently solved with a variational EM procedure, which iteratively solves an online loss-augmented SVM. We demonstrate the advantages of the large-margin approach on both an 8-category sports dataset and the 67-class MIT indoor scene dataset for scene categorization.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74669009 <a title="10-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-A_Novel_Kernel_for_Learning_a_Neuron_Model_from_Spike_Train_Data.html">10 nips-2010-A Novel Kernel for Learning a Neuron Model from Spike Train Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ben Recht, Nathan Srebro, Joel Tropp, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: The max-norm was proposed as a convex matrix regularizer in [1] and was shown to be empirically superior to the trace-norm for collaborative ﬁltering problems. Although the max-norm can be computed in polynomial time, there are currently no practical algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems that incorporate the max-norm. The present work uses a factorization technique of Burer and Monteiro [2] to devise scalable ﬁrst-order algorithms for convex programs involving the max-norm. These algorithms are applied to solve huge collaborative ﬁltering, graph cut, and clustering problems. Empirically, the new methods outperform mature techniques from all three areas. 1</p><p>4 0.71567303 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_a_Sparse_Matrix-Normal_Penalty.html">147 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks with a Sparse Matrix-Normal Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a matrix-variate normal penalty with sparse inverse covariances to couple multiple tasks. Learning multiple (parametric) models can be viewed as estimating a matrix of parameters, where rows and columns of the matrix correspond to tasks and features, respectively. Following the matrix-variate normal density, we design a penalty that decomposes the full covariance of matrix elements into the Kronecker product of row covariance and column covariance, which characterizes both task relatedness and feature representation. Several recently proposed methods are variants of the special cases of this formulation. To address the overﬁtting issue and select meaningful task and feature structures, we include sparse covariance selection into our matrix-normal regularization via ℓ1 penalties on task and feature inverse covariances. We empirically study the proposed method and compare with related models in two real-world problems: detecting landmines in multiple ﬁelds and recognizing faces between different subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides an effective and ﬂexible way to model various different structures of multiple tasks.</p><p>5 0.69341141 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>
<p>Author: Kritika Muralidharan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justiﬁcation for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classiﬁcation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems. 1</p><p>6 0.69245332 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Segmentation_as_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set.html">234 nips-2010-Segmentation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set</a></p>

<p>Author: Elaine Corbett, Eric Perreault, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: Applications of Brain-Machine-Interfaces typically estimate user intent based on biological signals that are under voluntary control. For example, we might want to estimate how a patient with a paralyzed arm wants to move based on residual muscle activity. To solve such problems it is necessary to integrate obtained information over time. To do so, state of the art approaches typically use a probabilistic model of how the state, e.g. position and velocity of the arm, evolves over time – a so-called trajectory model. We wanted to further develop this approach using two intuitive insights: (1) At any given point of time there may be a small set of likely movement targets, potentially identified by the location of objects in the workspace or by gaze information from the user. (2) The user may want to produce movements at varying speeds. We thus use a generative model with a trajectory model incorporating these insights. Approximate inference on that generative model is implemented using a mixture of extended Kalman filters. We find that the resulting algorithm allows us to decode arm movements dramatically better than when we use a trajectory model with linear dynamics. 1 In trod u cti on When patients have lost a limb or the ability to communicate with the outside world, brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are often used to enable robotic prostheses or restore communication. To achieve this, the user's intended state of the device must be decoded from biological signals. In the context of Bayesian statistics, two aspects are important for the design of an estimator of a temporally evolving state: the observation model, which describes how measured variables relate to the system’s state and the trajectory model which describes how the state changes over time in a probabilistic manner. Following this logic many recent BMI applications have relied on Bayesian estimation for a wide range of problems including the decoding of intended human [1] and animal [2] movements. In the context of BMIs, Bayesian approaches offer a principled way of formalizing the uncertainty about signals and thus often result in improvements over other signal processing techniques [1]-[3]. Most work on state estimation in dynamical systems has assumed linear dynamics and Gaussian noise. Under these circumstances, efficient algorithms result from belief propagation. The most frequent application uses the Kalman filter (KF), which recursively combines noisy state observations with the probabilistic evolution of state defined by the trajectory model to estimate the marginal distribution over states [4]. Such approaches have been used widely for applications including upper [1] and lower [5] extremity prosthetic 1 devices, functional electric stimulation [6] and human computer interactions [7]. As these algorithms are so commonly used, it seems promising to develop extensions to nonlinear trajectory models that may better describe the probabilistic distribution of movements in everyday life. One salient departure from the standard assumptions is that people tend to produce both slow and fast movements, depending on the situation. Models with linear dynamics only allow such deviation through the noise term, which makes these models poor at describing the natural variation of movement speeds during real world tasks. Explicitly incorporating movement speed into the trajectory model should lead to better movement estimates. Knowledge of the target position should also strongly affect trajectory models. After all , we tend to accelerate our arm early during movement and slow down later on. Target information can be linearly incorporated into the trajectory model, and this has greatly improved predictions [8]-[12]. Alternatively, if there are a small number of potential targets then a mixture of trajectory models approach [13] can be used. Here we are interested in the case where available data provide a prior over potential t argets but where movement targets may be anywhere. We want to incorporate target uncertainty and allow generalization to novel targets. Prior information about potential targets could come from a number of sources but would generally be noisy. For example, activity in the dorsal premotor cortex provides information about intended target location prior to movement and may be used where such recordings are available [14]. Target information may also be found noninvasively by tracking eye movements. However, such data will generally provide non-zero priors for a number of possible target locations as the subject saccades over the scene. While subjects almost always look at a target before reaching for it [15], there may be a delay of up to a second between looking at the target and the reach – a time interval over which up to 3 saccades are typically made. Each of these fixations could be the target. Hence, a probabilistic distribution of targets is appropriate when using either neural recordings or eye tracking to estimate potential reach targets Here we present an algorithm that uses a mixture of extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) to combine our insights related to the variation of movement speed and the availability of probabilistic target knowledge. Each of the mixture component s allows the speed of the movement to vary continuously over time. We tested how well we could use EMGs and eye movements to decode hand position of humans performing a three -dimensional large workspace reaching task. We find that using a trajectory model that allows for probabilistic target information and variation of speed leads to dramatic improvements in decoding quality. 2 Gen e ral Decod i n g S etti n g We wanted to test how well different decoding algorithms can decode human movement, over a wide range of dynamics. While many recent studies have looked at more restrictive, two-dimensional movements, a system to restore arm function should produce a wide range of 3D trajectories. We recorded arm kinematics and EMGs of healthy subjects during unconstrained 3D reaches to targets over a large workspace. Two healthy subjects were asked to reach at slow, normal and fast speeds, as they would in everyday life. Subjects were seated as they reached towards 16 LEDs in blocks of 150s, which were located on two planes positioned such that all targets were just reachable (Fig 1A). The target LED was lit for one second prior to an auditory go cue, at which time the subject would reach to the target at the appropriate speed. Slow, normal and fast reaches were allotted 3 s, 1.5s and 1s respectively; however, subjects determined the speed. An approximate total of 450 reaches were performed per subject. The subjects provided informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. EMG signals were measured from the pectoralis major, and the three deltoid muscles of the shoulder. This represents a small subset of the muscles involved in reaching, and approximates those muscles retaining some voluntary control following mid-level cervical spinal cord injuries. 2 The EMG signals were band-pass filtered between 10 and 1,000 Hz, and subsequently anti aliased filtered. Hand, wrist, shoulder and head positions were tracked using an Optotrak motion analysis system. We simultaneously recorded eye movements with an ASL EYETRAC-6 head mounted eye tracker. Approximately 25% of the reaches were assigned to the test set, and the rest were used for training. Reaches for which either the motion capture data was incomplete, or there was visible motion artifact on the EMG were removed. As the state we used hand positions and joint angles (3 shoulder, 2 elbow, position, velocity and acceleration, 24 dimensions). Joint angles were calculated from the shoulder and wrist marker data using digitized bony landmarks which defined a coordinate system for the upper limb as detailed by Wu et al. [16]. As the motion data were sampled at 60Hz, the mean absolute value o f the EMG in the corresponding 16.7ms windows was used as an observation of the state at each time-step. Algorithm accuracy was quantified by normalizing the root -mean-squared error by the straight line distance between the first and final position of the endpoint for each reach. We compared the algorithms statistically using repeated measures ANOVAs with Tukey post -hoc tests, treating reach and subject as random effects. In the rest of the paper we will ask how well these reaching movements can be decoded from EMG and eye-tracking data. Figure 1: A Experimental setup and B sample kinematics and processed EMGs for one reach 3 Kal man Fi l ters w i th Target i n f ormati on All models that we consider in this paper assume linear observations with Gaussian noise: (1) where x is the state, y is the observation and v is the measurement noise with p(v) ~ N(0,R), and R is the observation covariance matrix. The model fitted the measured EMGs with an average r2 of 0.55. This highlights the need to integrate information over time. The standard approach also assumes linear dynamics and Gaussian process noise: (2) where, x t represents the hand and joint angle positions, w is the process noise with p(w) ~ N(0,Q), and Q is the state covariance matrix. The Kalman filter does optimal inference for this generative model. This model can effectively capture the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to a single target by appropriately tuning its parameters. However, when used to describe reaches to multiple targets, the model cannot describe target dependent aspects of reaching but boils down to a random drift model. Fast velocities are underestimated as they are unlikely under the trajectory model and there is excessive drift close to the target (Fig. 2A). 3 In many decoding applications we may know the subject’s target. A range of recent studies have addressed the issue of incorporating this information into the trajectory model [8, 13], and we might assume the effect of the target on the dynamics to be linear. This naturally suggests adding the target to the state space, which works well in practice [9, 12]. By appending the target to the state vector (KFT), the simple linear format of the KF may be retained: (3) where xTt is the vector of target positions, with dimensionality less than or equal to that of xt. This trajectory model thus allows describing both the rapid acceleration that characterizes the beginning of a reach and the stabilization towards its end. We compared the accuracy of the KF and the KFT to the Single Target Model (STM), a KF trained only on reaches to the target being tested (Fig. 2). The STM represents the best possible prediction that could be obtained with a Kalman filter. Assuming the target is perfectly known, we implemented the KFT by correctly initializing the target state xT at the beginning of the reach. We will relax this assumption below. The initial hand and joint angle positions were also assumed to be known. Figure 2: A Sample reach and predictions and B average accuracies with standard errors for KFT, KF and MTM. Consistent with the recent literature, both methods that incorporated target information produced higher prediction accuracy than the standard KF (both p<0.0001). Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the KFT and the STM (p=0.9). It seems that when we have knowledge of the target, we do not lose much by training a single model over the whole workspace rather than modeling the targets individually. This is encouraging, as we desire a BMI system that can generalize to any target within the workspace, not just specifically to those that are available in the training data. Clearly, adding the target to the state space allows the dynamics of typical movements to be modeled effectively, resulting in dramatic increases in decoding performance. 4 Ti me Warp i n g 4.1 I m p l e m e n t i n g a t i m e - w a r p e d t r a j e c t o r y mo d e l While the KFT above can capture the general reach trajectory profile, it does not allow for natural variability in the speed of movements. Depending on our task objectives, which would not directly be observed by a BMI, we might lazily reach toward a target or move a t maximal speed. We aim to change the trajectory model to explicitly incorporate a warping factor by which the average movement speed is scaled, allowing for such variability. As the movement speed will be positive in all practical cases, we model the logarithm of this factor, 4 and append it to the state vector: (4) We create a time-warped trajectory model by noting that if the average rate of a trajectory is to be scaled by a factor S, the position at time t will equal that of the original trajectory at time St. Differentiating, the velocity will be multiplied by S, and the acceleration by S 2. For simplicity, the trajectory noise is assumed to be additive and Gaussian, and the model is assumed to be stationary: (5) where Ip is the p-dimensional identity matrix and is a p p matrix of zeros. Only the terms used to predict the acceleration states need to be estimated to build the state transition matrix, and they are scaled as a nonlinear function of xs. After adding the variable movement speed to the state space the system is no longer linear. Therefore we need a different solution strategy. Instead of the typical KFT we use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKFT) to implement a nonlinear trajectory model by linearizing the dynamics around the best estimate at each time-step [17]. With this approach we add only small computational overhead to the KFT recursions. 4.2 Tr a i n i n g t h e t i m e w a r p i n g mo d e l The filter parameters were trained using a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [18]. For extended Kalman filter learning the initialization for the variables may matter. S was initialized with the ground truth average reach speeds for each movement relative to the average speed across all movements. The state transition parameters were estimated using nonlinear least squares regression, while C, Q and R were estimated linearly for the new system, using the maximum likelihood solution [18] (M-step). For the E-step we used a standard extended Kalman smoother. We thus found the expected values for t he states given the current filter parameters. For this computation, and later when testing the algorithm, xs was initialized to its average value across all reaches while the remaining states were initialized to their true values. The smoothed estimate fo r xs was then used, along with the true values for the other states, to re-estimate the filter parameters in the M-step as before. We alternated between the E and M steps until the log likelihood converged (which it did in all cases). Following the training procedure, the diagonal of the state covariance matrix Q corresponding to xs was set to the variance of the smoothed xs over all reaches, according to how much this state should be allowed to change during prediction. This allowed the estimate of xs to develop over the course of the reach due to the evidence provided by the observations, better capturing the dynamics of reaches at different speeds. 4.3 P e r f o r ma n c e o f t h e t i m e - w a r p e d E K F T Incorporating time warping explicitly into the trajectory model pro duced a noticeable increase in decoding performance over the KFT. As the speed state xs is estimated throughout the course of the reach, based on the evidence provided by the observations, the trajectory model has the flexibility to follow the dynamics of the reach more accurately (Fig. 3). While at the normal self-selected speed the difference between the algorithms is small, for the slow and fast speeds, where the dynamics deviate from average, there i s a clear advantage to the time warping model. 5 Figure 3: Hand positions and predictions of the KFT and EKFT for sample reaches at A slow, B normal and C fast speeds. Note the different time scales between reaches. The models were first trained using data from all speeds (Fig. 4A). The EKFT was 1.8% more accurate on average (p<0.01), and the effect was significant at the slow (1.9%, p<0.05) and the fast (2.8%, p<0.01), but not at the normal (p=0.3) speed. We also trained the models from data using only reaches at the self-selected normal speed, as we wanted to see if there was enough variation to effectively train the EKFT (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the performance of the EKFT was reduced by only 0.6%, and the KFT by 1.1%. The difference in performance between the EKFT and KFT was even more pronounced on aver age (2.3%, p<0.001), and for the slow and fast speeds (3.6 and 4.1%, both p< 0.0001). At the normal speed, the algorithms again were not statistically different (p=0.6). This result demonstrates that the EKFT is a practical option for a real BMI system, as it is not necessary to greatly vary the speeds while collecting training data for the model to be effective over a wide range of intended speeds. Explicitly incorporating speed information into the trajectory model helps decoding, by modeling the natural variation in volitional speed. Figure 4: Mean and standard error of EKFT and KFT accuracy at the different subjectselected speeds. Models were trained on reaches at A all speeds and B just normal speed reaches. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the algorithms. 5 Mi xtu res of Target s So far, we have assumed that the targets of our reaches are perfectly known. In a real-world system, there will be uncertainty about the intended target of the reach. However, in typical applications there are a small number of possible objectives. Here we address this situation. Drawing on the recent literature, we use a mixture model to consider each of the possible targets [11, 13]. We condition the posterior probability for the state on the N possible targets, T: (6) 6 Using Bayes' Rule, this equation becomes: (7) As we are dealing with a mixture model, we perform the Kalman filter recursion for each possible target, xT, and our solution is a weighted sum of the outputs. The weights are proportional to the prior for that target, , and the likelihood of the model given that target . is independent of the target and does not need to be calculated. We tested mixtures of both algorithms, the mKFT and mEKFT, with real uncert ain priors obtained from eye-tracking in the one-second period preceding movement. As the targets were situated on two planes, the three-dimensional location of the eye gaze was found by projecting its direction onto those planes. The first, middle and last eye samples were selected, and all other samples were assigned to a group according to which of the three was closest. The mean and variance of these three groups were used to initialize three Kalman filters in the mixture model. The priors of the three groups were assigned proportional to the number of samples in them. If the subject looks at multiple positions prior to reaching, this method ensures with a high probability that the correct target was accounted for in one of the filters in the mixture. We also compared the MTM approach of Yu et al. [13], where a different KF model was generated for each target, and a mixture is performed over these models. This approach explicitly captures the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to specific targets. Given perfect target information, it would reduce to the STM described above. Priors for the MTM were found by assigning each valid eye sample to its closest two targets, and weighting the models proportional to the number of samples assigned to the corresponding target, divided by its distance from the mean of those samples. We tried other ways of assigning priors and the one presented gave the best results. We calculated the reduction in decoding quality when instead of perfect priors we provide eye-movement based noisy priors (Fig. 5). The accuracies of the mEKFT, the mKFT and the MTM were only degraded by 0.8, 1.9 and 2.1% respectively, compared to the perfect prior situation. The mEKFT was still close to 10% better than the KF. The mixture model framework is effective in accounting for uncertain priors. Figure 5: Mean and standard errors of accuracy for algorithms with perfect priors, and uncertain priors with full and partial training set. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant effects between the two training types, where real priors are used. Here, only reaches at normal speed were used to train the models, as this is a more realistic training set for a BMI application. This accounts for the degraded performance of the MTM with perfect priors relative to the STM from above (Fig. 2). With even more stereotyped training data for each target, the MTM doesn't generalize as well to new speeds. 7 We also wanted to know if the algorithms could generalize to new targets. In a real application, the available training data will generally not span the entire useable worksp ace. We compared the algorithms where reaches to all targets except the one being tested had been used to train the models. The performance of the MTM was significantly de graded unsurprisingly, as it was designed for reaches to a set of known targets. Performance of the mKFT and mEKFT degraded by about 1%, but not significantly (both p>0.7), demonstrating that the continuous approach to target information is preferable when the target could be anywhere in space, not just at locations for which training data is available. 6 Di scu ssi on and concl u si on s The goal of this work was to design a trajectory model that would improve decoding for BMIs with an application to reaching. We incorporated two features that prominently influence the dynamics of natural reach: the movement speed and the target location. Our approach is appropriate where uncertain target information is available. The model generalizes well to new regions of the workspace for which there is no training data, and across a broad range of reaching dynamics to widely spaced targets in three dimensions. The advantages over linear models in decoding precision we report here could be equally obtained using mixtures over many targets and speeds. While mixture models [11, 13] could allow for slow versus fast movements and any number of potential targets, this strategy will generally require many mixture components. Such an approach would require a lot more training data, as we have shown that it does not generalize well. It would also be run-time intensive which is problematic for prosthetic devices that rely on low power controllers. In contrast, the algorithm introduced here only takes a small amount of additional run-time in comparison to the standard KF approach. The EKF is only marginally slower than the standard KF and the algorithm will not generally need to consider more than 3 mixture components assuming the subject fixates the target within the second pre ceding the reach. In this paper we assumed that subjects always would fixate a reach target – along with other non-targets. While this is close to the way humans usually coordinate eyes and reaches [15], there might be cases where people do not fixate a reach target. Our approach could be easily extended to deal with such situations by adding a dummy mixture component that all ows the description of movements to any target. As an alternative to mixture approaches, a system can explicitly estimate the target position in the state vector [9]. This approach, however, would not straightforwardly allow for the rich target information available; we look at the target but also at other locations, strongly suggesting mixture distributions. A combination of the two approaches could further improve decoding quality. We could both estimate speed and target position for the EKFT in a continuous manner while retaining the mixture over target priors. We believe that the issues that we have addressed here are almost universal. Virtually all types of movements are executed at varying speed. A probabilistic distribution for a small number of action candidates may also be expected in most BMI applications – after all there are usually only a small number of actions that make sense in a given environment. While this work is presented in the context of decoding human reaching, it may be applied to a wide range of BMI applications including lower limb prosthetic devices and human computer interactions, as well as different signal sources such as electrode grid recordings and electroencephalograms. The increased user control in conveying their intended movements would significantly improve the functionality of a neuroprosthetic device.

<p>Author: Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort, Jean-baptiste Poline, Bertrand Thirion</p><p>Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity, as observed in functional neuroimaging, has been shown to display reproducible structure that expresses brain architecture and carries markers of brain pathologies. An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reﬂects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modeling full brain connectivity is a difﬁcult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative regularization schemes. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of a cross-validated model of spontaneous brain activity. Finally, we use the estimated graphical model to explore the large-scale characteristics of functional architecture and show for the ﬁrst time that known cognitive networks appear as the integrated communities of functional connectivity graph. 1</p><p>4 0.10215925 <a title="57-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Functional_Geometry_Alignment_and_Localization_of_Brain_Areas.html">97 nips-2010-Functional Geometry Alignment and Localization of Brain Areas</a></p>
<p>Author: Georg Langs, Yanmei Tie, Laura Rigolo, Alexandra Golby, Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: Matching functional brain regions across individuals is a challenging task, largely due to the variability in their location and extent. It is particularly difﬁcult, but highly relevant, for patients with pathologies such as brain tumors, which can cause substantial reorganization of functional systems. In such cases spatial registration based on anatomical data is only of limited value if the goal is to establish correspondences of functional areas among different individuals, or to localize potentially displaced active regions. Rather than rely on spatial alignment, we propose to perform registration in an alternative space whose geometry is governed by the functional interaction patterns in the brain. We ﬁrst embed each brain into a functional map that reﬂects connectivity patterns during a fMRI experiment. The resulting functional maps are then registered, and the obtained correspondences are propagated back to the two brains. In application to a language fMRI experiment, our preliminary results suggest that the proposed method yields improved functional correspondences across subjects. This advantage is pronounced for subjects with tumors that affect the language areas and thus cause spatial reorganization of the functional regions. 1</p><p>5 0.081529602 <a title="57-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Infinite_Relational_Modeling_of_Functional_Connectivity_in_Resting_State_fMRI.html">128 nips-2010-Infinite Relational Modeling of Functional Connectivity in Resting State fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Morten Mørup, Kristoffer Madsen, Anne-marie Dogonowski, Hartwig Siebner, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the neural elements which form complex network at a whole brain level. Most analyses of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been based on the analysis of correlation between the temporal dynamics of various regions of the brain. While these models can identify coherently behaving groups in terms of correlation they give little insight into how these groups interact. In this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state networks. Starting from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups we search for functional units of the brain that communicate with other parts of the brain in a coherent manner as measured by mutual information. We use the inﬁnite relational model (IRM) to quantify functional coherent groups of resting state networks and demonstrate how the extracted component interactions can be used to discriminate between functional resting state activity in multiple sclerosis and normal subjects. 1</p><p>6 0.074481629 <a title="57-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Spatial_and_anatomical_regularization_of_SVM_for_brain_image_analysis.html">249 nips-2010-Spatial and anatomical regularization of SVM for brain image analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuzong Liu, Mohit Sharma, Charles Gaona, Jonathan Breshears, Jarod Roland, Zachary Freudenburg, Eric Leuthardt, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Several motor related Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been developed over the years that use activity decoded from the contralateral hemisphere to operate devices. Contralateral primary motor cortex is also the region most severely affected by hemispheric stroke. Recent studies have identiﬁed ipsilateral cortical activity in planning of motor movements and its potential implications for a stroke relevant BCI. The most fundamental functional loss after a hemispheric stroke is the loss of ﬁne motor control of the hand. Thus, whether ipsilateral cortex encodes ﬁnger movements is critical to the potential feasibility of BCI approaches in the future. This study uses ipsilateral cortical signals from humans (using ECoG) to decode ﬁnger movements. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, successful ﬁnger movement detection using machine learning algorithms. Our results show high decoding accuracies in all cases which are always above chance. We also show that signiﬁcant accuracies can be achieved with the use of only a fraction of all the features recorded and that these core features are consistent with previous physiological ﬁndings. The results of this study have substantial implications for advancing neuroprosthetic approaches to stroke populations not currently amenable to existing BCI techniques. 1</p><p>2 0.65547043 <a title="57-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-Mixture_of_time-warped_trajectory_models_for_movement_decoding.html">167 nips-2010-Mixture of time-warped trajectory models for movement decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Elaine Corbett, Eric Perreault, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: Applications of Brain-Machine-Interfaces typically estimate user intent based on biological signals that are under voluntary control. For example, we might want to estimate how a patient with a paralyzed arm wants to move based on residual muscle activity. To solve such problems it is necessary to integrate obtained information over time. To do so, state of the art approaches typically use a probabilistic model of how the state, e.g. position and velocity of the arm, evolves over time – a so-called trajectory model. We wanted to further develop this approach using two intuitive insights: (1) At any given point of time there may be a small set of likely movement targets, potentially identified by the location of objects in the workspace or by gaze information from the user. (2) The user may want to produce movements at varying speeds. We thus use a generative model with a trajectory model incorporating these insights. Approximate inference on that generative model is implemented using a mixture of extended Kalman filters. We find that the resulting algorithm allows us to decode arm movements dramatically better than when we use a trajectory model with linear dynamics. 1 In trod u cti on When patients have lost a limb or the ability to communicate with the outside world, brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are often used to enable robotic prostheses or restore communication. To achieve this, the user's intended state of the device must be decoded from biological signals. In the context of Bayesian statistics, two aspects are important for the design of an estimator of a temporally evolving state: the observation model, which describes how measured variables relate to the system’s state and the trajectory model which describes how the state changes over time in a probabilistic manner. Following this logic many recent BMI applications have relied on Bayesian estimation for a wide range of problems including the decoding of intended human [1] and animal [2] movements. In the context of BMIs, Bayesian approaches offer a principled way of formalizing the uncertainty about signals and thus often result in improvements over other signal processing techniques [1]-[3]. Most work on state estimation in dynamical systems has assumed linear dynamics and Gaussian noise. Under these circumstances, efficient algorithms result from belief propagation. The most frequent application uses the Kalman filter (KF), which recursively combines noisy state observations with the probabilistic evolution of state defined by the trajectory model to estimate the marginal distribution over states [4]. Such approaches have been used widely for applications including upper [1] and lower [5] extremity prosthetic 1 devices, functional electric stimulation [6] and human computer interactions [7]. As these algorithms are so commonly used, it seems promising to develop extensions to nonlinear trajectory models that may better describe the probabilistic distribution of movements in everyday life. One salient departure from the standard assumptions is that people tend to produce both slow and fast movements, depending on the situation. Models with linear dynamics only allow such deviation through the noise term, which makes these models poor at describing the natural variation of movement speeds during real world tasks. Explicitly incorporating movement speed into the trajectory model should lead to better movement estimates. Knowledge of the target position should also strongly affect trajectory models. After all , we tend to accelerate our arm early during movement and slow down later on. Target information can be linearly incorporated into the trajectory model, and this has greatly improved predictions [8]-[12]. Alternatively, if there are a small number of potential targets then a mixture of trajectory models approach [13] can be used. Here we are interested in the case where available data provide a prior over potential t argets but where movement targets may be anywhere. We want to incorporate target uncertainty and allow generalization to novel targets. Prior information about potential targets could come from a number of sources but would generally be noisy. For example, activity in the dorsal premotor cortex provides information about intended target location prior to movement and may be used where such recordings are available [14]. Target information may also be found noninvasively by tracking eye movements. However, such data will generally provide non-zero priors for a number of possible target locations as the subject saccades over the scene. While subjects almost always look at a target before reaching for it [15], there may be a delay of up to a second between looking at the target and the reach – a time interval over which up to 3 saccades are typically made. Each of these fixations could be the target. Hence, a probabilistic distribution of targets is appropriate when using either neural recordings or eye tracking to estimate potential reach targets Here we present an algorithm that uses a mixture of extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) to combine our insights related to the variation of movement speed and the availability of probabilistic target knowledge. Each of the mixture component s allows the speed of the movement to vary continuously over time. We tested how well we could use EMGs and eye movements to decode hand position of humans performing a three -dimensional large workspace reaching task. We find that using a trajectory model that allows for probabilistic target information and variation of speed leads to dramatic improvements in decoding quality. 2 Gen e ral Decod i n g S etti n g We wanted to test how well different decoding algorithms can decode human movement, over a wide range of dynamics. While many recent studies have looked at more restrictive, two-dimensional movements, a system to restore arm function should produce a wide range of 3D trajectories. We recorded arm kinematics and EMGs of healthy subjects during unconstrained 3D reaches to targets over a large workspace. Two healthy subjects were asked to reach at slow, normal and fast speeds, as they would in everyday life. Subjects were seated as they reached towards 16 LEDs in blocks of 150s, which were located on two planes positioned such that all targets were just reachable (Fig 1A). The target LED was lit for one second prior to an auditory go cue, at which time the subject would reach to the target at the appropriate speed. Slow, normal and fast reaches were allotted 3 s, 1.5s and 1s respectively; however, subjects determined the speed. An approximate total of 450 reaches were performed per subject. The subjects provided informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. EMG signals were measured from the pectoralis major, and the three deltoid muscles of the shoulder. This represents a small subset of the muscles involved in reaching, and approximates those muscles retaining some voluntary control following mid-level cervical spinal cord injuries. 2 The EMG signals were band-pass filtered between 10 and 1,000 Hz, and subsequently anti aliased filtered. Hand, wrist, shoulder and head positions were tracked using an Optotrak motion analysis system. We simultaneously recorded eye movements with an ASL EYETRAC-6 head mounted eye tracker. Approximately 25% of the reaches were assigned to the test set, and the rest were used for training. Reaches for which either the motion capture data was incomplete, or there was visible motion artifact on the EMG were removed. As the state we used hand positions and joint angles (3 shoulder, 2 elbow, position, velocity and acceleration, 24 dimensions). Joint angles were calculated from the shoulder and wrist marker data using digitized bony landmarks which defined a coordinate system for the upper limb as detailed by Wu et al. [16]. As the motion data were sampled at 60Hz, the mean absolute value o f the EMG in the corresponding 16.7ms windows was used as an observation of the state at each time-step. Algorithm accuracy was quantified by normalizing the root -mean-squared error by the straight line distance between the first and final position of the endpoint for each reach. We compared the algorithms statistically using repeated measures ANOVAs with Tukey post -hoc tests, treating reach and subject as random effects. In the rest of the paper we will ask how well these reaching movements can be decoded from EMG and eye-tracking data. Figure 1: A Experimental setup and B sample kinematics and processed EMGs for one reach 3 Kal man Fi l ters w i th Target i n f ormati on All models that we consider in this paper assume linear observations with Gaussian noise: (1) where x is the state, y is the observation and v is the measurement noise with p(v) ~ N(0,R), and R is the observation covariance matrix. The model fitted the measured EMGs with an average r2 of 0.55. This highlights the need to integrate information over time. The standard approach also assumes linear dynamics and Gaussian process noise: (2) where, x t represents the hand and joint angle positions, w is the process noise with p(w) ~ N(0,Q), and Q is the state covariance matrix. The Kalman filter does optimal inference for this generative model. This model can effectively capture the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to a single target by appropriately tuning its parameters. However, when used to describe reaches to multiple targets, the model cannot describe target dependent aspects of reaching but boils down to a random drift model. Fast velocities are underestimated as they are unlikely under the trajectory model and there is excessive drift close to the target (Fig. 2A). 3 In many decoding applications we may know the subject’s target. A range of recent studies have addressed the issue of incorporating this information into the trajectory model [8, 13], and we might assume the effect of the target on the dynamics to be linear. This naturally suggests adding the target to the state space, which works well in practice [9, 12]. By appending the target to the state vector (KFT), the simple linear format of the KF may be retained: (3) where xTt is the vector of target positions, with dimensionality less than or equal to that of xt. This trajectory model thus allows describing both the rapid acceleration that characterizes the beginning of a reach and the stabilization towards its end. We compared the accuracy of the KF and the KFT to the Single Target Model (STM), a KF trained only on reaches to the target being tested (Fig. 2). The STM represents the best possible prediction that could be obtained with a Kalman filter. Assuming the target is perfectly known, we implemented the KFT by correctly initializing the target state xT at the beginning of the reach. We will relax this assumption below. The initial hand and joint angle positions were also assumed to be known. Figure 2: A Sample reach and predictions and B average accuracies with standard errors for KFT, KF and MTM. Consistent with the recent literature, both methods that incorporated target information produced higher prediction accuracy than the standard KF (both p<0.0001). Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the KFT and the STM (p=0.9). It seems that when we have knowledge of the target, we do not lose much by training a single model over the whole workspace rather than modeling the targets individually. This is encouraging, as we desire a BMI system that can generalize to any target within the workspace, not just specifically to those that are available in the training data. Clearly, adding the target to the state space allows the dynamics of typical movements to be modeled effectively, resulting in dramatic increases in decoding performance. 4 Ti me Warp i n g 4.1 I m p l e m e n t i n g a t i m e - w a r p e d t r a j e c t o r y mo d e l While the KFT above can capture the general reach trajectory profile, it does not allow for natural variability in the speed of movements. Depending on our task objectives, which would not directly be observed by a BMI, we might lazily reach toward a target or move a t maximal speed. We aim to change the trajectory model to explicitly incorporate a warping factor by which the average movement speed is scaled, allowing for such variability. As the movement speed will be positive in all practical cases, we model the logarithm of this factor, 4 and append it to the state vector: (4) We create a time-warped trajectory model by noting that if the average rate of a trajectory is to be scaled by a factor S, the position at time t will equal that of the original trajectory at time St. Differentiating, the velocity will be multiplied by S, and the acceleration by S 2. For simplicity, the trajectory noise is assumed to be additive and Gaussian, and the model is assumed to be stationary: (5) where Ip is the p-dimensional identity matrix and is a p p matrix of zeros. Only the terms used to predict the acceleration states need to be estimated to build the state transition matrix, and they are scaled as a nonlinear function of xs. After adding the variable movement speed to the state space the system is no longer linear. Therefore we need a different solution strategy. Instead of the typical KFT we use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKFT) to implement a nonlinear trajectory model by linearizing the dynamics around the best estimate at each time-step [17]. With this approach we add only small computational overhead to the KFT recursions. 4.2 Tr a i n i n g t h e t i m e w a r p i n g mo d e l The filter parameters were trained using a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [18]. For extended Kalman filter learning the initialization for the variables may matter. S was initialized with the ground truth average reach speeds for each movement relative to the average speed across all movements. The state transition parameters were estimated using nonlinear least squares regression, while C, Q and R were estimated linearly for the new system, using the maximum likelihood solution [18] (M-step). For the E-step we used a standard extended Kalman smoother. We thus found the expected values for t he states given the current filter parameters. For this computation, and later when testing the algorithm, xs was initialized to its average value across all reaches while the remaining states were initialized to their true values. The smoothed estimate fo r xs was then used, along with the true values for the other states, to re-estimate the filter parameters in the M-step as before. We alternated between the E and M steps until the log likelihood converged (which it did in all cases). Following the training procedure, the diagonal of the state covariance matrix Q corresponding to xs was set to the variance of the smoothed xs over all reaches, according to how much this state should be allowed to change during prediction. This allowed the estimate of xs to develop over the course of the reach due to the evidence provided by the observations, better capturing the dynamics of reaches at different speeds. 4.3 P e r f o r ma n c e o f t h e t i m e - w a r p e d E K F T Incorporating time warping explicitly into the trajectory model pro duced a noticeable increase in decoding performance over the KFT. As the speed state xs is estimated throughout the course of the reach, based on the evidence provided by the observations, the trajectory model has the flexibility to follow the dynamics of the reach more accurately (Fig. 3). While at the normal self-selected speed the difference between the algorithms is small, for the slow and fast speeds, where the dynamics deviate from average, there i s a clear advantage to the time warping model. 5 Figure 3: Hand positions and predictions of the KFT and EKFT for sample reaches at A slow, B normal and C fast speeds. Note the different time scales between reaches. The models were first trained using data from all speeds (Fig. 4A). The EKFT was 1.8% more accurate on average (p<0.01), and the effect was significant at the slow (1.9%, p<0.05) and the fast (2.8%, p<0.01), but not at the normal (p=0.3) speed. We also trained the models from data using only reaches at the self-selected normal speed, as we wanted to see if there was enough variation to effectively train the EKFT (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the performance of the EKFT was reduced by only 0.6%, and the KFT by 1.1%. The difference in performance between the EKFT and KFT was even more pronounced on aver age (2.3%, p<0.001), and for the slow and fast speeds (3.6 and 4.1%, both p< 0.0001). At the normal speed, the algorithms again were not statistically different (p=0.6). This result demonstrates that the EKFT is a practical option for a real BMI system, as it is not necessary to greatly vary the speeds while collecting training data for the model to be effective over a wide range of intended speeds. Explicitly incorporating speed information into the trajectory model helps decoding, by modeling the natural variation in volitional speed. Figure 4: Mean and standard error of EKFT and KFT accuracy at the different subjectselected speeds. Models were trained on reaches at A all speeds and B just normal speed reaches. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the algorithms. 5 Mi xtu res of Target s So far, we have assumed that the targets of our reaches are perfectly known. In a real-world system, there will be uncertainty about the intended target of the reach. However, in typical applications there are a small number of possible objectives. Here we address this situation. Drawing on the recent literature, we use a mixture model to consider each of the possible targets [11, 13]. We condition the posterior probability for the state on the N possible targets, T: (6) 6 Using Bayes' Rule, this equation becomes: (7) As we are dealing with a mixture model, we perform the Kalman filter recursion for each possible target, xT, and our solution is a weighted sum of the outputs. The weights are proportional to the prior for that target, , and the likelihood of the model given that target . is independent of the target and does not need to be calculated. We tested mixtures of both algorithms, the mKFT and mEKFT, with real uncert ain priors obtained from eye-tracking in the one-second period preceding movement. As the targets were situated on two planes, the three-dimensional location of the eye gaze was found by projecting its direction onto those planes. The first, middle and last eye samples were selected, and all other samples were assigned to a group according to which of the three was closest. The mean and variance of these three groups were used to initialize three Kalman filters in the mixture model. The priors of the three groups were assigned proportional to the number of samples in them. If the subject looks at multiple positions prior to reaching, this method ensures with a high probability that the correct target was accounted for in one of the filters in the mixture. We also compared the MTM approach of Yu et al. [13], where a different KF model was generated for each target, and a mixture is performed over these models. This approach explicitly captures the dynamics of stereotypical reaches to specific targets. Given perfect target information, it would reduce to the STM described above. Priors for the MTM were found by assigning each valid eye sample to its closest two targets, and weighting the models proportional to the number of samples assigned to the corresponding target, divided by its distance from the mean of those samples. We tried other ways of assigning priors and the one presented gave the best results. We calculated the reduction in decoding quality when instead of perfect priors we provide eye-movement based noisy priors (Fig. 5). The accuracies of the mEKFT, the mKFT and the MTM were only degraded by 0.8, 1.9 and 2.1% respectively, compared to the perfect prior situation. The mEKFT was still close to 10% better than the KF. The mixture model framework is effective in accounting for uncertain priors. Figure 5: Mean and standard errors of accuracy for algorithms with perfect priors, and uncertain priors with full and partial training set. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant effects between the two training types, where real priors are used. Here, only reaches at normal speed were used to train the models, as this is a more realistic training set for a BMI application. This accounts for the degraded performance of the MTM with perfect priors relative to the STM from above (Fig. 2). With even more stereotyped training data for each target, the MTM doesn't generalize as well to new speeds. 7 We also wanted to know if the algorithms could generalize to new targets. In a real application, the available training data will generally not span the entire useable worksp ace. We compared the algorithms where reaches to all targets except the one being tested had been used to train the models. The performance of the MTM was significantly de graded unsurprisingly, as it was designed for reaches to a set of known targets. Performance of the mKFT and mEKFT degraded by about 1%, but not significantly (both p>0.7), demonstrating that the continuous approach to target information is preferable when the target could be anywhere in space, not just at locations for which training data is available. 6 Di scu ssi on and concl u si on s The goal of this work was to design a trajectory model that would improve decoding for BMIs with an application to reaching. We incorporated two features that prominently influence the dynamics of natural reach: the movement speed and the target location. Our approach is appropriate where uncertain target information is available. The model generalizes well to new regions of the workspace for which there is no training data, and across a broad range of reaching dynamics to widely spaced targets in three dimensions. The advantages over linear models in decoding precision we report here could be equally obtained using mixtures over many targets and speeds. While mixture models [11, 13] could allow for slow versus fast movements and any number of potential targets, this strategy will generally require many mixture components. Such an approach would require a lot more training data, as we have shown that it does not generalize well. It would also be run-time intensive which is problematic for prosthetic devices that rely on low power controllers. In contrast, the algorithm introduced here only takes a small amount of additional run-time in comparison to the standard KF approach. The EKF is only marginally slower than the standard KF and the algorithm will not generally need to consider more than 3 mixture components assuming the subject fixates the target within the second pre ceding the reach. In this paper we assumed that subjects always would fixate a reach target – along with other non-targets. While this is close to the way humans usually coordinate eyes and reaches [15], there might be cases where people do not fixate a reach target. Our approach could be easily extended to deal with such situations by adding a dummy mixture component that all ows the description of movements to any target. As an alternative to mixture approaches, a system can explicitly estimate the target position in the state vector [9]. This approach, however, would not straightforwardly allow for the rich target information available; we look at the target but also at other locations, strongly suggesting mixture distributions. A combination of the two approaches could further improve decoding quality. We could both estimate speed and target position for the EKFT in a continuous manner while retaining the mixture over target priors. We believe that the issues that we have addressed here are almost universal. Virtually all types of movements are executed at varying speed. A probabilistic distribution for a small number of action candidates may also be expected in most BMI applications – after all there are usually only a small number of actions that make sense in a given environment. While this work is presented in the context of decoding human reaching, it may be applied to a wide range of BMI applications including lower limb prosthetic devices and human computer interactions, as well as different signal sources such as electrode grid recordings and electroencephalograms. The increased user control in conveying their intended movements would significantly improve the functionality of a neuroprosthetic device.

<p>Author: Konrad Rawlik, Marc Toussaint, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on iterative local approximations present a practical approach to optimal control in robotic systems. However, they generally require the temporal parameters (for e.g. the movement duration or the time point of reaching an intermediate goal) to be speciﬁed a priori. Here, we present a methodology that is capable of jointly optimizing the temporal parameters in addition to the control command proﬁles. The presented approach is based on a Bayesian canonical time formulation of the optimal control problem, with the temporal mapping from canonical to real time parametrised by an additional control variable. An approximate EM algorithm is derived that efﬁciently optimizes both the movement duration and control commands offering, for the ﬁrst time, a practical approach to tackling generic via point problems in a systematic way under the optimal control framework. The proposed approach, which is applicable to plants with non-linear dynamics as well as arbitrary state dependent and quadratic control costs, is evaluated on realistic simulations of a redundant robotic plant.</p><p>4 0.55221903 <a title="57-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Attractor_Dynamics_with_Synaptic_Depression.html">34 nips-2010-Attractor Dynamics with Synaptic Depression</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, He Wang, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Neuronal connection weights exhibit short-term depression (STD). The present study investigates the impact of STD on the dynamics of a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) and its potential roles in neural information processing. We ﬁnd that the network with STD can generate both static and traveling bumps, and STD enhances the performance of the network in tracking external inputs. In particular, we ﬁnd that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau behaviors, namely, the network being initially stimulated to an active state will decay to silence very slowly in the time scale of STD rather than that of neural signaling. We argue that this provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold short-term memory easily and shut off persistent activities naturally.</p><p>5 0.54280037 <a title="57-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Functional_Geometry_Alignment_and_Localization_of_Brain_Areas.html">97 nips-2010-Functional Geometry Alignment and Localization of Brain Areas</a></p>
<p>Author: Georg Langs, Yanmei Tie, Laura Rigolo, Alexandra Golby, Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: Matching functional brain regions across individuals is a challenging task, largely due to the variability in their location and extent. It is particularly difﬁcult, but highly relevant, for patients with pathologies such as brain tumors, which can cause substantial reorganization of functional systems. In such cases spatial registration based on anatomical data is only of limited value if the goal is to establish correspondences of functional areas among different individuals, or to localize potentially displaced active regions. Rather than rely on spatial alignment, we propose to perform registration in an alternative space whose geometry is governed by the functional interaction patterns in the brain. We ﬁrst embed each brain into a functional map that reﬂects connectivity patterns during a fMRI experiment. The resulting functional maps are then registered, and the obtained correspondences are propagated back to the two brains. In application to a language fMRI experiment, our preliminary results suggest that the proposed method yields improved functional correspondences across subjects. This advantage is pronounced for subjects with tumors that affect the language areas and thus cause spatial reorganization of the functional regions. 1</p><p>6 0.50920296 <a title="57-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Individualized_ROI_Optimization_via_Maximization_of_Group-wise_Consistency_of_Structural_and_Functional_Profiles.html">123 nips-2010-Individualized ROI Optimization via Maximization of Group-wise Consistency of Structural and Functional Profiles</a></p>

<p>Author: Shinichi Nakajima, Masashi Sugiyama, Ryota Tomioka</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian methods of matrix factorization (MF) have been actively explored recently as promising alternatives to classical singular value decomposition. In this paper, we show that, despite the fact that the optimization problem is non-convex, the global optimal solution of variational Bayesian (VB) MF can be computed analytically by solving a quartic equation. This is highly advantageous over a popular VBMF algorithm based on iterated conditional modes since it can only ﬁnd a local optimal solution after iterations. We further show that the global optimal solution of empirical VBMF (hyperparameters are also learned from data) can also be analytically computed. We illustrate the usefulness of our results through experiments.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7041384 <a title="57-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Decoding_Ipsilateral_Finger_Movements_from_ECoG_Signals_in_Humans.html">57 nips-2010-Decoding Ipsilateral Finger Movements from ECoG Signals in Humans</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuzong Liu, Mohit Sharma, Charles Gaona, Jonathan Breshears, Jarod Roland, Zachary Freudenburg, Eric Leuthardt, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Several motor related Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been developed over the years that use activity decoded from the contralateral hemisphere to operate devices. Contralateral primary motor cortex is also the region most severely affected by hemispheric stroke. Recent studies have identiﬁed ipsilateral cortical activity in planning of motor movements and its potential implications for a stroke relevant BCI. The most fundamental functional loss after a hemispheric stroke is the loss of ﬁne motor control of the hand. Thus, whether ipsilateral cortex encodes ﬁnger movements is critical to the potential feasibility of BCI approaches in the future. This study uses ipsilateral cortical signals from humans (using ECoG) to decode ﬁnger movements. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, successful ﬁnger movement detection using machine learning algorithms. Our results show high decoding accuracies in all cases which are always above chance. We also show that signiﬁcant accuracies can be achieved with the use of only a fraction of all the features recorded and that these core features are consistent with previous physiological ﬁndings. The results of this study have substantial implications for advancing neuroprosthetic approaches to stroke populations not currently amenable to existing BCI techniques. 1</p><p>3 0.57919037 <a title="57-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Lower_Bounds_on_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Cutting_Plane_Methods.html">163 nips-2010-Lower Bounds on Rate of Convergence of Cutting Plane Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Ankan Saha, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: In a recent paper Joachims [1] presented SVM-Perf, a cutting plane method (CPM) for training linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which converges to an accurate solution in O(1/ 2 ) iterations. By tightening the analysis, Teo et al. [2] showed that O(1/ ) iterations sufﬁce. Given the impressive convergence speed of CPM on a number of practical problems, it was conjectured that these rates could be further improved. In this paper we disprove this conjecture. We present counter examples which are not only applicable for training linear SVMs with hinge loss, but also hold for support vector methods which optimize a multivariate performance score. However, surprisingly, these problems are not inherently hard. By exploiting the structure of the objective function we can devise an algo√ rithm that converges in O(1/ ) iterations. 1</p><p>4 0.49942142 <a title="57-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-The_Neural_Costs_of_Optimal_Control.html">268 nips-2010-The Neural Costs of Optimal Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Gershman, Robert Wilson</p><p>Abstract: Optimal control entails combining probabilities and utilities. However, for most practical problems, probability densities can be represented only approximately. Choosing an approximation requires balancing the beneﬁts of an accurate approximation against the costs of computing it. We propose a variational framework for achieving this balance and apply it to the problem of how a neural population code should optimally represent a distribution under resource constraints. The essence of our analysis is the conjecture that population codes are organized to maximize a lower bound on the log expected utility. This theory can account for a plethora of experimental data, including the reward-modulation of sensory receptive ﬁelds, GABAergic effects on saccadic movements, and risk aversion in decisions under uncertainty. 1</p><p>5 0.49827915 <a title="57-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Linear_readout_from_a_neural_population_with_partial_correlation_data.html">161 nips-2010-Linear readout from a neural population with partial correlation data</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Wohrer, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How much information does a neural population convey about a stimulus? Answers to this question are known to strongly depend on the correlation of response variability in neural populations. These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>6 0.49679387 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-More_data_means_less_inference%3A_A_pseudo-max_approach_to_structured_learning.html">169 nips-2010-More data means less inference: A pseudo-max approach to structured learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Miller, Nadya Bliss, Patrick J. Wolfe</p><p>Abstract: When working with network datasets, the theoretical framework of detection theory for Euclidean vector spaces no longer applies. Nevertheless, it is desirable to determine the detectability of small, anomalous graphs embedded into background networks with known statistical properties. Casting the problem of subgraph detection in a signal processing context, this article provides a framework and empirical results that elucidate a “detection theory” for graph-valued data. Its focus is the detection of anomalies in unweighted, undirected graphs through L1 properties of the eigenvectors of the graph’s so-called modularity matrix. This metric is observed to have relatively low variance for certain categories of randomly-generated graphs, and to reveal the presence of an anomalous subgraph with reasonable reliability when the anomaly is not well-correlated with stronger portions of the background graph. An analysis of subgraphs in real network datasets conﬁrms the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>3 0.12610422 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Practical_Large-Scale_Optimization_for_Max-norm_Regularization.html">210 nips-2010-Practical Large-Scale Optimization for Max-norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ben Recht, Nathan Srebro, Joel Tropp, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: The max-norm was proposed as a convex matrix regularizer in [1] and was shown to be empirically superior to the trace-norm for collaborative ﬁltering problems. Although the max-norm can be computed in polynomial time, there are currently no practical algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems that incorporate the max-norm. The present work uses a factorization technique of Burer and Monteiro [2] to devise scalable ﬁrst-order algorithms for convex programs involving the max-norm. These algorithms are applied to solve huge collaborative ﬁltering, graph cut, and clustering problems. Empirically, the new methods outperform mature techniques from all three areas. 1</p><p>4 0.11547282 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_graph-structured_activation_patterns_in_networks.html">117 nips-2010-Identifying graph-structured activation patterns in networks</a></p>
<p>Author: James Sharpnack, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying an activation pattern in a complex, largescale network that is embedded in very noisy measurements. This problem is relevant to several applications, such as identifying traces of a biochemical spread by a sensor network, expression levels of genes, and anomalous activity or congestion in the Internet. Extracting such patterns is a challenging task specially if the network is large (pattern is very high-dimensional) and the noise is so excessive that it masks the activity at any single node. However, typically there are statistical dependencies in the network activation process that can be leveraged to fuse the measurements of multiple nodes and enable reliable extraction of highdimensional noisy patterns. In this paper, we analyze an estimator based on the graph Laplacian eigenbasis, and establish the limits of mean square error recovery of noisy patterns arising from a probabilistic (Gaussian or Ising) model based on an arbitrary graph structure. We consider both deterministic and probabilistic network evolution models, and our results indicate that by leveraging the network interaction structure, it is possible to consistently recover high-dimensional patterns even when the noise variance increases with network size. 1</p><p>5 0.11284638 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Property-Based_Classification_of_Clustering_Paradigms.html">273 nips-2010-Towards Property-Based Classification of Clustering Paradigms</a></p>
<p>Author: Margareta Ackerman, Shai Ben-David, David Loker</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a basic data mining task with a wide variety of applications. Not surprisingly, there exist many clustering algorithms. However, clustering is an ill deﬁned problem - given a data set, it is not clear what a “correct” clustering for that set is. Indeed, different algorithms may yield dramatically different outputs for the same input sets. Faced with a concrete clustering task, a user needs to choose an appropriate clustering algorithm. Currently, such decisions are often made in a very ad hoc, if not completely random, manner. Given the crucial effect of the choice of a clustering algorithm on the resulting clustering, this state of affairs is truly regrettable. In this paper we address the major research challenge of developing tools for helping users make more informed decisions when they come to pick a clustering tool for their data. This is, of course, a very ambitious endeavor, and in this paper, we make some ﬁrst steps towards this goal. We propose to address this problem by distilling abstract properties of the input-output behavior of different clustering paradigms. In this paper, we demonstrate how abstract, intuitive properties of clustering functions can be used to taxonomize a set of popular clustering algorithmic paradigms. On top of addressing deterministic clustering algorithms, we also propose similar properties for randomized algorithms and use them to highlight functional differences between different common implementations of k-means clustering. We also study relationships between the properties, independent of any particular algorithm. In particular, we strengthen Kleinberg’s famous impossibility result, while providing a simpler proof. 1</p><p>6 0.10847744 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ali Shojaie, George Michailidis</p><p>Abstract: Network models are widely used to capture interactions among component of complex systems, such as social and biological. To understand their behavior, it is often necessary to analyze functionally related components of the system, corresponding to subsystems. Therefore, the analysis of subnetworks may provide additional insight into the behavior of the system, not evident from individual components. We propose a novel approach for incorporating available network information into the analysis of arbitrary subnetworks. The proposed method offers an efﬁcient dimension reduction strategy using Laplacian eigenmaps with Neumann boundary conditions, and provides a ﬂexible inference framework for analysis of subnetworks, based on a group-penalized principal component regression model on graphs. Asymptotic properties of the proposed inference method, as well as the choice of the tuning parameter for control of the false positive rate are discussed in high dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated using simulated and real data examples from biology. 1</p><p>4 0.55198449 <a title="30-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Getting_lost_in_space%3A_Large_sample_analysis_of_the_resistance_distance.html">105 nips-2010-Getting lost in space: Large sample analysis of the resistance distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike V. Luxburg, Agnes Radl, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: The commute distance between two vertices in a graph is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from the ﬁrst to the second vertex and back. We study the behavior of the commute distance as the size of the underlying graph increases. We prove that the commute distance converges to an expression that does not take into account the structure of the graph at all and that is completely meaningless as a distance function on the graph. Consequently, the use of the raw commute distance for machine learning purposes is strongly discouraged for large graphs and in high dimensions. As an alternative we introduce the ampliﬁed commute distance that corrects for the undesired large sample effects. 1</p><p>5 0.52599096 <a title="30-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_graph-structured_activation_patterns_in_networks.html">117 nips-2010-Identifying graph-structured activation patterns in networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Jose Puertas, Joerg Bornschein, Joerg Luecke</p><p>Abstract: We study the application of a strongly non-linear generative model to image patches. As in standard approaches such as Sparse Coding or Independent Component Analysis, the model assumes a sparse prior with independent hidden variables. However, in the place where standard approaches use the sum to combine basis functions we use the maximum. To derive tractable approximations for parameter estimation we apply a novel approach based on variational Expectation Maximization. The derived learning algorithm can be applied to large-scale problems with hundreds of observed and hidden variables. Furthermore, we can infer all model parameters including observation noise and the degree of sparseness. In applications to image patches we ﬁnd that Gabor-like basis functions are obtained. Gabor-like functions are thus not a feature exclusive to approaches assuming linear superposition. Quantitatively, the inferred basis functions show a large diversity of shapes with many strongly elongated and many circular symmetric functions. The distribution of basis function shapes reﬂects properties of simple cell receptive ﬁelds that are not reproduced by standard linear approaches. In the study of natural image statistics, the implications of using different superposition assumptions have so far not been investigated systematically because models with strong non-linearities have been found analytically and computationally challenging. The presented algorithm represents the ﬁrst large-scale application of such an approach. 1</p><p>3 0.66866618 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-The_Neural_Costs_of_Optimal_Control.html">268 nips-2010-The Neural Costs of Optimal Control</a></p>

Choosing an approximation requires balancing the beneﬁts of an accurate approximation against the costs of computing it. We propose a variational framework for achieving this balance and apply it to the problem of how a neural population code should optimally represent a distribution under resource constraints. The essence of our analysis is the conjecture that population codes are organized to maximize a lower bound on the log expected utility. This theory can account for a plethora of experimental data, including the reward-modulation of sensory receptive ﬁelds, GABAergic effects on saccadic movements, and risk aversion in decisions under uncertainty. 1</p><p>4 0.66550815 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Direct_Loss_Minimization_for_Structured_Prediction.html">61 nips-2010-Direct Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Joseph Keshet, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: In discriminative machine learning one is interested in training a system to optimize a certain desired measure of performance, or loss. In binary classiﬁcation one typically tries to minimizes the error rate. But in structured prediction each task often has its own measure of performance such as the BLEU score in machine translation or the intersection-over-union score in PASCAL segmentation. The most common approaches to structured prediction, structural SVMs and CRFs, do not minimize the task loss: the former minimizes a surrogate loss with no guarantees for task loss and the latter minimizes log loss independent of task loss. The main contribution of this paper is a theorem stating that a certain perceptronlike learning rule, involving features vectors derived from loss-adjusted inference, directly corresponds to the gradient of task loss. We give empirical results on phonetic alignment of a standard test set from the TIMIT corpus, which surpasses all previously reported results on this problem. 1</p><p>5 0.61650884 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Random_Walk_Approach_to_Regret_Minimization.html">222 nips-2010-Random Walk Approach to Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hariharan Narayanan, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a computationally efﬁcient random walk on a convex body which rapidly mixes to a time-varying Gibbs distribution. In the setting of online convex optimization and repeated games, the algorithm yields low regret and presents a novel efﬁcient method for implementing mixture forecasting strategies. 1</p><p>6 0.61372972 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Rina Foygel, Mathias Drton</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian graphical models with sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix are of signiﬁcant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n. 1</p><p>3 0.093696415 <a title="154-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Multiple_Kernel_Learning_and_the_SMO_Algorithm.html">176 nips-2010-Multiple Kernel Learning and the SMO Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhaonan Sun, Nawanol Ampornpunt, Manik Varma, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: Our objective is to train p-norm Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and, more generally, linear MKL regularised by the Bregman divergence, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. The SMO algorithm is simple, easy to implement and adapt, and efﬁciently scales to large problems. As a result, it has gained widespread acceptance and SVMs are routinely trained using SMO in diverse real world applications. Training using SMO has been a long standing goal in MKL for the very same reasons. Unfortunately, the standard MKL dual is not differentiable, and therefore can not be optimised using SMO style co-ordinate ascent.

The resulting algorithm retains both simplicity and efﬁciency and is signiﬁcantly faster than state-of-the-art specialised p-norm MKL solvers.

<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>5 0.075533375 <a title="154-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Multi-label_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_by_Stochastic_Approximation%3A_Application_to_Visual_Object_Recognition.html">174 nips-2010-Multi-label Multiple Kernel Learning by Stochastic Approximation: Application to Visual Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Serhat Bucak, Rong Jin, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that multiple kernel learning is very effective for object recognition, leading to the popularity of kernel learning in computer vision problems. In this work, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for multi-label multiple kernel learning (ML-MKL). We assume that all the classes under consideration share the same combination of kernel functions, and the objective is to ﬁnd the optimal kernel combination that beneﬁts all the classes. Although several algorithms have been developed for ML-MKL, their computational cost is linear in the number of classes, making them unscalable when the number of classes is large, a challenge frequently encountered in visual object recognition. We address this computational challenge by developing a framework for ML-MKL that combines the worst-case analysis with stochastic approximation. Our analysis √ shows that the complexity of our algorithm is O(m1/3 lnm), where m is the number of classes. Empirical studies with object recognition show that while achieving similar classiﬁcation accuracy, the proposed method is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the state-of-the-art algorithms for ML-MKL. 1</p><p>6 0.070371479 <a title="154-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Danny Bickson, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions naturally occur in many real life problems. Unfortunately, it is typically not possible to compute inference in closed-form in graphical models which involve such heavy-tailed distributions. In this work, we propose a novel simple linear graphical model for independent latent random variables, called linear characteristic model (LCM), defined in the characteristic function domain. Using stable distributions, a heavy-tailed family of distributions which is a generalization of Cauchy, L´ vy and Gaussian distrie butions, we show for the first time, how to compute both exact and approximate inference in such a linear multivariate graphical model. LCMs are not limited to stable distributions, in fact LCMs are always defined for any random variables (discrete, continuous or a mixture of both). We provide a realistic problem from the field of computer networks to demonstrate the applicability of our construction. Other potential application is iterative decoding of linear channels with non-Gaussian noise. 1</p><p>3 0.64233536 <a title="154-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural ﬁring rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron sufﬁces to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the online approximation of signals with a sum of powerlaw kernels is beneﬁcial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>4 0.5876562 <a title="154-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Fast_global_convergence_rates_of_gradient_methods_for_high-dimensional_statistical_recovery.html">92 nips-2010-Fast global convergence rates of gradient methods for high-dimensional statistical recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical M -estimators are based on convex optimization problems formed by the weighted sum of a loss function with a norm-based regularizer. We analyze the convergence rates of ﬁrst-order gradient methods for solving such problems within a high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension d to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size n. This high-dimensional structure precludes the usual global assumptions— namely, strong convexity and smoothness conditions—that underlie classical optimization analysis. We deﬁne appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that they are satisﬁed with high probability for various statistical models. Under these conditions, our theory guarantees that Nesterov’s ﬁrst-order method [12] has a globally geometric rate of convergence up to the statistical precision of the model, meaning the typical Euclidean distance between the true unknown parameter θ∗ and the optimal solution θ. This globally linear rate is substantially faster than previous analyses of global convergence for speciﬁc methods that yielded only sublinear rates. Our analysis applies to a wide range of M -estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear regression using Lasso ( 1 regularized regression), group Lasso, block sparsity, and low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization. Overall, this result reveals an interesting connection between statistical precision and computational eﬃciency in high-dimensional estimation. 1</p><p>5 0.58743745 <a title="154-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Structured_Determinantal_Point_Processes.html">257 nips-2010-Structured Determinantal Point Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Kulesza, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic model for distributions over sets of structures— for example, sets of sequences, trees, or graphs. The critical characteristic of our model is a preference for diversity: sets containing dissimilar structures are more likely. Our model is a marriage of structured probabilistic models, like Markov random ﬁelds and context free grammars, with determinantal point processes, which arise in quantum physics as models of particles with repulsive interactions. We extend the determinantal point process model to handle an exponentially-sized set of particles (structures) via a natural factorization of the model into parts. We show how this factorization leads to tractable algorithms for exact inference, including computing marginals, computing conditional probabilities, and sampling. Our algorithms exploit a novel polynomially-sized dual representation of determinantal point processes, and use message passing over a special semiring to compute relevant quantities. We illustrate the advantages of the model on tracking and articulated pose estimation problems. 1</p><p>6 0.58692575 <a title="154-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-The_LASSO_risk%3A_asymptotic_results_and_real_world_examples.html">265 nips-2010-The LASSO risk: asymptotic results and real world examples</a></p>

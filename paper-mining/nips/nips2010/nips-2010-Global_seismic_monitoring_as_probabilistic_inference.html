<p>Author: Leonid Karlinsky, Michael Dinerstein, Shimon Ullman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to the visual recognition of human actions using only single images as input. The task is easy for humans but difficult for current approaches to object recognition, because instances of different actions may be similar in terms of body pose, and often require detailed examination of relations between participating objects and body parts in order to be recognized. The proposed approach applies a two-stage interpretation procedure to each training and test image. The first stage produces accurate detection of the relevant body parts of the actor, forming a prior for the local evidence needed to be considered for identifying the action. The second stage extracts features that are anchored to the detected body parts, and uses these features and their feature-to-part relations in order to recognize the action. The body anchored priors we propose apply to a large range of human actions. These priors allow focusing on the relevant regions and relations, thereby significantly simplifying the learning process and increasing recognition performance. 1</p><p>3 0.089358956 <a title="107-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>4 0.085723139 <a title="107-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-An_Alternative_to_Low-level-Sychrony-Based_Methods_for_Speech_Detection.html">28 nips-2010-An Alternative to Low-level-Sychrony-Based Methods for Speech Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Paul L. Ruvolo</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether someone is talking has applications in many areas such as speech recognition, speaker diarization, social robotics, facial expression recognition, and human computer interaction. One popular approach to this problem is audio-visual synchrony detection [10, 21, 12]. A candidate speaker is deemed to be talking if the visual signal around that speaker correlates with the auditory signal. Here we show that with the proper visual features (in this case movements of various facial muscle groups), a very accurate detector of speech can be created that does not use the audio signal at all. Further we show that this person independent visual-only detector can be used to train very accurate audio-based person dependent voice models. The voice model has the advantage of being able to identify when a particular person is speaking even when they are not visible to the camera (e.g. in the case of a mobile robot). Moreover, we show that a simple sensory fusion scheme between the auditory and visual models improves performance on the task of talking detection. The work here provides dramatic evidence about the efﬁcacy of two very different approaches to multimodal speech detection on a challenging database. 1</p><p>5 0.083853744 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many machine learning domains (such as scene understanding), several related sub-tasks (such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection) operate on the same raw data and provide correlated outputs. Each of these tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classiﬁers already exist for many subtasks. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classiﬁer. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (FE-CCM), that maximizes the joint likelihood of the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classiﬁer for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classiﬁers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the ﬁrst layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classiﬁers to provide earlier classiﬁers information about what error modes to focus on. We show that our method signiﬁcantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in two different domains: (i) scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection, and (ii) robotic grasping, where we consider grasp point detection and object classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.075218827 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Stella X. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Size, color, and orientation have long been considered elementary features whose attributes are extracted in parallel and available to guide the deployment of attention. If each is processed in the same fashion with simply a different set of local detectors, one would expect similar search behaviours on localizing an equivalent ﬂickering change among identically laid out disks. We analyze feature transitions associated with saccadic search and ﬁnd out that size, color, and orientation are not alike in dynamic attribute processing over time. The Markovian feature transition is attractive for size, repulsive for color, and largely reversible for orientation. 1</p><p>6 0.52011168 <a title="107-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Subgraph_Detection_Using_Eigenvector_L1_Norms.html">259 nips-2010-Subgraph Detection Using Eigenvector L1 Norms</a></p>

<p>Author: William Brendel, Sinisa Todorovic</p><p>Abstract: Given an ensemble of distinct, low-level segmentations of an image, our goal is to identify visually “meaningful” segments in the ensemble. Knowledge about any speciﬁc objects and surfaces present in the image is not available. The selection of image regions occupied by objects is formalized as the maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem. MWIS is the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent nodes of an attributed graph. We construct such a graph from all segments in the ensemble. Then, MWIS selects maximally distinctive segments that together partition the image. A new MWIS algorithm is presented. The algorithm seeks a solution directly in the discrete domain, instead of relaxing MWIS to a continuous problem, as common in previous work. It iteratively ﬁnds a candidate discrete solution of the Taylor series expansion of the original MWIS objective function around the previous solution. The algorithm is shown to converge to an optimum. Our empirical evaluation on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset shows that the new algorithm eliminates the need for hand-picking optimal input parameters of the state-of-the-art segmenters, and outperforms their best, manually optimized results.</p><p>3 0.61151981 <a title="107-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Worst-Case_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis.html">287 nips-2010-Worst-Case Linear Discriminant Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Zhang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is often needed in many applications due to the high dimensionality of the data involved. In this paper, we ďŹ rst analyze the scatter measures used in the conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model and note that the formulation is based on the average-case view. Based on this analysis, we then propose a new dimensionality reduction method called worst-case linear discriminant analysis (WLDA) by deďŹ ning new between-class and within-class scatter measures. This new model adopts the worst-case view which arguably is more suitable for applications such as classiďŹ cation. When the number of training data points or the number of features is not very large, we relax the optimization problem involved and formulate it as a metric learning problem. Otherwise, we take a greedy approach by ďŹ nding one direction of the transformation at a time. Moreover, we also analyze a special case of WLDA to show its relationship with conventional LDA. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WLDA when compared with some related dimensionality reduction methods. 1</p><p>4 0.5994212 <a title="107-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive_Embedding_by_Nonlinear_NCA_Regression.html">209 nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive Embedding by Nonlinear NCA Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, George Williams, Ian Spiro, Christoph Bregler, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the complex problem of visually matching people in similar pose but with different clothes, background, and other appearance changes. We achieve this with a novel method for learning a nonlinear embedding based on several extensions to the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) framework. Our method is convolutional, enabling it to scale to realistically-sized images. By cheaply labeling the head and hands in large video databases through Amazon Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing service), we can use the task of localizing the head and hands as a proxy for determining body pose. We apply our method to challenging real-world data and show that it can generalize beyond hand localization to infer a more general notion of body pose. We evaluate our method quantitatively against other embedding methods. We also demonstrate that realworld performance can be improved through the use of synthetic data. 1</p><p>5 0.58355397 <a title="107-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Gergely Neu, Andras Antos, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider online learning in ﬁnite stochastic Markovian environments where in each time step a new reward function is chosen by an oblivious adversary. The goal of the learning agent is to compete with the best stationary policy in terms of the total reward received. In each time step the agent observes the current state and the reward associated with the last transition, however, the agent does not observe the rewards associated with other state-action pairs. The agent is assumed to know the transition probabilities. The state of the art result for this setting is a no-regret algorithm. In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm and, assuming that stationary policies mix uniformly fast, we show that after T time steps, the expected regret of the new algorithm is O T 2/3 (ln T )1/3 , giving the ﬁrst rigorously proved regret bound for the problem. 1</p><p>6 0.55903989 <a title="107-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

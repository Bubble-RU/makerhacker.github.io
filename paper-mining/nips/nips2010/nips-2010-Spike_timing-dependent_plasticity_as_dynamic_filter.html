<p>Author: Nicholas Fisher, Arunava Banerjee</p><p>Abstract: From a functional viewpoint, a spiking neuron is a device that transforms input spike trains on its various synapses into an output spike train on its axon. We demonstrate in this paper that the function mapping underlying the device can be tractably learned based on input and output spike train data alone. We begin by posing the problem in a classiﬁcation based framework. We then derive a novel kernel for an SRM0 model that is based on PSP and AHP like functions. With the kernel we demonstrate how the learning problem can be posed as a Quadratic Program. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our approach. 1</p><p>3 0.2578918 <a title="253-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural ﬁring rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron sufﬁces to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the online approximation of signals with a sum of powerlaw kernels is beneﬁcial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>4 0.20607403 <a title="253-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing? On goodness-of-fit procedures for point process models and Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Gerhard, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an increasingly popular framework for modeling neural spike trains. They have been linked to the theory of stochastic point processes and researchers have used this relation to assess goodness-of-ﬁt using methods from point-process theory, e.g. the time-rescaling theorem. However, high neural ﬁring rates or coarse discretization lead to a breakdown of the assumptions necessary for this connection. Here, we show how goodness-of-ﬁt tests from point-process theory can still be applied to GLMs by constructing equivalent surrogate point processes out of time-series observations. Furthermore, two additional tests based on thinning and complementing point processes are introduced. They augment the instruments available for checking model adequacy of point processes as well as discretized models. 1</p><p>5 0.18351835 <a title="253-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-A_VLSI_Implementation_of_the_Adaptive_Exponential_Integrate-and-Fire_Neuron_Model.html">16 nips-2010-A VLSI Implementation of the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Sylvain Chevallier, Hél\`ene Paugam-moisy, Michele Sebag</p><p>Abstract: Many complex systems, ranging from neural cell assemblies to insect societies, involve and rely on some division of labor. How to enforce such a division in a decentralized and distributed way, is tackled in this paper, using a spiking neuron network architecture. Speciﬁcally, a spatio-temporal model called SpikeAnts is shown to enforce the emergence of synchronized activities in an ant colony. Each ant is modelled from two spiking neurons; the ant colony is a sparsely connected spiking neuron network. Each ant makes its decision (among foraging, sleeping and self-grooming) from the competition between its two neurons, after the signals received from its neighbor ants. Interestingly, three types of temporal patterns emerge in the ant colony: asynchronous, synchronous, and synchronous periodic foraging activities − similar to the actual behavior of some living ant colonies. A phase diagram of the emergent activity patterns with respect to two control parameters, respectively accounting for ant sociability and receptivity, is presented and discussed. 1</p><p>4 0.83099645 <a title="253-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Katherine Demuth, Bevan Jones, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Bayesian non-parametric models that simultaneously learn to segment words from phoneme strings and learn the referents of some of those words, and shows that there is a synergistic interaction in the acquisition of these two kinds of linguistic information. The models themselves are novel kinds of Adaptor Grammars that are an extension of an embedding of topic models into PCFGs. These models simultaneously segment phoneme sequences into words and learn the relationship between non-linguistic objects to the words that refer to them. We show (i) that modelling inter-word dependencies not only improves the accuracy of the word segmentation but also of word-object relationships, and (ii) that a model that simultaneously learns word-object relationships and word segmentation segments more accurately than one that just learns word segmentation on its own. We argue that these results support an interactive view of language acquisition that can take advantage of synergies such as these. 1</p><p>3 0.48534673 <a title="253-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Latent_Variable_Models_for_Predicting_File_Dependencies_in_Large-Scale_Software_Development.html">139 nips-2010-Latent Variable Models for Predicting File Dependencies in Large-Scale Software Development</a></p>
<p>Author: Diane Hu, Laurens Maaten, Youngmin Cho, Sorin Lerner, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: When software developers modify one or more ﬁles in a large code base, they must also identify and update other related ﬁles. Many ﬁle dependencies can be detected by mining the development history of the code base: in essence, groups of related ﬁles are revealed by the logs of previous workﬂows. From data of this form, we show how to detect dependent ﬁles by solving a problem in binary matrix completion. We explore different latent variable models (LVMs) for this problem, including Bernoulli mixture models, exponential family PCA, restricted Boltzmann machines, and fully Bayesian approaches. We evaluate these models on the development histories of three large, open-source software systems: Mozilla Firefox, Eclipse Subversive, and Gimp. In all of these applications, we ﬁnd that LVMs improve the performance of related ﬁle prediction over current leading methods. 1</p><p>4 0.3677353 <a title="253-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Multivariate_Dyadic_Regression_Trees_for_Sparse_Learning_Problems.html">178 nips-2010-Multivariate Dyadic Regression Trees for Sparse Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric learning method based on multivariate dyadic regression trees (MDRTs). Unlike traditional dyadic decision trees (DDTs) or classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs), MDRTs are constructed using penalized empirical risk minimization with a novel sparsity-inducing penalty. Theoretically, we show that MDRTs can simultaneously adapt to the unknown sparsity and smoothness of the true regression functions, and achieve the nearly optimal rates of convergence (in a minimax sense) for the class of (α, C)-smooth functions. Empirically, MDRTs can simultaneously conduct function estimation and variable selection in high dimensions. To make MDRTs applicable for large-scale learning problems, we propose a greedy heuristics. The superior performance of MDRTs are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.36755109 <a title="253-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>
<p>Author: Kritika Muralidharan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justiﬁcation for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classiﬁcation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems. 1</p><p>6 0.36600834 <a title="253-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Bayesian_Framework_for_Figure-Ground_Interpretation.html">3 nips-2010-A Bayesian Framework for Figure-Ground Interpretation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Strehl, John Langford, Lihong Li, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a sound and consistent foundation for the use of nonrandom exploration data in “contextual bandit” or “partially labeled” settings where only the value of a chosen action is learned. The primary challenge in a variety of settings is that the exploration policy, in which “ofﬂine” data is logged, is not explicitly known. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during the learning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in a repeated manner. The techniques reported here lift these restrictions, allowing the learning of a policy for choosing actions given features from historical data where no randomization occurred or was logged.

<p>Author: Tang Jie, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: Likelihood ratio policy gradient methods have been some of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for learning on physical systems. We describe how the likelihood ratio policy gradient can be derived from an importance sampling perspective. This derivation highlights how likelihood ratio methods under-use past experience by (i) using the past experience to estimate only the gradient of the expected return U (θ) at the current policy parameterization θ, rather than to obtain a more complete estimate of U (θ), and (ii) using past experience under the current policy only rather than using all past experience to improve the estimates. We present a new policy search method, which leverages both of these observations as well as generalized baselines—a new technique which generalizes commonly used baseline techniques for policy gradient methods. Our algorithm outperforms standard likelihood ratio policy gradient algorithms on several testbeds. 1</p><p>5 0.21534577 <a title="201-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Gergely Neu, Andras Antos, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider online learning in ﬁnite stochastic Markovian environments where in each time step a new reward function is chosen by an oblivious adversary. The goal of the learning agent is to compete with the best stationary policy in terms of the total reward received. In each time step the agent observes the current state and the reward associated with the last transition, however, the agent does not observe the rewards associated with other state-action pairs. The agent is assumed to know the transition probabilities. The state of the art result for this setting is a no-regret algorithm. In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm and, assuming that stationary policies mix uniformly fast, we show that after T time steps, the expected regret of the new algorithm is O T 2/3 (ln T )1/3 , giving the ﬁrst rigorously proved regret bound for the problem. 1</p><p>6 0.19568561 <a title="201-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Error_Propagation_for_Approximate_Policy_and_Value_Iteration.html">78 nips-2010-Error Propagation for Approximate Policy and Value Iteration</a></p>

<p>Author: Umar Syed, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We provide new theoretical results for apprenticeship learning, a variant of reinforcement learning in which the true reward function is unknown, and the goal is to perform well relative to an observed expert. We study a common approach to learning from expert demonstrations: using a classiﬁcation algorithm to learn to imitate the expert’s behavior. Although this straightforward learning strategy is widely-used in practice, it has been subject to very little formal analysis. We prove that, if the learned classiﬁer has error rate ǫ, the difference between the √ value of the apprentice’s policy and the expert’s policy is O( ǫ). Further, we prove that this difference is only O(ǫ) when the expert’s policy is close to optimal. This latter result has an important practical consequence: Not only does imitating a near-optimal expert result in a better policy, but far fewer demonstrations are required to successfully imitate such an expert. This suggests an opportunity for substantial savings whenever the expert is known to be good, but demonstrations are expensive or difﬁcult to obtain. 1</p><p>5 0.76011246 <a title="201-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Markov_Decision_Processes_under_Bandit_Feedback.html">196 nips-2010-Online Markov Decision Processes under Bandit Feedback</a></p>

However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world.

<p>Author: Ken Takiyama, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: 019 020 We propose an algorithm for simultaneously estimating state transitions among neural states, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates using a switching state space model (SSSM). This algorithm enables us to detect state transitions on the basis of not only the discontinuous changes of mean ﬁring rates but also discontinuous changes in temporal proﬁles of ﬁring rates, e.g., temporal correlation. We construct a variational Bayes algorithm for a non-Gaussian SSSM whose non-Gaussian property is caused by binary spike events. Synthetic data analysis reveals that our algorithm has the high performance for estimating state transitions, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates compared to previous methods. We also analyze neural data that were recorded from the medial temporal area. The statistically detected neural states probably coincide with transient and sustained states that have been detected heuristically. Estimated parameters suggest that our algorithm detects the state transition on the basis of discontinuous changes in the temporal correlation of ﬁring rates, which transitions previous methods cannot detect. This result suggests that our algorithm is advantageous in real-data analysis. 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053</p><p>3 0.98689985 <a title="201-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition.html">143 nips-2010-Learning Convolutional Feature Hierarchies for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pierre Sermanet, Y-lan Boureau, Karol Gregor, Michael Mathieu, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for learning multi-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting ﬁlters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efﬁciency of the overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efﬁcient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasisparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse ﬁlters, including center-surround ﬁlters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these ﬁlters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.97138017 <a title="201-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many machine learning domains (such as scene understanding), several related sub-tasks (such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection) operate on the same raw data and provide correlated outputs. Each of these tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classiﬁers already exist for many subtasks. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classiﬁer. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (FE-CCM), that maximizes the joint likelihood of the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classiﬁer for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classiﬁers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the ﬁrst layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classiﬁers to provide earlier classiﬁers information about what error modes to focus on. We show that our method signiﬁcantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in two different domains: (i) scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection, and (ii) robotic grasping, where we consider grasp point detection and object classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.96038663 <a title="201-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Worst-case_bounds_on_the_quality_of_max-product_fixed-points.html">288 nips-2010-Worst-case bounds on the quality of max-product fixed-points</a></p>
<p>Author: Meritxell Vinyals, Jes\'us Cerquides, Alessandro Farinelli, Juan A. Rodríguez-aguilar</p><p>Abstract: We study worst-case bounds on the quality of any ﬁxed point assignment of the max-product algorithm for Markov Random Fields (MRF). We start providing a bound independent of the MRF structure and parameters. Afterwards, we show how this bound can be improved for MRFs with speciﬁc structures such as bipartite graphs or grids. Our results provide interesting insight into the behavior of max-product. For example, we prove that max-product provides very good results (at least 90% optimal) on MRFs with large variable-disjoint cycles1 . 1</p><p>6 0.95866996 <a title="201-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>

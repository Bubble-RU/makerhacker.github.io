<p>Author: Tian Lan, Yang Wang, Weilong Yang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative model for recognizing group activities. Our model jointly captures the group activity, the individual person actions, and the interactions among them. Two new types of contextual information, group-person interaction and person-person interaction, are explored in a latent variable framework. Different from most of the previous latent structured models which assume a predeﬁned structure for the hidden layer, e.g. a tree structure, we treat the structure of the hidden layer as a latent variable and implicitly infer it during learning and inference. Our experimental results demonstrate that by inferring this contextual information together with adaptive structures, the proposed model can signiﬁcantly improve activity recognition performance. 1</p><p>3 0.1578345 <a title="28-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Inference_and_communication_in_the_game_of_Password.html">125 nips-2010-Inference and communication in the game of Password</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Xu, Charles Kemp</p><p>Abstract: Communication between a speaker and hearer will be most efﬁcient when both parties make accurate inferences about the other. We study inference and communication in a television game called Password, where speakers must convey secret words to hearers by providing one-word clues. Our working hypothesis is that human communication is relatively efﬁcient, and we use game show data to examine three predictions. First, we predict that speakers and hearers are both considerate, and that both take the other’s perspective into account. Second, we predict that speakers and hearers are calibrated, and that both make accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other. Finally, we predict that speakers and hearers are collaborative, and that they tend to share the cognitive burden of communication equally. We ﬁnd evidence in support of all three predictions, and demonstrate in addition that efﬁcient communication tends to break down when speakers and hearers are placed under time pressure.</p><p>4 0.1452252 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Using_body-anchored_priors_for_identifying_actions_in_single_images.html">281 nips-2010-Using body-anchored priors for identifying actions in single images</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Karlinsky, Michael Dinerstein, Shimon Ullman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to the visual recognition of human actions using only single images as input. The task is easy for humans but difficult for current approaches to object recognition, because instances of different actions may be similar in terms of body pose, and often require detailed examination of relations between participating objects and body parts in order to be recognized. The proposed approach applies a two-stage interpretation procedure to each training and test image. The first stage produces accurate detection of the relevant body parts of the actor, forming a prior for the local evidence needed to be considered for identifying the action. The second stage extracts features that are anchored to the detected body parts, and uses these features and their feature-to-part relations in order to recognize the action. The body anchored priors we propose apply to a large range of human actions. These priors allow focusing on the relevant regions and relations, thereby significantly simplifying the learning process and increasing recognition performance. 1</p><p>5 0.11405811 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive_Embedding_by_Nonlinear_NCA_Regression.html">209 nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive Embedding by Nonlinear NCA Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, George Williams, Ian Spiro, Christoph Bregler, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the complex problem of visually matching people in similar pose but with different clothes, background, and other appearance changes. We achieve this with a novel method for learning a nonlinear embedding based on several extensions to the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) framework. Our method is convolutional, enabling it to scale to realistically-sized images. By cheaply labeling the head and hands in large video databases through Amazon Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing service), we can use the task of localizing the head and hands as a proxy for determining body pose. We apply our method to challenging real-world data and show that it can generalize beyond hand localization to infer a more general notion of body pose. We evaluate our method quantitatively against other embedding methods. We also demonstrate that realworld performance can be improved through the use of synthetic data. 1</p><p>6 0.10977212 <a title="28-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Phone_Recognition_with_the_Mean-Covariance_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">206 nips-2010-Phone Recognition with the Mean-Covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Nimar Arora, Stuart Russell, Paul Kidwell, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: The International Monitoring System (IMS) is a global network of sensors whose purpose is to identify potential violations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), primarily through detection and localization of seismic events. We report on the ﬁrst stage of a project to improve on the current automated software system with a Bayesian inference system that computes the most likely global event history given the record of local sensor data. The new system, VISA (Vertically Integrated Seismological Analysis), is based on empirically calibrated, generative models of event occurrence, signal propagation, and signal detection. VISA exhibits signiﬁcantly improved precision and recall compared to the current operational system and is able to detect events that are missed even by the human analysts who post-process the IMS output. 1</p><p>5 0.56568569 <a title="28-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Phoneme_Recognition_with_Large_Hierarchical_Reservoirs.html">207 nips-2010-Phoneme Recognition with Large Hierarchical Reservoirs</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Triefenbach, Azarakhsh Jalalvand, Benjamin Schrauwen, Jean-pierre Martens</p><p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition has gradually improved over the years, but the reliable recognition of unconstrained speech is still not within reach. In order to achieve a breakthrough, many research groups are now investigating new methodologies that have potential to outperform the Hidden Markov Model technology that is at the core of all present commercial systems. In this paper, it is shown that the recently introduced concept of Reservoir Computing might form the basis of such a methodology. In a limited amount of time, a reservoir system that can recognize the elementary sounds of continuous speech has been built. The system already achieves a state-of-the-art performance, and there is evidence that the margin for further improvements is still signiﬁcant. 1</p><p>6 0.4975284 <a title="28-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Beyond_Actions%3A_Discriminative_Models_for_Contextual_Group_Activities.html">40 nips-2010-Beyond Actions: Discriminative Models for Contextual Group Activities</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Zhang Tong, Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a principled extension of the traditional single-layer ﬂat sparse coding scheme, where a two-layer coding scheme is derived based on theoretical analysis of nonlinear functional approximation that extends recent results for local coordinate coding. The two-layer approach can be easily generalized to deeper structures in a hierarchical multiple-layer manner. Empirically, it is shown that the deep coding approach yields improved performance in benchmark datasets.</p><p>3 0.49069628 <a title="28-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Layered_image_motion_with_explicit_occlusions%2C_temporal_consistency%2C_and_depth_ordering.html">141 nips-2010-Layered image motion with explicit occlusions, temporal consistency, and depth ordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Deqing Sun, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Layered models are a powerful way of describing natural scenes containing smooth surfaces that may overlap and occlude each other. For image motion estimation, such models have a long history but have not achieved the wide use or accuracy of non-layered methods. We present a new probabilistic model of optical ﬂow in layers that addresses many of the shortcomings of previous approaches. In particular, we deﬁne a probabilistic graphical model that explicitly captures: 1) occlusions and disocclusions; 2) depth ordering of the layers; 3) temporal consistency of the layer segmentation. Additionally the optical ﬂow in each layer is modeled by a combination of a parametric model and a smooth deviation based on an MRF with a robust spatial prior; the resulting model allows roughness in layers. Finally, a key contribution is the formulation of the layers using an imagedependent hidden ﬁeld prior based on recent models for static scene segmentation. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Middlebury benchmark and produces meaningful scene segmentations as well as detected occlusion regions.</p><p>4 0.49048567 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Sparse_Coding_for_Learning_Interpretable_Spatio-Temporal_Primitives.html">246 nips-2010-Sparse Coding for Learning Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Primitives</a></p>
<p>Author: Taehwan Kim, Gregory Shakhnarovich, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding has recently become a popular approach in computer vision to learn dictionaries of natural images. In this paper we extend the sparse coding framework to learn interpretable spatio-temporal primitives. We formulated the problem as a tensor factorization problem with tensor group norm constraints over the primitives, diagonal constraints on the activations that provide interpretability as well as smoothness constraints that are inherent to human motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to learn interpretable representations of human motion from motion capture data, and show that our approach outperforms recently developed matching pursuit and sparse coding algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.48882198 <a title="28-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Guaranteed_Rank_Minimization_via_Singular_Value_Projection.html">110 nips-2010-Guaranteed Rank Minimization via Singular Value Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Raghu Meka, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under afﬁne constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for afﬁne constraints that satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of lowrank matrix completion, for which the deﬁning afﬁne constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of [5, 18, 14], for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is signiﬁcantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem. 1</p><p>6 0.48863661 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>

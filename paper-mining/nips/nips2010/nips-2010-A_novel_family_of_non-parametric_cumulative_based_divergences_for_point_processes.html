<p>Author: Nicholas Fisher, Arunava Banerjee</p><p>Abstract: From a functional viewpoint, a spiking neuron is a device that transforms input spike trains on its various synapses into an output spike train on its axon. We demonstrate in this paper that the function mapping underlying the device can be tractably learned based on input and output spike train data alone. We begin by posing the problem in a classiﬁcation based framework. We then derive a novel kernel for an SRM0 model that is based on PSP and AHP like functions. With the kernel we demonstrate how the learning problem can be posed as a Quadratic Program. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our approach. 1</p><p>3 0.30656812 <a title="18-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing? On goodness-of-fit procedures for point process models and Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Gerhard, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an increasingly popular framework for modeling neural spike trains. They have been linked to the theory of stochastic point processes and researchers have used this relation to assess goodness-of-ﬁt using methods from point-process theory, e.g. the time-rescaling theorem. However, high neural ﬁring rates or coarse discretization lead to a breakdown of the assumptions necessary for this connection. Here, we show how goodness-of-ﬁt tests from point-process theory can still be applied to GLMs by constructing equivalent surrogate point processes out of time-series observations. Furthermore, two additional tests based on thinning and complementing point processes are introduced. They augment the instruments available for checking model adequacy of point processes as well as discretized models. 1</p><p>4 0.29929712 <a title="18-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural ﬁring rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron sufﬁces to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the online approximation of signals with a sum of powerlaw kernels is beneﬁcial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>5 0.17791519 <a title="18-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Accounting_for_network_effects_in_neuronal_responses_using_L1_regularized_point_process_models.html">21 nips-2010-Accounting for network effects in neuronal responses using L1 regularized point process models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Kelly, Matthew Smith, Robert Kass, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Activity of a neuron, even in the early sensory areas, is not simply a function of its local receptive ﬁeld or tuning properties, but depends on global context of the stimulus, as well as the neural context. This suggests the activity of the surrounding neurons and global brain states can exert considerable inﬂuence on the activity of a neuron. In this paper we implemented an L1 regularized point process model to assess the contribution of multiple factors to the ﬁring rate of many individual units recorded simultaneously from V1 with a 96-electrode “Utah” array. We found that the spikes of surrounding neurons indeed provide strong predictions of a neuron’s response, in addition to the neuron’s receptive ﬁeld transfer function. We also found that the same spikes could be accounted for with the local ﬁeld potentials, a surrogate measure of global network states. This work shows that accounting for network ﬂuctuations can improve estimates of single trial ﬁring rate and stimulus-response transfer functions. 1</p><p>6 0.16944665 <a title="18-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Spike_timing-dependent_plasticity_as_dynamic_filter.html">253 nips-2010-Spike timing-dependent plasticity as dynamic filter</a></p>

<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>5 0.70551074 <a title="18-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>

The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>3 0.63690394 <a title="18-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: During the last years support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied in situations where the input space X is not necessarily a subset of Rd . Examples include SVMs for the analysis of histograms or colored images, SVMs for text classiÄ?Ĺš cation and web mining, and SVMs for applications from computational biology using, e.g., kernels for trees and graphs. Moreover, SVMs are known to be consistent to the Bayes risk, if either the input space is a complete separable metric space and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Lp (PX ) is dense, or if the SVM uses a universal kernel k. So far, however, there are no kernels of practical interest known that satisfy these assumptions, if X Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Rd . We close this gap by providing a general technique based on Taylor-type kernels to explicitly construct universal kernels on compact metric spaces which are not subset of Rd . We apply this technique for the following special cases: universal kernels on the set of probability measures, universal kernels based on Fourier transforms, and universal kernels for signal processing. 1</p><p>4 0.62940079 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Multi-label_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_by_Stochastic_Approximation%3A_Application_to_Visual_Object_Recognition.html">174 nips-2010-Multi-label Multiple Kernel Learning by Stochastic Approximation: Application to Visual Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Serhat Bucak, Rong Jin, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that multiple kernel learning is very effective for object recognition, leading to the popularity of kernel learning in computer vision problems. In this work, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for multi-label multiple kernel learning (ML-MKL). We assume that all the classes under consideration share the same combination of kernel functions, and the objective is to ﬁnd the optimal kernel combination that beneﬁts all the classes. Although several algorithms have been developed for ML-MKL, their computational cost is linear in the number of classes, making them unscalable when the number of classes is large, a challenge frequently encountered in visual object recognition. We address this computational challenge by developing a framework for ML-MKL that combines the worst-case analysis with stochastic approximation. Our analysis √ shows that the complexity of our algorithm is O(m1/3 lnm), where m is the number of classes. Empirical studies with object recognition show that while achieving similar classiﬁcation accuracy, the proposed method is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the state-of-the-art algorithms for ML-MKL. 1</p><p>5 0.59859926 <a title="18-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing? On goodness-of-fit procedures for point process models and Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Gerhard, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an increasingly popular framework for modeling neural spike trains. They have been linked to the theory of stochastic point processes and researchers have used this relation to assess goodness-of-ﬁt using methods from point-process theory, e.g. the time-rescaling theorem. However, high neural ﬁring rates or coarse discretization lead to a breakdown of the assumptions necessary for this connection. Here, we show how goodness-of-ﬁt tests from point-process theory can still be applied to GLMs by constructing equivalent surrogate point processes out of time-series observations. Furthermore, two additional tests based on thinning and complementing point processes are introduced. They augment the instruments available for checking model adequacy of point processes as well as discretized models. 1</p><p>6 0.59082949 <a title="18-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

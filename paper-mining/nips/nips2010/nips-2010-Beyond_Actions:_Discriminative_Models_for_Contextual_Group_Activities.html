<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Paul L. Ruvolo</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether someone is talking has applications in many areas such as speech recognition, speaker diarization, social robotics, facial expression recognition, and human computer interaction. One popular approach to this problem is audio-visual synchrony detection [10, 21, 12]. A candidate speaker is deemed to be talking if the visual signal around that speaker correlates with the auditory signal. Here we show that with the proper visual features (in this case movements of various facial muscle groups), a very accurate detector of speech can be created that does not use the audio signal at all. Further we show that this person independent visual-only detector can be used to train very accurate audio-based person dependent voice models. The voice model has the advantage of being able to identify when a particular person is speaking even when they are not visible to the camera (e.g. in the case of a mobile robot). Moreover, we show that a simple sensory fusion scheme between the auditory and visual models improves performance on the task of talking detection. The work here provides dramatic evidence about the efﬁcacy of two very different approaches to multimodal speech detection on a challenging database. 1</p><p>3 0.14431927 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Using_body-anchored_priors_for_identifying_actions_in_single_images.html">281 nips-2010-Using body-anchored priors for identifying actions in single images</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Karlinsky, Michael Dinerstein, Shimon Ullman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to the visual recognition of human actions using only single images as input. The task is easy for humans but difficult for current approaches to object recognition, because instances of different actions may be similar in terms of body pose, and often require detailed examination of relations between participating objects and body parts in order to be recognized. The proposed approach applies a two-stage interpretation procedure to each training and test image. The first stage produces accurate detection of the relevant body parts of the actor, forming a prior for the local evidence needed to be considered for identifying the action. The second stage extracts features that are anchored to the detected body parts, and uses these features and their feature-to-part relations in order to recognize the action. The body anchored priors we propose apply to a large range of human actions. These priors allow focusing on the relevant regions and relations, thereby significantly simplifying the learning process and increasing recognition performance. 1</p><p>4 0.1302543 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Discriminative_Latent_Model_of_Image_Region_and_Object_Tag_Correspondence.html">6 nips-2010-A Discriminative Latent Model of Image Region and Object Tag Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth regionto-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.</p><p>5 0.10777607 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: A standard approach to learning object category detectors is to provide strong supervision in the form of a region of interest (ROI) specifying each instance of the object in the training images [17]. In this work are goal is to learn from heterogeneous labels, in which some images are only weakly supervised, specifying only the presence or absence of the object or a weak indication of object location, whilst others are fully annotated. To this end we develop a discriminative learning approach and make two contributions: (i) we propose a structured output formulation for weakly annotated images where full annotations are treated as latent variables; and (ii) we propose to optimize a ranking objective function, allowing our method to more effectively use negatively labeled images to improve detection average precision performance. The method is demonstrated on the benchmark INRIA pedestrian detection dataset of Dalal and Triggs [14] and the PASCAL VOC dataset [17], and it is shown that for a signiﬁcant proportion of weakly supervised images the performance achieved is very similar to the fully supervised (state of the art) results. 1</p><p>6 0.10761749 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Li-jia Li, Hao Su, Li Fei-fei, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Robust low-level image features have been proven to be effective representations for a variety of visual recognition tasks such as object recognition and scene classiﬁcation; but pixels, or even local image patches, carry little semantic meanings. For high level visual tasks, such low-level image representations are potentially not enough. In this paper, we propose a high-level image representation, called the Object Bank, where an image is represented as a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, blind to the testing dataset or visual task. Leveraging on the Object Bank representation, superior performances on high level visual recognition tasks can be achieved with simple off-the-shelf classiﬁers such as logistic regression and linear SVM. Sparsity algorithms make our representation more efﬁcient and scalable for large scene datasets, and reveal semantically meaningful feature patterns.</p><p>5 0.60658163 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>6 0.60565156 <a title="40-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Manas Pathak, Shantanu Rane, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: As increasing amounts of sensitive personal information ﬁnds its way into data repositories, it is important to develop analysis mechanisms that can derive aggregate information from these repositories without revealing information about individual data instances. Though the differential privacy model provides a framework to analyze such mechanisms for databases belonging to a single party, this framework has not yet been considered in a multi-party setting. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for composing a differentially private aggregate classiﬁer using classiﬁers trained locally by separate mutually untrusting parties. The protocol allows these parties to interact with an untrusted curator to construct additive shares of a perturbed aggregate classiﬁer. We also present a detailed theoretical analysis containing a proof of differential privacy of the perturbed aggregate classiﬁer and a bound on the excess risk introduced by the perturbation. We verify the bound with an experimental evaluation on a real dataset. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81668139 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Beyond_Actions%3A_Discriminative_Models_for_Contextual_Group_Activities.html">40 nips-2010-Beyond Actions: Discriminative Models for Contextual Group Activities</a></p>

Our experimental results demonstrate that by inferring this contextual information together with adaptive structures, the proposed model can signiﬁcantly improve activity recognition performance. 1</p><p>3 0.75911945 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Discriminative_Latent_Model_of_Image_Region_and_Object_Tag_Correspondence.html">6 nips-2010-A Discriminative Latent Model of Image Region and Object Tag Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth regionto-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.</p><p>4 0.75785369 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>
<p>Author: Kritika Muralidharan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justiﬁcation for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classiﬁcation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems. 1</p><p>5 0.7553677 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_invariant_features_using_the_Transformed_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">153 nips-2010-Learning invariant features using the Transformed Indian Buffet Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph L. Austerweil, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Identifying the features of objects becomes a challenge when those features can change in their appearance. We introduce the Transformed Indian Buffet Process (tIBP), and use it to deﬁne a nonparametric Bayesian model that infers features that can transform across instantiations. We show that this model can identify features that are location invariant by modeling a previous experiment on human feature learning. However, allowing features to transform adds new kinds of ambiguity: Are two parts of an object the same feature with different transformations or two unique features? What transformations can features undergo? We present two new experiments in which we explore how people resolve these questions, showing that the tIBP model demonstrates a similar sensitivity to context to that shown by human learners when determining the invariant aspects of features. 1</p><p>6 0.75429875 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>

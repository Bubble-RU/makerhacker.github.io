<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>3 0.24576625 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Minimization_of_Decomposable_Submodular_Functions.html">69 nips-2010-Efficient Minimization of Decomposable Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Stobbe, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many combinatorial problems arising in machine learning can be reduced to the problem of minimizing a submodular function. Submodular functions are a natural discrete analog of convex functions, and can be minimized in strongly polynomial time. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art algorithms for general submodular minimization are intractable for larger problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel subclass of submodular minimization problems that we call decomposable. Decomposable submodular functions are those that can be represented as sums of concave functions applied to modular functions. We develop an algorithm, SLG, that can efÄ?Ĺš ciently minimize decomposable submodular functions with tens of thousands of variables. Our algorithm exploits recent results in smoothed convex minimization. We apply SLG to synthetic benchmarks and a joint classiÄ?Ĺš cation-and-segmentation task, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art general purpose submodular minimization algorithms by several orders of magnitude. 1</p><p>4 0.20089823 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Minimum_Average_Cost_Clustering.html">166 nips-2010-Minimum Average Cost Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kiyohito Nagano, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Satoru Iwata</p><p>Abstract: A number of objective functions in clustering problems can be described with submodular functions. In this paper, we introduce the minimum average cost criterion, and show that the theory of intersecting submodular functions can be used for clustering with submodular objective functions. The proposed algorithm does not require the number of clusters in advance, and it will be determined by the property of a given set of data points. The minimum average cost clustering problem is parameterized with a real variable, and surprisingly, we show that all information about optimal clusterings for all parameters can be computed in polynomial time in total. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through computational experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.085291505 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_and_Robust_Feature_Selection_via_Joint_%E2%84%932%2C1-Norms_Minimization.html">73 nips-2010-Efficient and Robust Feature Selection via Joint ℓ2,1-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Feiping Nie, Heng Huang, Xiao Cai, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Feature selection is an important component of many machine learning applications. Especially in many bioinformatics tasks, efﬁcient and robust feature selection methods are desired to extract meaningful features and eliminate noisy ones. In this paper, we propose a new robust feature selection method with emphasizing joint 2,1 -norm minimization on both loss function and regularization. The 2,1 -norm based loss function is robust to outliers in data points and the 2,1 norm regularization selects features across all data points with joint sparsity. An efﬁcient algorithm is introduced with proved convergence. Our regression based objective makes the feature selection process more efﬁcient. Our method has been applied into both genomic and proteomic biomarkers discovery. Extensive empirical studies are performed on six data sets to demonstrate the performance of our feature selection method. 1</p><p>6 0.083199657 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis R. Bach, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems that involve a structured sparsityinducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas a lot of effort has been put in developing fast optimization methods when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a speciﬁc hierarchical structure, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is related to network ﬂow optimization. More precisely, the proximal problem associated with the norm we consider is dual to a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem. We propose an efﬁcient procedure which computes its solution exactly in polynomial time. Our algorithm scales up to millions of variables, and opens up a whole new range of applications for structured sparse models. We present several experiments on image and video data, demonstrating the applicability and scalability of our approach for various problems. 1</p><p>6 0.29478791 <a title="102-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Nebojsa Jojic, Alessandro Perina, Vittorio Murino</p><p>Abstract: In order to study the properties of total visual input in humans, a single subject wore a camera for two weeks capturing, on average, an image every 20 seconds. The resulting new dataset contains a mix of indoor and outdoor scenes as well as numerous foreground objects. Our ﬁrst goal is to create a visual summary of the subject’s two weeks of life using unsupervised algorithms that would automatically discover recurrent scenes, familiar faces or common actions. Direct application of existing algorithms, such as panoramic stitching (e.g., Photosynth) or appearance-based clustering models (e.g., the epitome), is impractical due to either the large dataset size or the dramatic variations in the lighting conditions. As a remedy to these problems, we introduce a novel image representation, the ”structural element (stel) epitome,” and an associated efﬁcient learning algorithm. In our model, each image or image patch is characterized by a hidden mapping T which, as in previous epitome models, deﬁnes a mapping between the image coordinates and the coordinates in the large ”all-I-have-seen” epitome matrix. The limited epitome real-estate forces the mappings of different images to overlap which indicates image similarity. However, the image similarity no longer depends on direct pixel-to-pixel intensity/color/feature comparisons as in previous epitome models, but on spatial conﬁguration of scene or object parts, as the model is based on the palette-invariant stel models. As a result, stel epitomes capture structure that is invariant to non-structural changes, such as illumination changes, that tend to uniformly affect pixels belonging to a single scene or object part. 1</p><p>3 0.61163217 <a title="102-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Optimal_Bayesian_Recommendation_Sets_and_Myopically_Optimal_Choice_Query_Sets.html">197 nips-2010-Optimal Bayesian Recommendation Sets and Myopically Optimal Choice Query Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Paolo Viappiani, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.</p><p>4 0.58395356 <a title="102-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Repeated_Games_against_Budgeted_Adversaries.html">226 nips-2010-Repeated Games against Budgeted Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob D. Abernethy, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We study repeated zero-sum games against an adversary on a budget. Given that an adversary has some constraint on the sequence of actions that he plays, we consider what ought to be the player’s best mixed strategy with knowledge of this budget. We show that, for a general class of normal-form games, the minimax strategy is indeed efﬁciently computable and relies on a “random playout” technique. We give three diverse applications of this new algorithmic template: a cost-sensitive “Hedge” setting, a particular problem in Metrical Task Systems, and the design of combinatorial prediction markets. 1</p><p>5 0.56007838 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Linear_readout_from_a_neural_population_with_partial_correlation_data.html">161 nips-2010-Linear readout from a neural population with partial correlation data</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Wohrer, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How much information does a neural population convey about a stimulus? Answers to this question are known to strongly depend on the correlation of response variability in neural populations. These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>6 0.542404 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Networks_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations.html">148 nips-2010-Learning Networks of Stochastic Differential Equations</a></p>

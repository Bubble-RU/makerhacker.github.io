<p>Author: Paolo Viappiani, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.</p><p>3 0.14955369 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.13722901 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_the_context_of_a_category.html">155 nips-2010-Learning the context of a category</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Stegle, Dominik Janzing, Kun Zhang, Joris M. Mooij, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for inferring whether X causes Y or vice versa from joint observations of X and Y . The basic idea is to model the observed data using probabilistic latent variable models, which incorporate the effects of unobserved noise. To this end, we consider the hypothetical effect variable to be a function of the hypothetical cause variable and an independent noise term (not necessarily additive). An important novel aspect of our work is that we do not restrict the model class, but instead put general non-parametric priors on this function and on the distribution of the cause. The causal direction can then be inferred by using standard Bayesian model selection. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and real-world data and report encouraging results. 1</p><p>6 0.11620133 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Agnostic_Active_Learning_Without_Constraints.html">27 nips-2010-Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints</a></p>

Our algorithm solves an integer linear program in an online fashion. It exploits total unimodularity of the constraint matrix and a Lagrangian relaxation to solve the problem as a convex online game. The algorithm generates approximate solutions of max-ﬂow problems by performing stochastic gradient descent on a set of ﬂows. We apply the algorithm to optimize tier arrangement of over 84 million web pages on a layered set of caches to serve an incoming query stream optimally. 1</p><p>4 0.49816334 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>

<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.44924268 <a title="100-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_inference_in_continuous_time_Gaussian-Jump_processes.html">33 nips-2010-Approximate inference in continuous time Gaussian-Jump processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Stobbe, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many combinatorial problems arising in machine learning can be reduced to the problem of minimizing a submodular function. Submodular functions are a natural discrete analog of convex functions, and can be minimized in strongly polynomial time. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art algorithms for general submodular minimization are intractable for larger problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel subclass of submodular minimization problems that we call decomposable. Decomposable submodular functions are those that can be represented as sums of concave functions applied to modular functions. We develop an algorithm, SLG, that can efÄ?Ĺš ciently minimize decomposable submodular functions with tens of thousands of variables. Our algorithm exploits recent results in smoothed convex minimization. We apply SLG to synthetic benchmarks and a joint classiÄ?Ĺš cation-and-segmentation task, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art general purpose submodular minimization algorithms by several orders of magnitude. 1</p><p>2 0.80840731 <a title="100-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Infinite_Relational_Modeling_of_Functional_Connectivity_in_Resting_State_fMRI.html">128 nips-2010-Infinite Relational Modeling of Functional Connectivity in Resting State fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Morten Mørup, Kristoffer Madsen, Anne-marie Dogonowski, Hartwig Siebner, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the neural elements which form complex network at a whole brain level. Most analyses of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been based on the analysis of correlation between the temporal dynamics of various regions of the brain. While these models can identify coherently behaving groups in terms of correlation they give little insight into how these groups interact. In this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state networks. Starting from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups we search for functional units of the brain that communicate with other parts of the brain in a coherent manner as measured by mutual information. We use the inﬁnite relational model (IRM) to quantify functional coherent groups of resting state networks and demonstrate how the extracted component interactions can be used to discriminate between functional resting state activity in multiple sclerosis and normal subjects. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.79736137 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Gaussian_Process_Preference_Elicitation.html">100 nips-2010-Gaussian Process Preference Elicitation</a></p>

We learn the hyper-parameters of this GP on a set of preferences of previous users and use it to aid in the elicitation process for a new user. This approach provides a ﬂexible model of a multi-user utility function, facilitates an efﬁcient value of information (VOI) heuristic query selection strategy, and provides a principled way to incorporate the elicitations of multiple users back into the model. We show the effectiveness of our method in comparison to previous work on a real dataset of user preferences over sushi types. 1</p><p>4 0.77463579 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.77121246 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Random_Walk_Approach_to_Regret_Minimization.html">222 nips-2010-Random Walk Approach to Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hariharan Narayanan, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a computationally efﬁcient random walk on a convex body which rapidly mixes to a time-varying Gibbs distribution. In the setting of online convex optimization and repeated games, the algorithm yields low regret and presents a novel efﬁcient method for implementing mixture forecasting strategies. 1</p><p>6 0.76747787 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

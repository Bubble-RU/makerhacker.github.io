<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Koby Crammer</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework to online learning for classiﬁcation problems with time-varying potential functions in the adversarial setting. This framework allows to design and prove relative mistake bounds for any generic loss function. The mistake bounds can be specialized for the hinge loss, allowing to recover and improve the bounds of known online classiﬁcation algorithms. By optimizing the general bound we derive a new online classiﬁcation algorithm, called NAROW, that hybridly uses adaptive- and ﬁxed- second order information. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance using synthetic dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.13628677 <a title="162-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Inter-time_segment_information_sharing_for_non-homogeneous_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">129 nips-2010-Inter-time segment information sharing for non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Dirk Husmeier, Frank Dondelinger, Sophie Lebre</p><p>Abstract: Conventional dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are based on the homogeneous Markov assumption, which is too restrictive in many practical applications. Various approaches to relax the homogeneity assumption have recently been proposed, allowing the network structure to change with time. However, unless time series are very long, this ﬂexibility leads to the risk of overﬁtting and inﬂated inference uncertainty. In the present paper we investigate three regularization schemes based on inter-segment information sharing, choosing different prior distributions and different coupling schemes between nodes. We apply our method to gene expression time series obtained during the Drosophila life cycle, and compare the predicted segmentation with other state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude our evaluation with an application to synthetic biology, where the objective is to predict a known in vivo regulatory network of ﬁve genes in yeast. 1</p><p>4 0.13592617 <a title="162-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Transduction_with_Matrix_Completion%3A_Three_Birds_with_One_Stone.html">275 nips-2010-Transduction with Matrix Completion: Three Birds with One Stone</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Goldberg, Ben Recht, Junming Xu, Robert Nowak, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We pose transductive classiﬁcation as a matrix completion problem. By assuming the underlying matrix has a low rank, our formulation is able to handle three problems simultaneously: i) multi-label learning, where each item has more than one label, ii) transduction, where most of these labels are unspeciﬁed, and iii) missing data, where a large number of features are missing. We obtained satisfactory results on several real-world tasks, suggesting that the low rank assumption may not be as restrictive as it seems. Our method allows for different loss functions to apply on the feature and label entries of the matrix. The resulting nuclear norm minimization problem is solved with a modiﬁed ﬁxed-point continuation method that is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum. 1</p><p>5 0.12861666 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Networks_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations.html">148 nips-2010-Learning Networks of Stochastic Differential Equations</a></p>
<p>Author: José Pereira, Morteza Ibrahimi, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We consider linear models for stochastic dynamics. To any such model can be associated a network (namely a directed graph) describing which degrees of freedom interact under the dynamics. We tackle the problem of learning such a network from observation of the system trajectory over a time interval T . We analyze the ℓ1 -regularized least squares algorithm and, in the setting in which the underlying network is sparse, we prove performance guarantees that are uniform in the sampling rate as long as this is sufﬁciently high. This result substantiates the notion of a well deﬁned ‘time complexity’ for the network inference problem. keywords: Gaussian processes, model selection and structure learning, graphical models, sparsity and feature selection. 1 Introduction and main results Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph with weight A0 ∈ R associated to the directed edge (j, i) from ij j ∈ V to i ∈ V . To each node i ∈ V in this network is associated an independent standard Brownian motion bi and a variable xi taking values in R and evolving according to A0 xj (t) dt + dbi (t) , ij dxi (t) = j∈∂+ i where ∂+ i = {j ∈ V : (j, i) ∈ E} is the set of ‘parents’ of i. Without loss of generality we shall take V = [p] ≡ {1, . . . , p}. In words, the rate of change of xi is given by a weighted sum of the current values of its neighbors, corrupted by white noise. In matrix notation, the same system is then represented by dx(t) = A0 x(t) dt + db(t) , p (1) 0 p×p with x(t) ∈ R , b(t) a p-dimensional standard Brownian motion and A ∈ R a matrix with entries {A0 }i,j∈[p] whose sparsity pattern is given by the graph G. We assume that the linear system ij x(t) = A0 x(t) is stable (i.e. that the spectrum of A0 is contained in {z ∈ C : Re(z) < 0}). Further, ˙ we assume that x(t = 0) is in its stationary state. More precisely, x(0) is a Gaussian random variable 1 independent of b(t), distributed according to the invariant measure. Under the stability assumption, this a mild restriction, since the system converges exponentially to stationarity. A portion of time length T of the system trajectory {x(t)}t∈[0,T ] is observed and we ask under which conditions these data are sufﬁcient to reconstruct the graph G (i.e., the sparsity pattern of A0 ). We are particularly interested in computationally efﬁcient procedures, and in characterizing the scaling of the learning time for large networks. Can the network structure be learnt in a time scaling linearly with the number of its degrees of freedom? As an example application, chemical reactions can be conveniently modeled by systems of nonlinear stochastic differential equations, whose variables encode the densities of various chemical species [1, 2]. Complex biological networks might involve hundreds of such species [3], and learning stochastic models from data is an important (and challenging) computational task [4]. Considering one such chemical reaction network in proximity of an equilibrium point, the model (1) can be used to trace ﬂuctuations of the species counts with respect to the equilibrium values. The network G would represent in this case the interactions between different chemical factors. Work in this area focused so-far on low-dimensional networks, i.e. on methods that are guaranteed to be correct for ﬁxed p, as T → ∞, while we will tackle here the regime in which both p and T diverge. Before stating our results, it is useful to stress a few important differences with respect to classical graphical model learning problems: (i) Samples are not independent. This can (and does) increase the sample complexity. (ii) On the other hand, inﬁnitely many samples are given as data (in fact a collection indexed by the continuous parameter t ∈ [0, T ]). Of course one can select a ﬁnite subsample, for instance at regularly spaced times {x(i η)}i=0,1,... . This raises the question as to whether the learning performances depend on the choice of the spacing η. (iii) In particular, one expects that choosing η sufﬁciently large as to make the conﬁgurations in the subsample approximately independent can be harmful. Indeed, the matrix A0 contains more information than the stationary distribution of the above process (1), and only the latter can be learned from independent samples. (iv) On the other hand, letting η → 0, one can produce an arbitrarily large number of distinct samples. However, samples become more dependent, and intuitively one expects that there is limited information to be harnessed from a given time interval T . Our results conﬁrm in a detailed and quantitative way these intuitions. 1.1 Results: Regularized least squares Regularized least squares is an efﬁcient and well-studied method for support recovery. We will discuss relations with existing literature in Section 1.3. In the present case, the algorithm reconstructs independently each row of the matrix A0 . The rth row, A0 , is estimated by solving the following convex optimization problem for Ar ∈ Rp r minimize L(Ar ; {x(t)}t∈[0,T ] ) + λ Ar 1 , (2) where the likelihood function L is deﬁned by L(Ar ; {x(t)}t∈[0,T ] ) = 1 2T T 0 (A∗ x(t))2 dt − r 1 T T 0 (A∗ x(t)) dxr (t) . r (3) (Here and below M ∗ denotes the transpose of matrix/vector M .) To see that this likelihood function is indeed related to least squares, one can formally write xr (t) = dxr (t)/dt and complete the square ˙ for the right hand side of Eq. (3), thus getting the integral (A∗ x(t) − xr (t))2 dt − xr (t)2 dt. ˙ ˙ r The ﬁrst term is a sum of square residuals, and the second is independent of A. Finally the ℓ1 regularization term in Eq. (2) has the role of shrinking to 0 a subset of the entries Aij thus effectively selecting the structure. Let S 0 be the support of row A0 , and assume |S 0 | ≤ k. We will refer to the vector sign(A0 ) as to r r the signed support of A0 (where sign(0) = 0 by convention). Let λmax (M ) and λmin (M ) stand for r 2 the maximum and minimum eigenvalue of a square matrix M respectively. Further, denote by Amin the smallest absolute value among the non-zero entries of row A0 . r When stable, the diffusion process (1) has a unique stationary measure which is Gaussian with covariance Q0 ∈ Rp×p given by the solution of Lyapunov’s equation [5] A0 Q0 + Q0 (A0 )∗ + I = 0. (4) Our guarantee for regularized least squares is stated in terms of two properties of the covariance Q0 and one assumption on ρmin (A0 ) (given a matrix M , we denote by ML,R its submatrix ML,R ≡ (Mij )i∈L,j∈R ): (a) We denote by Cmin ≡ λmin (Q0 0 ,S 0 ) the minimum eigenvalue of the restriction of Q0 to S the support S 0 and assume Cmin > 0. (b) We deﬁne the incoherence parameter α by letting |||Q0 (S 0 )C ,S 0 Q0 S 0 ,S 0 and assume α > 0. (Here ||| · |||∞ is the operator sup norm.) −1 |||∞ = 1 − α, ∗ (c) We deﬁne ρmin (A0 ) = −λmax ((A0 + A0 )/2) and assume ρmin (A0 ) > 0. Note this is a stronger form of stability assumption. Our main result is to show that there exists a well deﬁned time complexity, i.e. a minimum time interval T such that, observing the system for time T enables us to reconstruct the network with high probability. This result is stated in the following theorem. Theorem 1.1. Consider the problem of learning the support S 0 of row A0 of the matrix A0 from a r sample trajectory {x(t)}t∈[0,T ] distributed according to the model (1). If T > 104 k 2 (k ρmin (A0 )−2 + A−2 ) 4pk min log , 2 α2 ρmin (A0 )Cmin δ (5) then there exists λ such that ℓ1 -regularized least squares recovers the signed support of A0 with r probability larger than 1 − δ. This is achieved by taking λ = 36 log(4p/δ)/(T α2 ρmin (A0 )) . The time complexity is logarithmic in the number of variables and polynomial in the support size. Further, it is roughly inversely proportional to ρmin (A0 ), which is quite satisfying conceptually, since ρmin (A0 )−1 controls the relaxation time of the mixes. 1.2 Overview of other results So far we focused on continuous-time dynamics. While, this is useful in order to obtain elegant statements, much of the paper is in fact devoted to the analysis of the following discrete-time dynamics, with parameter η > 0: x(t) = x(t − 1) + ηA0 x(t − 1) + w(t), t ∈ N0 . (6) Here x(t) ∈ Rp is the vector collecting the dynamical variables, A0 ∈ Rp×p speciﬁes the dynamics as above, and {w(t)}t≥0 is a sequence of i.i.d. normal vectors with covariance η Ip×p (i.e. with independent components of variance η). We assume that consecutive samples {x(t)}0≤t≤n are given and will ask under which conditions regularized least squares reconstructs the support of A0 . The parameter η has the meaning of a time-step size. The continuous-time model (1) is recovered, in a sense made precise below, by letting η → 0. Indeed we will prove reconstruction guarantees that are uniform in this limit as long as the product nη (which corresponds to the time interval T in the previous section) is kept constant. For a formal statement we refer to Theorem 3.1. Theorem 1.1 is indeed proved by carefully controlling this limit. The mathematical challenge in this problem is related to the fundamental fact that the samples {x(t)}0≤t≤n are dependent (and strongly dependent as η → 0). Discrete time models of the form (6) can arise either because the system under study evolves by discrete steps, or because we are subsampling a continuous time system modeled as in Eq. (1). Notice that in the latter case the matrices A0 appearing in Eq. (6) and (1) coincide only to the zeroth order in η. Neglecting this technical complication, the uniformity of our reconstruction guarantees as η → 0 has an appealing interpretation already mentioned above. Whenever the samples spacing is not too large, the time complexity (i.e. the product nη) is roughly independent of the spacing itself. 3 1.3 Related work A substantial amount of work has been devoted to the analysis of ℓ1 regularized least squares, and its variants [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The most closely related results are the one concerning high-dimensional consistency for support recovery [11, 12]. Our proof follows indeed the line of work developed in these papers, with two important challenges. First, the design matrix is in our case produced by a stochastic diffusion, and it does not necessarily satisﬁes the irrepresentability conditions used by these works. Second, the observations are not corrupted by i.i.d. noise (since successive conﬁgurations are correlated) and therefore elementary concentration inequalities are not sufﬁcient. Learning sparse graphical models via ℓ1 regularization is also a topic with signiﬁcant literature. In the Gaussian case, the graphical LASSO was proposed to reconstruct the model from i.i.d. samples [13]. In the context of binary pairwise graphical models, Ref. [11] proves high-dimensional consistency of regularized logistic regression for structural learning, under a suitable irrepresentability conditions on a modiﬁed covariance. Also this paper focuses on i.i.d. samples. Most of these proofs builds on the technique of [12]. A naive adaptation to the present case allows to prove some performance guarantee for the discrete-time setting. However the resulting bounds are not uniform as η → 0 for nη = T ﬁxed. In particular, they do not allow to prove an analogous of our continuous time result, Theorem 1.1. A large part of our effort is devoted to producing more accurate probability estimates that capture the correct scaling for small η. Similar issues were explored in the study of stochastic differential equations, whereby one is often interested in tracking some slow degrees of freedom while ‘averaging out’ the fast ones [14]. The relevance of this time-scale separation for learning was addressed in [15]. Let us however emphasize that these works focus once more on system with a ﬁxed (small) number of dimensions p. Finally, the related topic of learning graphical models for autoregressive processes was studied recently in [16, 17]. The convex relaxation proposed in these papers is different from the one developed here. Further, no model selection guarantee was proved in [16, 17]. 2 Illustration of the main results It might be difﬁcult to get a clear intuition of Theorem 1.1, mainly because of conditions (a) and (b), which introduce parameters Cmin and α. The same difﬁculty arises with analogous results on the high-dimensional consistency of the LASSO [11, 12]. In this section we provide concrete illustration both via numerical simulations, and by checking the condition on speciﬁc classes of graphs. 2.1 Learning the laplacian of graphs with bounded degree Given a simple graph G = (V, E) on vertex set V = [p], its laplacian ∆G is the symmetric p × p matrix which is equal to the adjacency matrix of G outside the diagonal, and with entries ∆G = ii −deg(i) on the diagonal [18]. (Here deg(i) denotes the degree of vertex i.) It is well known that ∆G is negative semideﬁnite, with one eigenvalue equal to 0, whose multiplicity is equal to the number of connected components of G. The matrix A0 = −m I + ∆G ﬁts into the setting of Theorem 1.1 for m > 0. The corresponding model (1.1) describes the over-damped dynamics of a network of masses connected by springs of unit strength, and connected by a spring of strength m to the origin. We obtain the following result. Theorem 2.1. Let G be a simple connected graph of maximum vertex degree k and consider the model (1.1) with A0 = −m I + ∆G where ∆G is the laplacian of G and m > 0. If k+m 5 4pk T ≥ 2 · 105 k 2 , (7) (k + m2 ) log m δ then there exists λ such that ℓ1 -regularized least squares recovers the signed support of A0 with r probability larger than 1 − δ. This is achieved by taking λ = 36(k + m)2 log(4p/δ)/(T m3 ). In other words, for m bounded away from 0 and ∞, regularized least squares regression correctly reconstructs the graph G from a trajectory of time length which is polynomial in the degree and logarithmic in the system size. Notice that once the graph is known, the laplacian ∆G is uniquely determined. Also, the proof technique used for this example is generalizable to other graphs as well. 4 2800 Min. # of samples for success prob. = 0.9 1 0.9 p = 16 p = 32 0.8 Probability of success p = 64 0.7 p = 128 p = 256 0.6 p = 512 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 T=nη 350 400 2600 2400 2200 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1 10 450 2 3 10 10 p Figure 1: (left) Probability of success vs. length of the observation interval nη. (right) Sample complexity for 90% probability of success vs. p. 2.2 Numerical illustrations In this section we present numerical validation of the proposed method on synthetic data. The results conﬁrm our observations in Theorems 1.1 and 3.1, below, namely that the time complexity scales logarithmically with the number of nodes in the network p, given a constant maximum degree. Also, the time complexity is roughly independent of the sampling rate. In Fig. 1 and 2 we consider the discrete-time setting, generating data as follows. We draw A0 as a random sparse matrix in {0, 1}p×p with elements chosen independently at random with P(A0 = 1) = k/p, k = 5. The ij process xn ≡ {x(t)}0≤t≤n is then generated according to Eq. (6). We solve the regularized least 0 square problem (the cost function is given explicitly in Eq. (8) for the discrete-time case) for different values of n, the number of observations, and record if the correct support is recovered for a random row r using the optimum value of the parameter λ. An estimate of the probability of successful recovery is obtained by repeating this experiment. Note that we are estimating here an average probability of success over randomly generated matrices. The left plot in Fig.1 depicts the probability of success vs. nη for η = 0.1 and different values of p. Each curve is obtained using 211 instances, and each instance is generated using a new random matrix A0 . The right plot in Fig.1 is the corresponding curve of the sample complexity vs. p where sample complexity is deﬁned as the minimum value of nη with probability of success of 90%. As predicted by Theorem 2.1 the curve shows the logarithmic scaling of the sample complexity with p. In Fig. 2 we turn to the continuous-time model (1). Trajectories are generated by discretizing this stochastic differential equation with step δ much smaller than the sampling rate η. We draw random matrices A0 as above and plot the probability of success for p = 16, k = 4 and different values of η, as a function of T . We used 211 instances for each curve. As predicted by Theorem 1.1, for a ﬁxed observation interval T , the probability of success converges to some limiting value as η → 0. 3 Discrete-time model: Statement of the results Consider a system evolving in discrete time according to the model (6), and let xn ≡ {x(t)}0≤t≤n 0 be the observed portion of the trajectory. The rth row A0 is estimated by solving the following r convex optimization problem for Ar ∈ Rp minimize L(Ar ; xn ) + λ Ar 0 where L(Ar ; xn ) ≡ 0 1 2η 2 n 1 , (8) n−1 2 t=0 {xr (t + 1) − xr (t) − η A∗ x(t)} . r (9) Apart from an additive constant, the η → 0 limit of this cost function can be shown to coincide with the cost function in the continuous time case, cf. Eq. (3). Indeed the proof of Theorem 1.1 will amount to a more precise version of this statement. Furthermore, L(Ar ; xn ) is easily seen to be the 0 log-likelihood of Ar within model (6). 5 1 1 0.9 0.95 0.9 0.7 Probability of success Probability of success 0.8 η = 0.04 η = 0.06 0.6 η = 0.08 0.5 η = 0.1 0.4 η = 0.14 0.3 η = 0.22 η = 0.18 0.85 0.8 0.75 0.7 0.65 0.2 0.6 0.1 0 50 100 150 T=nη 200 0.55 0.04 250 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 η 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 Figure 2: (right)Probability of success vs. length of the observation interval nη for different values of η. (left) Probability of success vs. η for a ﬁxed length of the observation interval, (nη = 150) . The process is generated for a small value of η and sampled at different rates. As before, we let S 0 be the support of row A0 , and assume |S 0 | ≤ k. Under the model (6) x(t) has r a Gaussian stationary state distribution with covariance Q0 determined by the following modiﬁed Lyapunov equation A0 Q0 + Q0 (A0 )∗ + ηA0 Q0 (A0 )∗ + I = 0 . (10) It will be clear from the context whether A0 /Q0 refers to the dynamics/stationary matrix from the continuous or discrete time system. We assume conditions (a) and (b) introduced in Section 1.1, and adopt the notations already introduced there. We use as a shorthand notation σmax ≡ σmax (I +η A0 ) where σmax (.) is the maximum singular value. Also deﬁne D ≡ 1 − σmax /η . We will assume D > 0. As in the previous section, we assume the model (6) is initiated in the stationary state. Theorem 3.1. Consider the problem of learning the support S 0 of row A0 from the discrete-time r trajectory {x(t)}0≤t≤n . If nη > 4pk 104 k 2 (kD−2 + A−2 ) min log , 2 DC 2 α δ min (11) then there exists λ such that ℓ1 -regularized least squares recovers the signed support of A0 with r probability larger than 1 − δ. This is achieved by taking λ = (36 log(4p/δ))/(Dα2 nη). In other words the discrete-time sample complexity, n, is logarithmic in the model dimension, polynomial in the maximum network degree and inversely proportional to the time spacing between samples. The last point is particularly important. It enables us to derive the bound on the continuoustime sample complexity as the limit η → 0 of the discrete-time sample complexity. It also conﬁrms our intuition mentioned in the Introduction: although one can produce an arbitrary large number of samples by sampling the continuous process with ﬁner resolutions, there is limited amount of information that can be harnessed from a given time interval [0, T ]. 4 Proofs In the following we denote by X ∈ Rn×p the matrix whose (t + 1)th column corresponds to the conﬁguration x(t), i.e. X = [x(0), x(1), . . . , x(n − 1)]. Further ∆X ∈ Rn×p is the matrix containing conﬁguration changes, namely ∆X = [x(1) − x(0), . . . , x(n) − x(n − 1)]. Finally we write W = [w(1), . . . , w(n − 1)] for the matrix containing the Gaussian noise realization. Equivalently, The r th row of W is denoted by Wr . W = ∆X − ηA X . In order to lighten the notation, we will omit the reference to xn in the likelihood function (9) and 0 simply write L(Ar ). We deﬁne its normalized gradient and Hessian by G = −∇L(A0 ) = r 1 ∗ XWr , nη Q = ∇2 L(A0 ) = r 6 1 XX ∗ . n (12) 4.1 Discrete time In this Section we outline our prove for our main result for discrete-time dynamics, i.e., Theorem 3.1. We start by stating a set of sufﬁcient conditions for regularized least squares to work. Then we present a series of concentration lemmas to be used to prove the validity of these conditions, and ﬁnally we sketch the outline of the proof. As mentioned, the proof strategy, and in particular the following proposition which provides a compact set of sufﬁcient conditions for the support to be recovered correctly is analogous to the one in [12]. A proof of this proposition can be found in the supplementary material. Proposition 4.1. Let α, Cmin > 0 be be deﬁned by λmin (Q0 0 ,S 0 ) ≡ Cmin , S |||Q0 0 )C ,S 0 Q0 0 ,S 0 S (S −1 |||∞ ≡ 1 − α . (13) If the following conditions hold then the regularized least square solution (8) correctly recover the signed support sign(A0 ): r λα Amin Cmin G ∞≤ , GS 0 ∞ ≤ − λ, (14) 3 4k α Cmin α Cmin √ , √ . |||QS 0 ,S 0 − Q0 0 ,S 0 |||∞ ≤ (15) |||Q(S 0 )C ,S 0 − Q0 0 )C ,S 0 |||∞ ≤ S (S 12 k 12 k Further the same statement holds for the continuous model 3, provided G and Q are the gradient and the hessian of the likelihood (3). The proof of Theorem 3.1 consists in checking that, under the hypothesis (11) on the number of consecutive conﬁgurations, conditions (14) to (15) will hold with high probability. Checking these conditions can be regarded in turn as concentration-of-measure statements. Indeed, if expectation is taken with respect to a stationary trajectory, we have E{G} = 0, E{Q} = Q0 . 4.1.1 Technical lemmas In this section we will state the necessary concentration lemmas for proving Theorem 3.1. These are non-trivial because G, Q are quadratic functions of dependent random variables the samples {x(t)}0≤t≤n . The proofs of Proposition 4.2, of Proposition 4.3, and Corollary 4.4 can be found in the supplementary material provided. Our ﬁrst Proposition implies concentration of G around 0. Proposition 4.2. Let S ⊆ [p] be any set of vertices and ǫ < 1/2. If σmax ≡ σmax (I + η A0 ) < 1, then 2 P GS ∞ > ǫ ≤ 2|S| e−n(1−σmax ) ǫ /4 . (16) We furthermore need to bound the matrix norms as per (15) in proposition 4.1. First we relate bounds on |||QJS − Q0 JS |||∞ with bounds on |Qij − Q0 |, (i ∈ J, i ∈ S) where J and S are any ij subsets of {1, ..., p}. We have, P(|||QJS − Q0 )|||∞ > ǫ) ≤ |J||S| max P(|Qij − Q0 | > ǫ/|S|). JS ij i,j∈J (17) Then, we bound |Qij − Q0 | using the following proposition ij Proposition 4.3. Let i, j ∈ {1, ..., p}, σmax ≡ σmax (I + ηA0 ) < 1, T = ηn > 3/D and 0 < ǫ < 2/D where D = (1 − σmax )/η then, P(|Qij − Q0 )| > ǫ) ≤ 2e ij n − 32η2 (1−σmax )3 ǫ2 . (18) Finally, the next corollary follows from Proposition 4.3 and Eq. (17). Corollary 4.4. Let J, S (|S| ≤ k) be any two subsets of {1, ..., p} and σmax ≡ σmax (I + ηA0 ) < 1, ǫ < 2k/D and nη > 3/D (where D = (1 − σmax )/η) then, P(|||QJS − Q0 |||∞ > ǫ) ≤ 2|J|ke JS 7 n − 32k2 η2 (1−σmax )3 ǫ2 . (19) 4.1.2 Outline of the proof of Theorem 3.1 With these concentration bounds we can now easily prove Theorem 3.1. All we need to do is to compute the probability that the conditions given by Proposition 4.1 hold. From the statement of the theorem we have that the ﬁrst two conditions (α, Cmin > 0) of Proposition 4.1 hold. In order to make the ﬁrst condition on G imply the second condition on G we assume that λα/3 ≤ (Amin Cmin )/(4k) − λ which is guaranteed to hold if λ ≤ Amin Cmin /8k. (20) We also combine the two last conditions on Q, thus obtaining the following |||Q[p],S 0 − Q0 0 |||∞ ≤ [p],S α Cmin √ , 12 k (21) since [p] = S 0 ∪ (S 0 )C . We then impose that both the probability of the condition on Q failing and the probability of the condition on G failing are upper bounded by δ/2 using Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.4. It is shown in the supplementary material that this is satisﬁed if condition (11) holds. 4.2 Outline of the proof of Theorem 1.1 To prove Theorem 1.1 we recall that Proposition 4.1 holds provided the appropriate continuous time expressions are used for G and Q, namely G = −∇L(A0 ) = r 1 T T x(t) dbr (t) , 0 Q = ∇2 L(A0 ) = r 1 T T x(t)x(t)∗ dt . (22) 0 These are of course random variables. In order to distinguish these from the discrete time version, we will adopt the notation Gn , Qn for the latter. We claim that these random variables can be coupled (i.e. deﬁned on the same probability space) in such a way that Gn → G and Qn → Q almost surely as n → ∞ for ﬁxed T . Under assumption (5), it is easy to show that (11) holds for all n > n0 with n0 a sufﬁciently large constant (for a proof see the provided supplementary material). Therefore, by the proof of Theorem 3.1, the conditions in Proposition 4.1 hold for gradient Gn and hessian Qn for any n ≥ n0 , with probability larger than 1 − δ. But by the claimed convergence Gn → G and Qn → Q, they hold also for G and Q with probability at least 1 − δ which proves the theorem. We are left with the task of showing that the discrete and continuous time processes can be coupled in such a way that Gn → G and Qn → Q. With slight abuse of notation, the state of the discrete time system (6) will be denoted by x(i) where i ∈ N and the state of continuous time system (1) by x(t) where t ∈ R. We denote by Q0 the solution of (4) and by Q0 (η) the solution of (10). It is easy to check that Q0 (η) → Q0 as η → 0 by the uniqueness of stationary state distribution. The initial state of the continuous time system x(t = 0) is a N(0, Q0 ) random variable independent of b(t) and the initial state of the discrete time system is deﬁned to be x(i = 0) = (Q0 (η))1/2 (Q0 )−1/2 x(t = 0). At subsequent times, x(i) and x(t) are assumed are generated by the respective dynamical systems using the same matrix A0 using common randomness provided by the standard Brownian motion {b(t)}0≤t≤T in Rp . In order to couple x(t) and x(i), we construct w(i), the noise driving the discrete time system, by letting w(i) ≡ (b(T i/n) − b(T (i − 1)/n)). The almost sure convergence Gn → G and Qn → Q follows then from standard convergence of random walk to Brownian motion.

<p>Author: Kaushik Mitra, Sameer Sheorey, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Matrix factorization in the presence of missing data is at the core of many computer vision problems such as structure from motion (SfM), non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo. We formulate the problem of matrix factorization with missing data as a low-rank semideﬁnite program (LRSDP) with the advantage that: 1) an efﬁcient quasi-Newton implementation of the LRSDP enables us to solve large-scale factorization problems, and 2) additional constraints such as orthonormality, required in orthographic SfM, can be directly incorporated in the new formulation. Our empirical evaluations suggest that, under the conditions of matrix completion theory, the proposed algorithm ﬁnds the optimal solution, and also requires fewer observations compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the afﬁne SfM problem, non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo problems.</p><p>3 0.65709698 <a title="162-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Guaranteed_Rank_Minimization_via_Singular_Value_Projection.html">110 nips-2010-Guaranteed Rank Minimization via Singular Value Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Raghu Meka, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under afﬁne constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for afﬁne constraints that satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of lowrank matrix completion, for which the deﬁning afﬁne constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of [5, 18, 14], for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is signiﬁcantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem. 1</p><p>4 0.6463536 <a title="162-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Penalized_Principal_Component_Regression_on_Graphs_for_Analysis_of_Subnetworks.html">204 nips-2010-Penalized Principal Component Regression on Graphs for Analysis of Subnetworks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Shojaie, George Michailidis</p><p>Abstract: Network models are widely used to capture interactions among component of complex systems, such as social and biological. To understand their behavior, it is often necessary to analyze functionally related components of the system, corresponding to subsystems. Therefore, the analysis of subnetworks may provide additional insight into the behavior of the system, not evident from individual components. We propose a novel approach for incorporating available network information into the analysis of arbitrary subnetworks. The proposed method offers an efﬁcient dimension reduction strategy using Laplacian eigenmaps with Neumann boundary conditions, and provides a ﬂexible inference framework for analysis of subnetworks, based on a group-penalized principal component regression model on graphs. Asymptotic properties of the proposed inference method, as well as the choice of the tuning parameter for control of the false positive rate are discussed in high dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated using simulated and real data examples from biology. 1</p><p>5 0.62520963 <a title="162-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Collaborative_Filtering_in_a_Non-Uniform_World%3A_Learning_with_the_Weighted_Trace_Norm.html">48 nips-2010-Collaborative Filtering in a Non-Uniform World: Learning with the Weighted Trace Norm</a></p>

We show experiments with both simulated and real data which reveal the interest of our methodology. 1</p><p>2 0.80054933 <a title="162-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning%3A_Random_Averages%2C_Combinatorial_Parameters%2C_and_Learnability.html">193 nips-2010-Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: We develop a theory of online learning by deﬁning several complexity measures. Among them are analogues of Rademacher complexity, covering numbers and fatshattering dimension from statistical learning theory. Relationship among these complexity measures, their connection to online learning, and tools for bounding them are provided. We apply these results to various learning problems. We provide a complete characterization of online learnability in the supervised setting. 1</p><p>3 0.77098006 <a title="162-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>4 0.76883161 <a title="162-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>5 0.76623321 <a title="162-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Random_Walk_Approach_to_Regret_Minimization.html">222 nips-2010-Random Walk Approach to Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hariharan Narayanan, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a computationally efﬁcient random walk on a convex body which rapidly mixes to a time-varying Gibbs distribution. In the setting of online convex optimization and repeated games, the algorithm yields low regret and presents a novel efﬁcient method for implementing mixture forecasting strategies. 1</p><p>6 0.76537275 <a title="162-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Construction_of_Dependent_Dirichlet_Processes_based_on_Poisson_Processes.html">51 nips-2010-Construction of Dependent Dirichlet Processes based on Poisson Processes</a></p>

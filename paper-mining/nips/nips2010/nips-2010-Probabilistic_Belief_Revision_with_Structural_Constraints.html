<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>3 0.10492184 <a title="214-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>4 0.098234251 <a title="214-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Agnostic_Active_Learning_Without_Constraints.html">27 nips-2010-Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, John Langford, Zhang Tong, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.085691072 <a title="214-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Functional_form_of_motion_priors_in_human_motion_perception.html">98 nips-2010-Functional form of motion priors in human motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Tungyou Lin, Alan Lee, Luminita Vese, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>6 0.08066529 <a title="214-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Empirical_Risk_Minimization_with_Approximations_of_Probabilistic_Grammars.html">75 nips-2010-Empirical Risk Minimization with Approximations of Probabilistic Grammars</a></p>

We present a framework, reminiscent of structural risk minimization, for empirical risk minimization of the parameters of a ﬁxed probabilistic grammar using the log-loss. We derive sample complexity bounds in this framework that apply both to the supervised setting and the unsupervised setting. 1</p><p>5 0.50518423 <a title="214-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Switching_state_space_model_for_simultaneously_estimating_state_transitions_and_nonstationary_firing_rates.html">263 nips-2010-Switching state space model for simultaneously estimating state transitions and nonstationary firing rates</a></p>
<p>Author: Ken Takiyama, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: 019 020 We propose an algorithm for simultaneously estimating state transitions among neural states, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates using a switching state space model (SSSM). This algorithm enables us to detect state transitions on the basis of not only the discontinuous changes of mean ﬁring rates but also discontinuous changes in temporal proﬁles of ﬁring rates, e.g., temporal correlation. We construct a variational Bayes algorithm for a non-Gaussian SSSM whose non-Gaussian property is caused by binary spike events. Synthetic data analysis reveals that our algorithm has the high performance for estimating state transitions, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates compared to previous methods. We also analyze neural data that were recorded from the medial temporal area. The statistically detected neural states probably coincide with transient and sustained states that have been detected heuristically. Estimated parameters suggest that our algorithm detects the state transition on the basis of discontinuous changes in the temporal correlation of ﬁring rates, which transitions previous methods cannot detect. This result suggests that our algorithm is advantageous in real-data analysis. 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053</p><p>6 0.41513517 <a title="214-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-An_analysis_on_negative_curvature_induced_by_singularity_in_multi-layer_neural-network_learning.html">31 nips-2010-An analysis on negative curvature induced by singularity in multi-layer neural-network learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>2 0.90197158 <a title="214-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Monte-Carlo_Planning_in_Large_POMDPs.html">168 nips-2010-Monte-Carlo Planning in Large POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: David Silver, Joel Veness</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent’s belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, MonteCarlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan eﬀectively in signiﬁcantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 × 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 1018 and 1056 states respectively. Our MonteCarlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the ﬁrst general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs. 1</p><p>3 0.87984729 <a title="214-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Group_Sparse_Regularization_with_Overlapping_Groups.html">12 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Group Sparse Regularization with Overlapping Groups</a></p>
<p>Author: Sofia Mosci, Silvia Villa, Alessandro Verri, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of variable selection when variables must be selected group-wise, with possibly overlapping groups deﬁned a priori. In particular we propose a new optimization procedure for solving the regularized algorithm presented in [12], where the group lasso penalty is generalized to overlapping groups of variables. While in [12] the proposed implementation requires explicit replication of the variables belonging to more than one group, our iterative procedure is based on a combination of proximal methods in the primal space and projected Newton method in a reduced dual space, corresponding to the active groups. This procedure provides a scalable alternative with no need for data duplication, and allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction. The computational advantages of our scheme with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms using data duplication are shown empirically with numerical simulations. 1</p><p>4 0.8553223 <a title="214-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>
<p>Author: Issei Sato, Kenichi Kurihara, Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: We develop a deterministic single-pass algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in order to process received documents one at a time and then discard them in an excess text stream. Our algorithm does not need to store old statistics for all data. The proposed algorithm is much faster than a batch algorithm and is comparable to the batch algorithm in terms of perplexity in experiments.</p><p>5 0.84827197 <a title="214-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Parallelized_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.html">202 nips-2010-Parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Markus Weimer, Lihong Li, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the ﬁrst parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8]. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.83330202 <a title="214-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Probabilistic_Belief_Revision_with_Structural_Constraints.html">214 nips-2010-Probabilistic Belief Revision with Structural Constraints</a></p>

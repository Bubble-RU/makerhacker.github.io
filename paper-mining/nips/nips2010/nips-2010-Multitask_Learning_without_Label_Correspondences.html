<p>Author: Arvind Agarwal, Samuel Gerber, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for multitask learning (MTL) based on manifold regularization: assume that all task parameters lie on a manifold. This is the generalization of a common assumption made in the existing literature: task parameters share a common linear subspace. One proposed method uses the projection distance from the manifold to regularize the task parameters. The manifold structure and the task parameters are learned using an alternating optimization framework. When the manifold structure is ﬁxed, our method decomposes across tasks which can be learnt independently. An approximation of the manifold regularization scheme is presented that preserves the convexity of the single task learning problem, and makes the proposed MTL framework efﬁcient and easy to implement. We show the efﬁcacy of our method on several datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.15898226 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Adversarially_Missing_Label_Information.html">236 nips-2010-Semi-Supervised Learning with Adversarially Missing Label Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Umar Syed, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of semi-supervised learning in an adversarial setting. Instead of assuming that labels are missing at random, we analyze a less favorable scenario where the label information can be missing partially and arbitrarily, which is motivated by several practical examples. We present nearly matching upper and lower generalization bounds for learning in this setting under reasonable assumptions about available label information. Motivated by the analysis, we formulate a convex optimization problem for parameter estimation, derive an efﬁcient algorithm, and analyze its convergence. We provide experimental results on several standard data sets showing the robustness of our algorithm to the pattern of missing label information, outperforming several strong baselines. 1</p><p>4 0.14285076 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Candidate_Labeling_Sets.html">151 nips-2010-Learning from Candidate Labeling Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Jason Weston, David Grangier</p><p>Abstract: Multi-class classiﬁcation becomes challenging at test time when the number of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a treestructure of classiﬁers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster. 1</p><p>6 0.13035674 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_a_Sparse_Matrix-Normal_Penalty.html">147 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks with a Sparse Matrix-Normal Penalty</a></p>

<p>Author: Shibin Parameswaran, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) improves the prediction performance on multiple, different but related, learning problems through shared parameters or representations. One of the most prominent multi-task learning algorithms is an extension to support vector machines (svm) by Evgeniou et al. [15]. Although very elegant, multi-task svm is inherently restricted by the fact that support vector machines require each class to be addressed explicitly with its own weight vector which, in a multi-task setting, requires the different learning tasks to share the same set of classes. This paper proposes an alternative formulation for multi-task learning by extending the recently published large margin nearest neighbor (lmnn) algorithm to the MTL paradigm. Instead of relying on separating hyperplanes, its decision function is based on the nearest neighbor rule which inherently extends to many classes and becomes a natural ﬁt for multi-task learning. We evaluate the resulting multi-task lmnn on real-world insurance data and speech classiﬁcation problems and show that it consistently outperforms single-task kNN under several metrics and state-of-the-art MTL classiﬁers. 1</p><p>3 0.63706529 <a title="177-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_a_Sparse_Matrix-Normal_Penalty.html">147 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks with a Sparse Matrix-Normal Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a matrix-variate normal penalty with sparse inverse covariances to couple multiple tasks. Learning multiple (parametric) models can be viewed as estimating a matrix of parameters, where rows and columns of the matrix correspond to tasks and features, respectively. Following the matrix-variate normal density, we design a penalty that decomposes the full covariance of matrix elements into the Kronecker product of row covariance and column covariance, which characterizes both task relatedness and feature representation. Several recently proposed methods are variants of the special cases of this formulation. To address the overﬁtting issue and select meaningful task and feature structures, we include sparse covariance selection into our matrix-normal regularization via ℓ1 penalties on task and feature inverse covariances. We empirically study the proposed method and compare with related models in two real-world problems: detecting landmines in multiple ﬁelds and recognizing faces between different subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides an effective and ﬂexible way to model various different structures of multiple tasks.</p><p>4 0.6200735 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Manifold_Regularization.html">146 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks using Manifold Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Yang, Linli Xu, Martha White, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Robust regression and classiﬁcation are often thought to require non-convex loss functions that prevent scalable, global training. However, such a view neglects the possibility of reformulated training methods that can yield practically solvable alternatives. A natural way to make a loss function more robust to outliers is to truncate loss values that exceed a maximum threshold. We demonstrate that a relaxation of this form of “loss clipping” can be made globally solvable and applicable to any standard loss while guaranteeing robustness against outliers. We present a generic procedure that can be applied to standard loss functions and demonstrate improved robustness in regression and classiﬁcation problems. 1</p><p>4 0.66682637 <a title="177-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Predicting_Execution_Time_of_Computer_Programs_Using_Sparse_Polynomial_Regression.html">211 nips-2010-Predicting Execution Time of Computer Programs Using Sparse Polynomial Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Huang, Jinzhu Jia, Bin Yu, Byung-gon Chun, Petros Maniatis, Mayur Naik</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the execution time of computer programs is an important but challenging problem in the community of computer systems. Existing methods require experts to perform detailed analysis of program code in order to construct predictors or select important features. We recently developed a new system to automatically extract a large number of features from program execution on sample inputs, on which prediction models can be constructed without expert knowledge. In this paper we study the construction of predictive models for this problem. We propose the SPORE (Sparse POlynomial REgression) methodology to build accurate prediction models of program performance using feature data collected from program execution on sample inputs. Our two SPORE algorithms are able to build relationships between responses (e.g., the execution time of a computer program) and features, and select a few from hundreds of the retrieved features to construct an explicitly sparse and non-linear model to predict the response variable. The compact and explicitly polynomial form of the estimated model could reveal important insights into the computer program (e.g., features and their non-linear combinations that dominate the execution time), enabling a better understanding of the program’s behavior. Our evaluation on three widely used computer programs shows that SPORE methods can give accurate prediction with relative error less than 7% by using a moderate number of training data samples. In addition, we compare SPORE algorithms to state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms, and show that SPORE methods, motivated by real applications, outperform the other methods in terms of both interpretability and prediction accuracy.</p><p>5 0.61816591 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Optimization_for_Discriminative_Latent_Class_Models.html">70 nips-2010-Efficient Optimization for Discriminative Latent Class Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Armand Joulin, Jean Ponce, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is commonly used in the setting of multi-label supervised classiﬁcation to control the learning capacity and to provide a meaningful representation of the data. We introduce a simple forward probabilistic model which is a multinomial extension of reduced rank regression, and show that this model provides a probabilistic interpretation of discriminative clustering methods with added beneﬁts in terms of number of hyperparameters and optimization. While the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used to learn these probabilistic models, it usually leads to local maxima because it relies on a non-convex cost function. To avoid this problem, we introduce a local approximation of this cost function, which in turn leads to a quadratic non-convex optimization problem over a product of simplices. In order to maximize quadratic functions, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm based on convex relaxations and lowrank representations of the data, capable of handling large-scale problems. Experiments on text document classiﬁcation show that the new model outperforms other supervised dimensionality reduction methods, while simulations on unsupervised clustering show that our probabilistic formulation has better properties than existing discriminative clustering methods. 1</p><p>6 0.61670554 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-New_Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Online_Classification.html">182 nips-2010-New Adaptive Algorithms for Online Classification</a></p>

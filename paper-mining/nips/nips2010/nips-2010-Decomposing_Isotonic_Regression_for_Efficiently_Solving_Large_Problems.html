<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis R. Bach, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems that involve a structured sparsityinducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas a lot of effort has been put in developing fast optimization methods when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a speciﬁc hierarchical structure, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is related to network ﬂow optimization. More precisely, the proximal problem associated with the norm we consider is dual to a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem. We propose an efﬁcient procedure which computes its solution exactly in polynomial time. Our algorithm scales up to millions of variables, and opens up a whole new range of applications for structured sparse models. We present several experiments on image and video data, demonstrating the applicability and scalability of our approach for various problems. 1</p><p>3 0.095499977 <a title="58-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Nonparametric_Density_Estimation_for_Stochastic_Optimization_with_an_Observable_State_Variable.html">185 nips-2010-Nonparametric Density Estimation for Stochastic Optimization with an Observable State Variable</a></p>
<p>Author: Lauren Hannah, Warren Powell, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study convex stochastic optimization problems where a noisy objective function value is observed after a decision is made. There are many stochastic optimization problems whose behavior depends on an exogenous state variable which affects the shape of the objective function. Currently, there is no general purpose algorithm to solve this class of problems. We use nonparametric density estimation to take observations from the joint state-outcome distribution and use them to infer the optimal decision for a given query state s. We propose two solution methods that depend on the problem characteristics: function-based and gradient-based optimization. We examine two weighting schemes, kernel based weights and Dirichlet process based weights, for use with the solution methods. The weights and solution methods are tested on a synthetic multi-product newsvendor problem and the hour ahead wind commitment problem. Our results show that in some cases Dirichlet process weights offer substantial beneﬁts over kernel based weights and more generally that nonparametric estimation methods provide good solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 1</p><p>4 0.091684349 <a title="58-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.078487374 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-More_data_means_less_inference%3A_A_pseudo-max_approach_to_structured_learning.html">169 nips-2010-More data means less inference: A pseudo-max approach to structured learning</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Ofer Meshi, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning to predict structured labels is of key importance in many applications. However, for general graph structure both learning and inference are intractable. Here we show that it is possible to circumvent this difﬁculty when the distribution of training examples is rich enough, via a method similar in spirit to pseudo-likelihood. We show that our new method achieves consistency, and illustrate empirically that it indeed approaches the performance of exact methods when sufﬁciently large training sets are used. Many prediction problems in machine learning applications are structured prediction tasks. For example, in protein folding we are given a protein sequence and the goal is to predict the protein’s native structure [14]. In parsing for natural language processing, we are given a sentence and the goal is to predict the most likely parse tree [2]. In these and many other applications, we can formalize the structured prediction problem as taking an input x (e.g., primary sequence, sentence) and predicting ˆ y (e.g., structure, parse) according to y = arg maxy∈Y θ · φ(x, y ), where φ(x, y) is a function that ˆ maps any input and a candidate assignment to a feature vector, Y denotes the space of all possible assignments to the vector y, and θ is a weight vector to be learned. This paper addresses the problem of learning structured prediction models from data. In particular, given a set of labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M , our goal is to ﬁnd a vector θ such that for each m=1 example m, y m = arg maxy∈Y θ · φ(xm , y), i.e. one which separates the training data. For many structured prediction models, maximization over Y is computationally intractable. This makes it difﬁcult to apply previous algorithms for learning structured prediction models, such as structured perceptron [2], stochastic subgradient [10], and cutting-plane algorithms [5], which require making a prediction at every iteration (equivalent to repeatedly solving an integer linear program). Given training data, we can consider the space of parameters Θ that separate the data. This space can be deﬁned by the intersection of a large number of linear inequalities. A recent approach to getting around the hardness of prediction is to use linear programming (LP) relaxations to approximate the maximization over Y [4, 6, 9]. However, separation with respect to a relaxation places stronger constraints on the parameters. The target solution, an integral vertex in the LP, must now distinguish itself also from possible fractional vertexes that arise due to the relaxation. The relaxations can therefore be understood as optimizing over an inner bound of Θ. This set may be empty even if the training data is separable with exact inference [6]. Another obstacle to using LP relaxations for learning is that solving the LPs can be very slow. In this paper we ask whether it is possible to learn while avoiding inference altogether. We propose a new learning algorithm, inspired by pseudo-likelihood [1], that optimizes over an outer bound of Θ. Learning involves optimizing over only a small number of constraints per data point, and thus can be performed quickly, even for complex structured prediction models. We show that, if the data available for learning is “nice”, this algorithm is consistent, i.e. it will ﬁnd some θ ∈ Θ. This is an example of how having the right data can circumvent the hardness of learning for structured prediction. 1 We also investigate the limitations of the proposed method. We show that the problem of even deciding whether a given data set is separable is NP-hard, and thus learning in a strict sense is no easier than prediction. Thus, we should not expect for our algorithm, or any other polynomial time algorithm, to always succeed at learning from an arbitrary ﬁnite data set. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst result characterizing the hardness of exact learning for structured prediction. Finally, we show empirically that our algorithm allows us to successfully learn the parameters for both multi-label prediction and protein side-chain placement. The performance of the algorithm is improved as more data becomes available, as our theoretical results anticipate. 1 Pseudo-Max method We consider the general structured prediction problem. The input space is denoted by X and the set of all possible assignments by Y. Each y ∈ Y corresponds to n variables y1 , . . . , yn , each with k possible states. The classiﬁer uses a (given) function φ(x, y) : X , Y → Rd and (learned) weights θ ∈ Rd , and is deﬁned as y(x; θ) = arg maxy∈Y f (ˆ ; x, θ) where f is the discriminant function y ˆ f (y; x, θ) = θ · φ(x, y). Our analysis will focus on functions φ whose scope is limited to small sets of the yi variables, but for now we keep the discussion general. Given a set of labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M , the goal of the typical learning problem is to ﬁnd m=1 weights θ that correctly classify the training examples. Consider ﬁrst the separable case. Deﬁne the set of separating weight vectors, Θ = θ | ∀m, y ∈ Y, f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y; xm , θ)+e(y, y m ) . e is a loss function (e.g., zero-one or Hamming) such that e(y m , y m ) = 0 and e(y, y m ) > 0 for y = y m , which serves to rule out the trivial solution θ = 0.1 The space Θ is deﬁned by exponentially many constraints per example, one for each competing assignment. In this work we consider a much simpler set of constraints where, for each example, we only consider the competing assignments obtained by modifying a single label yi , while ﬁxing the other labels to their value at y m . The pseudo-max set, which is an outer bound on Θ, is given by Here ym −i m Θps = θ | ∀m, i, yi , f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) . −i denotes the label y m (1) without the assignment to yi . When the data is not separable, Θ will be the empty set. Instead, we may choose to minimize the hinge loss, (θ) = m maxy f (y; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(y, y m ) , which can be shown to be an upper bound on the training error [13]. When the data is separable, minθ (θ) = 0. Note that regularization may be added to this objective. The corresponding pseudo-max objective replaces the maximization over all of y with maximization over a single variable yi while ﬁxing the other labels to their value at y m :2,3 M ps (θ) n = m=1 i=1 m max f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) . −i yi Analogous to before, we have minθ ps (θ) (2) = 0 if and only if θ ∈ Θps . The objective in Eq. 2 is similar in spirit to pseudo-likelihood objectives used for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters of Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs) [1]. The pseudo-likelihood estimate is provably consistent when the data generating distribution is a MRF of the same structure as used in the pseudo-likelihood objective. However, our setting is different since we only get to view the maximizing assignment of the MRF rather than samples from it. Thus, a particular x will always be paired with the same y rather than samples y drawn from the conditional distribution p(y|x; θ). The pseudo-max constraints in Eq. 1 are also related to cutting plane approaches to inference [4, 5]. In the latter, the learning problem is solved by repeatedly looking for assignments that violate the separability constraint (or its hinge version). Our constraints can be viewed as using a very small 1 An alternative formulation, which we use in the next section, is to break the symmetry by having part of the input not be multiplied by any weight. This will also rule out the trivial solution θ = 0. P 2 It is possible to use maxi instead of i , and some of our consistency results will still hold. 3 The pseudo-max approach is markedly different from a learning method which predicts each label yi independently, since the objective considers all i simultaneously (both at learning and test time). 2 x2 0.2 J ∗ + x1 = 0 y = (0, 1) y = (1, 1) g(J12) x2 = 0 x1 J ∗ + x1 + x2 = 0 y = (0, 0) c1=0 c1=1 c1= 1 0.15 0.1 J + x2 = 0 ∗ 0.05 y = (1, 0) x1 = 0 0 1 0.5 0 J 0.5 1 Figure 1: Illustrations for a model with two variables.

The function is shown for different values of c1 , the mean of the x1 variable. subset of assignments for the set of candidate constraint violators. We also note that when exact maximization over the discriminant function f (y; x, θ) is hard, the standard cutting plane algorithm cannot be employed since it is infeasible to ﬁnd a violated constraint. For the pseudo-max objective, ﬁnding a constraint violation is simple and linear in the number of variables.4 It is easy to see (as will be elaborated on next) that the pseudo-max method does not in general yield a consistent estimate of θ, even in the separable case. However, as we show, consistency can be shown to be achieved under particular assumptions on the data generating distribution p(x). 2 Consistency of the Pseudo-Max method In this section we show that if the feature generating distribution p(x) satisﬁes particular assumptions, then the pseudo-max approach yields a consistent estimate. In other words, if the training data is of the form {(xm , y(xm ; θ ∗ ))}M for some true parameter vector θ ∗ , then as M → ∞ the m=1 minimum of the pseudo-max objective will converge to θ ∗ (up to equivalence transformations). The section is organized as follows. First, we provide intuition for the consistency results by considering a model with only two variables. Then, in Sec. 2.1, we show that any parameter θ ∗ can be identiﬁed to within arbitrary accuracy by choosing a particular training set (i.e., choice of xm ). This in itself proves consistency, as long as there is a non-zero probability of sampling this set. In Sec. 2.2 we give a more direct proof of consistency by using strict convexity arguments. For ease of presentation, we shall work with a simpliﬁed instance of the structured learning setting. We focus on binary variables, yi ∈ {0, 1}, and consider discriminant functions corresponding to Ising models, a special case of pairwise MRFs (J denotes the vector of “interaction” parameters): f (y; x, J ) = ij∈E Jij yi yj + i yi xi (3) The singleton potential for variable yi is yi xi and is not dependent on the model parameters. We could have instead used Ji yi xi , which would be more standard. However, this would make the parameter vector J invariant to scaling, complicating the identiﬁability analysis. In the consistency analysis we will assume that the data is generated using a true parameter vector J ∗ . We will show that as the data size goes to inﬁnity, minimization of ps (J ) yields J ∗ . We begin with an illustrative analysis of the pseudo-max constraints for a model with only two variables, i.e. f (y; x, J) = Jy1 y2 + y1 x1 + y2 x2 . The purpose of the analysis is to demonstrate general principles for when pseudo-max constraints may succeed or fail. Assume that training samples are generated via y(x) = argmaxy f (y; x, J ∗ ). We can partition the input space X into four regions, ˆ ˆ {x ∈ X : y(x) = y } for each of the four conﬁgurations y , shown in Fig. 1 (left). The blue lines outline the exact decision boundaries of f (y; x, J ∗ ), with the lines being given by the constraints 4 The methods differ substantially in the non-separable setting where we minimize ps (θ), using a slack variable for every node and example, rather than just one slack variable per example as in (θ). 3 in Θ that hold with equality. The red lines denote the pseudo-max constraints in Θps that hold with equality. For x such that y(x) = (1, 0) or (0, 1), the pseudo-max and exact constraints are identical. We can identify J ∗ by obtaining samples x = (x1 , x2 ) that explore both sides of one of the decision boundaries that depends on J ∗ . The pseudo-max constraints will fail to identify J ∗ if the samples do not sufﬁciently explore the transitions between y = (0, 1) and y = (1, 1) or between y = (1, 0) and y = (1, 1). This can happen, for example, when the input samples are dependent, giving only rise to the conﬁgurations y = (0, 0) and y = (1, 1). For points labeled (1, 1) around the decision line J ∗ + x1 + x2 = 0, pseudo-max can only tell that they respect J ∗ + x1 ≥ 0 and J ∗ + x2 ≥ 0 (dashed red lines), or x1 ≤ 0 and x2 ≤ 0 for points labeled (0, 0). Only constraints that depend on the parameter are effective for learning. For pseudo-max to be able to identify J ∗ , the input samples must be continuous, densely populating the two parameter dependent decision lines that pseudo-max can use. The two point sets in the ﬁgure illustrate good and bad input distributions for pseudo-max. The diagonal set would work well with the exact constraints but badly with pseudo-max, and the difference can be arbitrarily large. However, the input distribution on the right, populating the J ∗ + x2 = 0 decision line, would permit pseudo-max to identify J ∗ . 2.1 Identiﬁability of True Parameters In this section, we show that it is possible to approximately identify the true model parameters, up to model equivalence, using the pseudo-max constraints and a carefully chosen linear number of data points. Consider the learning problem for structured prediction deﬁned on a ﬁxed graph G = (V, E) where the parameters to be learned are pairwise potential functions θij (yi , yj ) for ij ∈ E and single node ﬁelds θi (yi ) for i ∈ V . We consider discriminant functions of the form f (y; x, θ) = ij∈E θij (yi , yj ) + i θi (yi ) + i xi (yi ), (4) where the input space X = R|V |k speciﬁes the single node potentials. Without loss of generality, we remove the additional degrees of freedom in θ by restricting it to be in a canonical form: θ ∈ Θcan if for all edges θij (yi , yj ) = 0 whenever yi = 0 or yj = 0, and if for all nodes, θi (yi ) = 0 when yi = 0. As a result, assuming the training set comes from a model in this class, and the input ﬁelds xi (yi ) exercise the discriminant function appropriately, we can hope to identify θ ∗ ∈ Θcan . Indeed, we show that, for some data sets, the pseudo-max constraints are sufﬁcient to identify θ ∗ . Let Θps ({y m , xm }) be the set of parameters that satisfy the pseudo-max classiﬁcation constraints m Θps ({y m , xm }) = θ | ∀m, i, yi = yi , f (y m ; xm , θ) ≥ f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) . −i (5) m e(yi , yi ), For simplicity we omit the margin losses since the input ﬁelds xi (yi ) already sufﬁce to rule out the trivial solution θ = 0. Proposition 2.1. For any θ ∗ ∈ Θcan , there is a set of 2|V |(k − 1) + 2|E|(k − 1)2 examples, {xm , y(xm ; θ ∗ )}, such that any pseudo-max consistent θ ∈ Θps ({y m , xm }) ∩ Θcan is arbitrarily close to θ ∗ . The proof is given in the supplementary material. To illustrate the key ideas, we consider the simpler binary discriminant function discussed in Eq. 3. Note that the binary model is already in the canonical form since Jij yi yj = 0 whenever yi = 0 or yj = 0. For any ij ∈ E, we show how to choose two input examples x1 and x2 such that any J consistent with the pseudo-max constraints for these ∗ ∗ two examples will have Jij ∈ [Jij − , Jij + ]. Repeating this for all of the edge parameters then gives the complete set of examples. The input examples we need for this will depend on J ∗ . For the ﬁrst example, we set the input ﬁelds for all neighbors of i (except j) in such a way that ∗ we force the corresponding labels to be zero. More formally, we set x1 < −|N (k)| maxl |Jkl | for k 1 k ∈ N (i)\j, resulting in yk = 0, where y 1 = y(x1 ). In contrast, we set x1 to a large value, e.g. j ∗ 1 ∗ x1 > |N (j)| maxl |Jjl |, so that yj = 1. Finally, for node i, we set x1 = −Jij + so as to obtain a j i 1 slight preference for yi = 1. All other input ﬁelds can be set arbitrarily. As a result, the pseudo-max constraints pertaining to node i are f (y 1 ; x1 , J ) ≥ f (y 1 , yi ; x1 , J ) for yi = 0, 1. By taking into −i 1 account the label assignments for yi and its neighbors, and by removing terms that are the same on both sides of the equation, we get Jij + x1 + x1 ≥ Jij yi + yi x1 + x1 , which, for yi = 0, implies i j i j ∗ that Jij + x1 ≥ 0 or Jij − Jij + ≥ 0. The second example x2 differs only in terms of the input i ∗ 2 ∗ ﬁeld for i. In particular, we set x2 = −Jij − so that yi = 0. This gives Jij ≤ Jij + , as desired. i 4 2.2 Consistency via Strict Convexity In this section we prove the consistency of the pseudo-max approach by showing that it corresponds to minimizing a strictly convex function. Our proof only requires that p(x) be non-zero for all x ∈ Rn (a simple example being a multi-variate Gaussian) and that J ∗ is ﬁnite. We use a discriminant function as in Eq. 3. Now, assume the input points xm are distributed according to p(x) and that y m are obtained via y m = arg maxy f (y; xm , J ∗ ). We can write the ps (J ) objective for ﬁnite data, and its limit when M → ∞, compactly as: 1 m m = max (yi − yi ) xm + Jki yk ps (J ) i M m i yi k∈N (i) p(x) max (yi − yi (x)) xi + → yi i Jki yk (x) dx (6) k∈N (i) ∗ where yi (x) is the label of i for input x when using parameters J . Starting from the above, consider the terms separately for each i. We partition the integral over x ∈ Rn into exclusive regions according to the predicted labels of the neighbors of i (given x). Deﬁne Sij = {x : yj (x) = 1 and yk (x) = 0 for k ∈ N (i)\j}. Eq. 6 can then be written as ps (J ) = gi ({Jik }k∈N (i) ) + ˆ i gik (Jik ) , (7) k∈N (i) where gik (Jik ) = x∈Sik p(x) maxyi [(yi −yi (x))(xi +Jik )]dx and gi ({Jik }k∈N (i) ) contains all of ˆ the remaining terms, i.e. where either zero or more than one neighbor is set to one. The function gi ˆ is convex in J since it is a sum of integrals over convex functions. We proceed to show that gik (Jik ) is strictly convex for all choices of i and k ∈ N (i). This will show that ps (J ) is strictly convex since it is a sum over functions strictly convex in each one of the variables in J . For all values xi ∈ (−∞, ∞) there is some x in Sij . This is because for any ﬁnite xi and ﬁnite J ∗ , the other xj ’s can be chosen so as to give the y conﬁguration corresponding to Sij . Now, since p(x) has full support, we have P (Sij ) > 0 and p(x) > 0 for any x in Sij . As a result, this also holds for the marginal pi (xi |Sij ) over xi within Sij . After some algebra, we obtain: gij (Jij ) = P (Sij ) ∞ p(x)yi (x)(xi + Jij )dx pi (xi |Sij ) max [0, xi + Jij ] dxi − −∞ x∈Sij The integral over the yi (x)(xi + Jij ) expression just adds a linear term to gij (Jij ). The relevant remaining term is (for brevity we drop P (Sij ), a strictly positive constant, and the ij index): h(J) = ∞ pi (xi |Sij ) max [0, xi + J] dxi = −∞ ∞ ˆ pi (xi |Sij )h(xi , J)dxi (8) −∞ ˆ ˆ where we deﬁne h(xi , J) = max [0, xi + J]. Note that h(J) is convex since h(xi , J) is convex in J for all xi . We want to show that h(J) is strictly convex. Consider J < J and α ∈ (0, 1) and deﬁne ˆ ˆ the interval I = [−J, −αJ − (1 − α)J ]. For xi ∈ I it holds that: αh(xi , J) + (1 − α)h(xi , J ) > ˆ i , αJ + (1 − α)J ) (since the ﬁrst term is strictly positive and the rest are zero). For all other x, h(x ˆ this inequality holds but is not necessarily strict (since h is always convex in J). We thus have after integrating over x that αh(J) + (1 − α)h(J ) > h(αJ + (1 − α)J ), implying h is strictly convex, as required. Note that we used the fact that p(x) has full support when integrating over I. The function ps (J ) is thus a sum of strictly convex functions in all its variables (namely g(Jik )) plus other convex functions of J , hence strictly convex. We can now proceed to show consistency. By strict convexity, the pseudo-max objective is minimized at a unique point J . Since we know that ps (J ∗ ) = 0 and zero is a lower bound on the value of ps (J ), it follows that J ∗ is the unique minimizer. Thus we have that as M → ∞, the minimizer of the pseudo-max objective is the true parameter vector, and thus we have consistency. As an example, consider the case of two variables y1 , y2 , with x1 and x2 distributed according to ∗ N (c1 , 1), N (0, 1) respectively. Furthermore assume J12 = 0. Then simple direct calculation yields: 2 2 2 c1 + J12 −c1 1 1 √ (9) e−x /2 dx − √ e−c1 /2 + √ e−(J12 +c1 ) /2 2π 2π 2π −J12 −c1 which is indeed a strictly convex function that is minimized at J = 0 (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). g(J12 ) = 5 3 Hardness of Structured Learning Most structured prediction learning algorithms use some form of inference as a subroutine. However, the corresponding prediction task is generally NP-hard. For example, maximizing the discriminant function deﬁned in Eq. 3 is equivalent to solving Max-Cut, which is known to be NP-hard. This raises the question of whether it is possible to bypass prediction during learning. Although prediction may be intractable for arbitrary MRFs, what does this say about the difﬁculty of learning with a polynomial number of data points? In this section, we show that the problem of deciding whether there exists a parameter vector that separates the training data is NP-hard. Put in the context of the positive results in this paper, these hardness results show that, although in some cases the pseudo-max constraints yield a consistent estimate, we cannot hope for a certiﬁcate of optimality. Put differently, although the pseudo-max constraints in the separable case always give an outer bound on Θ (and may even be a single point), Θ could be the empty set – and we would never know the difference. Theorem 3.1. Given labeled examples {(xm , y m )}M for a ﬁxed but arbitrary graph G, it is m=1 NP-hard to decide whether there exists parameters θ such that ∀m, y m = arg maxy f (y; xm , θ). Proof. Any parameters θ have an equivalent parameterization in canonical form (see section Sec. 2.1, also supplementary). Thus, the examples will be separable if and only if they are separable by some θ ∈ Θcan . We reduce from unweighted Max-Cut. The Max-Cut problem is to decide, given an undirected graph G, whether there exists a cut of at least K edges. Let G be the same graph as G, with k = 3 states per variable. We construct a small set of examples where a parameter vector will exist that separates the data if and only if there is no cut of K or more edges in G. Let θ be parameters in canonical form equivalent to θij (yi , yj ) = 1 if (yi , yj ) ∈ {(1, 2), (2, 1)}, 0 if yi = yj , and −n2 if (yi , yj ) ∈ {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}. We ﬁrst construct 4n + 8|E| examples, using the technique described in Sec. 2.1 (also supplementary material), which when restricted to the space Θcan , constrain the parameters to equal θ. We then use one more example (xm , y m ) where y m = 3 (every node is in state 3) and, for all i, xm (3) = K−1 and xm (1) = xm (2) = 0. The ﬁrst i i i n two states encode the original Max-Cut instance, while the third state is used to construct a labeling y m that has value equal to K − 1, and is otherwise not used. Let K ∗ be the value of the maximum cut in G. If in any assignment to the last example there is a variable taking the state 3 and another variable taking the state 1 or 2, then the assignment’s value will be at most K ∗ − n2 , which is less than zero. By construction, the 3 assignment has value K − 1. Thus, the optimal assignment must either be 3 with value K − 1, or some combination of states 1 and 2, which has value at most K ∗ . If K ∗ > K − 1 then 3 is not optimal and the examples are not separable. If K ∗ ≤ K − 1, the examples are separable. This result illustrates the potential difﬁculty of learning in worst-case graphs. Nonetheless, many problems have a more restricted dependence on the input. For example, in computer vision, edge potentials may depend only on the difference in color between two adjacent pixels. Our results do not preclude positive results of learnability in such restricted settings. By establishing hardness of learning, we also close the open problem of relating hardness of inference and learning in structured prediction. If inference problems can be solved in polynomial time, then so can learning (using, e.g., structured perceptron). Thus, when learning is hard, inference must be hard as well. 4 Experiments To evaluate our learning algorithm, we test its performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that, as the number of training samples grows, the accuracy of the pseudo-max method improves and its speed-up gain over competing algorithms increases. Our learning algorithm corresponds to solving the following, where we add L2 regularization and use a scaled 0-1 loss, m m e(yi , yi ) = 1{yi = yi }/nm (nm is the number of labels in example m): min θ C m nm M nm m=1 i=1 m max f (y m , yi ; xm , θ) − f (y m ; xm , θ) + e(yi , yi ) + θ −i yi 2 . (10) We will compare the pseudo-max method with learning using structural SVMs, both with exact inference and LP relaxations [see, e.g., 4]. We use exact inference for prediction at test time. 6 (a) Synthetic (b) Reuters 0.4 exact LP−relaxation pseudo−max 0.15 Test error Test error 0.2 0.1 0.05 0 1 10 2 10 0.2 0.1 0 1 10 3 10 Train size exact LP−relaxation pseudo−max 0.3 2 10 3 10 4 10 Train size Figure 2: Test error as a function of train size for various algorithms. Subﬁgure (a) shows results for a synthetic setting, while (b) shows performance on the Reuters data. In the synthetic setting we use the discriminant function f (y; x, θ) = ij∈E θij (yi , yj ) + xi θi (yi ), which is similar to Eq. 4. We take a fully connected graph over n = 10 binary labels. i For a weight vector θ ∗ (sampled once, uniformly in the range [−1, 1], and used for all train/test sets) we generate train and test instances by sampling xm uniformly in the range [−5, 5] and then computing the optimal labels y m = arg maxy∈Y f (y; xm , θ ∗ ). We generate train sets of increasing size (M = {10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000}), run the learning algorithms, and measure the test error for the learned weights (with 1000 test samples). For each train size we average the test error over 10 repeats of sampling and training. Fig. 2(a) shows a comparison of the test error for the three learning algorithms. For small numbers of training examples, the test error of pseudo-max is larger than that of the other algorithms. However, as the train size grows, the error converges to that of exact learning, as our consistency results predict. We also test the performance of our algorithm on a multi-label document classiﬁcation task from the Reuters dataset [7]. The data consists of M = 23149 training samples, and we use a reduction of the dataset to the 5 most frequent labels. The 5 label variables form a fully connected pairwise graph structure (see [4] for a similar setting). We use random subsamples of increasing size from the train set to learn the parameters, and then measure the test error using 20000 additional samples. For each sample size and learning algorithm, we optimize the trade-off parameter C using 30% of the training data as a hold-out set. Fig. 2(b) shows that for the large data regime the performance of pseudo-max learning gets close to that of the other methods. However, unlike the synthetic setting there is still a small gap, even after seeing the entire train set. This could be because the full dataset is not yet large enough to be in the consistent regime (note that exact learning has not ﬂattened either), or because the consistency conditions are not fully satisﬁed: the data might be non-separable or the support of the input distribution p(x) may be partial. We next apply our method to the problem of learning the energy function for protein side-chain placement, mirroring the learning setup of [14], where the authors train a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) using tree-reweighted belief propagation to maximize a lower bound on the likelihood.5 The prediction problem for side-chain placement corresponds to ﬁnding the most likely assignment in a pairwise MRF, and ﬁts naturally into our learning framework. There are only 8 parameters to be learned, corresponding to a reweighting of known energy terms. The dataset consists of 275 proteins, where each MRF has several hundred variables (one per residue of the protein) and each variable has on average 20 states. For prediction we use CPLEX’s ILP solver. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the pseudo-max method and a cutting-plane algorithm which uses an LP relaxation, solved with CPLEX, for ﬁnding violated constraints.6 We generate training sets of increasing size (M = {10, 50, 100, 274}), and measure the test error for the learned weights on the remaining examples.7 For M = 10, 50, 100 we average the test error over 3 random train/test splits, whereas for M = 274 we do 1-fold cross validation. We use C = 1 for both algorithms. 5 The authors’ data and results are available from: http://cyanover.fhcrc.org/recomb-2007/ We signiﬁcantly optimized the cutting-plane algorithm, e.g. including a large number of initial cuttingplanes and restricting the weight vector to be positive (which we know to hold at optimality). 7 Speciﬁcally, for each protein we compute the fraction of correctly predicted χ1 and χ2 angles for all residues (except when trivial, e.g. just 1 state). Then, we compute the median of this value across all proteins. 6 7 Time to train (minutes) Test error (χ1 and χ2) 0.27 0.265 pseudo−max LP−relaxation Soft rep 0.26 0.255 0.25 0 50 100 150 200 Train size 250 250 200 pseudo−max LP−relaxation 150 100 50 0 0 50 100 150 200 Train size 250 Figure 3: Training time (for one train/test split) and test error as a function of train size for both the pseudomax method and a cutting-plane algorithm which uses a LP relaxation for inference, applied to the problem of learning the energy function for protein side-chain placement. The pseudo-max method obtains better accuracy than both the LP relaxation and HCRF (given roughly ﬁve times more data) for a fraction of the training time. The original weights (“Soft rep” [3]) used for this energy function have 26.7% error across all 275 proteins. The best previously reported parameters, learned in [14] using a Hidden CRF, obtain 25.6% error (their training set included 55 of these 275 proteins, so this is an optimistic estimate). To get a sense of the difﬁculty of this learning task, we also tried a random positive weight vector, uniformly sampled from the range [0, 1], obtaining an error of 34.9% (results would be much worse if we allowed the weights to be negative). Training using pseudo-max with 50 examples, we learn parameters in under a minute that give better accuracy than the HCRF. The speed-up of training with pseudo-max (using CPLEX’s QP solver) versus cutting-plane is striking. For example, for M = 10, pseudo-max takes only 3 seconds, a 1000-fold speedup. Unfortunately the cutting-plane algorithm took a prohibitive amount of time to be able to run on the larger training sets. Since the data used in learning for protein side-chain placement is both highly non-separable and relatively little, these positive results illustrate the potential wide-spread applicability of the pseudo-max method. 5 Discussion The key idea of our method is to ﬁnd parameters that prefer the true assignment y m over assignments that differ from it in only one variable, in contrast to all other assignments. Perhaps surprisingly, this weak requirement is sufﬁcient to achieve consistency given a rich enough input distribution. One extension of our approach is to add constraints for assignments that differ from y m in more than one variable. This would tighten the outer bound on Θ and possibly result in improved performance, but would also increase computational complexity. We could also add such competing assignments via a cutting-plane scheme so that optimization is performed only over a subset of these constraints. Our work raises a number of important open problems: It would be interesting to derive generalization bounds to understand the convergence rate of our method, as well as understanding the effect of the distribution p(x) on these rates. The distribution p(x) needs to have two key properties. On the one hand, it needs to explore the space Y in the sense that a sufﬁcient number of labels need to be obtained as the correct label for the true parameters (this is indeed used in our consistency proofs). On the other hand, p(x) needs to be sufﬁciently sensitive close to the decision boundaries so that the true parameters can be inferred. We expect that generalization analysis will depend on these two properties of p(x). Note that [11] studied active learning schemes for structured data and may be relevant in the current context. How should one apply this learning algorithm to non-separable data sets? We suggested one approach, based on using a hinge loss for each of the pseudo constraints. One question in this context is, how resilient is this learning algorithm to label noise? Recent work has analyzed the sensitivity of pseudo-likelihood methods to model mis-speciﬁcation [8], and it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis here. Also, is it possible to give any guarantees for the empirical and expected risks (with respect to exact inference) obtained by outer bound learning versus exact learning? Finally, our algorithm demonstrates a phenomenon where more data can make computation easier. Such a scenario was recently analyzed in the context of supervised learning [12], and it would be interesting to combine the approaches.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis R. Bach, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems that involve a structured sparsityinducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas a lot of effort has been put in developing fast optimization methods when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a speciﬁc hierarchical structure, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is related to network ﬂow optimization. More precisely, the proximal problem associated with the norm we consider is dual to a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem. We propose an efﬁcient procedure which computes its solution exactly in polynomial time. Our algorithm scales up to millions of variables, and opens up a whole new range of applications for structured sparse models. We present several experiments on image and video data, demonstrating the applicability and scalability of our approach for various problems. 1</p><p>3 0.58843488 <a title="58-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Multivariate_Dyadic_Regression_Trees_for_Sparse_Learning_Problems.html">178 nips-2010-Multivariate Dyadic Regression Trees for Sparse Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric learning method based on multivariate dyadic regression trees (MDRTs). Unlike traditional dyadic decision trees (DDTs) or classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs), MDRTs are constructed using penalized empirical risk minimization with a novel sparsity-inducing penalty. Theoretically, we show that MDRTs can simultaneously adapt to the unknown sparsity and smoothness of the true regression functions, and achieve the nearly optimal rates of convergence (in a minimax sense) for the class of (α, C)-smooth functions. Empirically, MDRTs can simultaneously conduct function estimation and variable selection in high dimensions. To make MDRTs applicable for large-scale learning problems, we propose a greedy heuristics. The superior performance of MDRTs are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.575526 <a title="58-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida_Regularization_for_Grouped_Tree_Structure_Learning.html">170 nips-2010-Moreau-Yosida Regularization for Grouped Tree Structure Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Liu, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the tree structured group Lasso where the structure over the features can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as features and internal nodes as clusters of the features. The structured regularization with a pre-deﬁned tree structure is based on a group-Lasso penalty, where one group is deﬁned for each node in the tree. Such a regularization can help uncover the structured sparsity, which is desirable for applications with some meaningful tree structures on the features. However, the tree structured group Lasso is challenging to solve due to the complex regularization. In this paper, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for the tree structured group Lasso. One of the key steps in the proposed algorithm is to solve the Moreau-Yosida regularization associated with the grouped tree structure. The main technical contributions of this paper include (1) we show that the associated Moreau-Yosida regularization admits an analytical solution, and (2) we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for determining the effective interval for the regularization parameter. Our experimental results on the AR and JAFFE face data sets demonstrate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>5 0.548482 <a title="58-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Graph-Valued_Regression.html">108 nips-2010-Graph-Valued Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen, Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphical models encode in a graph G the dependency structure of a random vector Y . In many applications, it is of interest to model Y given another random vector X as input. We refer to the problem of estimating the graph G(x) of Y conditioned on X = x as “graph-valued regression”. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating G(x) that builds a tree on the X space just as in CART (classiﬁcation and regression trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. We call the method “Graph-optimized CART”, or GoCART. We study the theoretical properties of Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on risk minimization and tree partition consistency. We also demonstrate the application of Go-CART to a meteorological dataset, showing how graph-valued regression can provide a useful tool for analyzing complex data. 1</p><p>6 0.54239053 <a title="58-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exact_inference_and_learning_for_cumulative_distribution_functions_on_loopy_graphs.html">84 nips-2010-Exact inference and learning for cumulative distribution functions on loopy graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Bela Frigyik, Maya Gupta, Yihua Chen</p><p>Abstract: Although the Dirichlet distribution is widely used, the independence structure of its components limits its accuracy as a model. The proposed shadow Dirichlet distribution manipulates the support in order to model probability mass functions (pmfs) with dependencies or constraints that often arise in real world problems, such as regularized pmfs, monotonic pmfs, and pmfs with bounded variation. We describe some properties of this new class of distributions, provide maximum entropy constructions, give an expectation-maximization method for estimating the mean parameter, and illustrate with real data. 1 Modeling Probabilities for Machine Learning Modeling probability mass functions (pmfs) as random is useful in solving many real-world problems. A common random model for pmfs is the Dirichlet distribution [1]. The Dirichlet is conjugate to the multinomial and hence mathematically convenient for Bayesian inference, and the number of parameters is conveniently linear in the size of the sample space. However, the Dirichlet is a distribution over the entire probability simplex, and for many problems this is simply the wrong domain if there is application-speciﬁc prior knowledge that the pmfs come from a restricted subset of the simplex. For example, in natural language modeling, it is common to regularize a pmf over n-grams by some generic language model distribution q0 , that is, the pmf to be modeled is assumed to have the form θ = λq + (1 − λ)q0 for some q in the simplex, λ ∈ (0, 1) and a ﬁxed generic model q0 [2]. But once q0 and λ are ﬁxed, the pmf θ can only come from a subset of the simplex. Another natural language processing example is modeling the probability of keywords in a dictionary where some words are related, such as espresso and latte, and evidence for the one is to some extent evidence for the other. This relationship can be captured with a bounded variation model that would constrain the modeled probability of espresso to be within some of the modeled probability of latte. We show that such bounds on the variation between pmf components also restrict the domain of the pmf to a subset of the simplex. As a third example of restricting the domain, the similarity discriminant analysis classiﬁer estimates class-conditional pmfs that are constrained to be monotonically increasing over an ordered sample space of discrete similarity values [3]. In this paper we propose a simple variant of the Dirichlet whose support is a subset of the simplex, explore its properties, and show how to learn the model from data. We ﬁrst discuss the alternative solution of renormalizing the Dirichlet over the desired subset of the simplex, and other related work. Then we propose the shadow Dirichlet distribution; explain how to construct a shadow Dirichlet for three types of restricted domains: the regularized pmf case, bounded variation between pmf components, and monotonic pmfs; and discuss the most general case. We show how to use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the shadow Dirichlet parameter α, and present simulation results for the estimation. 1 Dirichlet Shadow Dirichlet Renormalized Dirichlet Figure 1: Dirichlet, shadow Dirichlet, and renormalized Dirichlet for α = [3.94 2.25 2.81]. 2 Related Work One solution to modeling pmfs on only a subset of the simplex is to simply restrict the support of ˜ ˜ the Dirichlet to the desired support S, and renormalize the Dirichlet over S (see Fig. 1 for an example). This renormalized Dirichlet has the advantage that it is still a conjugate distribution for the multinomial. Nallapati et al.considered the renormalized Dirichlet for language modeling, but found it difﬁcult to use because the density requires numerical integration to compute the normalizer [4] . In addition, there is no closed form solution for the mean, covariance, or peak of the renormalized Dirichlet, making it difﬁcult to work with. Table 1 summarizes these properties. Additionally, generating samples from the renormalized Dirichlet is inefﬁcient: one draws samples from the stan˜ dard Dirichlet, then rejects realizations that are outside S. For high-dimensional sample spaces, this could greatly increase the time to generate samples. Although the Dirichlet is a classic and popular distribution on the simplex, Aitchison warns it “is totally inadequate for the description of the variability of compositional data,” because of its “implied independence structure and so the Dirichlet class is unlikely to be of any great use for describing compositions whose components have even weak forms of dependence” [5]. Aitchison instead championed a logistic normal distribution with more parameters to control covariance between components. A number of variants of the Dirichlet that can capture more dependence have been proposed and analyzed. For example, the scaled Dirichlet enables a more ﬂexible shape for the distribution [5], but does not change the support. The original Dirichlet(α1 , α2 , . . . αd ) can be derived as Yj / j Yj where Yj ∼ Γ(αj , β), whereas the scaled Dirichlet is derived from Yj ∼ Γ(αj , βj ), resulting in α density p(θ) = γ j ( α −1 βj j θ j j βi θi )α1 +···+αd i , where β, α ∈ Rd are parameters, and γ is the normalizer. + Another variant is the generalized Dirichlet [6] which also has parameters β, α ∈ Rd , and allows + greater control of the covariance structure, again without changing the support. As perhaps ﬁrst noted by Karl Pearson [7] and expounded upon by Aitchison [5], correlations of proportional data can be very misleading. Many Dirichlet variants have been generalizations of the Connor-Mossiman variant, Dirichlet process variants, other compound Dirichlet models, and hierarchical Dirichlet models. Ongaro et al. [8] propose the ﬂexible Dirichlet distribution by forming a re-parameterized mixture of Dirichlet distributions. Rayens and Srinivasan [9] considered the dependence structure for the general Dirichlet family called the generalized Liouville distributions. In contrast to prior efforts, the shadow Dirichlet manipulates the support to achieve various kinds of dependence that arise frequently in machine learning problems. 3 Shadow Dirichlet Distribution We introduce a new distribution that we call the shadow Dirichlet distribution. Let S be the prob˜ ability (d − 1)-simplex, and let Θ ∈ S be a random pmf drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with density pD and unnormalized parameter α ∈ Rd . Then we say the random pmf Θ ∈ S is distributed + ˜ according to a shadow Dirichlet distribution if Θ = M Θ for some ﬁxed d × d left-stochastic (that ˜ is, each column of M sums to 1) full-rank (and hence invertible) matrix M , and we call Θ the gen2 erating Dirichlet of Θ, or Θ’s Dirichlet shadow. Because M is a left-stochastic linear map between ﬁnite-dimensional spaces, it is a continuous map from the convex and compact S to a convex and compact subset of S that we denote SM . The shadow Dirichlet has two parameters: the generating Dirichlet’s parameter α ∈ Rd , and the + d × d matrix M . Both α and M can be estimated from data. However, as we show in the following subsections, the matrix M can be proﬁtably used as a design parameter that is chosen based on application-speciﬁc knowledge or side-information to specify the restricted domain SM , and in that way impose dependency between the components of the random pmfs. The shadow Dirichlet density p(θ) is the normalized pushforward of the Dirichlet density, that is, it is the composition of the Dirichlet density and M −1 with the Jacobian: 1 α −1 p(θ) = (M −1 θ)j j , (1) B(α) |det(M )| j Γ(αj ) d j is the standard Dirichlet normalizer, and α0 = j=1 αj is the standard where B(α) Γ(α0 ) Dirichlet precision factor. Table 1 summarizes the basic properties of the shadow Dirichlet. Fig. 1 shows an example shadow Dirichlet distribution. Generating samples from the shadow Dirichlet is trivial: generate samples from its generating Dirichlet (for example, using stick-breaking or urn-drawing) and multiply each sample by M to create the corresponding shadow Dirichlet sample. Table 1: Table compares and summarizes the Dirichlet, renormalized Dirichlet, and shadow Dirichlet distributions.

In general, for a given λ and θ ∈ S, the following d × d matrix M will change the support to the desired subset SM by mapping the extreme points of S to the extreme points of SM : ˘ M = (1 − λ)θ1T + λI, (2) where I is the d × d identity matrix. In Section 4 we show that the M given in (2) is optimal in a maximum entropy sense. 3 3.2 Example: Bounded Variation Pmfs We describe how to use the shadow Dirichlet to model a random pmf that has bounded variation such that |θk − θl | ≤ k,l for any k, ∈ {1, 2, . . . , d} and k,l > 0. To construct speciﬁed bounds on the variation, we ﬁrst analyze the variation for a given M . For any d × d left stochastic matrix T d d ˜ ˜ ˜ M, θ = Mθ = M1j θj . . . Mdj θj , so the difference between any two entries is j=1 j=1 ˜ |Mkj − Mlj | θj . ˜ (Mkj − Mlj )θj ≤ |θk − θl | = (3) j j Thus, to obtain a distribution over pmfs with bounded |θk − θ | ≤ k,l for any k, components, it is sufﬁcient to choose components of the matrix M such that |Mkj − Mlj | ≤ k,l for all j = 1, . . . , d ˜ because θ in (3) sums to 1. One way to create such an M is using the regularization strategy described in Section 3.1. For this ˜ ˜ ˘ case, the jth component of θ is θj = M θ = λθj + (1 − λ)θj , and thus the variation between the j ith and jth component of any pmf in SM is: ˜ ˘ ˜ ˘ ˜ ˜ ˘ ˘ |θi − θj | = λθi + (1 − λ)θi − λθj − (1 − λ)θj ≤ λ θi − θj + (1 − λ) θi − θj ˘ ˘ ≤ λ + (1 − λ) max θi − θj . (4) i,j ˘ Thus by choosing an appropriate λ and regularizing pmf θ, one can impose the bounded variation ˘ to be the uniform pmf, and choose any λ ∈ (0, 1), then the matrix given by (4). For example, set θ M given by (2) will guarantee that the difference between any two entries of any pmf drawn from the shadow Dirichlet (M, α) will be less than or equal to λ. 3.3 Example: Monotonic Pmfs For pmfs over ordered components, it may be desirable to restrict the support of the random pmf distribution to only monotonically increasing pmfs (or to only monotonically decreasing pmfs). A d × d left-stochastic matrix M that will result in a shadow Dirichlet that generates only monotonically increasing d × 1 pmfs has kth column [0 . . . 0 1/(d − k + 1) . . . 1/(d − k + 1)]T , we call this the monotonic M . It is easy to see that with this M only monotonic θ’s can be produced, 1˜ 1˜ 1 ˜ because θ1 = d θ1 which is less than or equal to θ2 = d θ1 + d−1 θ2 and so on. In Section 4 we show that the monotonic M is optimal in a maximum entropy sense. Note that to provide support over both monotonically increasing and decreasing pmfs with one distribution is not achievable with a shadow Dirichlet, but could be achieved by a mixture of two shadow Dirichlets. 3.4 What Restricted Subsets are Possible? Above we have described solutions to construct M for three kinds of dependence that arise in machine learning applications. Here we consider the more general question: What subsets of the simplex can be the support of the shadow Dirichlet, and how to design a shadow Dirichlet for a particular support? For any matrix M , by the Krein-Milman theorem [10], SM = M S is the convex hull of its extreme points. If M is injective, the extreme points of SM are easy to specify, as a d × d matrix M will have d extreme points that occur for the d choices of θ that have only one nonzero component, as the rest of the θ will create a non-trivial convex combination of the columns of M , and therefore cannot result in extreme points of SM by deﬁnition. That is, the extreme points of SM are the d columns of M , and one can design any SM with d extreme points by setting the columns of M to be those extreme pmfs. However, if one wants the new support to be a polytope in the probability (d − 1)-simplex with m > d extreme points, then one must use a fat M with d × m entries. Let S m denote the probability 4 (m − 1)-simplex, then the domain of the shadow Dirichlet will be M S m , which is the convex hull of the m columns of M and forms a convex polytope in S with at most m vertices. In this case M cannot be injective, and hence it is not bijective between S m and M S m . However, a density on M S m can be deﬁned as: p(θ) = 1 B(α) ˜ {θ ˜α −1 ˜ θj j dθ. ˜ M θ=θ} j (5) On the other hand, if one wants the support to be a low-dimensional polytope subset of a higherdimensional probability simplex, then a thin d × m matrix M , where m < d, can be used to implement this. If M is injective, then it has a left inverse M ∗ that is a matrix of dimension m × d, and the normalized pushforward of the original density can be used as a density on the image M S m : p(θ) = 1 α −1 1/2 B(α) |det(M T M )| (M ∗ θ)j j , j If M is not injective then one way to determine a density is to use (5). 4 Information-theoretic Properties In this section we note two information-theoretic properties of the shadow Dirichlet. Let Θ be drawn ˜ from shadow Dirichlet density pM , and let its generating Dirichlet Θ be drawn from pD . Then the differential entropy of the shadow Dirichlet is h(pM ) = log |det(M )| + h(pD ), where h(pD ) is the differential entropy of its generating Dirichlet. In fact, the shadow Dirichlet always has less entropy than its Dirichlet shadow because log |det(M )| ≤ 0, which can be shown as a corollary to the following lemma (proof not included due to lack of space): Lemma 4.1. Let {x1 , . . . , xn } and {y1 , . . . , yn } be column vectors in Rn . If each yj is a convex n n combination of the xi ’s, i.e. yj = i=1 γji xi , i=1 γji = 1, γjk ≥ 0, ∀j, k ∈ {1, . . . , n} then |det[y1 , . . . , yn ]| ≤ |det[x1 , . . . , xn ]|. It follows from Lemma 4.1 that the constructive solutions for M given in (2) and the monotonic M are optimal in the sense of maximizing entropy: Corollary 4.1. Let Mreg be the set of left-stochastic matrices M that parameterize shadow Dirichlet ˜ ˘ ˜ ˘ distributions with support in {θ θ = λθ + (1 − λ)θ, θ ∈ S}, for a speciﬁc choice of λ and θ. Then the M given in (2) results in the shadow Dirichlet with maximum entropy, that is, (2) solves arg maxM ∈Mreg h(pM ). Corollary 4.2. Let Mmono be the set of left-stochastic matrices M that parameterize shadow Dirichlet distributions that generate only monotonic pmfs. Then the monotonic M given in Section 3.3 results in the shadow Dirichlet with maximum entropy, that is, the monotonic M solves arg maxM ∈Mmono h(pM ). 5 Estimating the Distribution from Data In this section, we discuss the estimation of α for the shadow Dirichlet and compound shadow Dirichlet, and the estimation of M . 5.1 Estimating α for the Shadow Dirichlet Let matrix M be speciﬁed (for example, as described in the subsections of Section 3), and let q be a d × N matrix where the ith column qi is the ith sample pmf for i = 1 . . . N , and let (qi )j be the jth component of the ith sample pmf for j = 1, . . . , d. Then ﬁnding the maximum likelihood estimate 5 of α for the shadow Dirichlet is straightforward:  N 1 arg max log + log  p(qi |α) ≡ arg max log B(α) |det(M )| α∈Rk α∈Rk + + i=1   1 αj −1  (˜i )j q , ≡ arg max log  B(α)N i j α∈Rk +  N α −1 (M −1 qi )j j  i j (6) where q = M −1 q. Note (6) is the maximum likelihood estimation problem for the Dirichlet dis˜ tribution given the matrix q , and can be solved using the standard methods for that problem (see ˜ e.g. [11, 12]). 5.2 Estimating α for the Compound Shadow Dirichlet For many machine learning applications the given data are modeled as samples from realizations of a random pmf, and given these samples one must estimate the random pmf model’s parameters. We refer to this case as the compound shadow Dirichlet, analogous to the compound Dirichlet (also called the multivariate P´ lya distribution). Assuming one has already speciﬁed M , we ﬁrst discuss o method of moments estimation, and then describe an expectation-maximization (EM) method for computing the maximum likelihood estimate α. ˘ One can form an estimate of α by the method of moments. For the standard compound Dirichlet, one treats the samples of the realizations as normalized empirical histograms, sets the normalized α parameter equal to the empirical mean of the normalized histograms, and uses the empirical variances to determine the precision α0 . By deﬁnition, this estimate will be less likely than the maximum likelihood estimate, but may be a practical short-cut in some cases. For the compound shadow Dirichlet, we believe the method of moments estimator will be a poorer estimate in general. The problem is that if one draws samples from a pmf θ from a restricted subset SM of the simplex, ˘ then the normalized empirical histogram θ of those samples may not be in SM . For example given a monotonic pmf, the histogram of ﬁve samples drawn from it may not be monotonic. Then the empirical mean of such normalized empirical histograms may not be in SM , and so setting the shadow Dirichlet mean M α equal to the empirical mean may lead to an infeasible estimate (one that is outside SM ). A heuristic solution is to project the empirical mean into SM ﬁrst, for example, by ﬁnding the nearest pmf in SM in squared error or relative entropy. As with the compound Dirichlet, this may still be a useful approach in practice for some problems. Next we state an EM method to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood estimate α. Let s be a d × N matrix ˘ of sample histograms from different experiments, such that the ith column si is the ith histogram for i = 1, . . . , N , and (si )j is the number of times we have observed the jth event from the ith pmf vi . Then the maximum log-likelihood estimate of α solves arg max log p(s|α) for α ∈ Rk . + If the random pmfs are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, then ﬁnding this maximum likelihood estimate requires an iterative procedure, and can be done in several ways including a gradient descent (ascent) approach. However, if the random pmfs are drawn from a shadow Dirichlet distribution, then a direct gradient descent approach is highly inconvenient as it requires taking derivatives of numerical integrals. However, it is practical to apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [13][14], as we describe in the rest of this section. Code to perform the EM estimation of α can be downloaded from idl.ee.washington.edu/publications.php. We assume that the experiments are independent and therefore p(s|α) = p({si }|α) = and hence arg maxα∈Rk log p(s|α) = arg maxα∈Rk i log p(si |α). + + i p(si |α) To apply the EM method, we consider the complete data to be the sample histograms s and the pmfs that generated them (s, v1 , v2 , . . . , vN ), whose expected log-likelihood will be maximized. Speciﬁcally, because of the assumed independence of the {vi }, the EM method requires one to repeatedly maximize the Q-function such that the estimate of α at the (m + 1)th iteration is: N α(m+1) = arg max α∈Rk + Evi |si ,α(m) [log p(vi |α)] . i=1 6 (7) Like the compound Dirichlet likelihood, the compound shadow Dirichlet likelihood is not necessarily concave. However, note that the Q-function given in (7) is concave, because log p(vi |α) = − log |det(M )| + log pD,α M −1 vi , where pD,α is the Dirichlet distribution with parameter α, and by a theorem of Ronning [11], log pD,α is a concave function, and adding a constant does not change the concavity. The Q-function is a ﬁnite integration of such concave functions and hence also concave [15]. We simplify (7) without destroying the concavity to yield the equivalent problem α(m+1) = d d arg max g(α) for α ∈ Rk , where g(α) = log Γ(α0 ) − j=1 log Γ(αj ) + j=1 βj αj , and + βj = N tij i=1 zi , 1 N where tij and zi are integrals we compute with Monte Carlo integration: d (s ) log(M −1 vi )j γi tij = SM (vi )k i k pM (vi |α(m) )dvi k=1 d zi = (vi )j k(si )k pM (vi |α(m) )dvi , γi SM k=1 where γi is the normalization constant for the multinomial with histogram si . We apply the Newton method [16] to maximize g(α), where the gradient g(α) has kth component ψ0 (α0 ) − ψ0 (α1 ) + β1 , where ψ0 denotes the digamma function. Let ψ1 denote the trigamma function, then the Hessian matrix of g(α) is: H = ψ1 (α0 )11T − diag (ψ1 (α1 ), . . . , ψ1 (αd )) . Note that because H has a very simple structure, the inversion of H required by the Newton step is greatly simpliﬁed by using the Woodbury identity [17]: H −1 = − diag(ξ1 , . . . , ξd ) − 1 1 1 [ξi ξj ]d×d , where ξ0 = ψ1 (α0 ) and ξj = ψ1 (αj ) , j = 1, . . . , d. ξ − d ξ 0 5.3 j=1 j Estimating M for the Shadow Dirichlet Thus far we have discussed how to construct M to achieve certain desired properties and how to interpret a given M ’s effect on the support. In some cases it may be useful to estimate M directly from data, for example, ﬁnding the maximum likelihood M . In general, this is a non-convex problem because the set of rank d − 1 matrices is not convex. However, we offer two approximations. First, note that as in estimating the support of a uniform distribution, the maximum likelihood M will correspond to a support that is no larger than needed to contain the convex hull of sample pmfs. Second, the mean of the empirical pmfs will be in the support, and thus a heuristic is to set the kth column of M (which corresponds to the kth vertex of the support) to be a convex combination of the kth vertex of the standard probability simplex and the empirical mean pmf. We provide code that ﬁnds the d optimal such convex combinations such that a speciﬁced percentage of the sample pmfs are within the support, which reduces the non-convex problem of ﬁnding the maximum likelihood d × d matrix M to a d-dimensional convex relaxation. 6 Demonstrations It is reasonable to believe that if the shadow Dirichlet better matches the problem’s statistics, it will perform better in practice, but an open question is how much better? To motivate the reader to investigate this question further in applications, we provide two small demonstrations. 6.1 Verifying the EM Estimation We used a broad suite of simulations to test and verify the EM estimation. Here we include a simple visual conﬁrmation that the EM estimation works: we drew 100 i.i.d. pmfs from a shadow Dirichlet with monotonic M for d = 3 and α = [3.94 2.25 2.81] (used in [18]). From each of the 100 pmfs, we drew 100 i.i.d. samples. Then we applied the EM algorithm to ﬁnd the α for both the standard compound Dirichlet, and the compound shadow Dirichlet with the correct M . Fig. 2 shows the true distribution and the two estimated distributions. 7 True Distribution (Shadow Dirichlet) Estimated Shadow Dirichlet Estimated Dirichlet Figure 2: Samples were drawn from the true distribution and the given EM method was applied to form the estimated distributions. 6.2 Estimating Proportions from Sales Manufacturers often have constrained manufacturing resources, such as equipment, inventory of raw materials, and employee time, with which to produce multiple products. The manufacturer must decide how to proportionally allocate such constrained resources across their product line based on their estimate of proportional sales. Manufacturer Artifact Puzzles gave us their past retail sales data for the 20 puzzles they sold during July 2009 through Dec 2009, which we used to predict the proportion of sales expected for each puzzle. These estimates were then tested on the next ﬁve months of sales data, for January 2010 through April 2010. The company also provided a similarity between puzzles S, where S(A, B) is the proportion of times an order during the six training months included both puzzle A and B if it included puzzle A. We compared treating each of the six training months of sales data as a sample from a compound Dirichlet versus or a compound shadow Dirichlet. For the shadow Dirichlet, we normalized each column of the similarity matrix S to sum to one so that it was left-stochastic, and used that as the M matrix; this forces puzzles that are often bought together to have closer estimated proportions. We estimated each α parameter by EM to maximize the likelihood of the past sales data, and then estimated the future sales proportions to be the mean of the estimated Dirichlet or shadow Dirichlet distribution. We also compared with treating all six months of sales data as coming from one multinomial which we estimated as the maximum likelihood multinomial, and to taking the mean of the six empirical pmfs.

We have discussed some of its theoretical properties, and shown how to specify the distribution for regularized pmfs, bounded variation pmfs, monotonic pmfs, and for any desired convex polytopal domain. We have derived the EM method and made available code to estimate both the shadow Dirichlet and compound shadow Dirichlet from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the EM method can estimate the shadow Dirichlet effectively, and that the shadow Dirichlet may provide worthwhile advantages in practice. 8 References [1] B.

<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Sujay Sanghavi, Chao Ruan, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-task learning in the setting of multiple linear regression, and where some relevant features could be shared across the tasks. Recent research has studied the use of ℓ1 /ℓq norm block-regularizations with q > 1 for such blocksparse structured problems, establishing strong guarantees on recovery even under high-dimensional scaling where the number of features scale with the number of observations. However, these papers also caution that the performance of such block-regularized methods are very dependent on the extent to which the features are shared across tasks. Indeed they show [8] that if the extent of overlap is less than a threshold, or even if parameter values in the shared features are highly uneven, then block ℓ1 /ℓq regularization could actually perform worse than simple separate elementwise ℓ1 regularization. Since these caveats depend on the unknown true parameters, we might not know when and which method to apply. Even otherwise, we are far away from a realistic multi-task setting: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same across tasks, but their values have to as well. Here, we ask the question: can we leverage parameter overlap when it exists, but not pay a penalty when it does not ? Indeed, this falls under a more general question of whether we can model such dirty data which may not fall into a single neat structural bracket (all block-sparse, or all low-rank and so on). With the explosion of such dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to develop tools – dirty models – to perform biased statistical estimation tailored to such data. Here, we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on developing a dirty model for the multiple regression problem. Our method uses a very simple idea: we estimate a superposition of two sets of parameters and regularize them differently. We show both theoretically and empirically, our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both ℓ1 or ℓ1 /ℓq methods, under high-dimensional scaling and over the entire range of possible overlaps (except at boundary cases, where we match the best method). 1 Introduction: Motivation and Setup High-dimensional scaling. In ﬁelds across science and engineering, we are increasingly faced with problems where the number of variables or features p is larger than the number of observations n. Under such high-dimensional scaling, for any hope of statistically consistent estimation, it becomes vital to leverage any potential structure in the problem such as sparsity (e.g. in compressed sensing [3] and LASSO [14]), low-rank structure [13, 9], or sparse graphical model structure [12]. It is in such high-dimensional contexts in particular that multi-task learning [4] could be most useful. Here, 1 multiple tasks share some common structure such as sparsity, and estimating these tasks jointly by leveraging this common structure could be more statistically efﬁcient. Block-sparse Multiple Regression. A common multiple task learning setting, and which is the focus of this paper, is that of multiple regression, where we have r > 1 response variables, and a common set of p features or covariates. The r tasks could share certain aspects of their underlying distributions, such as common variance, but the setting we focus on in this paper is where the response variables have simultaneously sparse structure: the index set of relevant features for each task is sparse; and there is a large overlap of these relevant features across the different regression problems. Such “simultaneous sparsity” arises in a variety of contexts [15]; indeed, most applications of sparse signal recovery in contexts ranging from graphical model learning, kernel learning, and function estimation have natural extensions to the simultaneous-sparse setting [12, 2, 11]. It is useful to represent the multiple regression parameters via a matrix, where each column corresponds to a task, and each row to a feature. Having simultaneous sparse structure then corresponds to the matrix being largely “block-sparse” – where each row is either all zero or mostly non-zero, and the number of non-zero rows is small. A lot of recent research in this setting has focused on ℓ1 /ℓq norm regularizations, for q > 1, that encourage the parameter matrix to have such blocksparse structure. Particular examples include results using the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ norm [16, 5, 8], and the ℓ1 /ℓ2 norm [7, 10]. Dirty Models. Block-regularization is “heavy-handed” in two ways. By strictly encouraging sharedsparsity, it assumes that all relevant features are shared, and hence suffers under settings, arguably more realistic, where each task depends on features speciﬁc to itself in addition to the ones that are common. The second concern with such block-sparse regularizers is that the ℓ1 /ℓq norms can be shown to encourage the entries in the non-sparse rows taking nearly identical values. Thus we are far away from the original goal of multitask learning: not only do the set of relevant features have to be exactly the same, but their values have to as well. Indeed recent research into such regularized methods [8, 10] caution against the use of block-regularization in regimes where the supports and values of the parameters for each task can vary widely. Since the true parameter values are unknown, that would be a worrisome caveat. We thus ask the question: can we learn multiple regression models by leveraging whatever overlap of features there exist, and without requiring the parameter values to be near identical? Indeed this is an instance of a more general question on whether we can estimate statistical models where the data may not fall cleanly into any one structural bracket (sparse, block-sparse and so on). With the explosion of dirty high-dimensional data in modern settings, it is vital to investigate estimation of corresponding dirty models, which might require new approaches to biased high-dimensional estimation. In this paper we take a ﬁrst step, focusing on such dirty models for a speciﬁc problem: simultaneously sparse multiple regression. Our approach uses a simple idea: while any one structure might not capture the data, a superposition of structural classes might. Our method thus searches for a parameter matrix that can be decomposed into a row-sparse matrix (corresponding to the overlapping or shared features) and an elementwise sparse matrix (corresponding to the non-shared features). As we show both theoretically and empirically, with this simple ﬁx we are able to leverage any extent of shared features, while allowing disparities in support and values of the parameters, so that we are always better than both the Lasso or block-sparse regularizers (at times remarkably so). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec 2. basic deﬁnitions and setup of the problem are presented. Main results of the paper is discussed in sec 3. Experimental results and simulations are demonstrated in Sec 4. Notation: For any matrix M , we denote its j th row as Mj , and its k-th column as M (k) . The set of all non-zero rows (i.e. all rows with at least one non-zero element) is denoted by RowSupp(M ) (k) and its support by Supp(M ). Also, for any matrix M , let M 1,1 := j,k |Mj |, i.e. the sums of absolute values of the elements, and M 1,∞ := j 2 Mj ∞ where, Mj ∞ (k) := maxk |Mj |. 2 Problem Set-up and Our Method Multiple regression. We consider the following standard multiple linear regression model: ¯ y (k) = X (k) θ(k) + w(k) , k = 1, . . . , r, where y (k) ∈ Rn is the response for the k-th task, regressed on the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p (possibly different across tasks), while w(k) ∈ Rn is the noise vector. We assume each w(k) is drawn independently from N (0, σ 2 ). The total number of tasks or target variables is r, the number of features is p, while the number of samples we have for each task is n. For notational convenience, ¯ we collate these quantities into matrices Y ∈ Rn×r for the responses, Θ ∈ Rp×r for the regression n×r parameters and W ∈ R for the noise. ¯ Dirty Model. In this paper we are interested in estimating the true parameter Θ from data by lever¯ aging any (unknown) extent of simultaneous-sparsity. In particular, certain rows of Θ would have many non-zero entries, corresponding to features shared by several tasks (“shared” rows), while certain rows would be elementwise sparse, corresponding to those features which are relevant for some tasks but not all (“non-shared rows”), while certain rows would have all zero entries, corresponding to those features that are not relevant to any task. We are interested in estimators Θ that automatically adapt to different levels of sharedness, and yet enjoy the following guarantees: Support recovery: We say an estimator Θ successfully recovers the true signed support if ¯ sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign(Supp(Θ)). We are interested in deriving sufﬁcient conditions under which ¯ the estimator succeeds. We note that this is stronger than merely recovering the row-support of Θ, which is union of its supports for the different tasks. In particular, denoting Uk for the support of the ¯ k-th column of Θ, and U = k Uk . Error bounds: We are also interested in providing bounds on the elementwise ℓ∞ norm error of the estimator Θ, ¯ Θ−Θ 2.1 ∞ = max max j=1,...,p k=1,...,r (k) Θj (k) ¯ − Θj . Our Method Our method explicitly models the dirty block-sparse structure. We estimate a sum of two parameter matrices B and S with different regularizations for each: encouraging block-structured row-sparsity in B and elementwise sparsity in S. The corresponding “clean” models would either just use blocksparse regularizations [8, 10] or just elementwise sparsity regularizations [14, 18], so that either method would perform better in certain suited regimes. Interestingly, as we will see in the main results, by explicitly allowing to have both block-sparse and elementwise sparse component, we are ¯ able to outperform both classes of these “clean models”, for all regimes Θ. Algorithm 1 Dirty Block Sparse Solve the following convex optimization problem: (S, B) ∈ arg min S,B 1 2n r k=1 y (k) − X (k) S (k) + B (k) 2 2 + λs S 1,1 + λb B 1,∞ . (1) Then output Θ = B + S. 3 Main Results and Their Consequences We now provide precise statements of our main results. A number of recent results have shown that the Lasso [14, 18] and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization [8] methods succeed in recovering signed supports with controlled error bounds under high-dimensional scaling regimes. Our ﬁrst two theorems extend these results to our dirty model setting. In Theorem 1, we consider the case of deterministic design matrices X (k) , and provide sufﬁcient conditions guaranteeing signed support recovery, and elementwise ℓ∞ norm error bounds. In Theorem 2, we specialize this theorem to the case where the 3 rows of the design matrices are random from a general zero mean Gaussian distribution: this allows us to provide scaling on the number of observations required in order to guarantee signed support recovery and bounded elementwise ℓ∞ norm error. Our third result is the most interesting in that it explicitly quantiﬁes the performance gains of our method vis-a-vis Lasso and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ block-regularization method. Since this entailed ﬁnding the precise constants underlying earlier theorems, and a correspondingly more delicate analysis, we follow Negahban and Wainwright [8] and focus on the case where there are two-tasks (i.e. r = 2), and where we have standard Gaussian design matrices as in Theorem 2. Further, while each of two tasks depends on s features, only a fraction α of these are common. It is then interesting to see how the behaviors of the different regularization methods vary with the extent of overlap α. Comparisons. Negahban and Wainwright [8] show that there is actually a “phase transition” in the scaling of the probability of successful signed support-recovery with the number of observations. n Denote a particular rescaling of the sample-size θLasso (n, p, α) = s log(p−s) . Then as Wainwright [18] show, when the rescaled number of samples scales as θLasso > 2 + δ for any δ > 0, Lasso succeeds in recovering the signed support of all columns with probability converging to one. But when the sample size scales as θLasso < 2−δ for any δ > 0, Lasso fails with probability converging to one. For the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -reguralized multiple linear regression, deﬁne a similar rescaled sample size n θ1,∞ (n, p, α) = s log(p−(2−α)s) . Then as Negahban and Wainwright [8] show there is again a transition in probability of success from near zero to near one, at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (4 − 3α). Thus, for α < 2/3 (“less sharing”) Lasso would perform better since its transition is at a smaller sample size, while for α > 2/3 (“more sharing”) the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method would perform better. As we show in our third theorem, the phase transition for our method occurs at the rescaled sample size of θ1,∞ = (2 − α), which is strictly before either the Lasso or the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularized method except for the boundary cases: α = 0, i.e. the case of no sharing, where we match Lasso, and for α = 1, i.e. full sharing, where we match ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . Everywhere else, we strictly outperform both methods. Figure 3 shows the empirical performance of each of the three methods; as can be seen, they agree very well with the theoretical analysis. (Further details in the experiments Section 4). 3.1 Sufﬁcient Conditions for Deterministic Designs We ﬁrst consider the case where the design matrices X (k) for k = 1, · · ·, r are deterministic, and start by specifying the assumptions we impose on the model. We note that similar sufﬁcient conditions for the deterministic X (k) ’s case were imposed in papers analyzing Lasso [18] and block-regularization methods [8, 10]. (k) A0 Column Normalization Xj 2 ≤ √ 2n for all j = 1, . . . , p, k = 1, . . . , r. ¯ Let Uk denote the support of the k-th column of Θ, and U = supports for each task. Then we require that k r A1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Xj , XUk (k) (k) XUk , XUk Uk denote the union of −1 c We will also ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne γs := 1−max1≤k≤r maxj∈Uk (k) > 0. 1 k=1 (k) Xj , XUk Note that by the incoherence condition A1, we have γs > 0.

Further, we require the regularization penalties be set as λs > 2(2 − γs )σ log(pr) √ γs n and 4 λb > 2(2 − γb )σ log(pr) √ . γb n (2) 1 0.9 0.8 0.8 Dirty Model L1/Linf Reguralizer Probability of Success Probability of Success 1 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 LASSO 0.3 0.2 0 0.5 1 1.5 1.7 2 2.5 Control Parameter θ 3 3.1 3.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.3 LASSO 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 Dirty Model 0.7 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 4 1 1.333 (a) α = 0.3 1.5 2 Control Parameter θ (b) α = 2.5 3 2 3 1 0.9 Dirty Model Probability of Success 0.8 0.7 L1/Linf Reguralizer 0.6 0.5 LASSO 0.4 0.3 0.2 p=128 p=256 p=512 0.1 0 0.5 1 1.2 1.5 1.6 2 Control Parameter θ 2.5 (c) α = 0.8 Figure 1: Probability of success in recovering the true signed support using dirty model, Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. For a 2-task problem, the probability of success for different values of feature-overlap fraction α is plotted. As we can see in the regimes that Lasso is better than, as good as and worse than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer ((a), (b) and (c) respectively), the dirty model outperforms both of the methods, i.e., it requires less number of observations for successful recovery of the true signed support compared to Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Here p s = ⌊ 10 ⌋ always. Theorem 1. Suppose A0-A3 hold, and that we obtain estimate Θ from our algorithm with regularization parameters chosen according to (2). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) → 1, we are guaranteed that the convex program (1) has a unique optimum and (a) The estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ 4σ 2 log (pr) + λs Dmax . n Cmin ≤ bmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > bmin . Here the positive constants c1 , c2 depend only on γs , γb , λs , λb and σ, but are otherwise independent of n, p, r, the problem dimensions of interest. Remark: Condition (a) guarantees that the estimate will have no false inclusions; i.e. all included features will be relevant. If in addition, we require that it have no false exclusions and that recover the support exactly, we need to impose the assumption in (b) that the non-zero elements are large enough to be detectable above the noise. 3.2 General Gaussian Designs Often the design matrices consist of samples from a Gaussian ensemble. Suppose that for each task (k) k = 1, . . . , r the design matrix X (k) ∈ Rn×p is such that each row Xi ∈ Rp is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix Σ(k) ∈ Rp×p , and is independent of every other (k) row. Let ΣV,U ∈ R|V|×|U | be the submatrix of Σ(k) with rows corresponding to V and columns to U . We require these covariance matrices to satisfy the following conditions: r C1 Incoherence Condition γb := 1 − max c j∈U (k) (k) Σj,Uk , ΣUk ,Uk k=1 5 −1 >0 1 C2 Eigenvalue Condition Cmin := min λmin Σ(k),Uk Uk > 0 so that the minimum eigenvalue 1≤k≤r is bounded away from zero. C3 Boundedness Condition Dmax := (k) ΣUk ,Uk −1 ∞,1 < ∞. These conditions are analogues of the conditions for deterministic designs; they are now imposed on the covariance matrix of the (randomly generated) rows of the design matrix. Further, deﬁning s := maxk |Uk |, we require the regularization penalties be set as 1/2 λs > 1/2 4σ 2 Cmin log(pr) √ γs nCmin − 2s log(pr) and λb > 4σ 2 Cmin r(r log(2) + log(p)) . √ γb nCmin − 2sr(r log(2) + log(p)) (3) Theorem 2. Suppose assumptions C1-C3 hold, and that the number of samples scale as n > max 2s log(pr) 2sr r log(2)+log(p) 2 2 Cmin γs , Cmin γb . Suppose we obtain estimate Θ from algorithm (3). Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp (−c2 (r log(2) + log(p))) − c3 exp(−c4 log(rs)) → 1 for some positive numbers c1 − c4 , we are guaranteed that the algorithm estimate Θ is unique and satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) the estimate Θ has no false inclusions, and has bounded ℓ∞ norm error so that ¯ Supp(Θ) ⊆ Supp(Θ), and ¯ Θ−Θ ∞,∞ ≤ 50σ 2 log(rs) + λs nCmin 4s √ + Dmax . Cmin n gmin ¯ (b) sign(Supp(Θ)) = sign Supp(Θ) provided that 3.3 min ¯ (j,k)∈Supp(Θ) ¯(k) θj > gmin . Sharp Transition for 2-Task Gaussian Designs This is one of the most important results of this paper. Here, we perform a more delicate and ﬁner analysis to establish precise quantitative gains of our method. We focus on the special case where r = 2 and the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ), so that C1 − C3 hold, with Cmin = Dmax = 1. As we will see both analytically and experimentally, our method strictly outperforms both Lasso and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ -block-regularization over for all cases, except at the extreme endpoints of no support sharing (where it matches that of Lasso) and full support sharing (where it matches that of ℓ1 /ℓ∞ ). We now present our analytical results; the empirical comparisons are presented next in Section 4. The results will be in terms of a particular rescaling of the sample size n as θ(n, p, s, α) := n . (2 − α)s log (p − (2 − α)s) We will also require the assumptions that 4σ 2 (1 − F1 λs > F2 λb > s/n)(log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((2 − α) s (log(r) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 4σ 2 (1 − s/n)r(r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)) , 1/2 (n)1/2 − (s)1/2 − ((1 − α/2) sr (r log(2) + log(p − (2 − α)s)))1/2 . Theorem 3. Consider a 2-task regression problem (n, p, s, α), where the design matrix has rows generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, In×n ). 6 Suppose maxj∈B∗ ∗(1) Θj − ∗(2) Θj = o(λs ), where B ∗ is the submatrix of Θ∗ with rows where both entries are non-zero. Then the estimate Θ of the problem (1) satisﬁes the following: (Success) Suppose the regularization coefﬁcients satisfy F1 − F2. Further, assume that the number of samples scales as θ(n, p, s, α) > 1. Then, with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 n) for some positive numbers c1 and c2 , we are guaranteed that Θ satisﬁes the support-recovery and ℓ∞ error bound conditions (a-b) in Theorem 2. ˆ ˆ (Failure) If θ(n, p, s, α) < 1 there is no solution (B, S) for any choices of λs and λb such that ¯ sign Supp(Θ) = sign Supp(Θ) . We note that we require the gap ∗(1) Θj ∗(2) − Θj to be small only on rows where both entries are non-zero. As we show in a more general theorem in the appendix, even in the case where the gap is large, the dependence of the sample scaling on the gap is quite weak. 4 Empirical Results In this section, we investigate the performance of our dirty block sparse estimator on synthetic and real-world data. The synthetic experiments explore the accuracy of Theorem 3, and compare our estimator with LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We see that Theorem 3 is very accurate indeed. Next, we apply our method to a real world datasets containing hand-written digits for classiﬁcation. Again we compare against LASSO and the ℓ1 /ℓ∞ . (a multi-task regression dataset) with r = 2 tasks. In both of this real world dataset, we show that dirty model outperforms both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ practically. For each method, the parameters are chosen via cross-validation; see supplemental material for more details. 4.1 Synthetic Data Simulation We consider a r = 2-task regression problem as discussed in Theorem 3, for a range of parameters (n, p, s, α). The design matrices X have each entry being i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. For each ﬁxed set of (n, s, p, α), we generate 100 instances of the problem. In each instance, ¯ given p, s, α, the locations of the non-zero entries of the true Θ are chosen at randomly; each nonzero entry is then chosen to be i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. n samples are then generated from this. We then attempt to estimate using three methods: our dirty model, ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer and LASSO. In each case, and for each instance, the penalty regularizer coefﬁcients are found by cross validation. After solving the three problems, we compare the signed support of the solution with the true signed support and decide whether or not the program was successful in signed support recovery. We describe these process in more details in this section. Performance Analysis: We ran the algorithm for ﬁve different values of the overlap ratio α ∈ 2 {0.3, 3 , 0.8} with three different number of features p ∈ {128, 256, 512}. For any instance of the ˆ ¯ problem (n, p, s, α), if the recovered matrix Θ has the same sign support as the true Θ, then we count it as success, otherwise failure (even if one element has different sign, we count it as failure). As Theorem 3 predicts and Fig 3 shows, the right scaling for the number of oservations is n s log(p−(2−α)s) , where all curves stack on the top of each other at 2 − α. Also, the number of observations required by dirty model for true signed support recovery is always less than both LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. Fig 1(a) shows the probability of success for the case α = 0.3 (when LASSO is better than ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer) and that dirty model outperforms both methods. When α = 2 3 (see Fig 1(b)), LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer performs the same; but dirty model require almost 33% less observations for the same performance. As α grows toward 1, e.g. α = 0.8 as shown in Fig 1(c), ℓ1 /ℓ∞ performs better than LASSO. Still, dirty model performs better than both methods in this case as well. 7 4 p=128 p=256 p=512 Phase Transition Threshold 3.5 L1/Linf Regularizer 3 2.5 LASSO 2 Dirty Model 1.5 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Shared Support Parameter α 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 2: Veriﬁcation of the result of the Theorem 3 on the behavior of phase transition threshold by changing the parameter α in a 2-task (n, p, s, α) problem for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer.

For ﬁve different values of 2 α ∈ {0.05, 0.3, 3 , 0.8, 0.95} and three different values of p ∈ {128, 256, 512}, we ﬁnd the phase transition threshold for dirty model, LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. We consider the point where the probability of success in recovery of signed support exceeds 50% as the phase transition threshold. We ﬁnd this point by interpolation on the closest two points. Fig 2 shows that phase transition threshold for dirty model is always lower than the phase transition for LASSO and ℓ1 /ℓ∞ regularizer. 4.2 Handwritten Digits Dataset We use the handwritten digit dataset [1], containing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. This dataset has been used by a number of papers [17, 6] as a reliable dataset for handwritten recognition algorithms. There are thus r = 10 tasks, and each handwritten sample consists of p = 649 features. Table 1 shows the results of our analysis for different sizes n of the training set . We measure the classiﬁcation error for each digit to get the 10-vector of errors. Then, we ﬁnd the average error and the variance of the error vector to show how the error is distributed over all tasks. We compare our method with ℓ1 /ℓ∞ reguralizer method and LASSO. Again, in all methods, parameters are chosen via cross-validation. For our method we separate out the B and S matrices that our method ﬁnds, so as to illustrate how many features it identiﬁes as “shared” and how many as “non-shared”. For the other methods we just report the straight row and support numbers, since they do not make such a separation.

<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.69613379 <a title="58-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Lower_Bounds_on_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Cutting_Plane_Methods.html">163 nips-2010-Lower Bounds on Rate of Convergence of Cutting Plane Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Ankan Saha, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: In a recent paper Joachims [1] presented SVM-Perf, a cutting plane method (CPM) for training linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which converges to an accurate solution in O(1/ 2 ) iterations. By tightening the analysis, Teo et al. [2] showed that O(1/ ) iterations sufﬁce. Given the impressive convergence speed of CPM on a number of practical problems, it was conjectured that these rates could be further improved. In this paper we disprove this conjecture. We present counter examples which are not only applicable for training linear SVMs with hinge loss, but also hold for support vector methods which optimize a multivariate performance score. However, surprisingly, these problems are not inherently hard. By exploiting the structure of the objective function we can devise an algo√ rithm that converges in O(1/ ) iterations. 1</p><p>6 0.69559914 <a title="58-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Probabilistic_Belief_Revision_with_Structural_Constraints.html">214 nips-2010-Probabilistic Belief Revision with Structural Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>3 0.19383168 <a title="60-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Tree-Structured_Stick_Breaking_for_Hierarchical_Data.html">276 nips-2010-Tree-Structured Stick Breaking for Hierarchical Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Michael I. Jordan, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a ﬂexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are inﬁnitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing inﬁnite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data. 1</p><p>4 0.19091488 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Word_Features_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">286 nips-2010-Word Features for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

Smola</p><p>Abstract: We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by explicitly allowing for the encoding of side information in the distribution over words. This results in a variety of new capabilities, such as improved estimates for infrequently occurring words, as well as the ability to leverage thesauri and dictionaries in order to boost topic cohesion within and across languages. We present experiments on multi-language topic synchronisation where dictionary information is used to bias corresponding words towards similar topics. Results indicate that our model substantially improves topic cohesion when compared to the standard LDA model. 1</p><p>5 0.14782009 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.13738611 <a title="60-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_concept_graphs_from_text_with_stick-breaking_priors.html">150 nips-2010-Learning concept graphs from text with stick-breaking priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Wang, Dehong Liu, Jorge Silva, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: We consider problems for which one has incomplete binary matrices that evolve with time (e.g., the votes of legislators on particular legislation, with each year characterized by a different such matrix). An objective of such analysis is to infer structure and inter-relationships underlying the matrices, here deﬁned by latent features associated with each axis of the matrix. In addition, it is assumed that documents are available for the entities associated with at least one of the matrix axes. By jointly analyzing the matrices and documents, one may be used to inform the other within the analysis, and the model offers the opportunity to predict matrix values (e.g., votes) based only on an associated document (e.g., legislation). The research presented here merges two areas of machine-learning that have previously been investigated separately: incomplete-matrix analysis and topic modeling. The analysis is performed from a Bayesian perspective, with efﬁcient inference constituted via Gibbs sampling. The framework is demonstrated by considering all voting data and available documents (legislation) during the 220-year lifetime of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. 1</p><p>5 0.5752269 <a title="60-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Global_Analytic_Solution_for_Variational_Bayesian_Matrix_Factorization.html">106 nips-2010-Global Analytic Solution for Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shinichi Nakajima, Masashi Sugiyama, Ryota Tomioka</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian methods of matrix factorization (MF) have been actively explored recently as promising alternatives to classical singular value decomposition. In this paper, we show that, despite the fact that the optimization problem is non-convex, the global optimal solution of variational Bayesian (VB) MF can be computed analytically by solving a quartic equation. This is highly advantageous over a popular VBMF algorithm based on iterated conditional modes since it can only ﬁnd a local optimal solution after iterations. We further show that the global optimal solution of empirical VBMF (hyperparameters are also learned from data) can also be analytically computed. We illustrate the usefulness of our results through experiments.</p><p>6 0.45500526 <a title="60-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Worst-Case_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis.html">287 nips-2010-Worst-Case Linear Discriminant Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: David Silver, Joel Veness</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent’s belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, MonteCarlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan eﬀectively in signiﬁcantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 × 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 1018 and 1056 states respectively. Our MonteCarlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the ﬁrst general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs. 1</p><p>4 0.77206707 <a title="60-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Group_Sparse_Regularization_with_Overlapping_Groups.html">12 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Group Sparse Regularization with Overlapping Groups</a></p>
<p>Author: Sofia Mosci, Silvia Villa, Alessandro Verri, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of variable selection when variables must be selected group-wise, with possibly overlapping groups deﬁned a priori. In particular we propose a new optimization procedure for solving the regularized algorithm presented in [12], where the group lasso penalty is generalized to overlapping groups of variables. While in [12] the proposed implementation requires explicit replication of the variables belonging to more than one group, our iterative procedure is based on a combination of proximal methods in the primal space and projected Newton method in a reduced dual space, corresponding to the active groups. This procedure provides a scalable alternative with no need for data duplication, and allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction. The computational advantages of our scheme with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms using data duplication are shown empirically with numerical simulations. 1</p><p>5 0.75005531 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Parallelized_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.html">202 nips-2010-Parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Markus Weimer, Lihong Li, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the ﬁrst parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits.

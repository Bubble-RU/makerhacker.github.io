<p>Author: Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many machine learning domains (such as scene understanding), several related sub-tasks (such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection) operate on the same raw data and provide correlated outputs. Each of these tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classiﬁers already exist for many subtasks. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classiﬁer. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (FE-CCM), that maximizes the joint likelihood of the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classiﬁer for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classiﬁers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the ﬁrst layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classiﬁers to provide earlier classiﬁers information about what error modes to focus on. We show that our method signiﬁcantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in two different domains: (i) scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection, and (ii) robotic grasping, where we consider grasp point detection and object classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.22572944 <a title="241-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: A standard approach to learning object category detectors is to provide strong supervision in the form of a region of interest (ROI) specifying each instance of the object in the training images [17]. In this work are goal is to learn from heterogeneous labels, in which some images are only weakly supervised, specifying only the presence or absence of the object or a weak indication of object location, whilst others are fully annotated. To this end we develop a discriminative learning approach and make two contributions: (i) we propose a structured output formulation for weakly annotated images where full annotations are treated as latent variables; and (ii) we propose to optimize a ranking objective function, allowing our method to more effectively use negatively labeled images to improve detection average precision performance. The method is demonstrated on the benchmark INRIA pedestrian detection dataset of Dalal and Triggs [14] and the PASCAL VOC dataset [17], and it is shown that for a signiﬁcant proportion of weakly supervised images the performance achieved is very similar to the fully supervised (state of the art) results. 1</p><p>4 0.18018182 <a title="241-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: The design of low-level image features is critical for computer vision algorithms. Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT [16] and HOG [3], are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a uniﬁed and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) [23]. Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classiﬁcation benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet.</p><p>5 0.17584923 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Object_Bank%3A_A_High-Level_Image_Representation_for_Scene_Classification_%26_Semantic_Feature_Sparsification.html">186 nips-2010-Object Bank: A High-Level Image Representation for Scene Classification & Semantic Feature Sparsification</a></p>
<p>Author: Li-jia Li, Hao Su, Li Fei-fei, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Robust low-level image features have been proven to be effective representations for a variety of visual recognition tasks such as object recognition and scene classiﬁcation; but pixels, or even local image patches, carry little semantic meanings. For high level visual tasks, such low-level image representations are potentially not enough. In this paper, we propose a high-level image representation, called the Object Bank, where an image is represented as a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, blind to the testing dataset or visual task. Leveraging on the Object Bank representation, superior performances on high level visual recognition tasks can be achieved with simple off-the-shelf classiﬁers such as logistic regression and linear SVM. Sparsity algorithms make our representation more efﬁcient and scalable for large scene datasets, and reveal semantically meaningful feature patterns.</p><p>6 0.17582336 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Large_Margin_Learning_of_Upstream_Scene_Understanding_Models.html">137 nips-2010-Large Margin Learning of Upstream Scene Understanding Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhinav Gupta, Martial Hebert, Takeo Kanade, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: There has been a recent push in extraction of 3D spatial layout of scenes. However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world. We show that augmenting current structured prediction techniques with volumetric reasoning signiﬁcantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.80944359 <a title="241-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Large_Margin_Learning_of_Upstream_Scene_Understanding_Models.html">137 nips-2010-Large Margin Learning of Upstream Scene Understanding Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Li-jia Li, Li Fei-fei, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Upstream supervised topic models have been widely used for complicated scene understanding. However, existing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) schemes can make the prediction model learning independent of latent topic discovery and result in an imbalanced prediction rule for scene classiﬁcation. This paper presents a joint max-margin and max-likelihood learning method for upstream scene understanding models, in which latent topic discovery and prediction model estimation are closely coupled and well-balanced. The optimization problem is efﬁciently solved with a variational EM procedure, which iteratively solves an online loss-augmented SVM. We demonstrate the advantages of the large-margin approach on both an 8-category sports dataset and the 67-class MIT indoor scene dataset for scene categorization.</p><p>5 0.75038052 <a title="241-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Space-Variant_Single-Image_Blind_Deconvolution_for_Removing_Camera_Shake.html">245 nips-2010-Space-Variant Single-Image Blind Deconvolution for Removing Camera Shake</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Hirsch Michael, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Modelling camera shake as a space-invariant convolution simpliﬁes the problem of removing camera shake, but often insufﬁciently models actual motion blur such as those due to camera rotation and movements outside the sensor plane or when objects in the scene have different distances to the camera. In an effort to address these limitations, (i) we introduce a taxonomy of camera shakes, (ii) we build on a recently introduced framework for space-variant ﬁltering by Hirsch et al. and a fast algorithm for single image blind deconvolution for space-invariant ﬁlters by Cho and Lee to construct a method for blind deconvolution in the case of space-variant blur, and (iii), we present an experimental setup for evaluation that allows us to take images with real camera shake while at the same time recording the spacevariant point spread function corresponding to that blur. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is able to deblur images degraded by spatially-varying blur originating from real camera shake, even without using additionally motion sensor information. 1</p><p>6 0.74481612 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Tungyou Lin, Alan Lee, Luminita Vese, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84271741 <a title="241-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>3 0.80732059 <a title="241-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>4 0.80357128 <a title="241-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Inferring_Stimulus_Selectivity_from_the_Spatial_Structure_of_Neural_Network_Dynamics.html">127 nips-2010-Inferring Stimulus Selectivity from the Spatial Structure of Neural Network Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Kanaka Rajan, L Abbott, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: How are the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked population responses related? We study the impact of connectivity on the spatial pattern of ﬂuctuations in the input-generated response, by comparing the distribution of evoked and intrinsically generated activity across the different units of a neural network. We develop a complementary approach to principal component analysis in which separate high-variance directions are derived for each input condition. We analyze subspace angles to compute the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, and the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces that driven trajectories occupy within the full space of neuronal activity. In addition to revealing how the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous activity affects input-evoked responses, these methods can be used to infer input selectivity induced by network dynamics from experimentally accessible measures of spontaneous activity (e.g. from voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical imaging experiments). We conclude that the absence of a detailed spatial map of afferent inputs and cortical connectivity does not limit our ability to design spatially extended stimuli that evoke strong responses. 1 1 Motivation Stimulus selectivity in neural networks was historically measured directly from input-driven responses [1], and only later were similar selectivity patterns observed in spontaneous activity across the cortical surface [2, 3]. We argue that it is possible to work in the reverse order, and show that analyzing the distribution of spontaneous activity across the different units in the network can inform us about the selectivity of evoked responses to stimulus features, even when no apparent sensory map exists. Sensory-evoked responses are typically divided into a signal component generated by the stimulus and a noise component corresponding to ongoing activity that is not directly related to the stimulus. Subsequent effort focuses on understanding how the signal depends on properties of the stimulus, while the remaining, irregular part of the response is treated as additive noise. The distinction between external stochastic processes and the noise generated deterministically as a function of intrinsic recurrence has been previously studied in chaotic neural networks [4]. It has also been suggested that internally generated noise is not additive and can be more sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the input, compared to the signal component of the response [5 - 8]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between deterministic intrinsic noise and the spatial properties of the external stimulus is also complex and nonlinear. We study the impact of network connectivity on the spatial pattern of input-driven responses by comparing the structure of evoked and spontaneous activity, and show how the unique signature of these dynamics determines the selectivity of networks to spatial features of the stimuli driving them. 2 Model description In this section, we describe the network model and the methods we use to analyze its dynamics. Subsequent sections explore how the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked responses are related in terms of the distribution of the activity across the network. Finally, we show how the stimulus selectivity of the network can be inferred from its spontaneous activity patterns. 2.1 Network elements We build a ﬁring rate model of N interconnected units characterized by a statistical description of the underlying circuitry (as N → ∞, the system “self averages” making the description independent of a speciﬁc network architecture, see also [11, 12]). Each unit is characterized by an activation variable xi ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N , and a nonlinear response function ri which relates to xi through ri = R0 + φ(xi ) where,   R0 tanh x for x ≤ 0 R0 φ(x) = (1) x  (Rmax − R0 ) tanh otherwise. Rmax −R0 Eq. 1 allows us to independently set the maximum ﬁring rate Rmax and the background rate R0 to biologically reasonable values, while retaining a maximum gradient at x = 0 to guarantee the smoothness of the transition to chaos [4]. We introduce a recurrent weight matrix with element Jij equivalent to the strength of the synapse from unit j → unit i. The individual weights are chosen independently and randomly from a Gaus2 sian distribution with mean and variance given by [Jij ]J = 0 and Jij J = g 2 /N , where square brackets are ensemble averages [9 - 11,13]. The control parameter g which scales as the variance of the synaptic weights, is particularly important in determining whether or not the network produces spontaneous activity with non-trivial dynamics (Speciﬁcally, g = 0 corresponds to a completely uncoupled network and a network with g = 1 generates non-trivial spontaneous activity [4, 9, 10]). The activation variable for each unit xi is therefore determined by the relation, N τr dxi = −xi + g Jij rj + Ii , dt j=1 with the time scale of the network set by the single-neuron time constant τr of 10 ms. 2 (2) The amplitude I of an oscillatory external input of frequency f , is always the same for each unit, but in some examples shown in this paper, we introduce a neuron-speciﬁc phase factor θi , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2π, such that Ii = I cos(2πf t + θi ) ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N. (3) In visually responsive neurons, this mimics a population of simple cells driven by a drifting grating of temporal frequency f , with the different phases arising from offsets in spatial receptive ﬁeld locations. The randomly assigned phases in our model ensure that the spatial pattern of input is not correlated with the pattern of recurrent connectivity. In our selectivity analysis however (Fig. 3), we replace the random phases with spatial input patterns that are aligned with network connectivity. 2.2 PCA redux Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied proﬁtably to neuronal recordings (see for example [14]) but these analyses often plot activity trajectories corresponding to different network states using the ﬁxed principal component coordinates derived from combined activities under all stimulus conditions. Our analysis offers a complementary approach whereby separate principal components are derived for each stimulus condition, and the resulting principal angles reveal not only the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, but also the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces these trajectories occupy within the full N -dimensional space of neuronal activity. The instantaneous network state can be described by a point in an N -dimensional space with coordinates equal to the ﬁring rates of the N units. Over time, the network activity traverses a trajectory in this N -dimensional space and PCA can be used to delineate the subspace in which this trajectory lies. The analysis is done by diagonalizing the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of network ﬁring rates given by, Dij = (ri (t) − ri )(rj (t) − rj ) , (4) where</p><p>5 0.77610028 <a title="241-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>
<p>Author: Kritika Muralidharan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justiﬁcation for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classiﬁcation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems. 1</p><p>6 0.7749998 <a title="241-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Feature_Transitions_with_Saccadic_Search%3A_Size%2C_Color%2C_and_Orientation_Are_Not_Alike.html">95 nips-2010-Feature Transitions with Saccadic Search: Size, Color, and Orientation Are Not Alike</a></p>

<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Paul L. Ruvolo</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether someone is talking has applications in many areas such as speech recognition, speaker diarization, social robotics, facial expression recognition, and human computer interaction. One popular approach to this problem is audio-visual synchrony detection [10, 21, 12]. A candidate speaker is deemed to be talking if the visual signal around that speaker correlates with the auditory signal. Here we show that with the proper visual features (in this case movements of various facial muscle groups), a very accurate detector of speech can be created that does not use the audio signal at all. Further we show that this person independent visual-only detector can be used to train very accurate audio-based person dependent voice models. The voice model has the advantage of being able to identify when a particular person is speaking even when they are not visible to the camera (e.g. in the case of a mobile robot). Moreover, we show that a simple sensory fusion scheme between the auditory and visual models improves performance on the task of talking detection. The work here provides dramatic evidence about the efﬁcacy of two very different approaches to multimodal speech detection on a challenging database. 1</p><p>3 0.085132703 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Why_are_some_word_orders_more_common_than_others%3F_A_uniform_information_density_account.html">285 nips-2010-Why are some word orders more common than others?

<p>Author: Luke Maurits, Dan Navarro, Amy Perfors</p><p>Abstract: Languages vary widely in many ways, including their canonical word order. A basic aspect of the observed variation is the fact that some word orders are much more common than others. Although this regularity has been recognized for some time, it has not been well-explained. In this paper we offer an informationtheoretic explanation for the observed word-order distribution across languages, based on the concept of Uniform Information Density (UID). We suggest that object-ﬁrst languages are particularly disfavored because they are highly nonoptimal if the goal is to distribute information content approximately evenly throughout a sentence, and that the rest of the observed word-order distribution is at least partially explainable in terms of UID. We support our theoretical analysis with data from child-directed speech and experimental work. 1</p><p>4 0.071491309 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Bayesian_Action-Graph_Games.html">39 nips-2010-Bayesian Action-Graph Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Albert X. Jiang, Kevin Leyton-brown</p><p>Abstract: Games of incomplete information, or Bayesian games, are an important gametheoretic model and have many applications in economics. We propose Bayesian action-graph games (BAGGs), a novel graphical representation for Bayesian games. BAGGs can represent arbitrary Bayesian games, and furthermore can compactly express Bayesian games exhibiting commonly encountered types of structure including symmetry, action- and type-speciﬁc utility independence, and probabilistic independence of type distributions. We provide an algorithm for computing expected utility in BAGGs, and discuss conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Bayes-Nash equilibria of BAGGs can be computed by adapting existing algorithms for complete-information normal form games and leveraging our expected utility algorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approaches improve signiﬁcantly on the state of the art. 1</p><p>5 0.060314484 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Approximate_inference_in_continuous_time_Gaussian-Jump_processes.html">33 nips-2010-Approximate inference in continuous time Gaussian-Jump processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Andreas Ruttor, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to inference in conditionally Gaussian continuous time stochastic processes, where the latent process is a Markovian jump process. We ﬁrst consider the case of jump-diffusion processes, where the drift of a linear stochastic differential equation can jump at arbitrary time points. We derive partial differential equations for exact inference and present a very efﬁcient mean ﬁeld approximation. By introducing a novel lower bound on the free energy, we then generalise our approach to Gaussian processes with arbitrary covariance, such as the non-Markovian RBF covariance. We present results on both simulated and real data, showing that the approach is very accurate in capturing latent dynamics and can be useful in a number of real data modelling tasks.</p><p>6 0.052616842 <a title="125-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Theory_of_Multiclass_Boosting.html">15 nips-2010-A Theory of Multiclass Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Qin, Xiubo Geng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with rank aggregation, which aims to combine multiple input rankings to get a better ranking. A popular approach to rank aggregation is based on probabilistic models on permutations, e.g., the Luce model and the Mallows model. However, these models have their limitations in either poor expressiveness or high computational complexity. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new model, which is deﬁned with a coset-permutation distance, and models the generation of a permutation as a stagewise process. We refer to the new model as coset-permutation distance based stagewise (CPS) model. The CPS model has rich expressiveness and can therefore be used in versatile applications, because many different permutation distances can be used to induce the coset-permutation distance. The complexity of the CPS model is low because of the stagewise decomposition of the permutation probability and the efﬁcient computation of most coset-permutation distances. We apply the CPS model to supervised rank aggregation, derive the learning and inference algorithms, and empirically study their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Experiments on public datasets show that the derived algorithms based on the CPS model can achieve state-ofthe-art ranking accuracy, and are much more efﬁcient than previous algorithms.</p><p>4 0.48707637 <a title="125-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Why_are_some_word_orders_more_common_than_others%3F_A_uniform_information_density_account.html">285 nips-2010-Why are some word orders more common than others?

<p>Author: Shibin Parameswaran, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) improves the prediction performance on multiple, different but related, learning problems through shared parameters or representations. One of the most prominent multi-task learning algorithms is an extension to support vector machines (svm) by Evgeniou et al. [15]. Although very elegant, multi-task svm is inherently restricted by the fact that support vector machines require each class to be addressed explicitly with its own weight vector which, in a multi-task setting, requires the different learning tasks to share the same set of classes. This paper proposes an alternative formulation for multi-task learning by extending the recently published large margin nearest neighbor (lmnn) algorithm to the MTL paradigm. Instead of relying on separating hyperplanes, its decision function is based on the nearest neighbor rule which inherently extends to many classes and becomes a natural ﬁt for multi-task learning. We evaluate the resulting multi-task lmnn on real-world insurance data and speech classiﬁcation problems and show that it consistently outperforms single-task kNN under several metrics and state-of-the-art MTL classiﬁers. 1</p><p>3 0.4077107 <a title="125-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.36295816 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Message-Passing_Algorithm_for_Approximated_Large_Scale_Structured_Prediction.html">13 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Message-Passing Algorithm for Approximated Large Scale Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an approximated structured prediction framework for large scale graphical models and derive message-passing algorithms for learning their parameters efﬁciently. We ﬁrst relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as the soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on a local entropy approximation and derive an efﬁcient messagepassing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efﬁciently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters. 1</p><p>5 0.36240789 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning%3A_Random_Averages%2C_Combinatorial_Parameters%2C_and_Learnability.html">193 nips-2010-Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: We develop a theory of online learning by deﬁning several complexity measures. Among them are analogues of Rademacher complexity, covering numbers and fatshattering dimension from statistical learning theory. Relationship among these complexity measures, their connection to online learning, and tools for bounding them are provided. We apply these results to various learning problems. We provide a complete characterization of online learnability in the supervised setting. 1</p><p>6 0.36159506 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Repeated_Games_against_Budgeted_Adversaries.html">226 nips-2010-Repeated Games against Budgeted Adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanjun Han, Qing Tao, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: In multi-instance learning, there are two kinds of prediction failure, i.e., false negative and false positive. Current research mainly focus on avoiding the former. We attempt to utilize the geometric distribution of instances inside positive bags to avoid both the former and the latter. Based on kernel principal component analysis, we deﬁne a projection constraint for each positive bag to classify its constituent instances far away from the separating hyperplane while place positive instances and negative instances at opposite sides. We apply the Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure to solve the resulted problem.

<p>Author: Jie Luo, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: In many real world applications we do not have access to fully-labeled training data, but only to a list of possible labels. This is the case, e.g., when learning visual classiﬁers from images downloaded from the web, using just their text captions or tags as learning oracles. In general, these problems can be very difﬁcult. However most of the time there exist different implicit sources of information, coming from the relations between instances and labels, which are usually dismissed. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised framework to model this kind of problems. Each training sample is a bag containing multi-instances, associated with a set of candidate labeling vectors. Each labeling vector encodes the possible labels for the instances in the bag, with only one being fully correct. The use of the labeling vectors provides a principled way not to exclude any information. We propose a large margin discriminative formulation, and an efﬁcient algorithm to solve it. Experiments conducted on artiﬁcial datasets and a real-world images and captions dataset show that our approach achieves performance comparable to an SVM trained with the ground-truth labels, and outperforms other baselines.</p><p>4 0.14633986 <a title="52-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: A standard approach to learning object category detectors is to provide strong supervision in the form of a region of interest (ROI) specifying each instance of the object in the training images [17]. In this work are goal is to learn from heterogeneous labels, in which some images are only weakly supervised, specifying only the presence or absence of the object or a weak indication of object location, whilst others are fully annotated. To this end we develop a discriminative learning approach and make two contributions: (i) we propose a structured output formulation for weakly annotated images where full annotations are treated as latent variables; and (ii) we propose to optimize a ranking objective function, allowing our method to more effectively use negatively labeled images to improve detection average precision performance. The method is demonstrated on the benchmark INRIA pedestrian detection dataset of Dalal and Triggs [14] and the PASCAL VOC dataset [17], and it is shown that for a signiﬁcant proportion of weakly supervised images the performance achieved is very similar to the fully supervised (state of the art) results. 1</p><p>5 0.14314154 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Bayesian_Action-Graph_Games.html">39 nips-2010-Bayesian Action-Graph Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Albert X. Jiang, Kevin Leyton-brown</p><p>Abstract: Games of incomplete information, or Bayesian games, are an important gametheoretic model and have many applications in economics. We propose Bayesian action-graph games (BAGGs), a novel graphical representation for Bayesian games. BAGGs can represent arbitrary Bayesian games, and furthermore can compactly express Bayesian games exhibiting commonly encountered types of structure including symmetry, action- and type-speciﬁc utility independence, and probabilistic independence of type distributions. We provide an algorithm for computing expected utility in BAGGs, and discuss conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Bayes-Nash equilibria of BAGGs can be computed by adapting existing algorithms for complete-information normal form games and leveraging our expected utility algorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approaches improve signiﬁcantly on the state of the art. 1</p><p>6 0.10951097 <a title="52-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Smoothness%2C_Low_Noise_and_Fast_Rates.html">243 nips-2010-Smoothness, Low Noise and Fast Rates</a></p>

<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Benjamin Packer, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models are a powerful tool for addressing several tasks in machine learning. However, the algorithms for learning the parameters of latent variable models are prone to getting stuck in a bad local optimum. To alleviate this problem, we build on the intuition that, rather than considering all samples simultaneously, the algorithm should be presented with the training data in a meaningful order that facilitates learning. The order of the samples is determined by how easy they are. The main challenge is that often we are not provided with a readily computable measure of the easiness of samples. We address this issue by proposing a novel, iterative self-paced learning algorithm where each iteration simultaneously selects easy samples and learns a new parameter vector. The number of samples selected is governed by a weight that is annealed until the entire training data has been considered. We empirically demonstrate that the self-paced learning algorithm outperforms the state of the art method for learning a latent structural SVM on four applications: object localization, noun phrase coreference, motif ﬁnding and handwritten digit recognition. 1</p><p>5 0.40573561 <a title="52-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Active_Estimation_of_F-Measures.html">22 nips-2010-Active Estimation of F-Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Sawade, Niels Landwehr, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the Fα -measure of a given model as accurately as possible on a ﬁxed labeling budget. This problem occurs whenever an estimate cannot be obtained from held-out training data; for instance, when data that have been used to train the model are held back for reasons of privacy or do not reﬂect the test distribution. In this case, new test instances have to be drawn and labeled at a cost. An active estimation procedure selects instances according to an instrumental sampling distribution. An analysis of the sources of estimation error leads to an optimal sampling distribution that minimizes estimator variance. We explore conditions under which active estimates of Fα -measures are more accurate than estimates based on instances sampled from the test distribution. 1</p><p>6 0.39012557 <a title="52-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Reverse_Multi-Label_Learning.html">228 nips-2010-Reverse Multi-Label Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Achintya Kundu, Vikram Tankasali, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Aharon Ben-tal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning an n × n kernel matrix from m(≥ 1) similarity matrices under general convex loss. Past research have extensively studied the m = 1 case and have derived several algorithms which require sophisticated techniques like ACCP, SOCP, etc. The existing algorithms do not apply if one uses arbitrary losses and often can not handle m > 1 case. We present several provably convergent iterative algorithms, where each iteration requires either an SVM or a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) solver for m > 1 case. One of the major contributions of the paper is to extend the well known Mirror Descent(MD) framework to handle Cartesian product of psd matrices. This novel extension leads to an algorithm, called EMKL, which solves the problem in 2 O( m ǫlog n ) iterations; in each iteration one solves an MKL involving m kernels 2 and m eigen-decomposition of n × n matrices. By suitably deﬁning a restriction on the objective function, a faster version of EMKL is proposed, called REKL, which avoids the eigen-decomposition. An alternative to both EMKL and REKL is also suggested which requires only an SVM solver. Experimental results on real world protein data set involving several similarity matrices illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithms.</p><p>2 0.84865326 <a title="52-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Relational_Learning_with_Hidden_Variable_Detection.html">71 nips-2010-Efficient Relational Learning with Hidden Variable Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao, Jun Zhu, Liu Xinwang, Yandong Liu, William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Markov networks (MNs) can incorporate arbitrarily complex features in modeling relational data. However, this ﬂexibility comes at a sharp price of training an exponentially complex model. To address this challenge, we propose a novel relational learning approach, which consists of a restricted class of relational MNs (RMNs) called relation tree-based RMN (treeRMN), and an efﬁcient Hidden Variable Detection algorithm called Contrastive Variable Induction (CVI). On one hand, the restricted treeRMN only considers simple (e.g., unary and pairwise) features in relational data and thus achieves computational efﬁciency; and on the other hand, the CVI algorithm efﬁciently detects hidden variables which can capture long range dependencies. Therefore, the resultant approach is highly efﬁcient yet does not sacriﬁce its expressive power. Empirical results on four real datasets show that the proposed relational learning method can achieve similar prediction quality as the state-of-the-art approaches, but is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient in training; and the induced hidden variables are semantically meaningful and crucial to improve the training speed and prediction qualities of treeRMNs.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82123071 <a title="52-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Convex_Multiple-Instance_Learning_by_Estimating_Likelihood_Ratio.html">52 nips-2010-Convex Multiple-Instance Learning by Estimating Likelihood Ratio</a></p>

Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.79109854 <a title="52-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Avoiding_False_Positive_in_Multi-Instance_Learning.html">36 nips-2010-Avoiding False Positive in Multi-Instance Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanjun Han, Qing Tao, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: In multi-instance learning, there are two kinds of prediction failure, i.e., false negative and false positive. Current research mainly focus on avoiding the former. We attempt to utilize the geometric distribution of instances inside positive bags to avoid both the former and the latter. Based on kernel principal component analysis, we deﬁne a projection constraint for each positive bag to classify its constituent instances far away from the separating hyperplane while place positive instances and negative instances at opposite sides. We apply the Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure to solve the resulted problem. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach offers improved generalization performance.</p><p>5 0.77900094 <a title="52-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Bayesian_Action-Graph_Games.html">39 nips-2010-Bayesian Action-Graph Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Albert X. Jiang, Kevin Leyton-brown</p><p>Abstract: Games of incomplete information, or Bayesian games, are an important gametheoretic model and have many applications in economics. We propose Bayesian action-graph games (BAGGs), a novel graphical representation for Bayesian games. BAGGs can represent arbitrary Bayesian games, and furthermore can compactly express Bayesian games exhibiting commonly encountered types of structure including symmetry, action- and type-speciﬁc utility independence, and probabilistic independence of type distributions. We provide an algorithm for computing expected utility in BAGGs, and discuss conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Bayes-Nash equilibria of BAGGs can be computed by adapting existing algorithms for complete-information normal form games and leveraging our expected utility algorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approaches improve signiﬁcantly on the state of the art. 1</p><p>6 0.77605319 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Message-Passing_Algorithm_for_Approximated_Large_Scale_Structured_Prediction.html">13 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Message-Passing Algorithm for Approximated Large Scale Structured Prediction</a></p>

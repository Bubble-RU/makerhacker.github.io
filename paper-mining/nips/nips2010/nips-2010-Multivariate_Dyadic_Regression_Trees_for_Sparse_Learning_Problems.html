<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen, Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphical models encode in a graph G the dependency structure of a random vector Y . In many applications, it is of interest to model Y given another random vector X as input. We refer to the problem of estimating the graph G(x) of Y conditioned on X = x as “graph-valued regression”. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating G(x) that builds a tree on the X space just as in CART (classiﬁcation and regression trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. We call the method “Graph-optimized CART”, or GoCART. We study the theoretical properties of Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on risk minimization and tree partition consistency. We also demonstrate the application of Go-CART to a meteorological dataset, showing how graph-valued regression can provide a useful tool for analyzing complex data. 1</p><p>3 0.073007286 <a title="178-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Jason Weston, David Grangier</p><p>Abstract: Multi-class classiﬁcation becomes challenging at test time when the number of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a treestructure of classiﬁers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster. 1</p><p>4 0.071358062 <a title="178-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Tree-Structured_Stick_Breaking_for_Hierarchical_Data.html">276 nips-2010-Tree-Structured Stick Breaking for Hierarchical Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Michael I. Jordan, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a ﬂexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are inﬁnitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing inﬁnite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data. 1</p><p>5 0.069183588 <a title="178-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Sample_Complexity_of_Testing_the_Manifold_Hypothesis.html">232 nips-2010-Sample Complexity of Testing the Manifold Hypothesis</a></p>
<p>Author: Hariharan Narayanan, Sanjoy Mitter</p><p>Abstract: The hypothesis that high dimensional data tends to lie in the vicinity of a low dimensional manifold is the basis of a collection of methodologies termed Manifold Learning. In this paper, we study statistical aspects of the question of ﬁtting a manifold with a nearly optimal least squared error. Given upper bounds on the dimension, volume, and curvature, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization can produce a nearly optimal manifold using a number of random samples that is independent of the ambient dimension of the space in which data lie. We obtain an upper bound on the required number of samples that depends polynomially on the curvature, exponentially on the intrinsic dimension, and linearly on the intrinsic volume. For constant error, we prove a matching minimax lower bound on the sample complexity that shows that this dependence on intrinsic dimension, volume log 1 and curvature is unavoidable. Whether the known lower bound of O( k + 2 δ ) 2 for the sample complexity of Empirical Risk minimization on k−means applied to data in a unit ball of arbitrary dimension is tight, has been an open question since 1997 [3]. Here is the desired bound on the error and δ is a bound on the probability of failure. We improve the best currently known upper bound [14] of 2 log 1 log4 k log 1 O( k2 + 2 δ ) to O k min k, 2 + 2 δ . Based on these results, we 2 devise a simple algorithm for k−means and another that uses a family of convex programs to ﬁt a piecewise linear curve of a speciﬁed length to high dimensional data, where the sample complexity is independent of the ambient dimension. 1</p><p>6 0.067924626 <a title="178-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning%3A_Random_Averages%2C_Combinatorial_Parameters%2C_and_Learnability.html">193 nips-2010-Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability</a></p>

We develop efﬁcient methods for each partitioning subproblem through an equivalent representation as a network ﬂow problem, and prove that this sequence of partitions converges to the global solution. These network ﬂow problems can further be decomposed in order to solve very large problems.

<p>Author: Nebojsa Jojic, Chris Meek, Jim C. Huang</p><p>Abstract: Many problem domains including climatology and epidemiology require models that can capture both heavy-tailed statistics and local dependencies. Specifying such distributions using graphical models for probability density functions (PDFs) generally lead to intractable inference and learning. Cumulative distribution networks (CDNs) provide a means to tractably specify multivariate heavy-tailed models as a product of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Existing algorithms for inference and learning in CDNs are limited to those with tree-structured (nonloopy) graphs. In this paper, we develop inference and learning algorithms for CDNs with arbitrary topology. Our approach to inference and learning relies on recursively decomposing the computation of mixed derivatives based on a junction trees over the cumulative distribution functions. We demonstrate that our systematic approach to utilizing the sparsity represented by the junction tree yields signiďŹ cant performance improvements over the general symbolic differentiation programs Mathematica and D*. Using two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that non-tree structured (loopy) CDNs are able to provide signiďŹ cantly better ďŹ ts to the data as compared to tree-structured and unstructured CDNs and other heavy-tailed multivariate distributions such as the multivariate copula and logistic models.</p><p>5 0.5089252 <a title="178-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Stability_Approach_to_Regularization_Selection_%28StARS%29_for_High_Dimensional_Graphical_Models.html">254 nips-2010-Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>6 0.50526285 <a title="178-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exact_learning_curves_for_Gaussian_process_regression_on_large_random_graphs.html">85 nips-2010-Exact learning curves for Gaussian process regression on large random graphs</a></p>

However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world.

<p>Author: Ken Takiyama, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: 019 020 We propose an algorithm for simultaneously estimating state transitions among neural states, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates using a switching state space model (SSSM). This algorithm enables us to detect state transitions on the basis of not only the discontinuous changes of mean ﬁring rates but also discontinuous changes in temporal proﬁles of ﬁring rates, e.g., temporal correlation. We construct a variational Bayes algorithm for a non-Gaussian SSSM whose non-Gaussian property is caused by binary spike events. Synthetic data analysis reveals that our algorithm has the high performance for estimating state transitions, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates compared to previous methods. We also analyze neural data that were recorded from the medial temporal area. The statistically detected neural states probably coincide with transient and sustained states that have been detected heuristically. Estimated parameters suggest that our algorithm detects the state transition on the basis of discontinuous changes in the temporal correlation of ﬁring rates, which transitions previous methods cannot detect. This result suggests that our algorithm is advantageous in real-data analysis. 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053</p><p>3 0.97653466 <a title="178-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Worst-case_bounds_on_the_quality_of_max-product_fixed-points.html">288 nips-2010-Worst-case bounds on the quality of max-product fixed-points</a></p>
<p>Author: Meritxell Vinyals, Jes\'us Cerquides, Alessandro Farinelli, Juan A. Rodríguez-aguilar</p><p>Abstract: We study worst-case bounds on the quality of any ﬁxed point assignment of the max-product algorithm for Markov Random Fields (MRF). We start providing a bound independent of the MRF structure and parameters. Afterwards, we show how this bound can be improved for MRFs with speciﬁc structures such as bipartite graphs or grids. Our results provide interesting insight into the behavior of max-product. For example, we prove that max-product provides very good results (at least 90% optimal) on MRFs with large variable-disjoint cycles1 . 1</p><p>4 0.96904218 <a title="178-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition.html">143 nips-2010-Learning Convolutional Feature Hierarchies for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pierre Sermanet, Y-lan Boureau, Karol Gregor, Michael Mathieu, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for learning multi-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting ﬁlters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efﬁciency of the overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efﬁcient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasisparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse ﬁlters, including center-surround ﬁlters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these ﬁlters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.94990379 <a title="178-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many machine learning domains (such as scene understanding), several related sub-tasks (such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection) operate on the same raw data and provide correlated outputs. Each of these tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classiﬁers already exist for many subtasks. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classiﬁer. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (FE-CCM), that maximizes the joint likelihood of the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classiﬁer for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classiﬁers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the ﬁrst layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classiﬁers to provide earlier classiﬁers information about what error modes to focus on. We show that our method signiﬁcantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in two different domains: (i) scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection, and (ii) robotic grasping, where we consider grasp point detection and object classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.94500029 <a title="178-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>

</p><p>6 We ﬁrst describe how to compute the symbolic mismatch between pairs of long term electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. [sent-11, score-0.851]
</p><p>7 This algorithm maps the original signals into a symbolic domain, and provides a quantitative assessment of the difference between these symbolic representations of the original signals. [sent-12, score-0.995]
</p><p>8 We then show how this measure can be used with each of a one-class SVM, a nearest neighbor classiﬁer, and hierarchical clustering to improve risk stratiﬁcation. [sent-13, score-0.5]
</p><p>9 We evaluated our methods on a population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data. [sent-14, score-0.665]
</p><p>10 In a univariate analysis, all of the methods provided a statistically signiﬁcant association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. [sent-15, score-0.539]
</p><p>11 1  • We address the problems related to scale by abstracting the raw signal into a sequence of symbols, • We address the problems related to patient-speciﬁc differences by using a novel technique, symbolic mismatch, that allows us to compare sequences of symbols drawn from distinct alphabets. [sent-25, score-0.637]
</p><p>12 In the remainder of this paper, we present our work in the context of risk stratiﬁcation for cardiovascular disease. [sent-27, score-0.37]
</p><p>13 However, matching patients with treatments that are appropriate for their risk has proven to be challenging [5,6]. [sent-33, score-0.652]
</p><p>14 We focus, in particular, on identifying patients at elevated risk of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction and severe recurrent ischemia) following coronary attacks. [sent-35, score-1.336]
</p><p>15 Fortunately, only a minority of cardiac patients experience serious subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. [sent-38, score-0.921]
</p><p>16 For example, cardiac mortality over a 90 day period following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was reported to be 1. [sent-39, score-0.405]
</p><p>17 79% for the SYMPHONY trial involving 14,970 patients [1] and 1. [sent-40, score-0.439]
</p><p>18 Our hypothesis is that these patients can be discovered as anomalies in the population, i. [sent-45, score-0.416]
</p><p>19 , their physiological activity over long periods of time is dissimilar to the majority of the patients in the population. [sent-47, score-0.45]
</p><p>20 2  Symbolic Mismatch  We start by describing the process through which symbolic mismatch is measured on ECG signals. [sent-50, score-0.828]
</p><p>21 At this point, the set S comprises the centroids for the clustering process, and the ﬁnal assignment of beats to clusters proceeds by matching each beat to its nearest centroid. [sent-64, score-0.339]
</p><p>22 Intuitively, the symbolic mismatch between patients p and q corresponds to an estimate of the expected difference in morphology between any two randomly chosen beats from these patients. [sent-85, score-1.395]
</p><p>23 The symbolic mismatch computation achieves this by weighting the difference between the centroids for every pair of symbols for the patients by the frequencies with which these symbols occur. [sent-86, score-1.436]
</p><p>24 An important feature of symbolic mismatch is that it avoids the need to set up a correspondence between the symbols of patients p and q. [sent-87, score-1.313]
</p><p>25 In contrast to cluster matching techniques [10,11] to compare data for two patients by ﬁrst making an assignment from symbols in one patient to the other, symbolic mismatch does not require any cross-patient registration of symbols. [sent-88, score-1.425]
</p><p>26 Instead, it performs weighted morphologic comparisons between all symbol centroids for patients p and q. [sent-89, score-0.496]
</p><p>27 3  Spectrum Clipping and Adaptation for Kernel-based Methods  The formulation for symbolic mismatch in Equation 2 gives rise to a symmetric dissimilarity matrix. [sent-92, score-0.854]
</p><p>28 For both the dissimilarity and similarity case, however, symbolic mismatch can produce a matrix that is indeﬁnite. [sent-94, score-0.877]
</p><p>29 This can be problematic 3  when using symbolic mismatch with kernel-based algorithms since the optimization problems become non-convex and the underlying theory is invalidated. [sent-95, score-0.828]
</p><p>30 This creates the need to transform the symbolic mismatch matrix before it can be used as a kernel in these methods. [sent-97, score-0.828]
</p><p>31 We use spectrum clipping to generalize the use of symbolic mismatch for classiﬁcation. [sent-98, score-1.041]
</p><p>32 , spectrum ﬂipping, spectrum shifting, spectrum squaring, and the use of indeﬁnite kernels) [13]. [sent-101, score-0.303]
</p><p>33 The symmetric mismatch matrix Ψ has an eigenvalue decomposition: Ψ = U T ΛU  (3)  where U is an orthogonal matrix and Λ is a diagonal matrix of real eigenvalues: Λ = diag(λ1 , . [sent-102, score-0.355]
</p><p>34 The modiﬁed positive semi-deﬁnite symbolic mismatch matrix is then given by: Ψclip = U T Λclip U  (5)  Λclip = diag(max(λ1 , 0), . [sent-106, score-0.828]
</p><p>35 Though we introduce spectrum clipping mainly for the purpose of broadening the applicability of symbolic mismatch to kernel-based methods, this approach offers additional advantages. [sent-110, score-1.041]
</p><p>36 3  Risk Stratiﬁcation Using Symbolic Mismatch  We now sketch three different approaches using symbolic mismatch to identify high risk patients in a population. [sent-113, score-1.482]
</p><p>37 The ﬁrst approach uses a one-class SVM and a symbolic mismatch similarity matrix obtained using a generalized radial basis transformation. [sent-115, score-0.851]
</p><p>38 The other two approaches, nearest neighbor analysis and hierarchical clustering, use the symbolic mismatch dissimilarity matrix. [sent-116, score-1.077]
</p><p>39 In each case, the symbolic mismatch matrix is processed using spectrum clipping. [sent-117, score-0.929]
</p><p>40 The resulting predicted label in terms of the Lagrange multipliers αi and the spectrum clipped symbolic mismatch similarity matrix Ψclip is then: ∑ yj = sgn( ˆ αi Ψclip (i, j) − p) (9) i  4  We apply this approach to train a one-class SVM on all patients. [sent-126, score-0.952]
</p><p>41 The anomaly score of each patient’s long-term time-series is computed as the sum of its distances from the time-series for its k-nearest neighbors, as measured by symbolic mismatch. [sent-133, score-0.52]
</p><p>42 The distance between two clusters is deﬁned as the average of the pairwise symbolic mismatch of the patients in each cluster. [sent-138, score-1.273]
</p><p>43 At this point, all patients outside the largest cluster are labeled as anomalies. [sent-142, score-0.438]
</p><p>44 4  Evaluation Methodology  We evaluated our work on patients enrolled in the DISPERSE2 trial [2]. [sent-143, score-0.439]
</p><p>45 The endpoints of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and severe recurrent ischemia were adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee for a median follow-up period of 60 days. [sent-146, score-0.33]
</p><p>46 Data from 686 patients was available after removal of noise-corrupted signals. [sent-148, score-0.416]
</p><p>47 We deﬁne a major adverse cardiac event to be any of these three adverse events. [sent-150, score-0.574]
</p><p>48 We studied the effectiveness of combining symbolic mismatch with each of classiﬁcation, nearest neighbor analysis and clustering in identifying a high risk group of patients. [sent-151, score-1.329]
</p><p>49 Consistent with other clinical studies to evaluate methods for risk stratiﬁcation in the setting of ACS [17], we classiﬁed patients in the highest quartile as the high risk group. [sent-152, score-0.963]
</p><p>50 For the classiﬁcation approach, this corresponded to choosing v such that the group of patients lying outside the enclosing boundary constituted roughly 25% of the population. [sent-153, score-0.438]
</p><p>51 For the nearest neighbor approach we investigated all odd values of k from 3 to 9, and patients with anomaly scores in the top 25% of the population were classiﬁed as being at high risk. [sent-154, score-0.711]
</p><p>52 For the clustering approach, the varying sizes of the clusters merged together at each step made it difﬁcult to select a high risk quartile. [sent-155, score-0.306]
</p><p>53 Instead, patients lying outside the largest cluster were categorized as being at risk. [sent-156, score-0.438]
</p><p>54 In the tests reported later in this paper, this group contained roughly 23% the patients in the population. [sent-157, score-0.416]
</p><p>55 We employed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compare the rates for major adverse cardiac events between patients declared to be at high and low risk. [sent-160, score-0.894]
</p><p>56 68  Table 1: Univariate association of risk predictions from different approaches using symbolic mismatch with major adverse cardiac events over a 90 day period following ACS. [sent-187, score-1.637]
</p><p>57 54  Table 2: Univariate association of existing clinical and ECG risk variables with major adverse cardiac events over a 90 day period following ACS. [sent-249, score-0.908]
</p><p>58 1  Results Univariate Results  Results of univariate analysis for all three unsupervised symbolic mismatch-based approaches are presented in Table 1. [sent-251, score-0.619]
</p><p>59 The results in Table 1 can be interpreted as roughly a doubled rate of adverse outcomes per unit time in patients identiﬁed as being at high risk by the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches. [sent-256, score-1.06]
</p><p>60 For the classiﬁcation approach, patients identiﬁed as being at high risk had a nearly 40% increased risk. [sent-257, score-0.626]
</p><p>61 For comparison, we also include the univariate association of the other clinical and ECG risk variables in our study (Table 2). [sent-258, score-0.448]
</p><p>62 Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches had a higher hazard ratio in this patient population than any of the other variables studied. [sent-259, score-0.505]
</p><p>63 Of the clinical risk variables, only age was found to be signiﬁcantly associated on univariate analysis with major cardiac events after ACS. [sent-260, score-0.753]
</p><p>64 Of the ECG risk variables, both HRT and DC showed a univariate association with major adverse cardiac events in this population. [sent-263, score-0.799]
</p><p>65 These results are consistent with the clinical literature on these risk metrics. [sent-264, score-0.337]
</p><p>66 2  Multivariate Results  We measured the correlation between the predictions of the unsupervised symbolic mismatch-based approaches and both the clinical and ECG risk variables. [sent-266, score-0.873]
</p><p>67 On multivariate analysis, both the nearest neighbor approach and the clustering approach were independent predictors of adverse outcomes (Table 3). [sent-270, score-0.463]
</p><p>68 In our study, the nearest neighbor approach (for k > 3) had the highest hazard ratio on both univariate and multivariate analysis. [sent-271, score-0.385]
</p><p>69 Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches predicted patients with an approximately two-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes. [sent-272, score-1.088]
</p><p>70 This increased risk did not change much even after adjusting for other clinical and ECG risk variables. [sent-273, score-0.547]
</p><p>71 46  Table 3: Multivariate association of high risk predictions from different approaches using symbolic mismatch with major adverse cardiac events over a 90 day period following ACS. [sent-298, score-1.637]
</p><p>72 12  Table 4: Univariate association of high risk predictions without the use of spectrum clipping. [sent-324, score-0.339]
</p><p>73 None of the approaches showed a statistically signiﬁcant association with the study endpoint in any of the multivariate models including other clinical risk variables when spectrum clipping was not used. [sent-325, score-0.657]
</p><p>74 3  Effect of Spectrum Clipping  We also investigated the effect of spectrum clipping on the performance of our different risk stratiﬁcation approaches. [sent-327, score-0.423]
</p><p>75 These approaches, unlike our symbolic mismatch based approaches, draw upon signiﬁcant a priori knowledge. [sent-338, score-0.858]
</p><p>76 Our belief was that for applications like risk stratifying patients for major cardiac events, focusing on a set of specialized features leads to important information being potentially missed. [sent-339, score-0.886]
</p><p>77 Other research in this area focuses on mismatch tree-based kernels [22], which use the mismatch tree data structure [23] to quantify the difference between two sequences based on the approximate occurrence of ﬁxed length subsequences within them. [sent-350, score-0.759]
</p><p>78 In contrast to these efforts, we use a simple computationally efﬁcient approach to compare symbolic sequences without prior knowledge. [sent-352, score-0.501]
</p><p>79 Most importantly, our approach helps address the situation where symbolizing long-term time-series in a patient-speciﬁc manner leads to the symbolic sequences from different alphabets [25]. [sent-353, score-0.501]
</p><p>80 In this case, hidden Markov models, mismatch trees or a “bag of motifs” approach trained on one patient cannot be easily used to score the sequences for other patients. [sent-354, score-0.471]
</p><p>81 Symbolic mismatch complements existing work on sequence comparison by using a measure that quantiﬁes differences across patients while retaining information on how the symbols for these patients differ. [sent-356, score-1.284]
</p><p>82 These methods typically calculate a particular pre-deﬁned feature from the raw ECG signal, and to use it to rank patients along a risk continuum. [sent-358, score-0.665]
</p><p>83 Our approach, focusing on detecting patients with high symbolic mismatch relative to other patients in the population, is orthogonal to the use of specialized high risk features along two important dimensions. [sent-359, score-1.892]
</p><p>84 For the cardiovascular care, we only assume that ECG signals from patients who are at high risk differ from those of the rest of the population. [sent-361, score-0.835]
</p><p>85 Second, the ability to partition patients into groups with similar ECG characteristics and potentially common risk proﬁles potentially allows for a more ﬁne-grained understanding of a how a patient’s future health may evolve over time. [sent-363, score-0.626]
</p><p>86 Matching patients to past cases with similar ECG signals could lead to more accurate assignments of risk scores for particular events such as death and recurring heart attacks. [sent-364, score-0.903]
</p><p>87 7  Discussion  In this paper, we described a novel unsupervised learning approach to cardiovascular risk stratiﬁcation that is complementary to existing clinical approaches. [sent-365, score-0.532]
</p><p>88 We proposed using symbolic mismatch to quantify differences in long-term physiological timeseries. [sent-366, score-0.89]
</p><p>89 Our approach uses a symbolic transformation to measure changes in the morphology and frequency of prototypical functional units observed over long periods in two signals. [sent-367, score-0.601]
</p><p>90 Symbolic mismatch avoids feature extraction and deals with inter-patient differences in a parameter-less way. [sent-368, score-0.383]
</p><p>91 We also explored the hypothesis that high risk patients in a population can be identiﬁed as individuals with anomalous long-term signals. [sent-369, score-0.675]
</p><p>92 We developed multiple comparative approaches to detect such patients, and evaluated these methods in a real-world application of risk stratiﬁcation for major adverse cardiac events following ACS. [sent-370, score-0.75]
</p><p>93 Our results suggest that symbolic mismatch-based comparative approaches may have clinical utility in identifying high risk patients, and can provide information that is complementary to existing clinical risk variables. [sent-371, score-1.234]
</p><p>94 In a different study of 118 variables in 15,000 post-ACS patients with 90 day follow-up similar to our population, [1] did not ﬁnd any variables with a hazard ratio greater than 2. [sent-373, score-0.526]
</p><p>95 We observed a similar result in our patient population, where all of the existing clinical and ECG risk variables had a hazard ratio less than 2. [sent-375, score-0.499]
</p><p>96 We also observe that all three of the comparative approaches investigated in our study focus only on identifying patients who are anomalies. [sent-381, score-0.503]
</p><p>97 While we believe that symbolic mismatch may have further use in supervised learning, this hypothesis needs to be evaluated more fully in future work. [sent-382, score-0.828]

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, resulting in 17 million deaths each year. Despite the availability of various treatment options, existing techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge often fail to identify patients who might have beneﬁted from more aggressive therapy. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel unsupervised machine learning approach for cardiac risk stratiﬁcation. The key idea of our approach is to avoid specialized medical knowledge, and assess patient risk using symbolic mismatch, a new metric to assess similarity in long-term time-series activity. We hypothesize that high risk patients can be identiﬁed using symbolic mismatch, as individuals in a population with unusual long-term physiological activity.

We evaluated our methods on a population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data. In a univariate analysis, all of the methods provided a statistically signiﬁcant association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days.

<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: While clinicians can accurately identify different types of heartbeats in electrocardiograms (ECGs) from different patients, researchers have had limited success in applying supervised machine learning to the same task. The problem is made challenging by the variety of tasks, inter- and intra-patient differences, an often severe class imbalance, and the high cost of getting cardiologists to label data for individual patients. We address these difﬁculties using active learning to perform patient-adaptive and task-adaptive heartbeat classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Yung-kyun Noh, Byoung-tak Zhang, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a local metric to enhance the performance of nearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Conventional metric learning methods attempt to separate data distributions in a purely discriminative manner; here we show how to take advantage of information from parametric generative models. We focus on the bias in the information-theoretic error arising from ﬁnite sampling effects, and ﬁnd an appropriate local metric that maximally reduces the bias based upon knowledge from generative models. As a byproduct, the asymptotic theoretical analysis in this work relates metric learning with dimensionality reduction, which was not understood from previous discriminative approaches. Empirical experiments show that this learned local metric enhances the discriminative nearest neighbor performance on various datasets using simple class conditional generative models. 1</p><p>4 0.075387448 <a title="116-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Smoothness%2C_Low_Noise_and_Fast_Rates.html">243 nips-2010-Smoothness, Low Noise and Fast Rates</a></p>

For typical hypothesis classes where Rn = R/n, this translates to ˜ ˜ a learning rate of O (RH/n) in the separable (L∗ = 0) case and O RH/n + L∗ RH/n more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization of a smooth non-negative objective. 1</p><p>5 0.06541124 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Variable_margin_losses_for_classifier_design.html">282 nips-2010-Variable margin losses for classifier design</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of controlling the margin of a classiﬁer is studied. A detailed analytical study is presented on how properties of the classiﬁcation risk, such as its optimal link and minimum risk functions, are related to the shape of the loss, and its margin enforcing properties. It is shown that for a class of risks, denoted canonical risks, asymptotic Bayes consistency is compatible with simple analytical relationships between these functions. These enable a precise characterization of the loss for a popular class of link functions. It is shown that, when the risk is in canonical form and the link is inverse sigmoidal, the margin properties of the loss are determined by a single parameter. Novel families of Bayes consistent loss functions, of variable margin, are derived. These families are then used to design boosting style algorithms with explicit control of the classiﬁcation margin. The new algorithms generalize well established approaches, such as LogitBoost. Experimental results show that the proposed variable margin losses outperform the ﬁxed margin counterparts used by existing algorithms. Finally, it is shown that best performance can be achieved by cross-validating the margin parameter. 1</p><p>6 0.062754378 <a title="116-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Infinite_Relational_Modeling_of_Functional_Connectivity_in_Resting_State_fMRI.html">128 nips-2010-Infinite Relational Modeling of Functional Connectivity in Resting State fMRI</a></p>

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, resulting in 17 million deaths each year. Despite the availability of various treatment options, existing techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge often fail to identify patients who might have beneﬁted from more aggressive therapy. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel unsupervised machine learning approach for cardiac risk stratiﬁcation. The key idea of our approach is to avoid specialized medical knowledge, and assess patient risk using symbolic mismatch, a new metric to assess similarity in long-term time-series activity. We hypothesize that high risk patients can be identiﬁed using symbolic mismatch, as individuals in a population with unusual long-term physiological activity. We describe related approaches that build on these ideas to provide improved medical decision making for patients who have recently suffered coronary attacks. We ﬁrst describe how to compute the symbolic mismatch between pairs of long term electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. This algorithm maps the original signals into a symbolic domain, and provides a quantitative assessment of the difference between these symbolic representations of the original signals. We then show how this measure can be used with each of a one-class SVM, a nearest neighbor classiﬁer, and hierarchical clustering to improve risk stratiﬁcation. We evaluated our methods on a population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data. In a univariate analysis, all of the methods provided a statistically signiﬁcant association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. In a multivariate analysis that incorporated the most widely used clinical risk variables, the nearest neighbor and hierarchical clustering approaches were able to statistically signiﬁcantly distinguish patients with a roughly two-fold risk of suffering a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. 1</p><p>2 0.68678689 <a title="116-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, John V.

<p>Author: Nimar Arora, Stuart Russell, Paul Kidwell, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: The International Monitoring System (IMS) is a global network of sensors whose purpose is to identify potential violations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), primarily through detection and localization of seismic events. We report on the ﬁrst stage of a project to improve on the current automated software system with a Bayesian inference system that computes the most likely global event history given the record of local sensor data. The new system, VISA (Vertically Integrated Seismological Analysis), is based on empirically calibrated, generative models of event occurrence, signal propagation, and signal detection. VISA exhibits signiﬁcantly improved precision and recall compared to the current operational system and is able to detect events that are missed even by the human analysts who post-process the IMS output. 1</p><p>4 0.35273314 <a title="116-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Variable_margin_losses_for_classifier_design.html">282 nips-2010-Variable margin losses for classifier design</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, batch-mode active learning has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning approach that selects a batch of queries in each iteration by maximizing a natural mutual information criterion between the labeled and unlabeled instances. By employing a Gaussian process framework, this mutual information based instance selection problem can be formulated as a matrix partition problem. Although matrix partition is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we show that a good local solution can be obtained by exploiting an effective local optimization technique on a relaxed continuous optimization problem. The proposed active learning approach is independent of employed classiﬁcation models. Our empirical studies show this approach can achieve comparable or superior performance to discriminative batch-mode active learning methods. 1</p><p>3 0.54958171 <a title="116-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Christopher Zach, Marc Pollefeys, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a ”log-bilinear” model that computes class probabilities by combining an input vector multiplicatively with a vector of binary latent variables. Even though the latent variables can take on exponentially many possible combinations of values, we can efﬁciently compute the exact probability of each class by marginalizing over the latent variables. This makes it possible to get the exact gradient of the log likelihood. The bilinear score-functions are deﬁned using a three-dimensional weight tensor, and we show that factorizing this tensor allows the model to encode invariances inherent in a task by learning a dictionary of invariant basis functions. Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that this fully probabilistic model can achieve classiﬁcation performance that is competitive with (kernel) SVMs, backpropagation, and deep belief nets. 1</p><p>5 0.51565623 <a title="116-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Short-term_memory_in_neuronal_networks_through_dynamical_compressed_sensing.html">238 nips-2010-Short-term memory in neuronal networks through dynamical compressed sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Surya Ganguli, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that large, generic neuronal networks could store memory traces of past input sequences in their instantaneous state. Such a proposal raises important theoretical questions about the duration of these memory traces and their dependence on network size, connectivity and signal statistics. Prior work, in the case of gaussian input sequences and linear neuronal networks, shows that the duration of memory traces in a network cannot exceed the number of neurons (in units of the neuronal time constant), and that no network can out-perform an equivalent feedforward network. However a more ethologically relevant scenario is that of sparse input sequences. In this scenario, we show how linear neural networks can essentially perform compressed sensing (CS) of past inputs, thereby attaining a memory capacity that exceeds the number of neurons. This enhanced capacity is achieved by a class of “orthogonal” recurrent networks and not by feedforward networks or generic recurrent networks. We exploit techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically compute the decay of memory traces in such networks as a function of network size, signal sparsity and integration time. Alternately, viewed purely from the perspective of CS, this work introduces a new ensemble of measurement matrices derived from dynamical systems, and provides a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance. 1</p><p>6 0.51517886 <a title="116-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Optimization_for_Discriminative_Latent_Class_Models.html">70 nips-2010-Efficient Optimization for Discriminative Latent Class Models</a></p>

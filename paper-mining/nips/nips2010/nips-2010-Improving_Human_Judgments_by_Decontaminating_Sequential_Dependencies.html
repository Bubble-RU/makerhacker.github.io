<p>Author: Anton Chechetka, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and effective approach to learning tractable conditional random ﬁelds with structure that depends on the evidence. Our approach retains the advantages of tractable discriminative models, namely efﬁcient exact inference and arbitrarily accurate parameter learning in polynomial time. At the same time, our algorithm does not suffer a large expressive power penalty inherent to ﬁxed tractable structures. On real-life relational datasets, our approach matches or exceeds state of the art accuracy of the dense models, and at the same time provides an order of magnitude speedup. 1</p><p>3 0.12026211 <a title="121-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Stability_Approach_to_Regularization_Selection_%28StARS%29_for_High_Dimensional_Graphical_Models.html">254 nips-2010-Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>4 0.11661351 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Double_Q-learning.html">66 nips-2010-Double Q-learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hado V. Hasselt</p><p>Abstract: In some stochastic environments the well-known reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning performs very poorly. This poor performance is caused by large overestimations of action values. These overestimations result from a positive bias that is introduced because Q-learning uses the maximum action value as an approximation for the maximum expected action value. We introduce an alternative way to approximate the maximum expected value for any set of random variables. The obtained double estimator method is shown to sometimes underestimate rather than overestimate the maximum expected value. We apply the double estimator to Q-learning to construct Double Q-learning, a new off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. We show the new algorithm converges to the optimal policy and that it performs well in some settings in which Q-learning performs poorly due to its overestimation. 1</p><p>5 0.09665861 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Functional_form_of_motion_priors_in_human_motion_perception.html">98 nips-2010-Functional form of motion priors in human motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Tungyou Lin, Alan Lee, Luminita Vese, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>6 0.095565915 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Inferring_Stimulus_Selectivity_from_the_Spatial_Structure_of_Neural_Network_Dynamics.html">127 nips-2010-Inferring Stimulus Selectivity from the Spatial Structure of Neural Network Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Haefner Ralf, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Many studies have explored the impact of response variability on the quality of sensory codes. The source of this variability is almost always assumed to be intrinsic to the brain. However, when inferring a particular stimulus property, variability associated with other stimulus attributes also effectively act as noise. Here we study the impact of such stimulus-induced response variability for the case of binocular disparity inference. We characterize the response distribution for the binocular energy model in response to random dot stereograms and ﬁnd it to be very different from the Poisson-like noise usually assumed. We then compute the Fisher information with respect to binocular disparity, present in the monocular inputs to the standard model of early binocular processing, and thereby obtain an upper bound on how much information a model could theoretically extract from them. Then we analyze the information loss incurred by the different ways of combining those inputs to produce a scalar single-neuron response. We ﬁnd that in the case of depth inference, monocular stimulus variability places a greater limit on the extractable information than intrinsic neuronal noise for typical spike counts. Furthermore, the largest loss of information is incurred by the standard model for position disparity neurons (tuned-excitatory), that are the most ubiquitous in monkey primary visual cortex, while more information from the inputs is preserved in phase-disparity neurons (tuned-near or tuned-far) primarily found in higher cortical regions. 1</p><p>4 0.49524903 <a title="121-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-A_rational_decision_making_framework_for_inhibitory_control.html">19 nips-2010-A rational decision making framework for inhibitory control</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Angela J. Yu, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: Intelligent agents are often faced with the need to choose actions with uncertain consequences, and to modify those actions according to ongoing sensory processing and changing task demands. The requisite ability to dynamically modify or cancel planned actions is known as inhibitory control in psychology. We formalize inhibitory control as a rational decision-making problem, and apply to it to the classical stop-signal task. Using Bayesian inference and stochastic control tools, we show that the optimal policy systematically depends on various parameters of the problem, such as the relative costs of different action choices, the noise level of sensory inputs, and the dynamics of changing environmental demands. Our normative model accounts for a range of behavioral data in humans and animals in the stop-signal task, suggesting that the brain implements statistically optimal, dynamically adaptive, and reward-sensitive decision-making in the context of inhibitory control problems. 1</p><p>5 0.48817718 <a title="121-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Evidence-Specific_Structures_for_Rich_Tractable_CRFs.html">83 nips-2010-Evidence-Specific Structures for Rich Tractable CRFs</a></p>

Our decontamination techniques yield an over 20% reduction in the error of human judgments. 1</p><p>2 0.68225539 <a title="121-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Basis_Construction_from_Power_Series_Expansions_of_Value_Functions.html">37 nips-2010-Basis Construction from Power Series Expansions of Value Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Sridhar Mahadevan, Bo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores links between basis construction methods in Markov decision processes and power series expansions of value functions. This perspective provides a useful framework to analyze properties of existing bases, as well as provides insight into constructing more effective bases. Krylov and Bellman error bases are based on the Neumann series expansion. These bases incur very large initial Bellman errors, and can converge rather slowly as the discount factor approaches unity. The Laurent series expansion, which relates discounted and average-reward formulations, provides both an explanation for this slow convergence as well as suggests a way to construct more efﬁcient basis representations. The ﬁrst two terms in the Laurent series represent the scaled average-reward and the average-adjusted sum of rewards, and subsequent terms expand the discounted value function using powers of a generalized inverse called the Drazin (or group inverse) of a singular matrix derived from the transition matrix. Experiments show that Drazin bases converge considerably more quickly than several other bases, particularly for large values of the discount factor. An incremental variant of Drazin bases called Bellman average-reward bases (BARBs) is described, which provides some of the same beneﬁts at lower computational cost. 1</p><p>3 0.63992065 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Phone_Recognition_with_the_Mean-Covariance_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">206 nips-2010-Phone Recognition with the Mean-Covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: George Dahl, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Straightforward application of Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) to acoustic modeling produces a rich distributed representation of speech data that is useful for recognition and yields impressive results on the speaker-independent TIMIT phone recognition task. However, the ﬁrst-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonalcovariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), ﬁrst introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efﬁcient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every conﬁguration of the precision units of the mcRBM speciﬁes a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date. 1</p><p>4 0.5645898 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Factorized_Latent_Spaces_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">89 nips-2010-Factorized Latent Spaces with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Mathieu Salzmann, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recent approaches to multi-view learning have shown that factorizing the information into parts that are shared across all views and parts that are private to each view could effectively account for the dependencies and independencies between the different input modalities. Unfortunately, these approaches involve minimizing non-convex objective functions. In this paper, we propose an approach to learning such factorized representations inspired by sparse coding techniques. In particular, we show that structured sparsity allows us to address the multiview learning problem by alternately solving two convex optimization problems. Furthermore, the resulting factorized latent spaces generalize over existing approaches in that they allow having latent dimensions shared between any subset of the views instead of between all the views only. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of human pose estimation. 1</p><p>5 0.53999078 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Phoneme_Recognition_with_Large_Hierarchical_Reservoirs.html">207 nips-2010-Phoneme Recognition with Large Hierarchical Reservoirs</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Triefenbach, Azarakhsh Jalalvand, Benjamin Schrauwen, Jean-pierre Martens</p><p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition has gradually improved over the years, but the reliable recognition of unconstrained speech is still not within reach. In order to achieve a breakthrough, many research groups are now investigating new methodologies that have potential to outperform the Hidden Markov Model technology that is at the core of all present commercial systems. In this paper, it is shown that the recently introduced concept of Reservoir Computing might form the basis of such a methodology. In a limited amount of time, a reservoir system that can recognize the elementary sounds of continuous speech has been built. The system already achieves a state-of-the-art performance, and there is evidence that the margin for further improvements is still signiﬁcant. 1</p><p>6 0.50011718 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Functional_form_of_motion_priors_in_human_motion_perception.html">98 nips-2010-Functional form of motion priors in human motion perception</a></p>

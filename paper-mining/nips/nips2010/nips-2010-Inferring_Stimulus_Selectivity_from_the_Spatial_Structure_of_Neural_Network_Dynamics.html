We study the impact of connectivity on the spatial pattern of ﬂuctuations in the input-generated response, by comparing the distribution of evoked and intrinsically generated activity across the different units of a neural network. We develop a complementary approach to principal component analysis in which separate high-variance directions are derived for each input condition. We analyze subspace angles to compute the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, and the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces that driven trajectories occupy within the full space of neuronal activity. In addition to revealing how the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous activity affects input-evoked responses, these methods can be used to infer input selectivity induced by network dynamics from experimentally accessible measures of spontaneous activity (e.g. from voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical imaging experiments). We conclude that the absence of a detailed spatial map of afferent inputs and cortical connectivity does not limit our ability to design spatially extended stimuli that evoke strong responses. 1 1 Motivation Stimulus selectivity in neural networks was historically measured directly from input-driven responses [1], and only later were similar selectivity patterns observed in spontaneous activity across the cortical surface [2, 3]. We argue that it is possible to work in the reverse order, and show that analyzing the distribution of spontaneous activity across the different units in the network can inform us about the selectivity of evoked responses to stimulus features, even when no apparent sensory map exists. Sensory-evoked responses are typically divided into a signal component generated by the stimulus and a noise component corresponding to ongoing activity that is not directly related to the stimulus. Subsequent effort focuses on understanding how the signal depends on properties of the stimulus, while the remaining, irregular part of the response is treated as additive noise. The distinction between external stochastic processes and the noise generated deterministically as a function of intrinsic recurrence has been previously studied in chaotic neural networks [4]. It has also been suggested that internally generated noise is not additive and can be more sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the input, compared to the signal component of the response [5 - 8]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between deterministic intrinsic noise and the spatial properties of the external stimulus is also complex and nonlinear. We study the impact of network connectivity on the spatial pattern of input-driven responses by comparing the structure of evoked and spontaneous activity, and show how the unique signature of these dynamics determines the selectivity of networks to spatial features of the stimuli driving them. 2 Model description In this section, we describe the network model and the methods we use to analyze its dynamics. Subsequent sections explore how the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked responses are related in terms of the distribution of the activity across the network. Finally, we show how the stimulus selectivity of the network can be inferred from its spontaneous activity patterns. 2.1 Network elements We build a ﬁring rate model of N interconnected units characterized by a statistical description of the underlying circuitry (as N → ∞, the system “self averages” making the description independent of a speciﬁc network architecture, see also [11, 12]). Each unit is characterized by an activation variable xi ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N , and a nonlinear response function ri which relates to xi through ri = R0 + φ(xi ) where,   R0 tanh x for x ≤ 0 R0 φ(x) = (1) x  (Rmax − R0 ) tanh otherwise. Rmax −R0 Eq. 1 allows us to independently set the maximum ﬁring rate Rmax and the background rate R0 to biologically reasonable values, while retaining a maximum gradient at x = 0 to guarantee the smoothness of the transition to chaos [4]. We introduce a recurrent weight matrix with element Jij equivalent to the strength of the synapse from unit j → unit i. The individual weights are chosen independently and randomly from a Gaus2 sian distribution with mean and variance given by [Jij ]J = 0 and Jij J = g 2 /N , where square brackets are ensemble averages [9 - 11,13]. The control parameter g which scales as the variance of the synaptic weights, is particularly important in determining whether or not the network produces spontaneous activity with non-trivial dynamics (Speciﬁcally, g = 0 corresponds to a completely uncoupled network and a network with g = 1 generates non-trivial spontaneous activity [4, 9, 10]). The activation variable for each unit xi is therefore determined by the relation, N τr dxi = −xi + g Jij rj + Ii , dt j=1 with the time scale of the network set by the single-neuron time constant τr of 10 ms. 2 (2) The amplitude I of an oscillatory external input of frequency f , is always the same for each unit, but in some examples shown in this paper, we introduce a neuron-speciﬁc phase factor θi , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2π, such that Ii = I cos(2πf t + θi ) ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N. (3) In visually responsive neurons, this mimics a population of simple cells driven by a drifting grating of temporal frequency f , with the different phases arising from offsets in spatial receptive ﬁeld locations. The randomly assigned phases in our model ensure that the spatial pattern of input is not correlated with the pattern of recurrent connectivity. In our selectivity analysis however (Fig. 3), we replace the random phases with spatial input patterns that are aligned with network connectivity. 2.2 PCA redux Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied proﬁtably to neuronal recordings (see for example [14]) but these analyses often plot activity trajectories corresponding to different network states using the ﬁxed principal component coordinates derived from combined activities under all stimulus conditions. Our analysis offers a complementary approach whereby separate principal components are derived for each stimulus condition, and the resulting principal angles reveal not only the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, but also the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces these trajectories occupy within the full N -dimensional space of neuronal activity. The instantaneous network state can be described by a point in an N -dimensional space with coordinates equal to the ﬁring rates of the N units. Over time, the network activity traverses a trajectory in this N -dimensional space and PCA can be used to delineate the subspace in which this trajectory lies. The analysis is done by diagonalizing the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of network ﬁring rates given by, Dij = (ri (t) − ri )(rj (t) − rj ) , (4) where</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2010-127-reference" href="../nips2010_reference/nips-2010-Inferring_Stimulus_Selectivity_from_the_Spatial_Structure_of_Neural_Network_Dynamics_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Ryan Kelly, Matthew Smith, Robert Kass, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Activity of a neuron, even in the early sensory areas, is not simply a function of its local receptive ﬁeld or tuning properties, but depends on global context of the stimulus, as well as the neural context. This suggests the activity of the surrounding neurons and global brain states can exert considerable inﬂuence on the activity of a neuron. In this paper we implemented an L1 regularized point process model to assess the contribution of multiple factors to the ﬁring rate of many individual units recorded simultaneously from V1 with a 96-electrode “Utah” array. We found that the spikes of surrounding neurons indeed provide strong predictions of a neuron’s response, in addition to the neuron’s receptive ﬁeld transfer function. We also found that the same spikes could be accounted for with the local ﬁeld potentials, a surrogate measure of global network states. This work shows that accounting for network ﬂuctuations can improve estimates of single trial ﬁring rate and stimulus-response transfer functions. 1</p><p>4 0.17700121 <a title="127-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Linear_readout_from_a_neural_population_with_partial_correlation_data.html">161 nips-2010-Linear readout from a neural population with partial correlation data</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Wohrer, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How much information does a neural population convey about a stimulus? Answers to this question are known to strongly depend on the correlation of response variability in neural populations. These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>5 0.16196521 <a title="127-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Attractor_Dynamics_with_Synaptic_Depression.html">34 nips-2010-Attractor Dynamics with Synaptic Depression</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, He Wang, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Neuronal connection weights exhibit short-term depression (STD). The present study investigates the impact of STD on the dynamics of a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) and its potential roles in neural information processing. We ﬁnd that the network with STD can generate both static and traveling bumps, and STD enhances the performance of the network in tracking external inputs. In particular, we ﬁnd that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau behaviors, namely, the network being initially stimulated to an active state will decay to silence very slowly in the time scale of STD rather than that of neural signaling. We argue that this provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold short-term memory easily and shut off persistent activities naturally.</p><p>6 0.15096074 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>

<p>Author: Kanaka Rajan, L Abbott, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: How are the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked population responses related? We study the impact of connectivity on the spatial pattern of ﬂuctuations in the input-generated response, by comparing the distribution of evoked and intrinsically generated activity across the different units of a neural network. We develop a complementary approach to principal component analysis in which separate high-variance directions are derived for each input condition. We analyze subspace angles to compute the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, and the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces that driven trajectories occupy within the full space of neuronal activity. In addition to revealing how the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous activity affects input-evoked responses, these methods can be used to infer input selectivity induced by network dynamics from experimentally accessible measures of spontaneous activity (e.g. from voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical imaging experiments). We conclude that the absence of a detailed spatial map of afferent inputs and cortical connectivity does not limit our ability to design spatially extended stimuli that evoke strong responses. 1 1 Motivation Stimulus selectivity in neural networks was historically measured directly from input-driven responses [1], and only later were similar selectivity patterns observed in spontaneous activity across the cortical surface [2, 3]. We argue that it is possible to work in the reverse order, and show that analyzing the distribution of spontaneous activity across the different units in the network can inform us about the selectivity of evoked responses to stimulus features, even when no apparent sensory map exists. Sensory-evoked responses are typically divided into a signal component generated by the stimulus and a noise component corresponding to ongoing activity that is not directly related to the stimulus. Subsequent effort focuses on understanding how the signal depends on properties of the stimulus, while the remaining, irregular part of the response is treated as additive noise. The distinction between external stochastic processes and the noise generated deterministically as a function of intrinsic recurrence has been previously studied in chaotic neural networks [4]. It has also been suggested that internally generated noise is not additive and can be more sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the input, compared to the signal component of the response [5 - 8]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between deterministic intrinsic noise and the spatial properties of the external stimulus is also complex and nonlinear. We study the impact of network connectivity on the spatial pattern of input-driven responses by comparing the structure of evoked and spontaneous activity, and show how the unique signature of these dynamics determines the selectivity of networks to spatial features of the stimuli driving them. 2 Model description In this section, we describe the network model and the methods we use to analyze its dynamics. Subsequent sections explore how the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked responses are related in terms of the distribution of the activity across the network. Finally, we show how the stimulus selectivity of the network can be inferred from its spontaneous activity patterns. 2.1 Network elements We build a ﬁring rate model of N interconnected units characterized by a statistical description of the underlying circuitry (as N → ∞, the system “self averages” making the description independent of a speciﬁc network architecture, see also [11, 12]). Each unit is characterized by an activation variable xi ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N , and a nonlinear response function ri which relates to xi through ri = R0 + φ(xi ) where,   R0 tanh x for x ≤ 0 R0 φ(x) = (1) x  (Rmax − R0 ) tanh otherwise. Rmax −R0 Eq. 1 allows us to independently set the maximum ﬁring rate Rmax and the background rate R0 to biologically reasonable values, while retaining a maximum gradient at x = 0 to guarantee the smoothness of the transition to chaos [4]. We introduce a recurrent weight matrix with element Jij equivalent to the strength of the synapse from unit j → unit i. The individual weights are chosen independently and randomly from a Gaus2 sian distribution with mean and variance given by [Jij ]J = 0 and Jij J = g 2 /N , where square brackets are ensemble averages [9 - 11,13]. The control parameter g which scales as the variance of the synaptic weights, is particularly important in determining whether or not the network produces spontaneous activity with non-trivial dynamics (Speciﬁcally, g = 0 corresponds to a completely uncoupled network and a network with g = 1 generates non-trivial spontaneous activity [4, 9, 10]). The activation variable for each unit xi is therefore determined by the relation, N τr dxi = −xi + g Jij rj + Ii , dt j=1 with the time scale of the network set by the single-neuron time constant τr of 10 ms. 2 (2) The amplitude I of an oscillatory external input of frequency f , is always the same for each unit, but in some examples shown in this paper, we introduce a neuron-speciﬁc phase factor θi , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2π, such that Ii = I cos(2πf t + θi ) ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N. (3) In visually responsive neurons, this mimics a population of simple cells driven by a drifting grating of temporal frequency f , with the different phases arising from offsets in spatial receptive ﬁeld locations. The randomly assigned phases in our model ensure that the spatial pattern of input is not correlated with the pattern of recurrent connectivity. In our selectivity analysis however (Fig. 3), we replace the random phases with spatial input patterns that are aligned with network connectivity. 2.2 PCA redux Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied proﬁtably to neuronal recordings (see for example [14]) but these analyses often plot activity trajectories corresponding to different network states using the ﬁxed principal component coordinates derived from combined activities under all stimulus conditions. Our analysis offers a complementary approach whereby separate principal components are derived for each stimulus condition, and the resulting principal angles reveal not only the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, but also the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces these trajectories occupy within the full N -dimensional space of neuronal activity. The instantaneous network state can be described by a point in an N -dimensional space with coordinates equal to the ﬁring rates of the N units. Over time, the network activity traverses a trajectory in this N -dimensional space and PCA can be used to delineate the subspace in which this trajectory lies. The analysis is done by diagonalizing the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of network ﬁring rates given by, Dij = (ri (t) − ri )(rj (t) − rj ) , (4) where</p><p>2 0.80760151 <a title="127-lsi-2" href="./nips-2010-Attractor_Dynamics_with_Synaptic_Depression.html">34 nips-2010-Attractor Dynamics with Synaptic Depression</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, He Wang, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Neuronal connection weights exhibit short-term depression (STD). The present study investigates the impact of STD on the dynamics of a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) and its potential roles in neural information processing. We ﬁnd that the network with STD can generate both static and traveling bumps, and STD enhances the performance of the network in tracking external inputs. In particular, we ﬁnd that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau behaviors, namely, the network being initially stimulated to an active state will decay to silence very slowly in the time scale of STD rather than that of neural signaling. We argue that this provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold short-term memory easily and shut off persistent activities naturally.</p><p>3 0.78536564 <a title="127-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Haefner Ralf, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Many studies have explored the impact of response variability on the quality of sensory codes. The source of this variability is almost always assumed to be intrinsic to the brain. However, when inferring a particular stimulus property, variability associated with other stimulus attributes also effectively act as noise. Here we study the impact of such stimulus-induced response variability for the case of binocular disparity inference. We characterize the response distribution for the binocular energy model in response to random dot stereograms and ﬁnd it to be very different from the Poisson-like noise usually assumed. We then compute the Fisher information with respect to binocular disparity, present in the monocular inputs to the standard model of early binocular processing, and thereby obtain an upper bound on how much information a model could theoretically extract from them. Then we analyze the information loss incurred by the different ways of combining those inputs to produce a scalar single-neuron response. We ﬁnd that in the case of depth inference, monocular stimulus variability places a greater limit on the extractable information than intrinsic neuronal noise for typical spike counts. Furthermore, the largest loss of information is incurred by the standard model for position disparity neurons (tuned-excitatory), that are the most ubiquitous in monkey primary visual cortex, while more information from the inputs is preserved in phase-disparity neurons (tuned-near or tuned-far) primarily found in higher cortical regions. 1</p><p>5 0.71740425 <a title="127-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Linear_readout_from_a_neural_population_with_partial_correlation_data.html">161 nips-2010-Linear readout from a neural population with partial correlation data</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Wohrer, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How much information does a neural population convey about a stimulus? Answers to this question are known to strongly depend on the correlation of response variability in neural populations. These noise correlations, however, are essentially immeasurable as the number of parameters in a noise correlation matrix grows quadratically with population size. Here, we suggest to bypass this problem by imposing a parametric model on a noise correlation matrix. Our basic assumption is that noise correlations arise due to common inputs between neurons. On average, noise correlations will therefore reﬂect signal correlations, which can be measured in neural populations. We suggest an explicit parametric dependency between signal and noise correlations. We show how this dependency can be used to ”ﬁll the gaps” in noise correlations matrices using an iterative application of the Wishart distribution over positive deﬁnitive matrices. We apply our method to data from the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a two-alternativeforced choice task. We compare the discrimination thresholds read out from the population of recorded neurons with the discrimination threshold of the monkey and show that our method predicts different results than simpler, average schemes of noise correlations. 1</p><p>6 0.68161786 <a title="127-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Accounting_for_network_effects_in_neuronal_responses_using_L1_regularized_point_process_models.html">21 nips-2010-Accounting for network effects in neuronal responses using L1 regularized point process models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kanaka Rajan, L Abbott, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: How are the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked population responses related? We study the impact of connectivity on the spatial pattern of ﬂuctuations in the input-generated response, by comparing the distribution of evoked and intrinsically generated activity across the different units of a neural network. We develop a complementary approach to principal component analysis in which separate high-variance directions are derived for each input condition. We analyze subspace angles to compute the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, and the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces that driven trajectories occupy within the full space of neuronal activity. In addition to revealing how the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous activity affects input-evoked responses, these methods can be used to infer input selectivity induced by network dynamics from experimentally accessible measures of spontaneous activity (e.g. from voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical imaging experiments). We conclude that the absence of a detailed spatial map of afferent inputs and cortical connectivity does not limit our ability to design spatially extended stimuli that evoke strong responses. 1 1 Motivation Stimulus selectivity in neural networks was historically measured directly from input-driven responses [1], and only later were similar selectivity patterns observed in spontaneous activity across the cortical surface [2, 3]. We argue that it is possible to work in the reverse order, and show that analyzing the distribution of spontaneous activity across the different units in the network can inform us about the selectivity of evoked responses to stimulus features, even when no apparent sensory map exists. Sensory-evoked responses are typically divided into a signal component generated by the stimulus and a noise component corresponding to ongoing activity that is not directly related to the stimulus. Subsequent effort focuses on understanding how the signal depends on properties of the stimulus, while the remaining, irregular part of the response is treated as additive noise. The distinction between external stochastic processes and the noise generated deterministically as a function of intrinsic recurrence has been previously studied in chaotic neural networks [4]. It has also been suggested that internally generated noise is not additive and can be more sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the input, compared to the signal component of the response [5 - 8]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between deterministic intrinsic noise and the spatial properties of the external stimulus is also complex and nonlinear. We study the impact of network connectivity on the spatial pattern of input-driven responses by comparing the structure of evoked and spontaneous activity, and show how the unique signature of these dynamics determines the selectivity of networks to spatial features of the stimuli driving them. 2 Model description In this section, we describe the network model and the methods we use to analyze its dynamics. Subsequent sections explore how the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked responses are related in terms of the distribution of the activity across the network. Finally, we show how the stimulus selectivity of the network can be inferred from its spontaneous activity patterns. 2.1 Network elements We build a ﬁring rate model of N interconnected units characterized by a statistical description of the underlying circuitry (as N → ∞, the system “self averages” making the description independent of a speciﬁc network architecture, see also [11, 12]). Each unit is characterized by an activation variable xi ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N , and a nonlinear response function ri which relates to xi through ri = R0 + φ(xi ) where,   R0 tanh x for x ≤ 0 R0 φ(x) = (1) x  (Rmax − R0 ) tanh otherwise. Rmax −R0 Eq. 1 allows us to independently set the maximum ﬁring rate Rmax and the background rate R0 to biologically reasonable values, while retaining a maximum gradient at x = 0 to guarantee the smoothness of the transition to chaos [4]. We introduce a recurrent weight matrix with element Jij equivalent to the strength of the synapse from unit j → unit i. The individual weights are chosen independently and randomly from a Gaus2 sian distribution with mean and variance given by [Jij ]J = 0 and Jij J = g 2 /N , where square brackets are ensemble averages [9 - 11,13]. The control parameter g which scales as the variance of the synaptic weights, is particularly important in determining whether or not the network produces spontaneous activity with non-trivial dynamics (Speciﬁcally, g = 0 corresponds to a completely uncoupled network and a network with g = 1 generates non-trivial spontaneous activity [4, 9, 10]). The activation variable for each unit xi is therefore determined by the relation, N τr dxi = −xi + g Jij rj + Ii , dt j=1 with the time scale of the network set by the single-neuron time constant τr of 10 ms. 2 (2) The amplitude I of an oscillatory external input of frequency f , is always the same for each unit, but in some examples shown in this paper, we introduce a neuron-speciﬁc phase factor θi , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2π, such that Ii = I cos(2πf t + θi ) ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N. (3) In visually responsive neurons, this mimics a population of simple cells driven by a drifting grating of temporal frequency f , with the different phases arising from offsets in spatial receptive ﬁeld locations. The randomly assigned phases in our model ensure that the spatial pattern of input is not correlated with the pattern of recurrent connectivity. In our selectivity analysis however (Fig. 3), we replace the random phases with spatial input patterns that are aligned with network connectivity. 2.2 PCA redux Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied proﬁtably to neuronal recordings (see for example [14]) but these analyses often plot activity trajectories corresponding to different network states using the ﬁxed principal component coordinates derived from combined activities under all stimulus conditions.

<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Tungyou Lin, Alan Lee, Luminita Vese, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measurements with prior expectations in an optimal, or rational, manner. The basic goal of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More speciﬁcally, we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the performance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness, ﬁrst-order smoothness, and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior distributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we estimate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm (Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion in natural environments. In addition, we found large weights for the second-order smoothness term, indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further, we used the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>3 0.69023997 <a title="127-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>4 0.68850678 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>5 0.64475495 <a title="127-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Over-complete_representations_on_recurrent_neural_networks_can_support_persistent_percepts.html">200 nips-2010-Over-complete representations on recurrent neural networks can support persistent percepts</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaul Druckmann, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: A striking aspect of cortical neural networks is the divergence of a relatively small number of input channels from the peripheral sensory apparatus into a large number of cortical neurons, an over-complete representation strategy. Cortical neurons are then connected by a sparse network of lateral synapses. Here we propose that such architecture may increase the persistence of the representation of an incoming stimulus, or a percept. We demonstrate that for a family of networks in which the receptive ﬁeld of each neuron is re-expressed by its outgoing connections, a represented percept can remain constant despite changing activity. We term this choice of connectivity REceptive FIeld REcombination (REFIRE) networks. The sparse REFIRE network may serve as a high-dimensional integrator and a biologically plausible model of the local cortical circuit. 1</p><p>6 0.64385664 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

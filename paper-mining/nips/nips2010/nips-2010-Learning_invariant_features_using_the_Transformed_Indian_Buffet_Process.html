<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Nicole Krämer</p><p>Abstract: We prove rates of convergence in the statistical sense for kernel-based least squares regression using a conjugate gradient algorithm, where regularization against overﬁtting is obtained by early stopping. This method is directly related to Kernel Partial Least Squares, a regression method that combines supervised dimensionality reduction with least squares projection. The rates depend on two key quantities: ﬁrst, on the regularity of the target regression function and second, on the effective dimensionality of the data mapped into the kernel space. Lower bounds on attainable rates depending on these two quantities were established in earlier literature, and we obtain upper bounds for the considered method that match these lower bounds (up to a log factor) if the true regression function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. If this assumption is not fulﬁlled, we obtain similar convergence rates provided additional unlabeled data are available. The order of the learning rates match state-of-the-art results that were recently obtained for least squares support vector machines and for linear regularization operators. 1</p><p>3 0.10199928 <a title="153-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_the_context_of_a_category.html">155 nips-2010-Learning the context of a category</a></p>

<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Christopher Zach, Marc Pollefeys, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a ”log-bilinear” model that computes class probabilities by combining an input vector multiplicatively with a vector of binary latent variables. Even though the latent variables can take on exponentially many possible combinations of values, we can efﬁciently compute the exact probability of each class by marginalizing over the latent variables. This makes it possible to get the exact gradient of the log likelihood. The bilinear score-functions are deﬁned using a three-dimensional weight tensor, and we show that factorizing this tensor allows the model to encode invariances inherent in a task by learning a dictionary of invariant basis functions. Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that this fully probabilistic model can achieve classiﬁcation performance that is competitive with (kernel) SVMs, backpropagation, and deep belief nets. 1</p><p>5 0.09516295 <a title="153-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Divisive_Normalization%3A_Justification_and_Effectiveness_as_Efficient_Coding_Transform.html">65 nips-2010-Divisive Normalization: Justification and Effectiveness as Efficient Coding Transform</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Divisive normalization (DN) has been advocated as an effective nonlinear efﬁcient coding transform for natural sensory signals with applications in biology and engineering. In this work, we aim to establish a connection between the DN transform and the statistical properties of natural sensory signals. Our analysis is based on the use of multivariate t model to capture some important statistical properties of natural sensory signals. The multivariate t model justiﬁes DN as an approximation to the transform that completely eliminates its statistical dependency. Furthermore, using the multivariate t model and measuring statistical dependency with multi-information, we can precisely quantify the statistical dependency that is reduced by the DN transform. We compare this with the actual performance of the DN transform in reducing statistical dependencies of natural sensory signals. Our theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluations conﬁrm DN as an effective efﬁcient coding transform for natural sensory signals. On the other hand, we also observe a previously unreported phenomenon that DN may increase statistical dependencies when the size of pooling is small. 1</p><p>6 0.087727204 <a title="153-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>

<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>4 0.58916396 <a title="153-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Space-Variant_Single-Image_Blind_Deconvolution_for_Removing_Camera_Shake.html">245 nips-2010-Space-Variant Single-Image Blind Deconvolution for Removing Camera Shake</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Hirsch Michael, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Modelling camera shake as a space-invariant convolution simpliﬁes the problem of removing camera shake, but often insufﬁciently models actual motion blur such as those due to camera rotation and movements outside the sensor plane or when objects in the scene have different distances to the camera. In an effort to address these limitations, (i) we introduce a taxonomy of camera shakes, (ii) we build on a recently introduced framework for space-variant ﬁltering by Hirsch et al. and a fast algorithm for single image blind deconvolution for space-invariant ﬁlters by Cho and Lee to construct a method for blind deconvolution in the case of space-variant blur, and (iii), we present an experimental setup for evaluation that allows us to take images with real camera shake while at the same time recording the spacevariant point spread function corresponding to that blur. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is able to deblur images degraded by spatially-varying blur originating from real camera shake, even without using additionally motion sensor information. 1</p><p>5 0.58510309 <a title="153-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Feature_Transitions_with_Saccadic_Search%3A_Size%2C_Color%2C_and_Orientation_Are_Not_Alike.html">95 nips-2010-Feature Transitions with Saccadic Search: Size, Color, and Orientation Are Not Alike</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Size, color, and orientation have long been considered elementary features whose attributes are extracted in parallel and available to guide the deployment of attention. If each is processed in the same fashion with simply a different set of local detectors, one would expect similar search behaviours on localizing an equivalent ﬂickering change among identically laid out disks. We analyze feature transitions associated with saccadic search and ﬁnd out that size, color, and orientation are not alike in dynamic attribute processing over time. The Markovian feature transition is attractive for size, repulsive for color, and largely reversible for orientation. 1</p><p>6 0.57595313 <a title="153-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_to_combine_foveal_glimpses_with_a_third-order_Boltzmann_machine.html">156 nips-2010-Learning to combine foveal glimpses with a third-order Boltzmann machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicholas Bartlett, Frank Wood, David Tax</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to learning with probabilistic deterministic ﬁnite automata (PDFA). We deﬁne and develop a sampler for a PDFA with an inﬁnite number of states which we call the probabilistic deterministic inﬁnite automata (PDIA). Posterior predictive inference in this model, given a ﬁnite training sequence, can be interpreted as averaging over multiple PDFAs of varying structure, where each PDFA is biased towards having few states. We suggest that our method for averaging over PDFAs is a novel approach to predictive distribution smoothing. We test PDIA inference both on PDFA structure learning and on both natural language and DNA data prediction tasks. The results suggest that the PDIA presents an attractive compromise between the computational cost of hidden Markov models and the storage requirements of hierarchically smoothed Markov models. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76774919 <a title="153-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Learning_invariant_features_using_the_Transformed_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">153 nips-2010-Learning invariant features using the Transformed Indian Buffet Process</a></p>

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>4 0.71889734 <a title="153-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_concept_graphs_from_text_with_stick-breaking_priors.html">150 nips-2010-Learning concept graphs from text with stick-breaking priors</a></p>
<p>Author: America Chambers, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative probabilistic model for learning general graph structures, which we term concept graphs, from text. Concept graphs provide a visual summary of the thematic content of a collection of documents—a task that is difﬁcult to accomplish using only keyword search. The proposed model can learn different types of concept graph structures and is capable of utilizing partial prior knowledge about graph structure as well as labeled documents. We describe a generative model that is based on a stick-breaking process for graphs, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data show that the model can recover known graph structure when learning in both unsupervised and semi-supervised modes. We also show that the proposed model is competitive in terms of empirical log likelihood with existing structure-based topic models (hPAM and hLDA) on real-world text data sets. Finally, we illustrate the application of the model to the problem of updating Wikipedia category graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.70217049 <a title="153-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Multivariate_Dyadic_Regression_Trees_for_Sparse_Learning_Problems.html">178 nips-2010-Multivariate Dyadic Regression Trees for Sparse Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric learning method based on multivariate dyadic regression trees (MDRTs). Unlike traditional dyadic decision trees (DDTs) or classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs), MDRTs are constructed using penalized empirical risk minimization with a novel sparsity-inducing penalty. Theoretically, we show that MDRTs can simultaneously adapt to the unknown sparsity and smoothness of the true regression functions, and achieve the nearly optimal rates of convergence (in a minimax sense) for the class of (α, C)-smooth functions. Empirically, MDRTs can simultaneously conduct function estimation and variable selection in high dimensions. To make MDRTs applicable for large-scale learning problems, we propose a greedy heuristics. The superior performance of MDRTs are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.70141339 <a title="153-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-A_biologically_plausible_network_for_the_computation_of_orientation_dominance.html">17 nips-2010-A biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance</a></p>

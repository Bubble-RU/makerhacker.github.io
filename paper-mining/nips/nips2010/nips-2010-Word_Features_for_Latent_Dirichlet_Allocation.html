<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>3 0.19091488 <a title="286-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Michael I. Jordan, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a ﬂexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are inﬁnitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing inﬁnite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data. 1</p><p>5 0.14807998 <a title="286-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_concept_graphs_from_text_with_stick-breaking_priors.html">150 nips-2010-Learning concept graphs from text with stick-breaking priors</a></p>
<p>Author: America Chambers, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative probabilistic model for learning general graph structures, which we term concept graphs, from text. Concept graphs provide a visual summary of the thematic content of a collection of documents—a task that is difﬁcult to accomplish using only keyword search. The proposed model can learn different types of concept graph structures and is capable of utilizing partial prior knowledge about graph structure as well as labeled documents. We describe a generative model that is based on a stick-breaking process for graphs, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data show that the model can recover known graph structure when learning in both unsupervised and semi-supervised modes. We also show that the proposed model is competitive in terms of empirical log likelihood with existing structure-based topic models (hPAM and hLDA) on real-world text data sets. Finally, we illustrate the application of the model to the problem of updating Wikipedia category graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.13461027 <a title="286-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Wang, Dehong Liu, Jorge Silva, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: We consider problems for which one has incomplete binary matrices that evolve with time (e.g., the votes of legislators on particular legislation, with each year characterized by a different such matrix). An objective of such analysis is to infer structure and inter-relationships underlying the matrices, here deﬁned by latent features associated with each axis of the matrix. In addition, it is assumed that documents are available for the entities associated with at least one of the matrix axes. By jointly analyzing the matrices and documents, one may be used to inform the other within the analysis, and the model offers the opportunity to predict matrix values (e.g., votes) based only on an associated document (e.g., legislation). The research presented here merges two areas of machine-learning that have previously been investigated separately: incomplete-matrix analysis and topic modeling. The analysis is performed from a Bayesian perspective, with efﬁcient inference constituted via Gibbs sampling. The framework is demonstrated by considering all voting data and available documents (legislation) during the 220-year lifetime of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. 1</p><p>5 0.63249582 <a title="286-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Synergies_in_learning_words_and_their_referents.html">264 nips-2010-Synergies in learning words and their referents</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Katherine Demuth, Bevan Jones, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Bayesian non-parametric models that simultaneously learn to segment words from phoneme strings and learn the referents of some of those words, and shows that there is a synergistic interaction in the acquisition of these two kinds of linguistic information. The models themselves are novel kinds of Adaptor Grammars that are an extension of an embedding of topic models into PCFGs. These models simultaneously segment phoneme sequences into words and learn the relationship between non-linguistic objects to the words that refer to them. We show (i) that modelling inter-word dependencies not only improves the accuracy of the word segmentation but also of word-object relationships, and (ii) that a model that simultaneously learns word-object relationships and word segmentation segments more accurately than one that just learns word segmentation on its own. We argue that these results support an interactive view of language acquisition that can take advantage of synergies such as these. 1</p><p>6 0.61424762 <a title="286-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Why_are_some_word_orders_more_common_than_others%3F_A_uniform_information_density_account.html">285 nips-2010-Why are some word orders more common than others?

<p>Author: Tobias Glasmachers</p><p>Abstract: Steinwart was the ﬁrst to prove universal consistency of support vector machine classiﬁcation. His proof analyzed the ‘standard’ support vector machine classiﬁer, which is restricted to binary classiﬁcation problems. In contrast, recent analysis has resulted in the common belief that several extensions of SVM classiﬁcation to more than two classes are inconsistent. Countering this belief, we prove the universal consistency of the multi-class support vector machine by Crammer and Singer. Our proof extends Steinwart’s techniques to the multi-class case. 1</p><p>3 0.62626994 <a title="286-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Markus Weimer, Lihong Li, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the ﬁrst parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8]. 1</p><p>5 0.62281096 <a title="286-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-A_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Group_Sparse_Regularization_with_Overlapping_Groups.html">12 nips-2010-A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Group Sparse Regularization with Overlapping Groups</a></p>
<p>Author: Sofia Mosci, Silvia Villa, Alessandro Verri, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of variable selection when variables must be selected group-wise, with possibly overlapping groups deﬁned a priori. In particular we propose a new optimization procedure for solving the regularized algorithm presented in [12], where the group lasso penalty is generalized to overlapping groups of variables. While in [12] the proposed implementation requires explicit replication of the variables belonging to more than one group, our iterative procedure is based on a combination of proximal methods in the primal space and projected Newton method in a reduced dual space, corresponding to the active groups. This procedure provides a scalable alternative with no need for data duplication, and allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction. The computational advantages of our scheme with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms using data duplication are shown empirically with numerical simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.62244844 <a title="286-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">194 nips-2010-Online Learning for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth regionto-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.</p><p>3 0.34983173 <a title="240-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-The_Multidimensional_Wisdom_of_Crowds.html">267 nips-2010-The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Welinder, Steve Branson, Pietro Perona, Serge J. Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Distributing labeling tasks among hundreds or thousands of annotators is an increasingly important method for annotating large datasets. We present a method for estimating the underlying value (e.g. the class) of each image from (noisy) annotations provided by multiple annotators. Our method is based on a model of the image formation and annotation process. Each image has different characteristics that are represented in an abstract Euclidean space. Each annotator is modeled as a multidimensional entity with variables representing competence, expertise and bias. This allows the model to discover and represent groups of annotators that have different sets of skills and knowledge, as well as groups of images that differ qualitatively. We ﬁnd that our model predicts ground truth labels on both synthetic and real data more accurately than state of the art methods. Experiments also show that our model, starting from a set of binary labels, may discover rich information, such as different “schools of thought” amongst the annotators, and can group together images belonging to separate categories. 1</p><p>4 0.25571123 <a title="240-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new supervised learning framework for visual object counting tasks, such as estimating the number of cells in a microscopic image or the number of humans in surveillance video frames. We focus on the practically-attractive case when the training images are annotated with dots (one dot per object). Our goal is to accurately estimate the count. However, we evade the hard task of learning to detect and localize individual object instances. Instead, we cast the problem as that of estimating an image density whose integral over any image region gives the count of objects within that region. Learning to infer such density can be formulated as a minimization of a regularized risk quadratic cost function. We introduce a new loss function, which is well-suited for such learning, and at the same time can be computed efﬁciently via a maximum subarray algorithm. The learning can then be posed as a convex quadratic program solvable with cutting-plane optimization. The proposed framework is very ﬂexible as it can accept any domain-speciﬁc visual features. Once trained, our system provides accurate object counts and requires a very small time overhead over the feature extraction step, making it a good candidate for applications involving real-time processing or dealing with huge amount of visual data. 1</p><p>5 0.22572944 <a title="240-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>6 0.19201982 <a title="240-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Exploiting_weakly-labeled_Web_images_to_improve_object_classification%3A_a_domain_adaptation_approach.html">86 nips-2010-Exploiting weakly-labeled Web images to improve object classification: a domain adaptation approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Chen, Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Learning from multi-view data is important in many applications, such as image classiﬁcation and annotation. In this paper, we present a large-margin learning framework to discover a predictive latent subspace representation shared by multiple views. Our approach is based on an undirected latent space Markov network that fulﬁlls a weak conditional independence assumption that multi-view observations and response variables are independent given a set of latent variables. We provide efﬁcient inference and parameter estimation methods for the latent subspace model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of large-margin learning on real video and web image data for discovering predictive latent representations and improving the performance on image classiﬁcation, annotation and retrieval.</p><p>6 0.62915951 <a title="240-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exploiting_weakly-labeled_Web_images_to_improve_object_classification%3A_a_domain_adaptation_approach.html">86 nips-2010-Exploiting weakly-labeled Web images to improve object classification: a domain adaptation approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Gowtham Bellala, Suresh Bhavnani, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Binary Search (GBS) is a well known greedy algorithm for identifying an unknown object while minimizing the number of “yes” or “no” questions posed about that object, and arises in problems such as active learning and active diagnosis. Here, we provide a coding-theoretic interpretation for GBS and show that GBS can be viewed as a top-down algorithm that greedily minimizes the expected number of queries required to identify an object. This interpretation is then used to extend GBS in two ways. First, we consider the case where the objects are partitioned into groups, and the objective is to identify only the group to which the object belongs. Then, we consider the case where the cost of identifying an object grows exponentially in the number of queries. In each case, we present an exact formula for the objective function involving Shannon or R´ nyi entropy, and e develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing it. 1</p><p>2 0.97584856 <a title="240-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Sodium_entry_efficiency_during_action_potentials%3A_A_novel_single-parameter_family_of_Hodgkin-Huxley_models.html">244 nips-2010-Sodium entry efficiency during action potentials: A novel single-parameter family of Hodgkin-Huxley models</a></p>
<p>Author: Anand Singh, Renaud Jolivet, Pierre Magistretti, Bruno Weber</p><p>Abstract: Sodium entry during an action potential determines the energy efﬁciency of a neuron. The classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation is notoriously inefﬁcient in that regard with about 4 times more charges ﬂowing through the membrane than the theoretical minimum required to achieve the observed depolarization. Yet, recent experimental results show that mammalian neurons are close to the optimal metabolic efﬁciency and that the dynamics of their voltage-gated channels is signiﬁcantly different than the one exhibited by the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model during the action potential. Nevertheless, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model is still widely used and rarely to model the squid giant axon from which it was extracted. Here, we introduce a novel family of HodgkinHuxley models that correctly account for sodium entry, action potential width and whose voltage-gated channels display a dynamics very similar to the most recent experimental observations in mammalian neurons. We speak here about a family of models because the model is parameterized by a unique parameter the variations of which allow to reproduce the entire range of experimental observations from cortical pyramidal neurons to Purkinje cells, yielding a very economical framework to model a wide range of different central neurons. The present paper demonstrates the performances and discuss the properties of this new family of models. 1</p><p>3 0.96177649 <a title="240-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Static_Analysis_of_Binary_Executables_Using_Structural_SVMs.html">255 nips-2010-Static Analysis of Binary Executables Using Structural SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Karampatziakis</p><p>Abstract: We cast the problem of identifying basic blocks of code in a binary executable as learning a mapping from a byte sequence to a segmentation of the sequence. In general, inference in segmentation models, such as semi-CRFs, can be cubic in the length of the sequence. By taking advantage of the structure of our problem, we derive a linear-time inference algorithm which makes our approach practical, given that even small programs are tens or hundreds of thousands bytes long. Furthermore, we introduce two loss functions which are appropriate for our problem and show how to use structural SVMs to optimize the learned mapping for these losses. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of our method against a strong baseline. 1</p><p>4 0.95955914 <a title="240-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Near-Optimal_Bayesian_Active_Learning_with_Noisy_Observations.html">180 nips-2010-Near-Optimal Bayesian Active Learning with Noisy Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Golovin, Andreas Krause, Debajyoti Ray</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the fundamental problem of Bayesian active learning with noise, where we need to adaptively select from a number of expensive tests in order to identify an unknown hypothesis sampled from a known prior distribution. In the case of noise–free observations, a greedy algorithm called generalized binary search (GBS) is known to perform near–optimally. We show that if the observations are noisy, perhaps surprisingly, GBS can perform very poorly. We develop EC2 , a novel, greedy active learning algorithm and prove that it is competitive with the optimal policy, thus obtaining the ﬁrst competitiveness guarantees for Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Our bounds rely on a recently discovered diminishing returns property called adaptive submodularity, generalizing the classical notion of submodular set functions to adaptive policies. Our results hold even if the tests have non–uniform cost and their noise is correlated. We also propose E FF ECXTIVE , a particularly fast approximation of EC 2 , and evaluate it on a Bayesian experimental design problem involving human subjects, intended to tease apart competing economic theories of how people make decisions under uncertainty. 1</p><p>5 0.93894529 <a title="240-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Smoothness%2C_Low_Noise_and_Fast_Rates.html">243 nips-2010-Smoothness, Low Noise and Fast Rates</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Srebro, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: √ ˜ We establish an excess risk bound of O HR2 + HL∗ Rn for ERM with an H-smooth loss n function and a hypothesis class with Rademacher complexity Rn , where L∗ is the best risk achievable by the hypothesis class. For typical hypothesis classes where Rn = R/n, this translates to ˜ ˜ a learning rate of O (RH/n) in the separable (L∗ = 0) case and O RH/n + L∗ RH/n more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization of a smooth non-negative objective. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.93395144 <a title="240-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>

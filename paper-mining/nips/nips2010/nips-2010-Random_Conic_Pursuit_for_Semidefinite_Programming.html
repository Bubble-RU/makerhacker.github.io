<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>3 0.14394714 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-The_LASSO_risk%3A_asymptotic_results_and_real_world_examples.html">265 nips-2010-The LASSO risk: asymptotic results and real world examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, José Pereira, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector x0 ∈ RN from noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w ∈ Rn . In many contexts (ranging from model selection to image processing) it is desirable to construct a sparse estimator x. In this case, a popular approach consists in solving an ℓ1 -penalized least squares problem known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). For sequences of matrices A of increasing dimensions, with independent gaussian entries, we prove that the normalized risk of the LASSO converges to a limit, and we obtain an explicit expression for this limit. Our result is the ﬁrst rigorous derivation of an explicit formula for the asymptotic mean square error of the LASSO for random instances. The proof technique is based on the analysis of AMP, a recently developed efﬁcient algorithm, that is inspired from graphical models ideas. Through simulations on real data matrices (gene expression data and hospital medical records) we observe that these results can be relevant in a broad array of practical applications.</p><p>4 0.14150865 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Random_Walk_Approach_to_Regret_Minimization.html">222 nips-2010-Random Walk Approach to Regret Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Koby Crammer</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework to online learning for classiﬁcation problems with time-varying potential functions in the adversarial setting. This framework allows to design and prove relative mistake bounds for any generic loss function. The mistake bounds can be specialized for the hinge loss, allowing to recover and improve the bounds of known online classiﬁcation algorithms. By optimizing the general bound we derive a new online classiﬁcation algorithm, called NAROW, that hybridly uses adaptive- and ﬁxed- second order information. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance using synthetic dataset. 1</p><p>5 0.45494711 <a title="219-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-CUR_from_a_Sparse_Optimization_Viewpoint.html">45 nips-2010-CUR from a Sparse Optimization Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Bien, Ya Xu, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: The CUR decomposition provides an approximation of a matrix X that has low reconstruction error and that is sparse in the sense that the resulting approximation lies in the span of only a few columns of X. In this regard, it appears to be similar to many sparse PCA methods. However, CUR takes a randomized algorithmic approach, whereas most sparse PCA methods are framed as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we try to understand CUR from a sparse optimization viewpoint. We show that CUR is implicitly optimizing a sparse regression objective and, furthermore, cannot be directly cast as a sparse PCA method. We also observe that the sparsity attained by CUR possesses an interesting structure, which leads us to formulate a sparse PCA method that achieves a CUR-like sparsity.</p><p>6 0.45242622 <a title="219-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Sparse_Coding_for_Learning_Interpretable_Spatio-Temporal_Primitives.html">246 nips-2010-Sparse Coding for Learning Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Primitives</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrey Bernstein, Shie Mannor, Nahum Shimkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online binary classiﬁcation problem, where we are given m classiﬁers. At each stage, the classiﬁers map the input to the probability that the input belongs to the positive class. An online classiﬁcation meta-algorithm is an algorithm that combines the outputs of the classiﬁers in order to attain a certain goal, without having prior knowledge on the form and statistics of the input, and without prior knowledge on the performance of the given classiﬁers. In this paper, we use sensitivity and speciﬁcity as the performance metrics of the meta-algorithm. In particular, our goal is to design an algorithm that satisﬁes the following two properties (asymptotically): (i) its average false positive rate (fp-rate) is under some given threshold; and (ii) its average true positive rate (tp-rate) is not worse than the tp-rate of the best convex combination of the m given classiﬁers that satisﬁes fprate constraint, in hindsight. We show that this problem is in fact a special case of the regret minimization problem with constraints, and therefore the above goal is not attainable. Hence, we pose a relaxed goal and propose a corresponding practical online learning meta-algorithm that attains it. In the case of two classiﬁers, we show that this algorithm takes a very simple form. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that addresses the problem of the average tp-rate maximization under average fp-rate constraints in the online setting. 1</p><p>3 0.71231914 <a title="219-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>4 0.70641619 <a title="219-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Practical_Large-Scale_Optimization_for_Max-norm_Regularization.html">210 nips-2010-Practical Large-Scale Optimization for Max-norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ben Recht, Nathan Srebro, Joel Tropp, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: The max-norm was proposed as a convex matrix regularizer in [1] and was shown to be empirically superior to the trace-norm for collaborative ﬁltering problems. Although the max-norm can be computed in polynomial time, there are currently no practical algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems that incorporate the max-norm. The present work uses a factorization technique of Burer and Monteiro [2] to devise scalable ﬁrst-order algorithms for convex programs involving the max-norm. These algorithms are applied to solve huge collaborative ﬁltering, graph cut, and clustering problems. Empirically, the new methods outperform mature techniques from all three areas. 1</p><p>5 0.70523775 <a title="219-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Collaborative_Filtering_in_a_Non-Uniform_World%3A_Learning_with_the_Weighted_Trace_Norm.html">48 nips-2010-Collaborative Filtering in a Non-Uniform World: Learning with the Weighted Trace Norm</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Srebro, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be signiﬁcantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly, but that a properly weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer works well with non-uniform sampling. We show that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields signiﬁcant gains on the highly non-uniformly sampled Netﬂix dataset.</p><p>6 0.70367807 <a title="219-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

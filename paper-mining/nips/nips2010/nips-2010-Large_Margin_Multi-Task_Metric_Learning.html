<p>Author: Yung-kyun Noh, Byoung-tak Zhang, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a local metric to enhance the performance of nearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Conventional metric learning methods attempt to separate data distributions in a purely discriminative manner; here we show how to take advantage of information from parametric generative models. We focus on the bias in the information-theoretic error arising from ﬁnite sampling effects, and ﬁnd an appropriate local metric that maximally reduces the bias based upon knowledge from generative models. As a byproduct, the asymptotic theoretical analysis in this work relates metric learning with dimensionality reduction, which was not understood from previous discriminative approaches. Empirical experiments show that this learned local metric enhances the discriminative nearest neighbor performance on various datasets using simple class conditional generative models. 1</p><p>3 0.23961751 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_a_Sparse_Matrix-Normal_Penalty.html">147 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks with a Sparse Matrix-Normal Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a matrix-variate normal penalty with sparse inverse covariances to couple multiple tasks. Learning multiple (parametric) models can be viewed as estimating a matrix of parameters, where rows and columns of the matrix correspond to tasks and features, respectively. Following the matrix-variate normal density, we design a penalty that decomposes the full covariance of matrix elements into the Kronecker product of row covariance and column covariance, which characterizes both task relatedness and feature representation. Several recently proposed methods are variants of the special cases of this formulation. To address the overﬁtting issue and select meaningful task and feature structures, we include sparse covariance selection into our matrix-normal regularization via ℓ1 penalties on task and feature inverse covariances. We empirically study the proposed method and compare with related models in two real-world problems: detecting landmines in multiple ﬁelds and recognizing faces between different subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides an effective and ﬂexible way to model various different structures of multiple tasks.</p><p>4 0.18899322 <a title="138-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Manifold_Regularization.html">146 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks using Manifold Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Arvind Agarwal, Samuel Gerber, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for multitask learning (MTL) based on manifold regularization: assume that all task parameters lie on a manifold. This is the generalization of a common assumption made in the existing literature: task parameters share a common linear subspace. One proposed method uses the projection distance from the manifold to regularize the task parameters. The manifold structure and the task parameters are learned using an alternating optimization framework. When the manifold structure is ﬁxed, our method decomposes across tasks which can be learnt independently. An approximation of the manifold regularization scheme is presented that preserves the convexity of the single task learning problem, and makes the proposed MTL framework efﬁcient and easy to implement. We show the efﬁcacy of our method on several datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.16283517 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Graph-Valued_Regression.html">108 nips-2010-Graph-Valued Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen, Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphical models encode in a graph G the dependency structure of a random vector Y . In many applications, it is of interest to model Y given another random vector X as input. We refer to the problem of estimating the graph G(x) of Y conditioned on X = x as “graph-valued regression”. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating G(x) that builds a tree on the X space just as in CART (classiﬁcation and regression trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. We call the method “Graph-optimized CART”, or GoCART. We study the theoretical properties of Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on risk minimization and tree partition consistency. We also demonstrate the application of Go-CART to a meteorological dataset, showing how graph-valued regression can provide a useful tool for analyzing complex data. 1</p><p>6 0.114161 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Inductive_Regularized_Learning_of_Kernel_Functions.html">124 nips-2010-Inductive Regularized Learning of Kernel Functions</a></p>

This is in contrast with existing methods which either assume that the label sets shared by different tasks are the same or that there exists a label mapping oracle. Our method directly maximizes the mutual information among the labels, and we show that the resulting objective function can be efﬁciently optimized using existing algorithms. Our proposed approach has a direct application for data integration with different label spaces, such as integrating Yahoo! and DMOZ web directories. 1</p><p>6 0.47497237 <a title="138-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive_Embedding_by_Nonlinear_NCA_Regression.html">209 nips-2010-Pose-Sensitive Embedding by Nonlinear NCA Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Xu, Charles Kemp</p><p>Abstract: Communication between a speaker and hearer will be most efﬁcient when both parties make accurate inferences about the other. We study inference and communication in a television game called Password, where speakers must convey secret words to hearers by providing one-word clues. Our working hypothesis is that human communication is relatively efﬁcient, and we use game show data to examine three predictions. First, we predict that speakers and hearers are both considerate, and that both take the other’s perspective into account. Second, we predict that speakers and hearers are calibrated, and that both make accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other. Finally, we predict that speakers and hearers are collaborative, and that they tend to share the cognitive burden of communication equally. We ﬁnd evidence in support of all three predictions, and demonstrate in addition that efﬁcient communication tends to break down when speakers and hearers are placed under time pressure.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7227993 <a title="138-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Large_Margin_Multi-Task_Metric_Learning.html">138 nips-2010-Large Margin Multi-Task Metric Learning</a></p>

One of the most prominent multi-task learning algorithms is an extension to support vector machines (svm) by Evgeniou et al. [15].

<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.61589295 <a title="138-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Robust_PCA_via_Outlier_Pursuit.html">231 nips-2010-Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>5 0.61523229 <a title="138-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Latent_Variable_Models.html">235 nips-2010-Self-Paced Learning for Latent Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Benjamin Packer, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models are a powerful tool for addressing several tasks in machine learning. However, the algorithms for learning the parameters of latent variable models are prone to getting stuck in a bad local optimum. To alleviate this problem, we build on the intuition that, rather than considering all samples simultaneously, the algorithm should be presented with the training data in a meaningful order that facilitates learning. The order of the samples is determined by how easy they are. The main challenge is that often we are not provided with a readily computable measure of the easiness of samples. We address this issue by proposing a novel, iterative self-paced learning algorithm where each iteration simultaneously selects easy samples and learns a new parameter vector. The number of samples selected is governed by a weight that is annealed until the entire training data has been considered. We empirically demonstrate that the self-paced learning algorithm outperforms the state of the art method for learning a latent structural SVM on four applications: object localization, noun phrase coreference, motif ﬁnding and handwritten digit recognition. 1</p><p>6 0.61437458 <a title="138-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Optimization_for_Discriminative_Latent_Class_Models.html">70 nips-2010-Efficient Optimization for Discriminative Latent Class Models</a></p>

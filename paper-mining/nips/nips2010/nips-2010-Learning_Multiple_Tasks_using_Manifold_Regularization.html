<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a matrix-variate normal penalty with sparse inverse covariances to couple multiple tasks. Learning multiple (parametric) models can be viewed as estimating a matrix of parameters, where rows and columns of the matrix correspond to tasks and features, respectively. Following the matrix-variate normal density, we design a penalty that decomposes the full covariance of matrix elements into the Kronecker product of row covariance and column covariance, which characterizes both task relatedness and feature representation. Several recently proposed methods are variants of the special cases of this formulation. To address the overﬁtting issue and select meaningful task and feature structures, we include sparse covariance selection into our matrix-normal regularization via ℓ1 penalties on task and feature inverse covariances. We empirically study the proposed method and compare with related models in two real-world problems: detecting landmines in multiple ﬁelds and recognizing faces between different subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides an effective and ﬂexible way to model various different structures of multiple tasks.</p><p>3 0.26868883 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Sample_Complexity_of_Testing_the_Manifold_Hypothesis.html">232 nips-2010-Sample Complexity of Testing the Manifold Hypothesis</a></p>
<p>Author: Hariharan Narayanan, Sanjoy Mitter</p><p>Abstract: The hypothesis that high dimensional data tends to lie in the vicinity of a low dimensional manifold is the basis of a collection of methodologies termed Manifold Learning. In this paper, we study statistical aspects of the question of ﬁtting a manifold with a nearly optimal least squared error. Given upper bounds on the dimension, volume, and curvature, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization can produce a nearly optimal manifold using a number of random samples that is independent of the ambient dimension of the space in which data lie. We obtain an upper bound on the required number of samples that depends polynomially on the curvature, exponentially on the intrinsic dimension, and linearly on the intrinsic volume. For constant error, we prove a matching minimax lower bound on the sample complexity that shows that this dependence on intrinsic dimension, volume log 1 and curvature is unavoidable. Whether the known lower bound of O( k + 2 δ ) 2 for the sample complexity of Empirical Risk minimization on k−means applied to data in a unit ball of arbitrary dimension is tight, has been an open question since 1997 [3]. Here is the desired bound on the error and δ is a bound on the probability of failure. We improve the best currently known upper bound [14] of 2 log 1 log4 k log 1 O( k2 + 2 δ ) to O k min k, 2 + 2 δ . Based on these results, we 2 devise a simple algorithm for k−means and another that uses a family of convex programs to ﬁt a piecewise linear curve of a speciﬁed length to high dimensional data, where the sample complexity is independent of the ambient dimension. 1</p><p>4 0.19129005 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Online_Learning_in_The_Manifold_of_Low-Rank_Matrices.html">195 nips-2010-Online Learning in The Manifold of Low-Rank Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches for minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is hard to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another second-order retraction that can be computed efﬁciently, with run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, given rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, LORETA, to learn a matrixform similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. LORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive- aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained over pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. LORETA also showed consistent improvement over standard methods in a large (1600 classes) multi-label image classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>5 0.18899322 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Large_Margin_Multi-Task_Metric_Learning.html">138 nips-2010-Large Margin Multi-Task Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shibin Parameswaran, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) improves the prediction performance on multiple, different but related, learning problems through shared parameters or representations. One of the most prominent multi-task learning algorithms is an extension to support vector machines (svm) by Evgeniou et al. [15]. Although very elegant, multi-task svm is inherently restricted by the fact that support vector machines require each class to be addressed explicitly with its own weight vector which, in a multi-task setting, requires the different learning tasks to share the same set of classes. This paper proposes an alternative formulation for multi-task learning by extending the recently published large margin nearest neighbor (lmnn) algorithm to the MTL paradigm. Instead of relying on separating hyperplanes, its decision function is based on the nearest neighbor rule which inherently extends to many classes and becomes a natural ﬁt for multi-task learning. We evaluate the resulting multi-task lmnn on real-world insurance data and speech classiﬁcation problems and show that it consistently outperforms single-task kNN under several metrics and state-of-the-art MTL classiﬁers. 1</p><p>6 0.17402638 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Humans_Learn_Using_Manifolds%2C_Reluctantly.html">114 nips-2010-Humans Learn Using Manifolds, Reluctantly</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim Rogers, Chuck Kalish, Joseph Harrison, Xiaojin Zhu, Bryan R. Gibson</p><p>Abstract: When the distribution of unlabeled data in feature space lies along a manifold, the information it provides may be used by a learner to assist classiﬁcation in a semi-supervised setting. While manifold learning is well-known in machine learning, the use of manifolds in human learning is largely unstudied. We perform a set of experiments which test a human’s ability to use a manifold in a semisupervised learning task, under varying conditions. We show that humans may be encouraged into using the manifold, overcoming the strong preference for a simple, axis-parallel linear boundary. 1</p><p>4 0.49551436 <a title="146-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Large_Margin_Multi-Task_Metric_Learning.html">138 nips-2010-Large Margin Multi-Task Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand, Csaba Szepesvári, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We address the question of how the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration of the Approximate Policy/Value Iteration algorithms inﬂuences the quality of the resulted policy. We quantify the performance loss as the Lp norm of the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum – as opposed to what has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the earlier iterations decays exponentially fast. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79315746 <a title="146-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Manifold_Regularization.html">146 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks using Manifold Regularization</a></p>

We show the efﬁcacy of our method on several datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.79267901 <a title="146-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Spectral_Regularization_for_Support_Estimation.html">250 nips-2010-Spectral Regularization for Support Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ernesto D. Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Alessandro Toigo</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning from data the support of a probability distribution when the distribution does not have a density (with respect to some reference measure). We propose a new class of regularized spectral estimators based on a new notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we call “completely regular”. Completely regular kernels allow to capture the relevant geometric and topological properties of an arbitrary probability space. In particular, they are the key ingredient to prove the universal consistency of the spectral estimators and in this respect they are the analogue of universal kernels for supervised problems. Numerical experiments show that spectral estimators compare favorably to state of the art machine learning algorithms for density support estimation.</p><p>4 0.75305045 <a title="146-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Robust_PCA_via_Outlier_Pursuit.html">231 nips-2010-Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>5 0.72438771 <a title="146-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: During the last years support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied in situations where the input space X is not necessarily a subset of Rd . Examples include SVMs for the analysis of histograms or colored images, SVMs for text classiÄ?Ĺš cation and web mining, and SVMs for applications from computational biology using, e.g., kernels for trees and graphs. Moreover, SVMs are known to be consistent to the Bayes risk, if either the input space is a complete separable metric space and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Lp (PX ) is dense, or if the SVM uses a universal kernel k. So far, however, there are no kernels of practical interest known that satisfy these assumptions, if X Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Rd . We close this gap by providing a general technique based on Taylor-type kernels to explicitly construct universal kernels on compact metric spaces which are not subset of Rd . We apply this technique for the following special cases: universal kernels on the set of probability measures, universal kernels based on Fourier transforms, and universal kernels for signal processing. 1</p><p>6 0.71963316 <a title="146-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_the_context_of_a_category.html">155 nips-2010-Learning the context of a category</a></p>

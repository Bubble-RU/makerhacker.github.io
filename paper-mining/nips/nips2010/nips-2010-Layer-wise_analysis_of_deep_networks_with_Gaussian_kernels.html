<p>Author: Jiquan Ngiam, Zhenghao Chen, Daniel Chia, Pang W. Koh, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many tasks such as digit and object recognition. Using convolutional (tied) weights signiﬁcantly reduces the number of parameters that have to be learned, and also allows translational invariance to be hard-coded into the architecture. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning invariances, rather than relying on hardcoding. We propose tiled convolution neural networks (Tiled CNNs), which use a regular “tiled” pattern of tied weights that does not require that adjacent hidden units share identical weights, but instead requires only that hidden units k steps away from each other to have tied weights. By pooling over neighboring units, this architecture is able to learn complex invariances (such as scale and rotational invariance) beyond translational invariance. Further, it also enjoys much of CNNs’ advantage of having a relatively small number of learned parameters (such as ease of learning and greater scalability). We provide an efﬁcient learning algorithm for Tiled CNNs based on Topographic ICA, and show that learning complex invariant features allows us to achieve highly competitive results for both the NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.19651102 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Layered_image_motion_with_explicit_occlusions%2C_temporal_consistency%2C_and_depth_ordering.html">141 nips-2010-Layered image motion with explicit occlusions, temporal consistency, and depth ordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Deqing Sun, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Layered models are a powerful way of describing natural scenes containing smooth surfaces that may overlap and occlude each other. For image motion estimation, such models have a long history but have not achieved the wide use or accuracy of non-layered methods. We present a new probabilistic model of optical ﬂow in layers that addresses many of the shortcomings of previous approaches. In particular, we deﬁne a probabilistic graphical model that explicitly captures: 1) occlusions and disocclusions; 2) depth ordering of the layers; 3) temporal consistency of the layer segmentation. Additionally the optical ﬂow in each layer is modeled by a combination of a parametric model and a smooth deviation based on an MRF with a robust spatial prior; the resulting model allows roughness in layers. Finally, a key contribution is the formulation of the layers using an imagedependent hidden ﬁeld prior based on recent models for static scene segmentation. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Middlebury benchmark and produces meaningful scene segmentations as well as detected occlusion regions.</p><p>5 0.19552924 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Gated_Softmax_Classification.html">99 nips-2010-Gated Softmax Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Christopher Zach, Marc Pollefeys, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a ”log-bilinear” model that computes class probabilities by combining an input vector multiplicatively with a vector of binary latent variables. Even though the latent variables can take on exponentially many possible combinations of values, we can efﬁciently compute the exact probability of each class by marginalizing over the latent variables. This makes it possible to get the exact gradient of the log likelihood. The bilinear score-functions are deﬁned using a three-dimensional weight tensor, and we show that factorizing this tensor allows the model to encode invariances inherent in a task by learning a dictionary of invariant basis functions. Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that this fully probabilistic model can achieve classiﬁcation performance that is competitive with (kernel) SVMs, backpropagation, and deep belief nets. 1</p><p>6 0.17484319 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Phone_Recognition_with_the_Mean-Covariance_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">206 nips-2010-Phone Recognition with the Mean-Covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Peggy Series, David P. Reichert, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: The Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is characterized by complex vivid visual hallucinations in people with, primarily, eye diseases and no other neurological pathology. We present a Deep Boltzmann Machine model of CBS, exploring two core hypotheses: First, that the visual cortex learns a generative or predictive model of sensory input, thus explaining its capability to generate internal imagery. And second, that homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neuronal activity levels, leading to hallucinations being formed when input is lacking. We reproduce a variety of qualitative ﬁndings in CBS. We also introduce a modiﬁcation to the DBM that allows us to model a possible role of acetylcholine in CBS as mediating the balance of feed-forward and feed-back processing. Our model might provide new insights into CBS and also demonstrates that generative frameworks are promising as hypothetical models of cortical learning and perception. 1</p><p>5 0.66703403 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Phone_Recognition_with_the_Mean-Covariance_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">206 nips-2010-Phone Recognition with the Mean-Covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: George Dahl, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Straightforward application of Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) to acoustic modeling produces a rich distributed representation of speech data that is useful for recognition and yields impressive results on the speaker-independent TIMIT phone recognition task. However, the ﬁrst-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonalcovariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), ﬁrst introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efﬁcient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every conﬁguration of the precision units of the mcRBM speciﬁes a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date. 1</p><p>6 0.6040929 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Layered_image_motion_with_explicit_occlusions%2C_temporal_consistency%2C_and_depth_ordering.html">141 nips-2010-Layered image motion with explicit occlusions, temporal consistency, and depth ordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Ken Takiyama, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: 019 020 We propose an algorithm for simultaneously estimating state transitions among neural states, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates using a switching state space model (SSSM). This algorithm enables us to detect state transitions on the basis of not only the discontinuous changes of mean ﬁring rates but also discontinuous changes in temporal proﬁles of ﬁring rates, e.g., temporal correlation. We construct a variational Bayes algorithm for a non-Gaussian SSSM whose non-Gaussian property is caused by binary spike events. Synthetic data analysis reveals that our algorithm has the high performance for estimating state transitions, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates compared to previous methods. We also analyze neural data that were recorded from the medial temporal area. The statistically detected neural states probably coincide with transient and sustained states that have been detected heuristically. Estimated parameters suggest that our algorithm detects the state transition on the basis of discontinuous changes in the temporal correlation of ﬁring rates, which transitions previous methods cannot detect. This result suggests that our algorithm is advantageous in real-data analysis. 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053</p><p>3 0.81888199 <a title="140-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Guaranteed_Rank_Minimization_via_Singular_Value_Projection.html">110 nips-2010-Guaranteed Rank Minimization via Singular Value Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Raghu Meka, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under afﬁne constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for afﬁne constraints that satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of lowrank matrix completion, for which the deﬁning afﬁne constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of [5, 18, 14], for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is signiﬁcantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem. 1</p><p>4 0.81776816 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Towards_Holistic_Scene_Understanding%3A_Feedback_Enabled_Cascaded_Classification_Models.html">272 nips-2010-Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many machine learning domains (such as scene understanding), several related sub-tasks (such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection) operate on the same raw data and provide correlated outputs. Each of these tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classiﬁers already exist for many subtasks. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classiﬁer. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (FE-CCM), that maximizes the joint likelihood of the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classiﬁer for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classiﬁers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the ﬁrst layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classiﬁers to provide earlier classiﬁers information about what error modes to focus on. We show that our method signiﬁcantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in two different domains: (i) scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection, and (ii) robotic grasping, where we consider grasp point detection and object classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.81765258 <a title="140-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition.html">143 nips-2010-Learning Convolutional Feature Hierarchies for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pierre Sermanet, Y-lan Boureau, Karol Gregor, Michael Mathieu, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for learning multi-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting ﬁlters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efﬁciency of the overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efﬁcient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasisparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse ﬁlters, including center-surround ﬁlters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these ﬁlters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.81649578 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>

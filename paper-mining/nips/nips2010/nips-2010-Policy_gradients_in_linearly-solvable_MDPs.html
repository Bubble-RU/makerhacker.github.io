<p>Author: Alex Strehl, John Langford, Lihong Li, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a sound and consistent foundation for the use of nonrandom exploration data in “contextual bandit” or “partially labeled” settings where only the value of a chosen action is learned. The primary challenge in a variety of settings is that the exploration policy, in which “ofﬂine” data is logged, is not explicitly known. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during the learning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in a repeated manner. The techniques reported here lift these restrictions, allowing the learning of a policy for choosing actions given features from historical data where no randomization occurred or was logged. We empirically verify our solution on two reasonably sized sets of real-world data obtained from Yahoo!.</p><p>3 0.51402813 <a title="208-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-On_a_Connection_between_Importance_Sampling_and_the_Likelihood_Ratio_Policy_Gradient.html">189 nips-2010-On a Connection between Importance Sampling and the Likelihood Ratio Policy Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Tang Jie, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: Likelihood ratio policy gradient methods have been some of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for learning on physical systems. We describe how the likelihood ratio policy gradient can be derived from an importance sampling perspective. This derivation highlights how likelihood ratio methods under-use past experience by (i) using the past experience to estimate only the gradient of the expected return U (θ) at the current policy parameterization θ, rather than to obtain a more complete estimate of U (θ), and (ii) using past experience under the current policy only rather than using all past experience to improve the estimates. We present a new policy search method, which leverages both of these observations as well as generalized baselines—a new technique which generalizes commonly used baseline techniques for policy gradient methods. Our algorithm outperforms standard likelihood ratio policy gradient algorithms on several testbeds. 1</p><p>4 0.44323957 <a title="208-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, David Wingate, Nicholas Roy, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning in partially observable domains where the agent can query an expert for demonstrations. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach combines model knowledge, inferred from expert information and independent exploration, with policy knowledge inferred from expert trajectories. We introduce priors that bias the agent towards models with both simple representations and simple policies, resulting in improved policy and model learning. 1</p><p>6 0.37962747 <a title="208-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Error_Propagation_for_Approximate_Policy_and_Value_Iteration.html">78 nips-2010-Error Propagation for Approximate Policy and Value Iteration</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey Johns, Christopher Painter-wakefield, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has emphasized the power of L1 regularization to perform feature selection and prevent overﬁtting. We propose formulating the L1 regularized linear ﬁxed point problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This formulation offers several advantages over the LARS-inspired formulation, LARS-TD. The LCP formulation allows the use of efﬁcient off-theshelf solvers, leads to a new uniqueness result, and can be initialized with starting points from similar problems (warm starts). We demonstrate that warm starts, as well as the efﬁciency of LCP solvers, can speed up policy iteration. Moreover, warm starts permit a form of modiﬁed policy iteration that can be used to approximate a “greedy” homotopy path, a generalization of the LARS-TD homotopy path that combines policy evaluation and optimization. 1</p><p>4 0.8894695 <a title="208-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: David Grangier, Iain Melvin</p><p>Abstract: We present a new learning strategy for classiﬁcation problems in which train and/or test data suffer from missing features. In previous work, instances are represented as vectors from some feature space and one is forced to impute missing values or to consider an instance-speciﬁc subspace. In contrast, our method considers instances as sets of (feature,value) pairs which naturally handle the missing value case. Building onto this framework, we propose a classiﬁcation strategy for sets. Our proposal maps (feature,value) pairs into an embedding space and then nonlinearly combines the set of embedded vectors. The embedding and the combination parameters are learned jointly on the ﬁnal classiﬁcation objective. This simple strategy allows great ﬂexibility in encoding prior knowledge about the features in the embedding step and yields advantageous results compared to alternative solutions over several datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.98246741 <a title="208-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Active_Instance_Sampling_via_Matrix_Partition.html">23 nips-2010-Active Instance Sampling via Matrix Partition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, batch-mode active learning has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning approach that selects a batch of queries in each iteration by maximizing a natural mutual information criterion between the labeled and unlabeled instances. By employing a Gaussian process framework, this mutual information based instance selection problem can be formulated as a matrix partition problem. Although matrix partition is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we show that a good local solution can be obtained by exploiting an effective local optimization technique on a relaxed continuous optimization problem. The proposed active learning approach is independent of employed classiﬁcation models. Our empirical studies show this approach can achieve comparable or superior performance to discriminative batch-mode active learning methods. 1</p><p>3 0.98104966 <a title="208-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.96722102 <a title="208-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>

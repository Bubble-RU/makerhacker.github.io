<p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, Francois Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: The standard strategy for efﬁcient object detection consists of building a cascade composed of several binary classiﬁers. The detection process takes the form of a lazy evaluation of the conjunction of the responses of these classiﬁers, and concentrates the computation on difﬁcult parts of the image which cannot be trivially rejected. We introduce a novel algorithm to construct jointly the classiﬁers of such a cascade, which interprets the response of a classiﬁer as the probability of a positive prediction, and the overall response of the cascade as the probability that all the predictions are positive. From this noisy-AND model, we derive a consistent loss and a Boosting procedure to optimize that global probability on the training set. Such a joint learning allows the individual predictors to focus on a more restricted modeling problem, and improves the performance compared to a standard cascade. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of this approach on face and pedestrian detection with standard data-sets and comparisons with reference baselines. 1</p><p>3 0.13826545 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Sidestepping_Intractable_Inference_with_Structured_Ensemble_Cascades.html">239 nips-2010-Sidestepping Intractable Inference with Structured Ensemble Cascades</a></p>
<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: For many structured prediction problems, complex models often require adopting approximate inference techniques such as variational methods or sampling, which generally provide no satisfactory accuracy guarantees. In this work, we propose sidestepping intractable inference altogether by learning ensembles of tractable sub-models as part of a structured prediction cascade. We focus in particular on problems with high-treewidth and large state-spaces, which occur in many computer vision tasks. Unlike other variational methods, our ensembles do not enforce agreement between sub-models, but ﬁlter the space of possible outputs by simply adding and thresholding the max-marginals of each constituent model. Our framework jointly estimates parameters for all models in the ensemble for each level of the cascade by minimizing a novel, convex loss function, yet requires only a linear increase in computation over learning or inference in a single tractable sub-model. We provide a generalization bound on the ﬁltering loss of the ensemble as a theoretical justiﬁcation of our approach, and we evaluate our method on both synthetic data and the task of estimating articulated human pose from challenging videos. We ﬁnd that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms loopy belief propagation on the synthetic data and a state-of-the-art model on the pose estimation/tracking problem. 1</p><p>4 0.12083139 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Boosting_Classifier_Cascades.html">42 nips-2010-Boosting Classifier Cascades</a></p>
<p>Author: Nuno Vasconcelos, Mohammad J. Saberian</p><p>Abstract: The problem of optimal and automatic design of a detector cascade is considered. A novel mathematical model is introduced for a cascaded detector. This model is analytically tractable, leads to recursive computation, and accounts for both classiﬁcation and complexity. A boosting algorithm, FCBoost, is proposed for fully automated cascade design. It exploits the new cascade model, minimizes a Lagrangian cost that accounts for both classiﬁcation risk and complexity. It searches the space of cascade conﬁgurations to automatically determine the optimal number of stages and their predictors, and is compatible with bootstrapping of negative examples and cost sensitive learning. Experiments show that the resulting cascades have state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision problems. 1</p><p>5 0.10714275 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Cross_Species_Expression_Analysis_using_a_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Model_with_Latent_Matchings.html">55 nips-2010-Cross Species Expression Analysis using a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model with Latent Matchings</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziv Bar-joseph, Hai-son P. Le</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies compare gene expression data across species to identify core and species speciﬁc genes in biological systems. To perform such comparisons researchers need to match genes across species. This is a challenging task since the correct matches (orthologs) are not known for most genes. Previous work in this area used deterministic matchings or reduced multidimensional expression data to binary representation. Here we develop a new method that can utilize soft matches (given as priors) to infer both, unique and similar expression patterns across species and a matching for the genes in both species. Our method uses a Dirichlet process mixture model which includes a latent data matching variable. We present learning and inference algorithms based on variational methods for this model. Applying our method to immune response data we show that it can accurately identify common and unique response patterns by improving the matchings between human and mouse genes. 1</p><p>6 0.10293916 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_graph-structured_activation_patterns_in_networks.html">117 nips-2010-Identifying graph-structured activation patterns in networks</a></p>

<p>Author: James Sharpnack, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying an activation pattern in a complex, largescale network that is embedded in very noisy measurements. This problem is relevant to several applications, such as identifying traces of a biochemical spread by a sensor network, expression levels of genes, and anomalous activity or congestion in the Internet. Extracting such patterns is a challenging task specially if the network is large (pattern is very high-dimensional) and the noise is so excessive that it masks the activity at any single node. However, typically there are statistical dependencies in the network activation process that can be leveraged to fuse the measurements of multiple nodes and enable reliable extraction of highdimensional noisy patterns. In this paper, we analyze an estimator based on the graph Laplacian eigenbasis, and establish the limits of mean square error recovery of noisy patterns arising from a probabilistic (Gaussian or Ising) model based on an arbitrary graph structure. We consider both deterministic and probabilistic network evolution models, and our results indicate that by leveraging the network interaction structure, it is possible to consistently recover high-dimensional patterns even when the noise variance increases with network size. 1</p><p>6 0.48102248 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exact_learning_curves_for_Gaussian_process_regression_on_large_random_graphs.html">85 nips-2010-Exact learning curves for Gaussian process regression on large random graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Lowd, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Arithmetic circuits (ACs) exploit context-speciﬁc independence and determinism to allow exact inference even in networks with high treewidth. In this paper, we introduce the ﬁrst ever approximate inference methods using ACs, for domains where exact inference remains intractable. We propose and evaluate a variety of techniques based on exact compilation, forward sampling, AC structure learning, Markov network parameter learning, variational inference, and Gibbs sampling. In experiments on eight challenging real-world domains, we ﬁnd that the methods based on sampling and learning work best: one such method (AC2 -F) is faster and usually more accurate than loopy belief propagation, mean ﬁeld, and Gibbs sampling; another (AC2 -G) has a running time similar to Gibbs sampling but is consistently more accurate than all baselines. 1</p><p>3 0.63455826 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-An_Approximate_Inference_Approach_to_Temporal_Optimization_in_Optimal_Control.html">29 nips-2010-An Approximate Inference Approach to Temporal Optimization in Optimal Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad Rawlik, Marc Toussaint, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on iterative local approximations present a practical approach to optimal control in robotic systems. However, they generally require the temporal parameters (for e.g. the movement duration or the time point of reaching an intermediate goal) to be speciﬁed a priori. Here, we present a methodology that is capable of jointly optimizing the temporal parameters in addition to the control command proﬁles. The presented approach is based on a Bayesian canonical time formulation of the optimal control problem, with the temporal mapping from canonical to real time parametrised by an additional control variable. An approximate EM algorithm is derived that efﬁciently optimizes both the movement duration and control commands offering, for the ﬁrst time, a practical approach to tackling generic via point problems in a systematic way under the optimal control framework. The proposed approach, which is applicable to plants with non-linear dynamics as well as arbitrary state dependent and quadratic control costs, is evaluated on realistic simulations of a redundant robotic plant.</p><p>4 0.62472928 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-MAP_Estimation_for_Graphical_Models_by_Likelihood_Maximization.html">164 nips-2010-MAP Estimation for Graphical Models by Likelihood Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Akshat Kumar, Shlomo Zilberstein</p><p>Abstract: Computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment in graphical models is a crucial inference problem for many practical applications. Several provably convergent approaches have been successfully developed using linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MAP problem. We present an alternative approach, which transforms the MAP problem into that of inference in a mixture of simple Bayes nets. We then derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for this mixture that also monotonically increases a lower bound on the MAP assignment until convergence. The update equations for the EM algorithm are remarkably simple, both conceptually and computationally, and can be implemented using a graph-based message passing paradigm similar to max-product computation. Experiments on the real-world protein design dataset show that EM’s convergence rate is signiﬁcantly higher than the previous LP relaxation based approach MPLP. EM also achieves a solution quality within 95% of optimal for most instances. 1</p><p>5 0.62441027 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Random_Projections_for_%24k%24-means_Clustering.html">221 nips-2010-Random Projections for $k$-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Boutsidis, Anastasios Zouzias, Petros Drineas</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses the topic of dimensionality reduction for k-means clustering. We prove that any set of n points in d dimensions (rows in a matrix A ∈ Rn×d ) can be projected into t = Ω(k/ε2 ) dimensions, for any ε ∈ (0, 1/3), in O(nd⌈ε−2 k/ log(d)⌉) time, such that with constant probability the optimal k-partition of the point set is preserved within a factor of 2 + √ The projection is done ε. √ by post-multiplying A with a d × t random matrix R having entries +1/ t or −1/ t with equal probability. A numerical implementation of our technique and experiments on a large face images dataset verify the speed and the accuracy of our theoretical results.</p><p>6 0.59154087 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>

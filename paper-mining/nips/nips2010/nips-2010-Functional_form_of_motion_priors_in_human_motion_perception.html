<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>3 0.29098573 <a title="98-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Random_Projections_for_%24k%24-means_Clustering.html">221 nips-2010-Random Projections for $k$-means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Boutsidis, Anastasios Zouzias, Petros Drineas</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses the topic of dimensionality reduction for k-means clustering. We prove that any set of n points in d dimensions (rows in a matrix A ∈ Rn×d ) can be projected into t = Ω(k/ε2 ) dimensions, for any ε ∈ (0, 1/3), in O(nd⌈ε−2 k/ log(d)⌉) time, such that with constant probability the optimal k-partition of the point set is preserved within a factor of 2 + √ The projection is done ε. √ by post-multiplying A with a d × t random matrix R having entries +1/ t or −1/ t with equal probability. A numerical implementation of our technique and experiments on a large face images dataset verify the speed and the accuracy of our theoretical results.</p><p>4 0.15525062 <a title="98-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Error_Propagation_for_Approximate_Policy_and_Value_Iteration.html">78 nips-2010-Error Propagation for Approximate Policy and Value Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand, Csaba Szepesvári, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We address the question of how the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration of the Approximate Policy/Value Iteration algorithms inﬂuences the quality of the resulted policy. We quantify the performance loss as the Lp norm of the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum – as opposed to what has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the earlier iterations decays exponentially fast. 1</p><p>5 0.1465515 <a title="98-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Structured_Determinantal_Point_Processes.html">257 nips-2010-Structured Determinantal Point Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Kulesza, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic model for distributions over sets of structures— for example, sets of sequences, trees, or graphs. The critical characteristic of our model is a preference for diversity: sets containing dissimilar structures are more likely. Our model is a marriage of structured probabilistic models, like Markov random ﬁelds and context free grammars, with determinantal point processes, which arise in quantum physics as models of particles with repulsive interactions. We extend the determinantal point process model to handle an exponentially-sized set of particles (structures) via a natural factorization of the model into parts. We show how this factorization leads to tractable algorithms for exact inference, including computing marginals, computing conditional probabilities, and sampling. Our algorithms exploit a novel polynomially-sized dual representation of determinantal point processes, and use message passing over a special semiring to compute relevant quantities. We illustrate the advantages of the model on tracking and articulated pose estimation problems. 1</p><p>6 0.13991997 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Jones, Venkatesh Saligrama, Sanjoy Mitter</p><p>Abstract: Experts (human or computer) are often required to assess the probability of uncertain events. When a collection of experts independently assess events that are structurally interrelated, the resulting assessment may violate fundamental laws of probability. Such an assessment is termed incoherent. In this work we investigate how the problem of incoherence may be affected by allowing experts to specify likelihood models and then update their assessments based on the realization of a globally-observable random sequence.

Our results showed excellent agreement between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to 8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.</p><p>2 0.79450738 <a title="98-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Inferring_Stimulus_Selectivity_from_the_Spatial_Structure_of_Neural_Network_Dynamics.html">127 nips-2010-Inferring Stimulus Selectivity from the Spatial Structure of Neural Network Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Kanaka Rajan, L Abbott, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: How are the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked population responses related? We study the impact of connectivity on the spatial pattern of ﬂuctuations in the input-generated response, by comparing the distribution of evoked and intrinsically generated activity across the different units of a neural network. We develop a complementary approach to principal component analysis in which separate high-variance directions are derived for each input condition. We analyze subspace angles to compute the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, and the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces that driven trajectories occupy within the full space of neuronal activity. In addition to revealing how the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous activity affects input-evoked responses, these methods can be used to infer input selectivity induced by network dynamics from experimentally accessible measures of spontaneous activity (e.g. from voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical imaging experiments). We conclude that the absence of a detailed spatial map of afferent inputs and cortical connectivity does not limit our ability to design spatially extended stimuli that evoke strong responses. 1 1 Motivation Stimulus selectivity in neural networks was historically measured directly from input-driven responses [1], and only later were similar selectivity patterns observed in spontaneous activity across the cortical surface [2, 3]. We argue that it is possible to work in the reverse order, and show that analyzing the distribution of spontaneous activity across the different units in the network can inform us about the selectivity of evoked responses to stimulus features, even when no apparent sensory map exists. Sensory-evoked responses are typically divided into a signal component generated by the stimulus and a noise component corresponding to ongoing activity that is not directly related to the stimulus. Subsequent effort focuses on understanding how the signal depends on properties of the stimulus, while the remaining, irregular part of the response is treated as additive noise. The distinction between external stochastic processes and the noise generated deterministically as a function of intrinsic recurrence has been previously studied in chaotic neural networks [4]. It has also been suggested that internally generated noise is not additive and can be more sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the input, compared to the signal component of the response [5 - 8]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between deterministic intrinsic noise and the spatial properties of the external stimulus is also complex and nonlinear. We study the impact of network connectivity on the spatial pattern of input-driven responses by comparing the structure of evoked and spontaneous activity, and show how the unique signature of these dynamics determines the selectivity of networks to spatial features of the stimuli driving them. 2 Model description In this section, we describe the network model and the methods we use to analyze its dynamics. Subsequent sections explore how the spatial patterns of spontaneous and evoked responses are related in terms of the distribution of the activity across the network. Finally, we show how the stimulus selectivity of the network can be inferred from its spontaneous activity patterns. 2.1 Network elements We build a ﬁring rate model of N interconnected units characterized by a statistical description of the underlying circuitry (as N → ∞, the system “self averages” making the description independent of a speciﬁc network architecture, see also [11, 12]). Each unit is characterized by an activation variable xi ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N , and a nonlinear response function ri which relates to xi through ri = R0 + φ(xi ) where,   R0 tanh x for x ≤ 0 R0 φ(x) = (1) x  (Rmax − R0 ) tanh otherwise. Rmax −R0 Eq. 1 allows us to independently set the maximum ﬁring rate Rmax and the background rate R0 to biologically reasonable values, while retaining a maximum gradient at x = 0 to guarantee the smoothness of the transition to chaos [4]. We introduce a recurrent weight matrix with element Jij equivalent to the strength of the synapse from unit j → unit i. The individual weights are chosen independently and randomly from a Gaus2 sian distribution with mean and variance given by [Jij ]J = 0 and Jij J = g 2 /N , where square brackets are ensemble averages [9 - 11,13]. The control parameter g which scales as the variance of the synaptic weights, is particularly important in determining whether or not the network produces spontaneous activity with non-trivial dynamics (Speciﬁcally, g = 0 corresponds to a completely uncoupled network and a network with g = 1 generates non-trivial spontaneous activity [4, 9, 10]). The activation variable for each unit xi is therefore determined by the relation, N τr dxi = −xi + g Jij rj + Ii , dt j=1 with the time scale of the network set by the single-neuron time constant τr of 10 ms. 2 (2) The amplitude I of an oscillatory external input of frequency f , is always the same for each unit, but in some examples shown in this paper, we introduce a neuron-speciﬁc phase factor θi , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2π, such that Ii = I cos(2πf t + θi ) ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . N. (3) In visually responsive neurons, this mimics a population of simple cells driven by a drifting grating of temporal frequency f , with the different phases arising from offsets in spatial receptive ﬁeld locations. The randomly assigned phases in our model ensure that the spatial pattern of input is not correlated with the pattern of recurrent connectivity. In our selectivity analysis however (Fig. 3), we replace the random phases with spatial input patterns that are aligned with network connectivity. 2.2 PCA redux Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied proﬁtably to neuronal recordings (see for example [14]) but these analyses often plot activity trajectories corresponding to different network states using the ﬁxed principal component coordinates derived from combined activities under all stimulus conditions. Our analysis offers a complementary approach whereby separate principal components are derived for each stimulus condition, and the resulting principal angles reveal not only the difference between the shapes of trajectories corresponding to different network states, but also the orientation of the low-dimensional subspaces these trajectories occupy within the full N -dimensional space of neuronal activity. The instantaneous network state can be described by a point in an N -dimensional space with coordinates equal to the ﬁring rates of the N units. Over time, the network activity traverses a trajectory in this N -dimensional space and PCA can be used to delineate the subspace in which this trajectory lies. The analysis is done by diagonalizing the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of network ﬁring rates given by, Dij = (ri (t) − ri )(rj (t) − rj ) , (4) where</p><p>3 0.7445147 <a title="98-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-A_unified_model_of_short-range_and_long-range_motion_perception.html">20 nips-2010-A unified model of short-range and long-range motion perception</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Xuming He, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The human vision system is able to effortlessly perceive both short-range and long-range motion patterns in complex dynamic scenes. Previous work has assumed that two different mechanisms are involved in processing these two types of motion. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model as a uniﬁed framework for modeling both short-range and long-range motion perception. Our model consists of two key components: a data likelihood that proposes multiple motion hypotheses using nonlinear matching, and a hierarchical prior that imposes slowness and spatial smoothness constraints on the motion ﬁeld at multiple scales. We tested our model on two types of stimuli, random dot kinematograms and multiple-aperture stimuli, both commonly used in human vision research. We demonstrate that the hierarchical model adequately accounts for human performance in psychophysical experiments.</p><p>4 0.72980505 <a title="98-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Size_Matters%3A_Metric_Visual_Search_Constraints_from_Monocular_Metadata.html">241 nips-2010-Size Matters: Metric Visual Search Constraints from Monocular Metadata</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Metric constraints are known to be highly discriminative for many objects, but if training is limited to data captured from a particular 3-D sensor the quantity of training data may be severly limited. In this paper, we show how a crucial aspect of 3-D information–object and feature absolute size–can be added to models learned from commonly available online imagery, without use of any 3-D sensing or reconstruction at training time. Such models can be utilized at test time together with explicit 3-D sensing to perform robust search. Our model uses a “2.1D” local feature, which combines traditional appearance gradient statistics with an estimate of average absolute depth within the local window. We show how category size information can be obtained from online images by exploiting relatively unbiquitous metadata ﬁelds specifying camera intrinstics. We develop an efﬁcient metric branch-and-bound algorithm for our search task, imposing 3-D size constraints as part of an optimal search for a set of features which indicate the presence of a category. Experiments on test scenes captured with a traditional stereo rig are shown, exploiting training data from from purely monocular sources with associated EXIF metadata. 1</p><p>5 0.68307233 <a title="98-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Implicit_encoding_of_prior_probabilities_in_optimal_neural_populations.html">119 nips-2010-Implicit encoding of prior probabilities in optimal neural populations</a></p>

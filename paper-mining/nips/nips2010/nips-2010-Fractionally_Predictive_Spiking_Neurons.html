<p>Author: Nicholas Fisher, Arunava Banerjee</p><p>Abstract: From a functional viewpoint, a spiking neuron is a device that transforms input spike trains on its various synapses into an output spike train on its axon. We demonstrate in this paper that the function mapping underlying the device can be tractably learned based on input and output spike train data alone. We begin by posing the problem in a classiﬁcation based framework. We then derive a novel kernel for an SRM0 model that is based on PSP and AHP like functions. With the kernel we demonstrate how the learning problem can be posed as a Quadratic Program. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our approach. 1</p><p>3 0.3853178 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Rescaling%2C_thinning_or_complementing%3F_On_goodness-of-fit_procedures_for_point_process_models_and_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">227 nips-2010-Rescaling, thinning or complementing? On goodness-of-fit procedures for point process models and Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Gerhard, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an increasingly popular framework for modeling neural spike trains. They have been linked to the theory of stochastic point processes and researchers have used this relation to assess goodness-of-ﬁt using methods from point-process theory, e.g. the time-rescaling theorem. However, high neural ﬁring rates or coarse discretization lead to a breakdown of the assumptions necessary for this connection. Here, we show how goodness-of-ﬁt tests from point-process theory can still be applied to GLMs by constructing equivalent surrogate point processes out of time-series observations. Furthermore, two additional tests based on thinning and complementing point processes are introduced. They augment the instruments available for checking model adequacy of point processes as well as discretized models. 1</p><p>4 0.33027771 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-SpikeAnts%2C_a_spiking_neuron_network_modelling_the_emergence_of_organization_in_a_complex_system.html">252 nips-2010-SpikeAnts, a spiking neuron network modelling the emergence of organization in a complex system</a></p>
<p>Author: Sylvain Chevallier, Hél\`ene Paugam-moisy, Michele Sebag</p><p>Abstract: Many complex systems, ranging from neural cell assemblies to insect societies, involve and rely on some division of labor. How to enforce such a division in a decentralized and distributed way, is tackled in this paper, using a spiking neuron network architecture. Speciﬁcally, a spatio-temporal model called SpikeAnts is shown to enforce the emergence of synchronized activities in an ant colony. Each ant is modelled from two spiking neurons; the ant colony is a sparsely connected spiking neuron network. Each ant makes its decision (among foraging, sleeping and self-grooming) from the competition between its two neurons, after the signals received from its neighbor ants. Interestingly, three types of temporal patterns emerge in the ant colony: asynchronous, synchronous, and synchronous periodic foraging activities − similar to the actual behavior of some living ant colonies. A phase diagram of the emergent activity patterns with respect to two control parameters, respectively accounting for ant sociability and receptivity, is presented and discussed. 1</p><p>5 0.32617348 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_Dendritic_Processing.html">115 nips-2010-Identifying Dendritic Processing</a></p>

The input to the circuit is an analog signal that belongs to the space of bandlimited functions. The output is a time sequence associated with the spike train.

<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>4 0.90627432 <a title="96-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Identifying_Dendritic_Processing.html">115 nips-2010-Identifying Dendritic Processing</a></p>

The impulse responses are modeled as Gaussian processes whose autocovariances encode the BIBO stability constraint, as deﬁned by the recently introduced “Stable Spline kernel”. Sparse solutions are obtained by placing exponential hyperpriors on the scale factors of such kernels. Numerical experiments regarding estimation of ARMAX models show that this technique provides a deﬁnite advantage over a group LAR algorithm and state-of-the-art parametric identiﬁcation techniques based on prediction error minimization. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88040364 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Fractionally_Predictive_Spiking_Neurons.html">96 nips-2010-Fractionally Predictive Spiking Neurons</a></p>

As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spiketrains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal ﬁltering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel. 1</p><p>3 0.84806955 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Predicting_Execution_Time_of_Computer_Programs_Using_Sparse_Polynomial_Regression.html">211 nips-2010-Predicting Execution Time of Computer Programs Using Sparse Polynomial Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Huang, Jinzhu Jia, Bin Yu, Byung-gon Chun, Petros Maniatis, Mayur Naik</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the execution time of computer programs is an important but challenging problem in the community of computer systems. Existing methods require experts to perform detailed analysis of program code in order to construct predictors or select important features. We recently developed a new system to automatically extract a large number of features from program execution on sample inputs, on which prediction models can be constructed without expert knowledge. In this paper we study the construction of predictive models for this problem. We propose the SPORE (Sparse POlynomial REgression) methodology to build accurate prediction models of program performance using feature data collected from program execution on sample inputs. Our two SPORE algorithms are able to build relationships between responses (e.g., the execution time of a computer program) and features, and select a few from hundreds of the retrieved features to construct an explicitly sparse and non-linear model to predict the response variable. The compact and explicitly polynomial form of the estimated model could reveal important insights into the computer program (e.g., features and their non-linear combinations that dominate the execution time), enabling a better understanding of the program’s behavior. Our evaluation on three widely used computer programs shows that SPORE methods can give accurate prediction with relative error less than 7% by using a moderate number of training data samples. In addition, we compare SPORE algorithms to state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms, and show that SPORE methods, motivated by real applications, outperform the other methods in terms of both interpretability and prediction accuracy.</p><p>4 0.84762394 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Segmentation_as_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set.html">234 nips-2010-Segmentation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set</a></p>
<p>Author: William Brendel, Sinisa Todorovic</p><p>Abstract: Given an ensemble of distinct, low-level segmentations of an image, our goal is to identify visually “meaningful” segments in the ensemble. Knowledge about any speciﬁc objects and surfaces present in the image is not available. The selection of image regions occupied by objects is formalized as the maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem. MWIS is the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent nodes of an attributed graph. We construct such a graph from all segments in the ensemble. Then, MWIS selects maximally distinctive segments that together partition the image. A new MWIS algorithm is presented. The algorithm seeks a solution directly in the discrete domain, instead of relaxing MWIS to a continuous problem, as common in previous work. It iteratively ﬁnds a candidate discrete solution of the Taylor series expansion of the original MWIS objective function around the previous solution. The algorithm is shown to converge to an optimum. Our empirical evaluation on the benchmark Berkeley segmentation dataset shows that the new algorithm eliminates the need for hand-picking optimal input parameters of the state-of-the-art segmenters, and outperforms their best, manually optimized results.</p><p>5 0.84584582 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>6 0.84271955 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>

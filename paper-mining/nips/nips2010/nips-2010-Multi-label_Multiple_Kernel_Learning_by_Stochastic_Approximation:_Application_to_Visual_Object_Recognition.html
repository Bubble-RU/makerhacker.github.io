<p>Author: Zhaonan Sun, Nawanol Ampornpunt, Manik Varma, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: Our objective is to train p-norm Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and, more generally, linear MKL regularised by the Bregman divergence, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. The SMO algorithm is simple, easy to implement and adapt, and efﬁciently scales to large problems. As a result, it has gained widespread acceptance and SVMs are routinely trained using SMO in diverse real world applications. Training using SMO has been a long standing goal in MKL for the very same reasons. Unfortunately, the standard MKL dual is not differentiable, and therefore can not be optimised using SMO style co-ordinate ascent. In this paper, we demonstrate that linear MKL regularised with the p-norm squared, or with certain Bregman divergences, can indeed be trained using SMO. The resulting algorithm retains both simplicity and efﬁciency and is signiﬁcantly faster than state-of-the-art specialised p-norm MKL solvers. We show that we can train on a hundred thousand kernels in approximately seven minutes and on ﬁfty thousand points in less than half an hour on a single core. 1</p><p>3 0.4407033 <a title="174-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Kernels_with_Radiuses_of_Minimum_Enclosing_Balls.html">145 nips-2010-Learning Kernels with Radiuses of Minimum Enclosing Balls</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Gai, Guangyun Chen, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we point out that there exist scaling and initialization problems in most existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) approaches, which employ the large margin principle to jointly learn both a kernel and an SVM classiﬁer. The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (e.g., L1 or L2 ) of norm constraints on combination coefﬁcients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms both SVM with the uniform combination of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.25102812 <a title="174-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: The design of low-level image features is critical for computer vision algorithms. Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT [16] and HOG [3], are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a uniﬁed and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) [23]. Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classiﬁcation benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet.</p><p>5 0.21928807 <a title="174-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_algorithms_for_learning_kernels_from_multiple_similarity_matrices_with_general_convex_loss_functions.html">72 nips-2010-Efficient algorithms for learning kernels from multiple similarity matrices with general convex loss functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Achintya Kundu, Vikram Tankasali, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Aharon Ben-tal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning an n × n kernel matrix from m(≥ 1) similarity matrices under general convex loss. Past research have extensively studied the m = 1 case and have derived several algorithms which require sophisticated techniques like ACCP, SOCP, etc. The existing algorithms do not apply if one uses arbitrary losses and often can not handle m > 1 case. We present several provably convergent iterative algorithms, where each iteration requires either an SVM or a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) solver for m > 1 case. One of the major contributions of the paper is to extend the well known Mirror Descent(MD) framework to handle Cartesian product of psd matrices. This novel extension leads to an algorithm, called EMKL, which solves the problem in 2 O( m ǫlog n ) iterations; in each iteration one solves an MKL involving m kernels 2 and m eigen-decomposition of n × n matrices. By suitably deﬁning a restriction on the objective function, a faster version of EMKL is proposed, called REKL, which avoids the eigen-decomposition. An alternative to both EMKL and REKL is also suggested which requires only an SVM solver. Experimental results on real world protein data set involving several similarity matrices illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithms.</p><p>6 0.20100075 <a title="174-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of semi-supervised kernel function learning. We ﬁrst propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and then demonstrate an equivalence between our proposed kernel matrix learning framework and a general linear transformation learning problem. Our result shows that the learned kernel matrices parameterize a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points. Furthermore, our result gives a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. To make our results practical for large-scale data, we modify our framework to limit the number of parameters in the optimization process. We also consider the problem of kernelized inductive dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting. To this end, we introduce a novel method for this problem by considering a special case of our general kernel learning framework where we select the trace norm function as the regularizer. We empirically demonstrate that our framework learns useful kernel functions, improving the k-NN classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly in a variety of domains. Furthermore, our kernelized dimensionality reduction technique signiﬁcantly reduces the dimensionality of the feature space while achieving competitive classiﬁcation accuracies. 1</p><p>6 0.6721493 <a title="174-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition.html">133 nips-2010-Kernel Descriptors for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Serhat Bucak, Rong Jin, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that multiple kernel learning is very effective for object recognition, leading to the popularity of kernel learning in computer vision problems. In this work, we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for multi-label multiple kernel learning (ML-MKL). We assume that all the classes under consideration share the same combination of kernel functions, and the objective is to ﬁnd the optimal kernel combination that beneﬁts all the classes. Although several algorithms have been developed for ML-MKL, their computational cost is linear in the number of classes, making them unscalable when the number of classes is large, a challenge frequently encountered in visual object recognition. We address this computational challenge by developing a framework for ML-MKL that combines the worst-case analysis with stochastic approximation. Our analysis √ shows that the complexity of our algorithm is O(m1/3 lnm), where m is the number of classes. Empirical studies with object recognition show that while achieving similar classiﬁcation accuracy, the proposed method is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the state-of-the-art algorithms for ML-MKL. 1</p><p>2 0.70483357 <a title="174-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-A_novel_family_of_non-parametric_cumulative_based_divergences_for_point_processes.html">18 nips-2010-A novel family of non-parametric cumulative based divergences for point processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Sohan Seth, Park Il, Austin Brockmeier, Mulugeta Semework, John Choi, Joseph Francis, Jose Principe</p><p>Abstract: Hypothesis testing on point processes has several applications such as model ﬁtting, plasticity detection, and non-stationarity detection. Standard tools for hypothesis testing include tests on mean ﬁring rate and time varying rate function. However, these statistics do not fully describe a point process, and therefore, the conclusions drawn by these tests can be misleading. In this paper, we introduce a family of non-parametric divergence measures for hypothesis testing. A divergence measure compares the full probability structure and, therefore, leads to a more robust test of hypothesis. We extend the traditional Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Cram´ r–von-Mises tests to the space of spike trains via stratiﬁcation, and e show that these statistics can be consistently estimated from data without any free parameter. We demonstrate an application of the proposed divergences as a cost function to ﬁnd optimally matched point processes. 1</p><p>3 0.64162564 <a title="174-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: During the last years support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied in situations where the input space X is not necessarily a subset of Rd . Examples include SVMs for the analysis of histograms or colored images, SVMs for text classiÄ?Ĺš cation and web mining, and SVMs for applications from computational biology using, e.g., kernels for trees and graphs. Moreover, SVMs are known to be consistent to the Bayes risk, if either the input space is a complete separable metric space and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Lp (PX ) is dense, or if the SVM uses a universal kernel k. So far, however, there are no kernels of practical interest known that satisfy these assumptions, if X Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Rd . We close this gap by providing a general technique based on Taylor-type kernels to explicitly construct universal kernels on compact metric spaces which are not subset of Rd . We apply this technique for the following special cases: universal kernels on the set of probability measures, universal kernels based on Fourier transforms, and universal kernels for signal processing. 1</p><p>4 0.64109135 <a title="174-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Stability_Approach_to_Regularization_Selection_%28StARS%29_for_High_Dimensional_Graphical_Models.html">254 nips-2010-Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.</p><p>5 0.60435259 <a title="174-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Linear_Complementarity_for_Regularized_Policy_Evaluation_and_Improvement.html">160 nips-2010-Linear Complementarity for Regularized Policy Evaluation and Improvement</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey Johns, Christopher Painter-wakefield, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has emphasized the power of L1 regularization to perform feature selection and prevent overﬁtting. We propose formulating the L1 regularized linear ﬁxed point problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This formulation offers several advantages over the LARS-inspired formulation, LARS-TD. The LCP formulation allows the use of efﬁcient off-theshelf solvers, leads to a new uniqueness result, and can be initialized with starting points from similar problems (warm starts). We demonstrate that warm starts, as well as the efﬁciency of LCP solvers, can speed up policy iteration. Moreover, warm starts permit a form of modiﬁed policy iteration that can be used to approximate a “greedy” homotopy path, a generalization of the LARS-TD homotopy path that combines policy evaluation and optimization. 1</p><p>6 0.60339332 <a title="174-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Practical_Large-Scale_Optimization_for_Max-norm_Regularization.html">210 nips-2010-Practical Large-Scale Optimization for Max-norm Regularization</a></p>

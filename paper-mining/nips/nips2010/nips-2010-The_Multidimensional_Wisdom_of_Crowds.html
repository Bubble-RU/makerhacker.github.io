<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth regionto-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.</p><p>3 0.34983173 <a title="267-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Simultaneous_Object_Detection_and_Ranking_with_Weak_Supervision.html">240 nips-2010-Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: A standard approach to learning object category detectors is to provide strong supervision in the form of a region of interest (ROI) specifying each instance of the object in the training images [17]. In this work are goal is to learn from heterogeneous labels, in which some images are only weakly supervised, specifying only the presence or absence of the object or a weak indication of object location, whilst others are fully annotated. To this end we develop a discriminative learning approach and make two contributions: (i) we propose a structured output formulation for weakly annotated images where full annotations are treated as latent variables; and (ii) we propose to optimize a ranking objective function, allowing our method to more effectively use negatively labeled images to improve detection average precision performance. The method is demonstrated on the benchmark INRIA pedestrian detection dataset of Dalal and Triggs [14] and the PASCAL VOC dataset [17], and it is shown that for a signiﬁcant proportion of weakly supervised images the performance achieved is very similar to the fully supervised (state of the art) results. 1</p><p>4 0.22741637 <a title="267-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_To_Count_Objects_in_Images.html">149 nips-2010-Learning To Count Objects in Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new supervised learning framework for visual object counting tasks, such as estimating the number of cells in a microscopic image or the number of humans in surveillance video frames. We focus on the practically-attractive case when the training images are annotated with dots (one dot per object). Our goal is to accurately estimate the count. However, we evade the hard task of learning to detect and localize individual object instances. Instead, we cast the problem as that of estimating an image density whose integral over any image region gives the count of objects within that region. Learning to infer such density can be formulated as a minimization of a regularized risk quadratic cost function. We introduce a new loss function, which is well-suited for such learning, and at the same time can be computed efﬁciently via a maximum subarray algorithm. The learning can then be posed as a convex quadratic program solvable with cutting-plane optimization. The proposed framework is very ﬂexible as it can accept any domain-speciﬁc visual features. Once trained, our system provides accurate object counts and requires a very small time overhead over the feature extraction step, making it a good candidate for applications involving real-time processing or dealing with huge amount of visual data. 1</p><p>5 0.13446452 <a title="267-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Candidate_Labeling_Sets.html">151 nips-2010-Learning from Candidate Labeling Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Luo, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: In many real world applications we do not have access to fully-labeled training data, but only to a list of possible labels. This is the case, e.g., when learning visual classiﬁers from images downloaded from the web, using just their text captions or tags as learning oracles. In general, these problems can be very difﬁcult. However most of the time there exist different implicit sources of information, coming from the relations between instances and labels, which are usually dismissed. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised framework to model this kind of problems. Each training sample is a bag containing multi-instances, associated with a set of candidate labeling vectors. Each labeling vector encodes the possible labels for the instances in the bag, with only one being fully correct. The use of the labeling vectors provides a principled way not to exclude any information. We propose a large margin discriminative formulation, and an efﬁcient algorithm to solve it. Experiments conducted on artiﬁcial datasets and a real-world images and captions dataset show that our approach achieves performance comparable to an SVM trained with the ground-truth labels, and outperforms other baselines.</p><p>6 0.1332529 <a title="267-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Chen, Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Learning from multi-view data is important in many applications, such as image classiﬁcation and annotation. In this paper, we present a large-margin learning framework to discover a predictive latent subspace representation shared by multiple views. Our approach is based on an undirected latent space Markov network that fulﬁlls a weak conditional independence assumption that multi-view observations and response variables are independent given a set of latent variables. We provide efﬁcient inference and parameter estimation methods for the latent subspace model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of large-margin learning on real video and web image data for discovering predictive latent representations and improving the performance on image classiﬁcation, annotation and retrieval.</p><p>6 0.38190606 <a title="267-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Exploiting_weakly-labeled_Web_images_to_improve_object_classification%3A_a_domain_adaptation_approach.html">86 nips-2010-Exploiting weakly-labeled Web images to improve object classification: a domain adaptation approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of retrieving the database points nearest to a given hyperplane query without exhaustively scanning the database. We propose two hashingbased solutions. Our ﬁrst approach maps the data to two-bit binary keys that are locality-sensitive for the angle between the hyperplane normal and a database point. Our second approach embeds the data into a vector space where the Euclidean norm reﬂects the desired distance between the original points and hyperplane query. Both use hashing to retrieve near points in sub-linear time. Our ﬁrst method’s preprocessing stage is more efﬁcient, while the second has stronger accuracy guarantees. We apply both to pool-based active learning: taking the current hyperplane classiﬁer as a query, our algorithm identiﬁes those points (approximately) satisfying the well-known minimal distance-to-hyperplane selection criterion. We empirically demonstrate our methods’ tradeoffs, and show that they make it practical to perform active selection with millions of unlabeled points. 1</p><p>3 0.6376909 <a title="267-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-New_Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Online_Classification.html">182 nips-2010-New Adaptive Algorithms for Online Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Koby Crammer</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework to online learning for classiﬁcation problems with time-varying potential functions in the adversarial setting. This framework allows to design and prove relative mistake bounds for any generic loss function. The mistake bounds can be specialized for the hinge loss, allowing to recover and improve the bounds of known online classiﬁcation algorithms. By optimizing the general bound we derive a new online classiﬁcation algorithm, called NAROW, that hybridly uses adaptive- and ﬁxed- second order information. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance using synthetic dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.56069356 <a title="267-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>5 0.55931306 <a title="267-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Faustino J. Gomez</p><p>Abstract: We present a new way of converting a reversible ﬁnite Markov chain into a nonreversible one, with a theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result conﬁrms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC. 1</p><p>6 0.55825692 <a title="267-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Random_Conic_Pursuit_for_Semidefinite_Programming.html">219 nips-2010-Random Conic Pursuit for Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

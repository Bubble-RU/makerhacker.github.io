<p>Author: Gowtham Bellala, Suresh Bhavnani, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Binary Search (GBS) is a well known greedy algorithm for identifying an unknown object while minimizing the number of “yes” or “no” questions posed about that object, and arises in problems such as active learning and active diagnosis. Here, we provide a coding-theoretic interpretation for GBS and show that GBS can be viewed as a top-down algorithm that greedily minimizes the expected number of queries required to identify an object. This interpretation is then used to extend GBS in two ways. First, we consider the case where the objects are partitioned into groups, and the objective is to identify only the group to which the object belongs. Then, we consider the case where the cost of identifying an object grows exponentially in the number of queries. In each case, we present an exact formula for the objective function involving Shannon or R´ nyi entropy, and e develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing it. 1</p><p>3 0.20336215 <a title="180-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse methods for supervised learning aim at ﬁnding good linear predictors from as few variables as possible, i.e., with small cardinality of their supports. This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lov´ sz extension, a common tool in submodua lar analysis. This deﬁnes a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting speciﬁc submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also deﬁne new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.</p><p>4 0.13901442 <a title="180-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_from_Logged_Implicit_Exploration_Data.html">152 nips-2010-Learning from Logged Implicit Exploration Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Strehl, John Langford, Lihong Li, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We provide a sound and consistent foundation for the use of nonrandom exploration data in “contextual bandit” or “partially labeled” settings where only the value of a chosen action is learned. The primary challenge in a variety of settings is that the exploration policy, in which “ofﬂine” data is logged, is not explicitly known. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during the learning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in a repeated manner. The techniques reported here lift these restrictions, allowing the learning of a policy for choosing actions given features from historical data where no randomization occurred or was logged. We empirically verify our solution on two reasonably sized sets of real-world data obtained from Yahoo!.</p><p>5 0.12966305 <a title="180-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Supervised_Clustering.html">261 nips-2010-Supervised Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Pranjal Awasthi, Reza B. Zadeh</p><p>Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of clustering as a tool in unsupervised learning, there is not yet a consensus on a formal theory, and the vast majority of work in this direction has focused on unsupervised clustering. We study a recently proposed framework for supervised clustering where there is access to a teacher. We give an improved generic algorithm to cluster any concept class in that model. Our algorithm is query-efﬁcient in the sense that it involves only a small amount of interaction with the teacher. We also present and study two natural generalizations of the model. The model assumes that the teacher response to the algorithm is perfect. We eliminate this limitation by proposing a noisy model and give an algorithm for clustering the class of intervals in this noisy model. We also propose a dynamic model where the teacher sees a random subset of the points. Finally, for datasets satisfying a spectrum of weak to strong properties, we give query bounds, and show that a class of clustering functions containing Single-Linkage will ﬁnd the target clustering under the strongest property.</p><p>6 0.12800302 <a title="180-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-A_Computational_Decision_Theory_for_Interactive_Assistants.html">4 nips-2010-A Computational Decision Theory for Interactive Assistants</a></p>

<p>Author: Paolo Viappiani, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches to utility elicitation typically adopt (myopic) expected value of information (EVOI) as a natural criterion for selecting queries. However, EVOI-optimization is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we examine EVOI optimization using choice queries, queries in which a user is ask to select her most preferred product from a set. We show that, under very general assumptions, the optimal choice query w.r.t. EVOI coincides with the optimal recommendation set, that is, a set maximizing the expected utility of the user selection. Since recommendation set optimization is a simpler, submodular problem, this can greatly reduce the complexity of both exact and approximate (greedy) computation of optimal choice queries. We also examine the case where user responses to choice queries are error-prone (using both constant and mixed multinomial logit noise models) and provide worst-case guarantees. Finally we present a local search technique for query optimization that works extremely well with large outcome spaces.</p><p>4 0.38858056 <a title="180-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Minimization_of_Decomposable_Submodular_Functions.html">69 nips-2010-Efficient Minimization of Decomposable Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Stobbe, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many combinatorial problems arising in machine learning can be reduced to the problem of minimizing a submodular function. Submodular functions are a natural discrete analog of convex functions, and can be minimized in strongly polynomial time. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art algorithms for general submodular minimization are intractable for larger problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel subclass of submodular minimization problems that we call decomposable. Decomposable submodular functions are those that can be represented as sums of concave functions applied to modular functions. We develop an algorithm, SLG, that can efÄ?Ĺš ciently minimize decomposable submodular functions with tens of thousands of variables. Our algorithm exploits recent results in smoothed convex minimization. We apply SLG to synthetic benchmarks and a joint classiÄ?Ĺš cation-and-segmentation task, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art general purpose submodular minimization algorithms by several orders of magnitude. 1</p><p>5 0.38608554 <a title="180-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Effects_of_Synaptic_Weight_Diffusion_on_Learning_in_Decision_Making_Networks.html">68 nips-2010-Effects of Synaptic Weight Diffusion on Learning in Decision Making Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Kentaro Katahira, Kazuo Okanoya, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: When animals repeatedly choose actions from multiple alternatives, they can allocate their choices stochastically depending on past actions and outcomes. It is commonly assumed that this ability is achieved by modiﬁcations in synaptic weights related to decision making. Choice behavior has been empirically found to follow Herrnstein’s matching law. Loewenstein & Seung (2006) demonstrated that matching behavior is a steady state of learning in neural networks if the synaptic weights change proportionally to the covariance between reward and neural activities. However, their proof did not take into account the change in entire synaptic distributions. In this study, we show that matching behavior is not necessarily a steady state of the covariance-based learning rule when the synaptic strength is sufﬁciently strong so that the ﬂuctuations in input from individual sensory neurons inﬂuence the net input to output neurons. This is caused by the increasing variance in the input potential due to the diffusion of synaptic weights. This effect causes an undermatching phenomenon, which has been observed in many behavioral experiments. We suggest that the synaptic diffusion effects provide a robust neural mechanism for stochastic choice behavior.</p><p>6 0.37661359 <a title="180-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Structured_sparsity-inducing_norms_through_submodular_functions.html">258 nips-2010-Structured sparsity-inducing norms through submodular functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Anand Singh, Renaud Jolivet, Pierre Magistretti, Bruno Weber</p><p>Abstract: Sodium entry during an action potential determines the energy efﬁciency of a neuron. The classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation is notoriously inefﬁcient in that regard with about 4 times more charges ﬂowing through the membrane than the theoretical minimum required to achieve the observed depolarization. Yet, recent experimental results show that mammalian neurons are close to the optimal metabolic efﬁciency and that the dynamics of their voltage-gated channels is signiﬁcantly different than the one exhibited by the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model during the action potential. Nevertheless, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model is still widely used and rarely to model the squid giant axon from which it was extracted. Here, we introduce a novel family of HodgkinHuxley models that correctly account for sodium entry, action potential width and whose voltage-gated channels display a dynamics very similar to the most recent experimental observations in mammalian neurons. We speak here about a family of models because the model is parameterized by a unique parameter the variations of which allow to reproduce the entire range of experimental observations from cortical pyramidal neurons to Purkinje cells, yielding a very economical framework to model a wide range of different central neurons. The present paper demonstrates the performances and discuss the properties of this new family of models. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90551513 <a title="180-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Near-Optimal_Bayesian_Active_Learning_with_Noisy_Observations.html">180 nips-2010-Near-Optimal Bayesian Active Learning with Noisy Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Golovin, Andreas Krause, Debajyoti Ray</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the fundamental problem of Bayesian active learning with noise, where we need to adaptively select from a number of expensive tests in order to identify an unknown hypothesis sampled from a known prior distribution. In the case of noise–free observations, a greedy algorithm called generalized binary search (GBS) is known to perform near–optimally. We show that if the observations are noisy, perhaps surprisingly, GBS can perform very poorly. We develop EC2 , a novel, greedy active learning algorithm and prove that it is competitive with the optimal policy, thus obtaining the ﬁrst competitiveness guarantees for Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Our bounds rely on a recently discovered diminishing returns property called adaptive submodularity, generalizing the classical notion of submodular set functions to adaptive policies. Our results hold even if the tests have non–uniform cost and their noise is correlated. We also propose E FF ECXTIVE , a particularly fast approximation of EC 2 , and evaluate it on a Bayesian experimental design problem involving human subjects, intended to tease apart competing economic theories of how people make decisions under uncertainty. 1</p><p>4 0.89353937 <a title="180-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Static_Analysis_of_Binary_Executables_Using_Structural_SVMs.html">255 nips-2010-Static Analysis of Binary Executables Using Structural SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Karampatziakis</p><p>Abstract: We cast the problem of identifying basic blocks of code in a binary executable as learning a mapping from a byte sequence to a segmentation of the sequence. In general, inference in segmentation models, such as semi-CRFs, can be cubic in the length of the sequence. By taking advantage of the structure of our problem, we derive a linear-time inference algorithm which makes our approach practical, given that even small programs are tens or hundreds of thousands bytes long. Furthermore, we introduce two loss functions which are appropriate for our problem and show how to use structural SVMs to optimize the learned mapping for these losses. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of our method against a strong baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.88573295 <a title="180-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Smoothness%2C_Low_Noise_and_Fast_Rates.html">243 nips-2010-Smoothness, Low Noise and Fast Rates</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Srebro, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: √ ˜ We establish an excess risk bound of O HR2 + HL∗ Rn for ERM with an H-smooth loss n function and a hypothesis class with Rademacher complexity Rn , where L∗ is the best risk achievable by the hypothesis class. For typical hypothesis classes where Rn = R/n, this translates to ˜ ˜ a learning rate of O (RH/n) in the separable (L∗ = 0) case and O RH/n + L∗ RH/n more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization of a smooth non-negative objective. 1</p><p>6 0.85889411 <a title="180-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Extended_Bayesian_Information_Criteria_for_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">87 nips-2010-Extended Bayesian Information Criteria for Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>

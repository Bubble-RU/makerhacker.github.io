The primary challenge in a variety of settings is that the exploration policy, in which “ofﬂine” data is logged, is not explicitly known. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during the learning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in a repeated manner.

<p>Author: Tang Jie, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: Likelihood ratio policy gradient methods have been some of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for learning on physical systems. We describe how the likelihood ratio policy gradient can be derived from an importance sampling perspective. This derivation highlights how likelihood ratio methods under-use past experience by (i) using the past experience to estimate only the gradient of the expected return U (θ) at the current policy parameterization θ, rather than to obtain a more complete estimate of U (θ), and (ii) using past experience under the current policy only rather than using all past experience to improve the estimates. We present a new policy search method, which leverages both of these observations as well as generalized baselines—a new technique which generalizes commonly used baseline techniques for policy gradient methods. Our algorithm outperforms standard likelihood ratio policy gradient algorithms on several testbeds. 1</p><p>5 0.27315158 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>

For the ﬁrst time, compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients are obtained by estimating the cost-to-go function, rather than the (much larger) state-action advantage function as is necessary in traditional MDPs. We also develop the ﬁrst compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients for continuous-time stochastic systems.</p><p>6 0.26671937 <a title="134-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Predictive_State_Temporal_Difference_Learning.html">212 nips-2010-Predictive State Temporal Difference Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey Johns, Christopher Painter-wakefield, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has emphasized the power of L1 regularization to perform feature selection and prevent overﬁtting. We propose formulating the L1 regularized linear ﬁxed point problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This formulation offers several advantages over the LARS-inspired formulation, LARS-TD. The LCP formulation allows the use of efﬁcient off-theshelf solvers, leads to a new uniqueness result, and can be initialized with starting points from similar problems (warm starts). We demonstrate that warm starts, as well as the efﬁciency of LCP solvers, can speed up policy iteration. Moreover, warm starts permit a form of modiﬁed policy iteration that can be used to approximate a “greedy” homotopy path, a generalization of the LARS-TD homotopy path that combines policy evaluation and optimization. 1</p><p>5 0.80695933 <a title="134-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-On_a_Connection_between_Importance_Sampling_and_the_Likelihood_Ratio_Policy_Gradient.html">189 nips-2010-On a Connection between Importance Sampling and the Likelihood Ratio Policy Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: J. Z. Kolter, Siddharth Batra, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Energy disaggregation is the task of taking a whole-home energy signal and separating it into its component appliances. Studies have shown that having devicelevel energy information can cause users to conserve signiﬁcant amounts of energy, but current electricity meters only report whole-home data. Thus, developing algorithmic methods for disaggregation presents a key technical challenge in the effort to maximize energy conservation. In this paper, we examine a large scale energy disaggregation task, and apply a novel extension of sparse coding to this problem. In particular, we develop a method, based upon structured prediction, for discriminatively training sparse coding algorithms speciﬁcally to maximize disaggregation performance. We show that this signiﬁcantly improves the performance of sparse coding algorithms on the energy task and illustrate how these disaggregation results can provide useful information about energy usage. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85713977 <a title="134-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-LSTD_with_Random_Projections.html">134 nips-2010-LSTD with Random Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Odalric Maillard, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider least-squares regression using a randomly generated subspace GP ⊂ F of ﬁnite dimension P , where F is a function space of inﬁnite dimension, e.g. L2 ([0, 1]d ). GP is deﬁned as the span of P random features that are linear combinations of the basis functions of F weighted by random Gaussian i.i.d. coefﬁcients. In particular, we consider multi-resolution random combinations at all scales of a given mother function, such as a hat function or a wavelet. In this latter case, the resulting Gaussian objects are called scrambled wavelets and we show that they enable to approximate functions in Sobolev spaces H s ([0, 1]d ). As a result, given N data, the least-squares estimate g built from P scrambled wavelets has excess risk ||f ∗ − g||2 = O(||f ∗ ||2 s ([0,1]d ) (log N )/P + P (log N )/N ) for P H target functions f ∗ ∈ H s ([0, 1]d ) of smoothness order s > d/2. An interesting aspect of the resulting bounds is that they do not depend on the distribution P from which the data are generated, which is important in a statistical regression setting considered here. Randomization enables to adapt to any possible distribution. We conclude by describing an efﬁcient numerical implementation using lazy ex˜ pansions with numerical complexity O(2d N 3/2 log N + N 2 ), where d is the dimension of the input space. 1</p><p>4 0.83158004 <a title="134-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Spectral_Regularization_for_Support_Estimation.html">250 nips-2010-Spectral Regularization for Support Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ernesto D. Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Alessandro Toigo</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning from data the support of a probability distribution when the distribution does not have a density (with respect to some reference measure). We propose a new class of regularized spectral estimators based on a new notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we call “completely regular”. Completely regular kernels allow to capture the relevant geometric and topological properties of an arbitrary probability space. In particular, they are the key ingredient to prove the universal consistency of the spectral estimators and in this respect they are the analogue of universal kernels for supervised problems. Numerical experiments show that spectral estimators compare favorably to state of the art machine learning algorithms for density support estimation.</p><p>5 0.82969975 <a title="134-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-The_LASSO_risk%3A_asymptotic_results_and_real_world_examples.html">265 nips-2010-The LASSO risk: asymptotic results and real world examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, José Pereira, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector x0 ∈ RN from noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w ∈ Rn . In many contexts (ranging from model selection to image processing) it is desirable to construct a sparse estimator x. In this case, a popular approach consists in solving an ℓ1 -penalized least squares problem known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). For sequences of matrices A of increasing dimensions, with independent gaussian entries, we prove that the normalized risk of the LASSO converges to a limit, and we obtain an explicit expression for this limit. Our result is the ﬁrst rigorous derivation of an explicit formula for the asymptotic mean square error of the LASSO for random instances. The proof technique is based on the analysis of AMP, a recently developed efﬁcient algorithm, that is inspired from graphical models ideas. Through simulations on real data matrices (gene expression data and hospital medical records) we observe that these results can be relevant in a broad array of practical applications.</p><p>6 0.82821238 <a title="134-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Two-Layer_Generalization_Analysis_for_Ranking_Using_Rademacher_Average.html">277 nips-2010-Two-Layer Generalization Analysis for Ranking Using Rademacher Average</a></p>

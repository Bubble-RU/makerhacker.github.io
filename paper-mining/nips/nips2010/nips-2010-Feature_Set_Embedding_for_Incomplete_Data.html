<p>Author: Andrew Goldberg, Ben Recht, Junming Xu, Robert Nowak, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We pose transductive classiﬁcation as a matrix completion problem. By assuming the underlying matrix has a low rank, our formulation is able to handle three problems simultaneously: i) multi-label learning, where each item has more than one label, ii) transduction, where most of these labels are unspeciﬁed, and iii) missing data, where a large number of features are missing. We obtained satisfactory results on several real-world tasks, suggesting that the low rank assumption may not be as restrictive as it seems. Our method allows for different loss functions to apply on the feature and label entries of the matrix. The resulting nuclear norm minimization problem is solved with a modiﬁed ﬁxed-point continuation method that is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum. 1</p><p>3 0.23277648 <a title="94-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks.html">135 nips-2010-Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Jason Weston, David Grangier</p><p>Abstract: Multi-class classiﬁcation becomes challenging at test time when the number of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a treestructure of classiﬁers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster. 1</p><p>4 0.13224526 <a title="94-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Sphere_Embedding%3A_An_Application_to_Part-of-Speech_Induction.html">251 nips-2010-Sphere Embedding: An Application to Part-of-Speech Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yariv Maron, Elie Bienenstock, Michael James</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application to unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, we present an algorithm for the Euclidean embedding of large sets of categorical data based on co-occurrence statistics. We use the CODE model of Globerson et al. but constrain the embedding to lie on a hig hdimensional unit sphere. This constraint allows for efficient optimization, even in the case of large datasets and high embedding dimensionality. Using k-means clustering of the embedded data, our approach efficiently produces state-of-the-art results. We analyze the reasons why the sphere constraint is beneficial in this application, and conjecture that these reasons might apply quite generally to other large-scale tasks. 1 In trod u cti on The embedding of objects in a low-dimensional Euclidean space is a form of dimensionality reduction that has been used in the past mostly to create 2D representations of data for the purpose of visualization and exploratory data analysis [10, 13]. Most methods work on objects of a single type, endowed with a measure of similarity. Other methods, such as [ 3], embed objects of heterogeneous types, based on their co-occurrence statistics. In this paper we demonstrate that the latter can be successfully applied to unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction, an extensively studied, challenging, problem in natural language processing [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The problem we address is distributional POS tagging, in which words are to be tagged based on the statistics of their immediate left and right context in a corpus (ignoring morphology and other features). The induction task is fully unsupervised, i.e., it uses no annotations. This task has been addressed in the past using a variety of methods. Some approaches, such as [1], combine a Markovian assumption with clustering. Many recent works use HMMs, perhaps due to their excellent performance on the supervised version of the task [7, 2, 5]. Using a latent-descriptor clustering approach, [15] obtain the best results to date for distributional-only unsupervised POS tagging of the widely-used WSJ corpus. Using a heterogeneous-data embedding approach for this task, we define separate embedding functions for the objects</p><p>5 0.12992615 <a title="94-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Variational_bounds_for_mixed-data_factor_analysis.html">284 nips-2010-Variational bounds for mixed-data factor analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad E. Khan, Guillaume Bouchard, Kevin P. Murphy, Benjamin M. Marlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new variational EM algorithm for ﬁtting factor analysis models with mixed continuous and categorical observations. The algorithm is based on a simple quadratic bound to the log-sum-exp function. In the special case of fully observed binary data, the bound we propose is signiﬁcantly faster than previous variational methods. We show that EM is signiﬁcantly more robust in the presence of missing data compared to treating the latent factors as parameters, which is the approach used by exponential family PCA and other related matrix-factorization methods. A further beneﬁt of the variational approach is that it can easily be extended to the case of mixtures of factor analyzers, as we show. We present results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrating several desirable properties of our proposed method. 1</p><p>6 0.11254087 <a title="94-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Link_Discovery_using_Graph_Feature_Tracking.html">162 nips-2010-Link Discovery using Graph Feature Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaushik Mitra, Sameer Sheorey, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Matrix factorization in the presence of missing data is at the core of many computer vision problems such as structure from motion (SfM), non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo. We formulate the problem of matrix factorization with missing data as a low-rank semideﬁnite program (LRSDP) with the advantage that: 1) an efﬁcient quasi-Newton implementation of the LRSDP enables us to solve large-scale factorization problems, and 2) additional constraints such as orthonormality, required in orthographic SfM, can be directly incorporated in the new formulation. Our empirical evaluations suggest that, under the conditions of matrix completion theory, the proposed algorithm ﬁnds the optimal solution, and also requires fewer observations compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the afﬁne SfM problem, non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo problems.</p><p>5 0.56841904 <a title="94-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Sphere_Embedding%3A_An_Application_to_Part-of-Speech_Induction.html">251 nips-2010-Sphere Embedding: An Application to Part-of-Speech Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Atsushi Miyamae, Yuichi Nagata, Isao Ono, Shigenobu Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm for estimating the natural policy gradient using parameter-based exploration; this algorithm samples directly in the parameter space. Unlike previous methods based on natural gradients, our algorithm calculates the natural policy gradient using the inverse of the exact Fisher information matrix. The computational cost of this algorithm is equal to that of conventional policy gradients whereas previous natural policy gradient methods have a prohibitive computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>3 0.97827393 <a title="94-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Active_Instance_Sampling_via_Matrix_Partition.html">23 nips-2010-Active Instance Sampling via Matrix Partition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, batch-mode active learning has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning approach that selects a batch of queries in each iteration by maximizing a natural mutual information criterion between the labeled and unlabeled instances. By employing a Gaussian process framework, this mutual information based instance selection problem can be formulated as a matrix partition problem. Although matrix partition is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we show that a good local solution can be obtained by exploiting an effective local optimization technique on a relaxed continuous optimization problem. The proposed active learning approach is independent of employed classiﬁcation models. Our empirical studies show this approach can achieve comparable or superior performance to discriminative batch-mode active learning methods. 1</p><p>4 0.96669203 <a title="94-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheng-jun Huang, Rong Jin, Zhi-hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.96040642 <a title="94-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov</p><p>Abstract: We present policy gradient results within the framework of linearly-solvable MDPs. For the ﬁrst time, compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients are obtained by estimating the cost-to-go function, rather than the (much larger) state-action advantage function as is necessary in traditional MDPs. We also develop the ﬁrst compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients for continuous-time stochastic systems.</p><p>6 0.95134252 <a title="94-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>

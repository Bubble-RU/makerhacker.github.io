<p>Author: Daniel Lowd, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Arithmetic circuits (ACs) exploit context-speciﬁc independence and determinism to allow exact inference even in networks with high treewidth. In this paper, we introduce the ﬁrst ever approximate inference methods using ACs, for domains where exact inference remains intractable. We propose and evaluate a variety of techniques based on exact compilation, forward sampling, AC structure learning, Markov network parameter learning, variational inference, and Gibbs sampling. In experiments on eight challenging real-world domains, we ﬁnd that the methods based on sampling and learning work best: one such method (AC2 -F) is faster and usually more accurate than loopy belief propagation, mean ﬁeld, and Gibbs sampling; another (AC2 -G) has a running time similar to Gibbs sampling but is consistently more accurate than all baselines. 1</p><p>3 0.28456131 <a title="56-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Short-term_memory_in_neuronal_networks_through_dynamical_compressed_sensing.html">238 nips-2010-Short-term memory in neuronal networks through dynamical compressed sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Surya Ganguli, Haim Sompolinsky</p><p>Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that large, generic neuronal networks could store memory traces of past input sequences in their instantaneous state. Such a proposal raises important theoretical questions about the duration of these memory traces and their dependence on network size, connectivity and signal statistics. Prior work, in the case of gaussian input sequences and linear neuronal networks, shows that the duration of memory traces in a network cannot exceed the number of neurons (in units of the neuronal time constant), and that no network can out-perform an equivalent feedforward network. However a more ethologically relevant scenario is that of sparse input sequences. In this scenario, we show how linear neural networks can essentially perform compressed sensing (CS) of past inputs, thereby attaining a memory capacity that exceeds the number of neurons. This enhanced capacity is achieved by a class of “orthogonal” recurrent networks and not by feedforward networks or generic recurrent networks. We exploit techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically compute the decay of memory traces in such networks as a function of network size, signal sparsity and integration time. Alternately, viewed purely from the perspective of CS, this work introduces a new ensemble of measurement matrices derived from dynamical systems, and provides a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance. 1</p><p>4 0.14462663 <a title="56-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition.html">143 nips-2010-Learning Convolutional Feature Hierarchies for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pierre Sermanet, Y-lan Boureau, Karol Gregor, Michael Mathieu, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for learning multi-stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting ﬁlters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efﬁciency of the overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efﬁcient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasisparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse ﬁlters, including center-surround ﬁlters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these ﬁlters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.12963532 <a title="56-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Factorized_Latent_Spaces_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">89 nips-2010-Factorized Latent Spaces with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Mathieu Salzmann, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recent approaches to multi-view learning have shown that factorizing the information into parts that are shared across all views and parts that are private to each view could effectively account for the dependencies and independencies between the different input modalities. Unfortunately, these approaches involve minimizing non-convex objective functions. In this paper, we propose an approach to learning such factorized representations inspired by sparse coding techniques. In particular, we show that structured sparsity allows us to address the multiview learning problem by alternately solving two convex optimization problems. Furthermore, the resulting factorized latent spaces generalize over existing approaches in that they allow having latent dimensions shared between any subset of the views instead of between all the views only. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of human pose estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.12799448 <a title="56-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Group_Sparse_Coding_with_a_Laplacian_Scale_Mixture_Prior.html">109 nips-2010-Group Sparse Coding with a Laplacian Scale Mixture Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Shaul Druckmann, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: A striking aspect of cortical neural networks is the divergence of a relatively small number of input channels from the peripheral sensory apparatus into a large number of cortical neurons, an over-complete representation strategy. Cortical neurons are then connected by a sparse network of lateral synapses. Here we propose that such architecture may increase the persistence of the representation of an incoming stimulus, or a percept. We demonstrate that for a family of networks in which the receptive ﬁeld of each neuron is re-expressed by its outgoing connections, a represented percept can remain constant despite changing activity. We term this choice of connectivity REceptive FIeld REcombination (REFIRE) networks. The sparse REFIRE network may serve as a high-dimensional integrator and a biologically plausible model of the local cortical circuit. 1</p><p>5 0.54523361 <a title="56-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Group_Sparse_Coding_with_a_Laplacian_Scale_Mixture_Prior.html">109 nips-2010-Group Sparse Coding with a Laplacian Scale Mixture Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a class of sparse coding models that utilizes a Laplacian Scale Mixture (LSM) prior to model dependencies among coefﬁcients. Each coefﬁcient is modeled as a Laplacian distribution with a variable scale parameter, with a Gamma distribution prior over the scale parameter. We show that, due to the conjugacy of the Gamma prior, it is possible to derive efﬁcient inference procedures for both the coefﬁcients and the scale parameter. When the scale parameters of a group of coefﬁcients are combined into a single variable, it is possible to describe the dependencies that occur due to common amplitude ﬂuctuations among coefﬁcients, which have been shown to constitute a large fraction of the redundancy in natural images [1]. We show that, as a consequence of this group sparse coding, the resulting inference of the coefﬁcients follows a divisive normalization rule, and that this may be efﬁciently implemented in a network architecture similar to that which has been proposed to occur in primary visual cortex. We also demonstrate improvements in image coding and compressive sensing recovery using the LSM model. 1</p><p>6 0.47644323 <a title="56-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Improvements_to_the_Sequence_Memoizer.html">120 nips-2010-Improvements to the Sequence Memoizer</a></p>

<p>Author: David Grangier, Iain Melvin</p><p>Abstract: We present a new learning strategy for classiﬁcation problems in which train and/or test data suffer from missing features. In previous work, instances are represented as vectors from some feature space and one is forced to impute missing values or to consider an instance-speciﬁc subspace. In contrast, our method considers instances as sets of (feature,value) pairs which naturally handle the missing value case. Building onto this framework, we propose a classiﬁcation strategy for sets. Our proposal maps (feature,value) pairs into an embedding space and then nonlinearly combines the set of embedded vectors. The embedding and the combination parameters are learned jointly on the ﬁnal classiﬁcation objective. This simple strategy allows great ﬂexibility in encoding prior knowledge about the features in the embedding step and yields advantageous results compared to alternative solutions over several datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.99398434 <a title="56-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Natural_Policy_Gradient_Methods_with_Parameter-based_Exploration_for_Control_Tasks.html">179 nips-2010-Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks</a></p>

Unlike previous methods based on natural gradients, our algorithm calculates the natural policy gradient using the inverse of the exact Fisher information matrix. The computational cost of this algorithm is equal to that of conventional policy gradients whereas previous natural policy gradient methods have a prohibitive computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>3 0.9916082 <a title="56-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Active_Instance_Sampling_via_Matrix_Partition.html">23 nips-2010-Active Instance Sampling via Matrix Partition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, batch-mode active learning has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning approach that selects a batch of queries in each iteration by maximizing a natural mutual information criterion between the labeled and unlabeled instances. By employing a Gaussian process framework, this mutual information based instance selection problem can be formulated as a matrix partition problem. Although matrix partition is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we show that a good local solution can be obtained by exploiting an effective local optimization technique on a relaxed continuous optimization problem. The proposed active learning approach is independent of employed classiﬁcation models. Our empirical studies show this approach can achieve comparable or superior performance to discriminative batch-mode active learning methods. 1</p><p>4 0.98438102 <a title="56-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples.html">25 nips-2010-Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples</a></p>

Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in ﬁnding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed Q UIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Q UIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.97981435 <a title="56-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Policy_gradients_in_linearly-solvable_MDPs.html">208 nips-2010-Policy gradients in linearly-solvable MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov</p><p>Abstract: We present policy gradient results within the framework of linearly-solvable MDPs. For the ﬁrst time, compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients are obtained by estimating the cost-to-go function, rather than the (much larger) state-action advantage function as is necessary in traditional MDPs. We also develop the ﬁrst compatible function approximators and natural policy gradients for continuous-time stochastic systems.</p><p>6 0.97441465 <a title="56-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Active_Learning_Applied_to_Patient-Adaptive_Heartbeat_Classification.html">24 nips-2010-Active Learning Applied to Patient-Adaptive Heartbeat Classification</a></p>

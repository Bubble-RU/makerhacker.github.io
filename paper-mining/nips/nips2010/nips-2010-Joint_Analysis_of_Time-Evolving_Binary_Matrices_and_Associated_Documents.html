<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Zhi-ming Ma</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the generalization analysis on learning to rank for information retrieval (IR). In IR, data are hierarchically organized, i.e., consisting of queries and documents. Previous generalization analysis for ranking, however, has not fully considered this structure, and cannot explain how the simultaneous change of query number and document number in the training data will affect the performance of the learned ranking model. In this paper, we propose performing generalization analysis under the assumption of two-layer sampling, i.e., the i.i.d. sampling of queries and the conditional i.i.d sampling of documents per query. Such a sampling can better describe the generation mechanism of real data, and the corresponding generalization analysis can better explain the real behaviors of learning to rank algorithms. However, it is challenging to perform such analysis, because the documents associated with different queries are not identically distributed, and the documents associated with the same query become no longer independent after represented by features extracted from query-document matching. To tackle the challenge, we decompose the expected risk according to the two layers, and make use of the new concept of two-layer Rademacher average. The generalization bounds we obtained are quite intuitive and are in accordance with previous empirical studies on the performances of ranking algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.13087325 <a title="131-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Deterministic_Single-Pass_Algorithm_for_LDA.html">60 nips-2010-Deterministic Single-Pass Algorithm for LDA</a></p>

<p>Author: America Chambers, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative probabilistic model for learning general graph structures, which we term concept graphs, from text. Concept graphs provide a visual summary of the thematic content of a collection of documents—a task that is difﬁcult to accomplish using only keyword search. The proposed model can learn different types of concept graph structures and is capable of utilizing partial prior knowledge about graph structure as well as labeled documents. We describe a generative model that is based on a stick-breaking process for graphs, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data show that the model can recover known graph structure when learning in both unsupervised and semi-supervised modes. We also show that the proposed model is competitive in terms of empirical log likelihood with existing structure-based topic models (hPAM and hLDA) on real-world text data sets. Finally, we illustrate the application of the model to the problem of updating Wikipedia category graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.11672992 <a title="131-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Tree-Structured_Stick_Breaking_for_Hierarchical_Data.html">276 nips-2010-Tree-Structured Stick Breaking for Hierarchical Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Francis R. Bach, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by ﬁtting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA ﬁnds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time. 1</p><p>5 0.60937643 <a title="131-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Learning_concept_graphs_from_text_with_stick-breaking_priors.html">150 nips-2010-Learning concept graphs from text with stick-breaking priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Eiji Mizutani, Stuart Dreyfus</p><p>Abstract: In the neural-network parameter space, an attractive ﬁeld is likely to be induced by singularities. In such a singularity region, ﬁrst-order gradient learning typically causes a long plateau with very little change in the objective function value E (hence, a ﬂat region). Therefore, it may be confused with “attractive” local minima. Our analysis shows that the Hessian matrix of E tends to be indeﬁnite in the vicinity of (perturbed) singular points, suggesting a promising strategy that exploits negative curvature so as to escape from the singularity plateaus. For numerical evidence, we limit the scope to small examples (some of which are found in journal papers) that allow us to conﬁrm singularities and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, and for which computation using a descent direction of negative curvature encounters no plateau. Even for those small problems, no efﬁcient methods have been previously developed that avoided plateaus. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75494522 <a title="131-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Joint_Analysis_of_Time-Evolving_Binary_Matrices_and_Associated_Documents.html">131 nips-2010-Joint Analysis of Time-Evolving Binary Matrices and Associated Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Urry, Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: We study learning curves for Gaussian process regression which characterise performance in terms of the Bayes error averaged over datasets of a given size. Whilst learning curves are in general very difﬁcult to calculate we show that for discrete input domains, where similarity between input points is characterised in terms of a graph, accurate predictions can be obtained. These should in fact become exact for large graphs drawn from a broad range of random graph ensembles with arbitrary degree distributions where each input (node) is connected only to a ﬁnite number of others. Our approach is based on translating the appropriate belief propagation equations to the graph ensemble. We demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions for Poisson (Erdos-Renyi) and regular random graphs, and discuss when and why previous approximations of the learning curve fail. 1</p><p>4 0.69129956 <a title="131-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-A_Family_of_Penalty_Functions_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">7 nips-2010-A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Morales, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefﬁcients. This family subsumes the ℓ1 norm and is ﬂexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the beneﬁt of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.</p><p>5 0.6895895 <a title="131-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-MAP_estimation_in_Binary_MRFs_via_Bipartite_Multi-cuts.html">165 nips-2010-MAP estimation in Binary MRFs via Bipartite Multi-cuts</a></p>
<p>Author: Sashank J. Reddi, Sunita Sarawagi, Sundar Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new LP relaxation for obtaining the MAP assignment of a binary MRF with pairwise potentials. Our relaxation is derived from reducing the MAP assignment problem to an instance of a recently proposed Bipartite Multi-cut problem where the LP relaxation is guaranteed to provide an O(log k) approximation where k is the number of vertices adjacent to non-submodular edges in the MRF. We then propose a combinatorial algorithm to efﬁciently solve the LP and also provide a lower bound by concurrently solving its dual to within an approximation. The algorithm is up to an order of magnitude faster and provides better MAP scores and bounds than the state of the art message passing algorithm of [1] that tightens the local marginal polytope with third-order marginal constraints. 1</p><p>6 0.68843502 <a title="131-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Improving_the_Asymptotic_Performance_of_Markov_Chain_Monte-Carlo_by_Inserting_Vortices.html">122 nips-2010-Improving the Asymptotic Performance of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo by Inserting Vortices</a></p>

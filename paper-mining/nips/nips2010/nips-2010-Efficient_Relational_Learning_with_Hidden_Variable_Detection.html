<p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand, Csaba Szepesvári, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We address the question of how the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration of the Approximate Policy/Value Iteration algorithms inﬂuences the quality of the resulted policy. We quantify the performance loss as the Lp norm of the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum – as opposed to what has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the earlier iterations decays exponentially fast. 1</p><p>3 0.076236866 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Evidence-Specific_Structures_for_Rich_Tractable_CRFs.html">83 nips-2010-Evidence-Specific Structures for Rich Tractable CRFs</a></p>

Our proposed model abstracts observed timevarying object-object relationships into relationships between object clusters. We extend the inﬁnite Hidden Markov model to follow dynamic and time-sensitive changes in the structure of the relational data and to estimate a number of clusters simultaneously.

<p>Author: Morten Mørup, Kristoffer Madsen, Anne-marie Dogonowski, Hartwig Siebner, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the neural elements which form complex network at a whole brain level. Most analyses of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been based on the analysis of correlation between the temporal dynamics of various regions of the brain. While these models can identify coherently behaving groups in terms of correlation they give little insight into how these groups interact. In this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state networks. Starting from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups we search for functional units of the brain that communicate with other parts of the brain in a coherent manner as measured by mutual information. We use the inﬁnite relational model (IRM) to quantify functional coherent groups of resting state networks and demonstrate how the extracted component interactions can be used to discriminate between functional resting state activity in multiple sclerosis and normal subjects. 1</p><p>6 0.051886544 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Predictive_Subspace_Learning_for_Multi-view_Data%3A_a_Large_Margin_Approach.html">213 nips-2010-Predictive Subspace Learning for Multi-view Data: a Large Margin Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Vibhav Gogate, William Webb, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning high-treewidth Markov networks where inference is still tractable. This is made possible by exploiting context-speciﬁc independence and determinism in the domain. The class of models our algorithm can learn has the same desirable properties as thin junction trees: polynomial inference, closed-form weight learning, etc., but is much broader. Our algorithm searches for a feature that divides the state space into subspaces where the remaining variables decompose into independent subsets (conditioned on the feature and its negation) and recurses on each subspace/subset of variables until no useful new features can be found. We provide probabilistic performance guarantees for our algorithm under the assumption that the maximum feature length is bounded by a constant k (the treewidth can be much larger) and dependences are of bounded strength. We also propose a greedy version of the algorithm that, while forgoing these guarantees, is much more efﬁcient. Experiments on a variety of domains show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art Markov network structure learners. 1</p><p>3 0.66255051 <a title="71-lsi-3" href="./nips-2010-Lifted_Inference_Seen_from_the_Other_Side_%3A_The_Tractable_Features.html">159 nips-2010-Lifted Inference Seen from the Other Side : The Tractable Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhay Jha, Vibhav Gogate, Alexandra Meliou, Dan Suciu</p><p>Abstract: Lifted Inference algorithms for representations that combine ﬁrst-order logic and graphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All lifted algorithms developed to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standard probabilistic inference algorithm (e.g., variable elimination, belief propagation etc.) and improve its efﬁciency by exploiting repeated structure in the ﬁrst-order model. In this paper, we propose an approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic for probabilistic inference. In particular, we deﬁne a set of rules that look only at the logical representation to identify models for which exact efﬁcient inference is possible. Our rules yield new tractable classes that could not be solved efﬁciently by any of the existing techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.63996768 <a title="71-lsi-4" href="./nips-2010-Evidence-Specific_Structures_for_Rich_Tractable_CRFs.html">83 nips-2010-Evidence-Specific Structures for Rich Tractable CRFs</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandre Bouchard-côté, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Since the discovery of sophisticated fully polynomial randomized algorithms for a range of #P problems [1, 2, 3], theoretical work on approximate inference in combinatorial spaces has focused on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Despite their strong theoretical guarantees, the slow running time of many of these randomized algorithms and the restrictive assumptions on the potentials have hindered the applicability of these algorithms to machine learning. Because of this, in applications to combinatorial spaces simple exact models are often preferred to more complex models that require approximate inference [4]. Variational inference would appear to provide an appealing alternative, given the success of variational methods for graphical models [5]; unfortunately, however, it is not obvious how to develop variational approximations for combinatorial objects such as matchings, partial orders, plane partitions and sequence alignments. We propose a new framework that extends variational inference to a wide range of combinatorial spaces. Our method is based on a simple assumption: the existence of a tractable measure factorization, which we show holds in many examples. Simulations on a range of matching models show that the algorithm is more general and empirically faster than a popular fully polynomial randomized algorithm. We also apply the framework to the problem of multiple alignment of protein sequences, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the BAliBASE dataset [6]. 1</p><p>6 0.56560457 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Dynamic_Infinite_Relational_Model_for_Time-varying_Relational_Data_Analysis.html">67 nips-2010-Dynamic Infinite Relational Model for Time-varying Relational Data Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Achintya Kundu, Vikram Tankasali, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Aharon Ben-tal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning an n × n kernel matrix from m(≥ 1) similarity matrices under general convex loss. Past research have extensively studied the m = 1 case and have derived several algorithms which require sophisticated techniques like ACCP, SOCP, etc. The existing algorithms do not apply if one uses arbitrary losses and often can not handle m > 1 case. We present several provably convergent iterative algorithms, where each iteration requires either an SVM or a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) solver for m > 1 case. One of the major contributions of the paper is to extend the well known Mirror Descent(MD) framework to handle Cartesian product of psd matrices. This novel extension leads to an algorithm, called EMKL, which solves the problem in 2 O( m ǫlog n ) iterations; in each iteration one solves an MKL involving m kernels 2 and m eigen-decomposition of n × n matrices. By suitably deﬁning a restriction on the objective function, a faster version of EMKL is proposed, called REKL, which avoids the eigen-decomposition. An alternative to both EMKL and REKL is also suggested which requires only an SVM solver. Experimental results on real world protein data set involving several similarity matrices illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.64197373 <a title="71-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Efficient_Relational_Learning_with_Hidden_Variable_Detection.html">71 nips-2010-Efficient Relational Learning with Hidden Variable Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Thiesson, Chong Wang</p><p>Abstract: Remarkably easy implementation and guaranteed convergence has made the EM algorithm one of the most used algorithms for mixture modeling. On the downside, the E-step is linear in both the sample size and the number of mixture components, making it impractical for large-scale data. Based on the variational EM framework, we propose a fast alternative that uses component-speciﬁc data partitions to obtain a sub-linear E-step in sample size, while the algorithm still maintains provable convergence. Our approach builds on previous work, but is signiﬁcantly faster and scales much better in the number of mixture components. We demonstrate this speedup by experiments on large-scale synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.52954125 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Convex_Multiple-Instance_Learning_by_Estimating_Likelihood_Ratio.html">52 nips-2010-Convex Multiple-Instance Learning by Estimating Likelihood Ratio</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to multiple-instance learning that reformulates the problem as a convex optimization on the likelihood ratio between the positive and the negative class for each training instance. This is casted as joint estimation of both a likelihood ratio predictor and the target (likelihood ratio variable) for instances. Theoretically, we prove a quantitative relationship between the risk estimated under the 0-1 classiﬁcation loss, and under a loss function for likelihood ratio. It is shown that likelihood ratio estimation is generally a good surrogate for the 0-1 loss, and separates positive and negative instances well. The likelihood ratio estimates provide a ranking of instances within a bag and are used as input features to learn a linear classiﬁer on bags of instances. Instance-level classiﬁcation is achieved from the bag-level predictions and the individual likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the approach.</p><p>5 0.49121124 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Avoiding_False_Positive_in_Multi-Instance_Learning.html">36 nips-2010-Avoiding False Positive in Multi-Instance Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanjun Han, Qing Tao, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: In multi-instance learning, there are two kinds of prediction failure, i.e., false negative and false positive. Current research mainly focus on avoiding the former. We attempt to utilize the geometric distribution of instances inside positive bags to avoid both the former and the latter. Based on kernel principal component analysis, we deﬁne a projection constraint for each positive bag to classify its constituent instances far away from the separating hyperplane while place positive instances and negative instances at opposite sides. We apply the Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure to solve the resulted problem. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach offers improved generalization performance.</p><p>6 0.45954686 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Bayesian_Action-Graph_Games.html">39 nips-2010-Bayesian Action-Graph Games</a></p>

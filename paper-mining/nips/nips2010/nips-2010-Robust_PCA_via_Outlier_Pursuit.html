<p>Author: Min Yang, Linli Xu, Martha White, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Robust regression and classiﬁcation are often thought to require non-convex loss functions that prevent scalable, global training. However, such a view neglects the possibility of reformulated training methods that can yield practically solvable alternatives. A natural way to make a loss function more robust to outliers is to truncate loss values that exceed a maximum threshold. We demonstrate that a relaxation of this form of “loss clipping” can be made globally solvable and applicable to any standard loss while guaranteeing robustness against outliers. We present a generic procedure that can be applied to standard loss functions and demonstrate improved robustness in regression and classiﬁcation problems. 1</p><p>3 0.24770078 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2010-Random_Conic_Pursuit_for_Semidefinite_Programming.html">219 nips-2010-Random Conic Pursuit for Semidefinite Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Ariel Kleiner, Ali Rahimi, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm, Random Conic Pursuit, that solves semideﬁnite programs (SDPs) via repeated optimization over randomly selected two-dimensional subcones of the PSD cone. This scheme is simple, easily implemented, applicable to very general SDPs, scalable, and theoretically interesting. Its advantages are realized at the expense of an ability to readily compute highly exact solutions, though useful approximate solutions are easily obtained. This property renders Random Conic Pursuit of particular interest for machine learning applications, in which the relevant SDPs are generally based upon random data and so exact minima are often not a priority. Indeed, we present empirical results to this effect for various SDPs encountered in machine learning; these experiments demonstrate the potential practical usefulness of Random Conic Pursuit. We also provide a preliminary analysis that yields insight into the theoretical properties and convergence of the algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.11262033 <a title="231-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Robust_Clustering_as_Ensembles_of_Affinity_Relations.html">230 nips-2010-Robust Clustering as Ensembles of Affinity Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hairong Liu, Longin J. Latecki, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we regard clustering as ensembles of k-ary afﬁnity relations and clusters correspond to subsets of objects with maximal average afﬁnity relations. The average afﬁnity relation of a cluster is relaxed and well approximated by a constrained homogenous function. We present an efﬁcient procedure to solve this optimization problem, and show that the underlying clusters can be robustly revealed by using priors systematically constructed from the data. Our method can automatically select some points to form clusters, leaving other points un-grouped; thus it is inherently robust to large numbers of outliers, which has seriously limited the applicability of classical methods. Our method also provides a uniﬁed solution to clustering from k-ary afﬁnity relations with k ≥ 2, that is, it applies to both graph-based and hypergraph-based clustering problems. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show the superiority of our method over classical solutions to the clustering problem, especially when there exists a large number of outliers.</p><p>5 0.11101945 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2010-Sparse_Coding_for_Learning_Interpretable_Spatio-Temporal_Primitives.html">246 nips-2010-Sparse Coding for Learning Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Primitives</a></p>
<p>Author: Taehwan Kim, Gregory Shakhnarovich, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding has recently become a popular approach in computer vision to learn dictionaries of natural images. In this paper we extend the sparse coding framework to learn interpretable spatio-temporal primitives. We formulated the problem as a tensor factorization problem with tensor group norm constraints over the primitives, diagonal constraints on the activations that provide interpretability as well as smoothness constraints that are inherent to human motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to learn interpretable representations of human motion from motion capture data, and show that our approach outperforms recently developed matching pursuit and sparse coding algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.099051319 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-CUR_from_a_Sparse_Optimization_Viewpoint.html">45 nips-2010-CUR from a Sparse Optimization Viewpoint</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaushik Mitra, Sameer Sheorey, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Matrix factorization in the presence of missing data is at the core of many computer vision problems such as structure from motion (SfM), non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo. We formulate the problem of matrix factorization with missing data as a low-rank semideﬁnite program (LRSDP) with the advantage that: 1) an efﬁcient quasi-Newton implementation of the LRSDP enables us to solve large-scale factorization problems, and 2) additional constraints such as orthonormality, required in orthographic SfM, can be directly incorporated in the new formulation. Our empirical evaluations suggest that, under the conditions of matrix completion theory, the proposed algorithm ﬁnds the optimal solution, and also requires fewer observations compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the afﬁne SfM problem, non-rigid SfM and photometric stereo problems.</p><p>5 0.50290859 <a title="231-lsi-5" href="./nips-2010-Guaranteed_Rank_Minimization_via_Singular_Value_Projection.html">110 nips-2010-Guaranteed Rank Minimization via Singular Value Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Raghu Meka, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints is a fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under afﬁne constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for afﬁne constraints that satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of lowrank matrix completion, for which the deﬁning afﬁne constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of [5, 18, 14], for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is signiﬁcantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem. 1</p><p>6 0.47362632 <a title="231-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-CUR_from_a_Sparse_Optimization_Viewpoint.html">45 nips-2010-CUR from a Sparse Optimization Viewpoint</a></p>

We quantify the performance loss as the Lp norm of the approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum – as opposed to what has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the earlier iterations decays exponentially fast. 1</p><p>2 0.90293431 <a title="231-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Spectral_Regularization_for_Support_Estimation.html">250 nips-2010-Spectral Regularization for Support Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ernesto D. Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Alessandro Toigo</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning from data the support of a probability distribution when the distribution does not have a density (with respect to some reference measure). We propose a new class of regularized spectral estimators based on a new notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we call “completely regular”. Completely regular kernels allow to capture the relevant geometric and topological properties of an arbitrary probability space. In particular, they are the key ingredient to prove the universal consistency of the spectral estimators and in this respect they are the analogue of universal kernels for supervised problems. Numerical experiments show that spectral estimators compare favorably to state of the art machine learning algorithms for density support estimation.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.88074279 <a title="231-lda-3" href="./nips-2010-Robust_PCA_via_Outlier_Pursuit.html">231 nips-2010-Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Sujay Sanghavi</p><p>Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efﬁciently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative ﬁltering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efﬁcient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisﬁed, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identiﬁes the corrupted points. Such identiﬁcation of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and ﬁnancial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach, necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself.</p><p>4 0.86223173 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Manifold_Regularization.html">146 nips-2010-Learning Multiple Tasks using Manifold Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Arvind Agarwal, Samuel Gerber, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for multitask learning (MTL) based on manifold regularization: assume that all task parameters lie on a manifold. This is the generalization of a common assumption made in the existing literature: task parameters share a common linear subspace. One proposed method uses the projection distance from the manifold to regularize the task parameters. The manifold structure and the task parameters are learned using an alternating optimization framework. When the manifold structure is ﬁxed, our method decomposes across tasks which can be learnt independently. An approximation of the manifold regularization scheme is presented that preserves the convexity of the single task learning problem, and makes the proposed MTL framework efﬁcient and easy to implement. We show the efﬁcacy of our method on several datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.85138535 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Universal_Kernels_on_Non-Standard_Input_Spaces.html">279 nips-2010-Universal Kernels on Non-Standard Input Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: During the last years support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied in situations where the input space X is not necessarily a subset of Rd . Examples include SVMs for the analysis of histograms or colored images, SVMs for text classiÄ?Ĺš cation and web mining, and SVMs for applications from computational biology using, e.g., kernels for trees and graphs. Moreover, SVMs are known to be consistent to the Bayes risk, if either the input space is a complete separable metric space and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Lp (PX ) is dense, or if the SVM uses a universal kernel k. So far, however, there are no kernels of practical interest known that satisfy these assumptions, if X Ă˘&Scaron;&sbquo; Rd . We close this gap by providing a general technique based on Taylor-type kernels to explicitly construct universal kernels on compact metric spaces which are not subset of Rd . We apply this technique for the following special cases: universal kernels on the set of probability measures, universal kernels based on Fourier transforms, and universal kernels for signal processing. 1</p><p>6 0.84346741 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-More_data_means_less_inference%3A_A_pseudo-max_approach_to_structured_learning.html">169 nips-2010-More data means less inference: A pseudo-max approach to structured learning</a></p>

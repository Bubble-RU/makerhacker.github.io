<p>Author: Luke Maurits, Dan Navarro, Amy Perfors</p><p>Abstract: Languages vary widely in many ways, including their canonical word order. A basic aspect of the observed variation is the fact that some word orders are much more common than others. Although this regularity has been recognized for some time, it has not been well-explained. In this paper we offer an informationtheoretic explanation for the observed word-order distribution across languages, based on the concept of Uniform Information Density (UID). We suggest that object-ﬁrst languages are particularly disfavored because they are highly nonoptimal if the goal is to distribute information content approximately evenly throughout a sentence, and that the rest of the observed word-order distribution is at least partially explainable in terms of UID. We support our theoretical analysis with data from child-directed speech and experimental work. 1</p><p>4 0.12345558 <a title="264-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2010-Word_Features_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">286 nips-2010-Word Features for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

This results in a variety of new capabilities, such as improved estimates for infrequently occurring words, as well as the ability to leverage thesauri and dictionaries in order to boost topic cohesion within and across languages. We present experiments on multi-language topic synchronisation where dictionary information is used to bias corresponding words towards similar topics.

<p>Author: Yariv Maron, Elie Bienenstock, Michael James</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application to unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, we present an algorithm for the Euclidean embedding of large sets of categorical data based on co-occurrence statistics. We use the CODE model of Globerson et al. but constrain the embedding to lie on a hig hdimensional unit sphere. This constraint allows for efficient optimization, even in the case of large datasets and high embedding dimensionality. Using k-means clustering of the embedded data, our approach efficiently produces state-of-the-art results. We analyze the reasons why the sphere constraint is beneficial in this application, and conjecture that these reasons might apply quite generally to other large-scale tasks. 1 In trod u cti on The embedding of objects in a low-dimensional Euclidean space is a form of dimensionality reduction that has been used in the past mostly to create 2D representations of data for the purpose of visualization and exploratory data analysis [10, 13]. Most methods work on objects of a single type, endowed with a measure of similarity. Other methods, such as [ 3], embed objects of heterogeneous types, based on their co-occurrence statistics. In this paper we demonstrate that the latter can be successfully applied to unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction, an extensively studied, challenging, problem in natural language processing [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The problem we address is distributional POS tagging, in which words are to be tagged based on the statistics of their immediate left and right context in a corpus (ignoring morphology and other features). The induction task is fully unsupervised, i.e., it uses no annotations. This task has been addressed in the past using a variety of methods. Some approaches, such as [1], combine a Markovian assumption with clustering. Many recent works use HMMs, perhaps due to their excellent performance on the supervised version of the task [7, 2, 5]. Using a latent-descriptor clustering approach, [15] obtain the best results to date for distributional-only unsupervised POS tagging of the widely-used WSJ corpus. Using a heterogeneous-data embedding approach for this task, we define separate embedding functions for the objects</p><p>6 0.1010659 <a title="264-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2010-Phoneme_Recognition_with_Large_Hierarchical_Reservoirs.html">207 nips-2010-Phoneme Recognition with Large Hierarchical Reservoirs</a></p>

<p>Author: Fabian Triefenbach, Azarakhsh Jalalvand, Benjamin Schrauwen, Jean-pierre Martens</p><p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition has gradually improved over the years, but the reliable recognition of unconstrained speech is still not within reach. In order to achieve a breakthrough, many research groups are now investigating new methodologies that have potential to outperform the Hidden Markov Model technology that is at the core of all present commercial systems. In this paper, it is shown that the recently introduced concept of Reservoir Computing might form the basis of such a methodology. In a limited amount of time, a reservoir system that can recognize the elementary sounds of continuous speech has been built. The system already achieves a state-of-the-art performance, and there is evidence that the margin for further improvements is still signiﬁcant. 1</p><p>6 0.47061655 <a title="264-lsi-6" href="./nips-2010-Sphere_Embedding%3A_An_Application_to_Part-of-Speech_Induction.html">251 nips-2010-Sphere Embedding: An Application to Part-of-Speech Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Joscha Schmiedt, Christian Albers, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁcations are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.67312682 <a title="264-lda-2" href="./nips-2010-Synergies_in_learning_words_and_their_referents.html">264 nips-2010-Synergies in learning words and their referents</a></p>

<p>Author: Diane Hu, Laurens Maaten, Youngmin Cho, Sorin Lerner, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: When software developers modify one or more ﬁles in a large code base, they must also identify and update other related ﬁles. Many ﬁle dependencies can be detected by mining the development history of the code base: in essence, groups of related ﬁles are revealed by the logs of previous workﬂows. From data of this form, we show how to detect dependent ﬁles by solving a problem in binary matrix completion. We explore different latent variable models (LVMs) for this problem, including Bernoulli mixture models, exponential family PCA, restricted Boltzmann machines, and fully Bayesian approaches. We evaluate these models on the development histories of three large, open-source software systems: Mozilla Firefox, Eclipse Subversive, and Gimp. In all of these applications, we ﬁnd that LVMs improve the performance of related ﬁle prediction over current leading methods. 1</p><p>4 0.41868854 <a title="264-lda-4" href="./nips-2010-Distributed_Dual_Averaging_In_Networks.html">63 nips-2010-Distributed Dual Averaging In Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: The goal of decentralized optimization over a network is to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients, and provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis clearly separates the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network. The sharpness of this prediction is conﬁrmed both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. 1</p><p>5 0.41621017 <a title="264-lda-5" href="./nips-2010-Decomposing_Isotonic_Regression_for_Efficiently_Solving_Large_Problems.html">58 nips-2010-Decomposing Isotonic Regression for Efficiently Solving Large Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Saharon Rosset, Moni Shahar</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithm for isotonic regression is presented based on recursively partitioning the solution space. We develop efﬁcient methods for each partitioning subproblem through an equivalent representation as a network ﬂow problem, and prove that this sequence of partitions converges to the global solution. These network ﬂow problems can further be decomposed in order to solve very large problems. Success of isotonic regression in prediction and our algorithm’s favorable computational properties are demonstrated through simulated examples as large as 2 × 105 variables and 107 constraints.</p><p>6 0.41564375 <a title="264-lda-6" href="./nips-2010-Lower_Bounds_on_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Cutting_Plane_Methods.html">163 nips-2010-Lower Bounds on Rate of Convergence of Cutting Plane Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Ariadna Quattoni, Michael Collins, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition of object classes from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as ﬂexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a uniﬁed framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by ﬁnding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes.</p><p>3 0.14081657 <a title="162-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Co-Training_and_Expansion%3A_Towards_Bridging_Theory_and_Practice.html">37 nips-2004-Co-Training and Expansion: Towards Bridging Theory and Practice</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria-florina Balcan, Avrim Blum, Ke Yang</p><p>Abstract: Co-training is a method for combining labeled and unlabeled data when examples can be thought of as containing two distinct sets of features. It has had a number of practical successes, yet previous theoretical analyses have needed very strong assumptions on the data that are unlikely to be satisﬁed in practice. In this paper, we propose a much weaker “expansion” assumption on the underlying data distribution, that we prove is sufﬁcient for iterative cotraining to succeed given appropriately strong PAC-learning algorithms on each feature set, and that to some extent is necessary as well. This expansion assumption in fact motivates the iterative nature of the original co-training algorithm, unlike stronger assumptions (such as independence given the label) that allow a simpler one-shot co-training to succeed. We also heuristically analyze the effect on performance of noise in the data. Predicted behavior is qualitatively matched in synthetic experiments on expander graphs. 1</p><p>4 0.13732365 <a title="162-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Exponentiated_Gradient_Algorithms_for_Large-margin_Structured_Classification.html">67 nips-2004-Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms for Large-margin Structured Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael Collins, Ben Taskar, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of structured classiﬁcation, where the task is to predict a label y from an input x, and y has meaningful internal structure. Our framework includes supervised training of Markov random ﬁelds and weighted context-free grammars as special cases. We describe an algorithm that solves the large-margin optimization problem deﬁned in [12], using an exponential-family (Gibbs distribution) representation of structured objects. The algorithm is efﬁcient—even in cases where the number of labels y is exponential in size—provided that certain expectations under Gibbs distributions can be calculated efﬁciently. The method for structured labels relies on a more general result, speciﬁcally the application of exponentiated gradient updates [7, 8] to quadratic programs. 1</p><p>5 0.1170036 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference.html">43 nips-2004-Conditional Models of Identity Uncertainty with Application to Noun Coreference</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, Ben Wellner</p><p>Abstract: Coreference analysis, also known as record linkage or identity uncertainty, is a difﬁcult and important problem in natural language processing, databases, citation matching and many other tasks. This paper introduces several discriminative, conditional-probability models for coreference analysis, all examples of undirected graphical models. Unlike many historical approaches to coreference, the models presented here are relational—they do not assume that pairwise coreference decisions should be made independently from each other. Unlike other relational models of coreference that are generative, the conditional model here can incorporate a great variety of features of the input without having to be concerned about their dependencies—paralleling the advantages of conditional random ﬁelds over hidden Markov models. We present positive results on noun phrase coreference in two standard text data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.11156203 <a title="162-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kumar Chellapilla, Patrice Y. Simard</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is often used to automatically solve human tasks. In this paper, we look for tasks where machine learning algorithms are not as good as humans with the hope of gaining insight into their current limitations. We studied various Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) on the market, because they are systems designed to tell computers and humans apart by posing challenges presumably too hard for computers. We found that most HIPs are pure recognition tasks which can easily be broken using machine learning. The harder HIPs use a combination of segmentation and recognition tasks. From this observation, we found that building segmentation tasks is the most effective way to confuse machine learning algorithms. This has enabled us to build effective HIPs (which we deployed in MSN Passport), as well as design challenging segmentation tasks for machine learning algorithms. 1 In t rod u ct i on The OCR problem for high resolution printed text has virtually been solved 10 years ago [1]. On the other hand, cursive handwriting recognition today is still too poor for most people to rely on. Is there a fundamental difference between these two seemingly similar problems? To shed more light on this question, we study problems that have been designed to be difficult for computers. The hope is that we will get some insight on what the stumbling blocks are for machine learning and devise appropriate tests to further understand their similarities and differences. Work on distinguishing computers from humans traces back to the original Turing Test [2] which asks that a human distinguish between another human and a machine by asking questions of both. Recent interest has turned to developing systems that allow a computer to distinguish between another computer and a human. These systems enable the construction of automatic filters that can be used to prevent automated scripts from utilizing services intended for humans [4]. Such systems have been termed Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) [3] or Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) [4]. An overview of the work in this area can be found in [5]. Construction of HIPs that are of practical value is difficult because it is not sufficient to develop challenges at which humans are somewhat more successful than machines. This is because the cost of failure for an automatic attacker is minimal compared to the cost of failure for humans. Ideally a HIP should be solved by humans more than 80% of the time, while an automatic script with reasonable resource use should succeed less than 0.01% of the time. This latter ratio (1 in 10,000) is a function of the cost of an automatic trial divided by the cost of having a human perform the attack. This constraint of generating tasks that are failed 99.99% of the time by all automated algorithms has generated various solutions which can easily be sampled on the internet. Seven different HIPs, namely, Mailblocks, MSN (before April 28th, 2004), Ticketmaster, Yahoo, Yahoo v2 (after Sept’04), Register, and Google, will be given as examples in the next section. We will show in Section 3 that machinelearning-based attacks are far more successful than 1 in 10,000. Yet, some of these HIPs are harder than others and could be made even harder by identifying the recognition and segmentation parts, and emphasizing the latter. Section 4 presents examples of more difficult HIPs which are much more respectable challenges for machine learning, and yet surprisingly easy for humans. The final section discusses a (known) weakness of machine learning algorithms and suggests designing simple artificial datasets for studying this weakness. 2 Exa mp les o f H I Ps The HIPs explored in this paper are made of characters (or symbols) rendered to an image and presented to the user. Solving the HIP requires identifying all characters in the correct order. The following HIPs can be sampled from the web: Mailblocks: While signing up for free email service with (www.mailblocks.com), you will find HIP challenges of the type: mailblocks MSN: While signing up for free e-mail with MSN Hotmail (www.hotmail.com), you will find HIP challenges of the type: Register.com: While requesting a whois lookup for a domain at www.register.com, you will HIP challenges of the type: Yahoo!/EZ-Gimpy (CMU): While signing up for free e-mail service with Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), you will receive HIP challenges of the type: Yahoo! (version 2): Starting in August 2004, Yahoo! introduced their second generation HIP. Three examples are presented below: Ticketmaster: While looking for concert tickets at www.ticketmaster.com, you will receive HIP challenges of the type: Google/Gmail: While signing up for free e-mail with Gmail at www.google.com, one will receive HIP challenges of the type: While solutions to Yahoo HIPs are common English words, those for ticketmaster and Google do not necessarily belong to the English dictionary. They appear to have been created using a phonetic generator [8]. 3 Usi n g ma ch i n e lea rn i n g t o b rea k H IP s Breaking HIPs is not new. Mori and Malik [7] have successfully broken the EZGimpy (92% success) and Gimpy (33% success) HIPs from CMU. Our approach aims at an automatic process for solving multiple HIPs with minimum human intervention, using machine learning. In this paper, our main goal is to learn more about the common strengths and weaknesses of these HIPs rather than to prove that we can break any one HIP in particular with the highest possible success rate. We have results for six different HIPs: EZ-Gimpy/Yahoo, Yahoo v2, mailblocks, register, ticketmaster, and Google. To simplify our study, we will not be using language models in our attempt to break HIPs. For example, there are only about 600 words in the EZ-Gimpy dictionary [7], which means that a random guess attack would get a success rate of 1 in 600 (more than enough to break the HIP, i.e., greater than 0.01% success). HIPs become harder when no language model is used. Similarly, when a HIP uses a language model to generate challenges, success rate of attacks can be significantly improved by incorporating the language model. Further, since the language model is not common to all HIPs studied, it was not used in this paper. Our generic method for breaking all of these HIPs is to write a custom algorithm to locate the characters, and then use machine learning for recognition. Surprisingly, segmentation, or finding the characters, is simple for many HIPs which makes the process of breaking the HIP particularly easy. Gimpy uses a single constant predictable color (black) for letters even though the background color changes. We quickly realized that once the segmentation problem is solved, solving the HIP becomes a pure recognition problem, and it can trivially be solved using machine learning. Our recognition engine is based on neural networks [6][9]. It yielded a 0.4% error rate on the MNIST database, uses little memory, and is very fast for recognition (important for breaking HIPs). For each HIP, we have a segmentation step, followed by a recognition step. It should be stressed that we are not trying to solve every HIP of a given type i.e., our goal is not 100% success rate, but something efficient that can achieve much better than 0.01%. In each of the following experiments, 2500 HIPs were hand labeled and used as follows (a) recognition (1600 for training, 200 for validation, and 200 for testing), and (b) segmentation (500 for testing segmentation). For each of the five HIPs, a convolution neural network, identical to the one described in [6], was trained and tested on gray level character images centered on the guessed character positions (see below). The trained neural network became the recognizer. 3.1 M a i l b l oc k s To solve the HIP, we select the red channel, binarize and erode it, extract the largest connected components (CCs), and breakup CCs that are too large into two or three adjacent CCs. Further, vertically overlapping half character size CCs are merged. The resulting rough segmentation works most of the time. Here is an example: For instance, in the example above, the NN would be trained, and tested on the following images: … The end-to-end success rate is 88.8% for segmentation, 95.9% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.888)*(0.959)7 = 66.2% total. Note that most of the errors come from segmentation, even though this is where all the custom programming was invested. 3.2 Register The procedure to solve HIPs is very similar. The image was smoothed, binarized, and the largest 5 connected components were identified. Two examples are presented below: The end-to-end success rate is 95.4% for segmentation, 87.1% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.954)*(0.871)5 = 47.8% total. 3.3 Y a h oo/ E Z - G i mp y Unlike the mailblocks and register HIPs, the Yahoo/EZ-Gimpy HIPs are richer in that a variety of backgrounds and clutter are possible. Though some amount of text warping is present, the text color, size, and font have low variability. Three simple segmentation algorithms were designed with associated rules to identify which algorithm to use. The goal was to keep these simple yet effective: a) No mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: b) Black mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, remove vertical and horizontal line pixels that don’t have neighboring pixels, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: c) White mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, add black pixels (in white line locations) if there exist neighboring pixels, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: Tests for black and white meshes were performed to determine which segmentation algorithm to use. The end-to-end success rate was 56.2% for segmentation (38.2% came from a), 11.8% from b), and 6.2% from c), 90.3% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.562)*(0.903)4.8 = 34.4% total. The average length of a Yahoo HIP solution is 4.8 characters. 3.4 T i c k e t ma s t e r The procedure that solved the Yahoo HIP is fairly successful at solving some of the ticket master HIPs. These HIPs are characterized by cris-crossing lines at random angles clustered around 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees. A multipronged attack as in the Yahoo case (section 3.3) has potential. In the interests of simplicity, a single attack was developed: Convert to grayscale, threshold to black and white, up-sample image, dilate first then erode, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: The dilate-erode combination causes the lines to be removed (along with any thin objects) but retains solid thick characters. This single attack is successful in achieving an end-to-end success rate of 16.6% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 82.3% (in spite of interfering lines), and (0.166)*(0.823)6.23 = 4.9% total. The average HIP solution length is 6.23 characters. 3.5 Y a h oo ve r s i on 2 The second generation HIP from Yahoo had several changes: a) it did not use words from a dictionary or even use a phonetic generator, b) it uses only black and white colors, c) uses both letters and digits, and d) uses connected lines and arcs as clutter. The HIP is somewhat similar to the MSN/Passport HIP which does not use a dictionary, uses two colors, uses letters and digits, and background and foreground arcs as clutter. Unlike the MSN/Passport HIP, several different fonts are used. A single segmentation attack was developed: Remove 6 pixel border, up-sample, dilate first then erode, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. The attack is practically identical to that used for the ticketmaster HIP with different preprocessing stages and slightly modified parameters. Two examples: This single attack is successful in achieving an end-to-end success rate of 58.4% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 95.2%, and (0.584)*(0.952)5 = 45.7% total. The average HIP solution length is 5 characters. 3.6 G oog l e / G M a i l The Google HIP is unique in that it uses only image warp as a means of distorting the characters. Similar to the MSN/Passport and Yahoo version 2 HIPs, it is also two color. The HIP characters are arranged closed to one another (they often touch) and follow a curved baseline. The following very simple attack was used to segment Google HIPs: Convert to grayscale, up-sample, threshold and separate connected components. a) b) This very simple attack gives an end-to-end success rate of 10.2% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 89.3%, giving (0.102)*(0.893)6.5 = 4.89% total probability of breaking a HIP. Average Google HIP solution length is 6.5 characters. This can be significantly improved upon by judicious use of dilate-erode attack. A direct application doesn’t do as well as it did on the ticketmaster and yahoo HIPs (because of the shear and warp of the baseline of the word). More successful and complicated attacks might estimate and counter the shear and warp of the baseline to achieve better success rates. 4 Lesso n s lea rn ed f ro m b rea ki n g H IPs From the previous section, it is clear that most of the errors come from incorrect segmentations, even though most of the development time is spent devising custom segmentation schemes. This observation raises the following questions: Why is segmentation a hard problem? Can we devise harder HIPs and datasets? Can we build an automatic segmentor? Can we compare classification algorithms based on how useful they are for segmentation? 4.1 T h e s e g me n t a t i on p r ob l e m As a review, segmentation is difficult for the following reasons: 1. Segmentation is computationally expensive. In order to find valid patterns, a recognizer must attempt recognition at many different candidate locations. 2. The segmentation function is complex. To segment successfully, the system must learn to identify which patterns are valid among the set of all possible valid and non-valid patterns. This task is intrinsically more difficult than classification because the space of input is considerably larger. Unlike the space of valid patterns, the space of non-valid patterns is typically too vast to sample. This is a problem for many learning algorithms which yield too many false positives when presented non-valid patterns. 3. Identifying valid characters among a set of valid and invalid candidates is a combinatorial problem. For example, correctly identifying which 8 characters among 20 candidates (assuming 12 false positives), has a 1 in 125,970 (20 choose 8) chances of success by random guessing. 4.2 B ui l d i n g b e t te r / h a r de r H I P s We can use what we have learned to build better HIPs. For instance the HIP below was designed to make segmentation difficult and a similar version has been deployed by MSN Passport for hotmail registrations (www.hotmail.com): The idea is that the additional arcs are themselves good candidates for false characters. The previous segmentation attacks would fail on this HIP. Furthermore, simple change of fonts, distortions, or arc types would require extensive work for the attacker to adjust to. We believe HIPs that emphasize the segmentation problem, such as the above example, are much stronger than the HIPs we examined in this paper, which rely on recognition being difficult. Pushing this to the extreme, we can easily generate the following HIPs: Despite the apparent difficulty of these HIPs, humans are surprisingly good at solving these, indicating that humans are far better than computers at segmentation. This approach of adding several competing false positives can in principle be used to automatically create difficult segmentation problems or benchmarks to test classification algorithms. 4.3 B ui l d i n g a n a ut o ma t i c s e g me n t or To build an automatic segmentor, we could use the following procedure. Label characters based on their correct position and train a recognizer. Apply the trained recognizer at all locations in the HIP image. Collect all candidate characters identified with high confidence by the recognizer. Compute the probability of each combination of candidates (going from left to right), and output the solution string with the highest probability. This is better illustrated with an example. Consider the following HIP (to the right). The trained neural network has these maps (warm colors indicate recognition) that show that K, Y, and so on are correctly identified. However, the maps for 7 and 9 show several false positives. In general, we would get the following color coded map for all the different candidates: HIP K Y B 7 9 With a threshold of 0.5 on the network’s outputs, the map obtained is: We note that there are several false positives for each true positive. The number of false positives per true positive character was found to be between 1 and 4, giving a 1 in C(16,8) = 12,870 to 1 in C(32,8) = 10,518,300 random chance of guessing the correct segmentation for the HIP characters. These numbers can be improved upon by constraining solution strings to flow sequentially from left to right and by restricting overlap. For each combination, we compute a probability by multiplying the 8 probabilities of the classifier for each position. The combination with the highest probability is the one proposed by the classifier. We do not have results for such an automatic segmentor at this time. It is interesting to note that with such a method a classifier that is robust to false positives would do far better than one that is not. This suggests another axis for comparing classifiers. 5 Con clu si on In this paper, we have successfully applied machine learning to the problem of solving HIPs. We have learned that decomposing the HIP problem into segmentation and recognition greatly simplifies analysis. Recognition on even unprocessed images (given segmentation is a solved) can be done automatically using neural networks. Segmentation, on the other hand, is the difficulty differentiator between weaker and stronger HIPs and requires custom intervention for each HIP. We have used this observation to design new HIPs and new tests for machine learning algorithms with the hope of improving them.

We would also like to acknowledge Josh Benaloh and Cem Paya for stimulating discussions on HIP security.

<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, Ben Wellner</p><p>Abstract: Coreference analysis, also known as record linkage or identity uncertainty, is a difﬁcult and important problem in natural language processing, databases, citation matching and many other tasks. This paper introduces several discriminative, conditional-probability models for coreference analysis, all examples of undirected graphical models. Unlike many historical approaches to coreference, the models presented here are relational—they do not assume that pairwise coreference decisions should be made independently from each other. Unlike other relational models of coreference that are generative, the conditional model here can incorporate a great variety of features of the input without having to be concerned about their dependencies—paralleling the advantages of conditional random ﬁelds over hidden Markov models.

<p>Author: Mark Craven, Joseph Bockhorst</p><p>Abstract: Many sequential prediction tasks involve locating instances of patterns in sequences. Generative probabilistic language models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), have been successfully applied to many of these tasks. A limitation of these models however, is that they cannot naturally handle cases in which pattern instances overlap in arbitrary ways. We present an alternative approach, based on conditional Markov networks, that can naturally represent arbitrarily overlapping elements. We show how to eﬃciently train and perform inference with these models. Experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on HMMs. 1</p><p>5 0.57808471 <a title="162-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Syntactic_Patterns_for_Automatic_Hypernym_Discovery.html">101 nips-2004-Learning Syntactic Patterns for Automatic Hypernym Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Rion Snow, Daniel Jurafsky, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Semantic taxonomies such as WordNet provide a rich source of knowledge for natural language processing applications, but are expensive to build, maintain, and extend. Motivated by the problem of automatically constructing and extending such taxonomies, in this paper we present a new algorithm for automatically learning hypernym (is-a) relations from text. Our method generalizes earlier work that had relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify hypernym pairs. Using “dependency path” features extracted from parse trees, we introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns. Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs. On our evaluation task (determining whether two nouns in a news article participate in a hypernym relationship), our automatically extracted database of hypernyms attains both higher precision and higher recall than WordNet. 1</p><p>6 0.53953236 <a title="162-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Co-Training_and_Expansion%3A_Towards_Bridging_Theory_and_Practice.html">37 nips-2004-Co-Training and Expansion: Towards Bridging Theory and Practice</a></p>

<p>Author: Sunita Sarawagi, William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe semi-Markov conditional random ﬁelds (semi-CRFs), a conditionally trained version of semi-Markov chains. Intuitively, a semiCRF on an input sequence x outputs a “segmentation” of x, in which labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x. Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time—often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on ﬁve named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs. 1</p><p>2 0.65122807 <a title="162-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>3 0.64929456 <a title="162-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-A_Probabilistic_Model_for_Online_Document_Clustering_with_Application_to_Novelty_Detection.html">10 nips-2004-A Probabilistic Model for Online Document Clustering with Application to Novelty Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Andrew Emili</p><p>Abstract: Multiple realizations of continuous-valued time series from a stochastic process often contain systematic variations in rate and amplitude. To leverage the information contained in such noisy replicate sets, we need to align them in an appropriate way (for example, to allow the data to be properly combined by adaptive averaging). We present the Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data. 1 A Proﬁle Model for Continuous Data When observing multiple time series generated by a noisy, stochastic process, large systematic sources of variability are often present. For example, within a set of nominally replicate time series, the time axes can be variously shifted, compressed and expanded, in complex, non-linear ways. Additionally, in some circumstances, the scale of the measured data can vary systematically from one replicate to the next, and even within a given replicate. We propose a Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) for simultaneously analyzing a set of such time series. In this model, each time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single latent trace. The latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series. Output time series are generated from this model by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as in an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a particular location in the latent trace, and the emitted value from the state depends on the value of the latent trace at that position. To account for changes in the amplitude of the signals across and within replicates, the latent time states are augmented by a set of scale states, which control how the emission signal will be scaled relative to the value of the latent trace. During training, the latent trace is learned, as well as the transition probabilities controlling the Markovian evolution of the scale and time states and the overall noise level of the observed data. After training, the latent trace learned by the model represents a higher resolution ’fusion’ of the experimental replicates. Figure 1 illustrate the model in action.

The 1 2 N temporal sampling rate within each xk need not be uniform, nor must it be the same across the different xk . Constraints on the variability of the sampling rate are discussed at the end of this section. For notational convenience, we henceforth assume N k = N for all k, but this is not a requirement of the model. The CPM is set up as follows: We assume that there is a latent trace, z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ), a canonical representation of the set of noisy input replicate time series. Any given observed time series in the set is modeled as a non-uniformly subsampled version of the latent trace to which local scale transformations have been applied. Ideally, M would be inﬁnite, or at least very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent trace is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made effectively to speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. The subsampling and local scaling used during the generation of each observed time series are determined by a sequence of hidden state variables. Let the state sequence for observation k be π k . Each state in the state sequence maps to a time state/scale state pair: k πi → {τik , φk }. Time states belong to the integer set (1..M ); scale states belong to an i ordered set (φ1 ..φQ ). (In our experiments we have used Q=7, evenly spaced scales in k logarithmic space). States, πi , and observation values, xk , are related by the emission i k probability distribution: Aπi (xk |z) ≡ p(xk |πi , z, σ, uk ) ≡ N (xk ; zτik φk uk , σ), where σ k i i i i is the noise level of the observed data, N (a; b, c) denotes a Gaussian probability density for a with mean b and standard deviation c. The uk are real-valued scale parameters, one per observed time series, that correct for any overall scale difference between time series k and the latent trace. To fully specify our model we also need to deﬁne the state transition probabilities. We deﬁne the transitions between time states and between scale states separately, so that k Tπi−1 ,πi ≡ p(πi |πi−1 ) = p(φi |φi−1 )pk (τi |τi−1 ). The constraint that time must move forward, cannot stand still, and that it can jump ahead no more than Jτ time states is enforced. (In our experiments we used Jτ = 3.) As well, we only allow scale state transitions between neighbouring scale states so that the local scale cannot jump arbitrarily. These constraints keep the number of legal transitions to a tractable computational size and work well in practice. Each observed time series has its own time transition probability distribution to account for experiment-speciﬁc patterns. Both the time and scale transition probability distributions are given by multinomials:  dk , if a − b = 1  1  k  d2 , if a − b = 2   k . p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = . .  k d , if a − b = J  τ  Jτ  0, otherwise p(φi = a|φi−1  s0 , if D(a, b) = 0   s1 , if D(a, b) = 1 = b) =  s1 , if D(a, b) = −1  0, otherwise where D(a, b) = 1 means that a is one scale state larger than b, and D(a, b) = −1 means that a is one scale state smaller than b, and D(a, b) = 0 means that a = b. The distributions Jτ are constrained by: i=1 dk = 1 and 2s1 + s0 = 1. i Jτ determines the maximum allowable instantaneous speedup of one portion of a time series relative to another portion, within the same series or across different series. However, the length of time for which any series can move so rapidly is constrained by the length of the latent trace; thus the maximum overall ratio in speeds achievable by the model between any two entire time series is given by min(Jτ , M ). N After training, one may examine either the latent trace or the alignment of each observable time series to the latent trace. Such alignments can be achieved by several methods, including use of the Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the highest likelihood path through the hidden states [1], or sampling from the posterior over hidden state sequences. We found Viterbi alignments to work well in the experiments below; samples from the posterior looked quite similar. 3 Training with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm As with HMMs, training with the EM algorithm (often referred to as Baum-Welch in the context of HMMs [1]), is a natural choice. In our model the E-Step is computed exactly using the Forward-Backward algorithm [1], which provides the posterior probability over k states for each time point of every observed time series, γs (i) ≡ p(πi = s|x) and also the pairwise state posteriors, ξs,t (i) ≡ p(πi−1 = s, πi = t|xk ). The algorithm is modiﬁed only in that the emission probabilities depend on the latent trace as described in Section 2. The M-Step consists of a series of analytical updates to the various parameters as detailed below. Given the latent trace (and the emission and state transition probabilities), the complete log likelihood of K observed time series, xk , is given by Lp ≡ L + P. L is the likelihood term arising in a (conditional) HMM model, and can be obtained from the Forward-Backward algorithm. It is composed of the emission and state transition terms. P is the log prior (or penalty term), regularizing various aspects of the model parameters as explained below. These two terms are: K N N L≡ log Aπi (xk |z) + i log p(π1 ) + τ −1 K (zj+1 − zj )2 + P ≡ −λ (1) i=2 i=1 k=1 k log Tπi−1 ,πi j=1 k log D(dk |{ηv }) + log D(sv |{ηv }), v (2) k=1 where p(π1 ) are priors over the initial states. The ﬁrst term in Equation 2 is a smoothing k penalty on the latent trace, with λ controlling the amount of smoothing. ηv and ηv are Dirichlet hyperprior parameters for the time and scale state transition probability distributions respectively. These ensure that all non-zero transition probabilities remain non-zero. k For the time state transitions, v ∈ {1, Jτ } and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for k the parameters d1 , d2 . . . dJτ . For the scale state transitions, v ∈ {0, 1} and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for the parameters s0 and s1 . Letting S be the total number of possible states, that is, the number of elements in the cross-product of possible time states and possible scale states, the expected complete log likelihood is: K S K p k k γs (1) log T0,s</p><p>5 0.64254135 <a title="162-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>6 0.64221418 <a title="162-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Exponential_Family_Harmoniums_with_an_Application_to_Information_Retrieval.html">66 nips-2004-Exponential Family Harmoniums with an Application to Information Retrieval</a></p>

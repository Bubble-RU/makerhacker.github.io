<p>Author: Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: There is growing evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies that the brain utilizes Bayesian principles for inference and decision making. An important open question is how Bayesian inference for arbitrary graphical models can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons. In this paper, we show that recurrent networks of noisy integrate-and-ﬁre neurons can perform approximate Bayesian inference for dynamic and hierarchical graphical models. The membrane potential dynamics of neurons is used to implement belief propagation in the log domain. The spiking probability of a neuron is shown to approximate the posterior probability of the preferred state encoded by the neuron, given past inputs. We illustrate the model using two examples: (1) a motion detection network in which the spiking probability of a direction-selective neuron becomes proportional to the posterior probability of motion in a preferred direction, and (2) a two-level hierarchical network that produces attentional effects similar to those observed in visual cortical areas V2 and V4. The hierarchical model offers a new Bayesian interpretation of attentional modulation in V2 and V4. 1</p><p>3 0.34326535 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_inference_in_spiking_neurons.html">28 nips-2004-Bayesian inference in spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sophie Deneve</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of spiking neurons as Bayesian integrators accumulating evidence over time about events in the external world or the body, and communicating to other neurons their certainties about these events. In this model, spikes signal the occurrence of new information, i.e. what cannot be predicted from the past activity. As a result, ﬁring statistics are close to Poisson, albeit providing a deterministic representation of probabilities. We proceed to develop a theory of Bayesian inference in spiking neural networks, recurrent interactions implementing a variant of belief propagation. Many perceptual and motor tasks performed by the central nervous system are probabilistic, and can be described in a Bayesian framework [4, 3]. A few important but hidden properties, such as direction of motion, or appropriate motor commands, are inferred from many noisy, local and ambiguous sensory cues. These evidences are combined with priors about the sensory world and body. Importantly, because most of these inferences should lead to quick and irreversible decisions in a perpetually changing world, noisy cues have to be integrated on-line, but in a way that takes into account unpredictable events, such as a sudden change in motion direction or the appearance of a new stimulus. This raises the question of how this temporal integration can be performed at the neural level. It has been proposed that single neurons in sensory cortices represent and compute the log probability that a sensory variable takes on a certain value (eg Is visual motion in the neuron’s preferred direction?) [9, 7]. Alternatively, to avoid normalization issues and provide an appropriate signal for decision making, neurons could represent the log probability ratio of a particular hypothesis (eg is motion more likely to be towards the right than towards the left) [7, 6]. Log probabilities are convenient here, since under some assumptions, independent noisy cues simply combine linearly. Moreover, there are physiological evidence for the neural representation of log probabilities and log probability ratios [9, 6, 7]. However, these models assume that neurons represent probabilities in their ﬁring rates. We argue that it is important to study how probabilistic information are encoded in spikes. Indeed, it seems spurious to marry the idea of an exquisite on-line integration of noisy cues with an underlying rate code that requires averaging on large populations of noisy neurons and long periods of time. In particular, most natural tasks require this integration to take place on the time scale of inter-spike intervals. Spikes are more efﬁciently signaling events ∗ Institute of Cognitive Science, 69645 Bron, France than analog quantities. In addition, a neural theory of inference with spikes will bring us closer to the physiological level and generate more easily testable predictions. Thus, we propose a new theory of neural processing in which spike trains provide a deterministic, online representation of a log-probability ratio. Spikes signals events, eg that the log-probability ratio has exceeded what could be predicted from previous spikes. This form of coding was loosely inspired by the idea of ”energy landscape” coding proposed by Hinton and Brown [2]. However, contrary to [2] and other theories using rate-based representation of probabilities, this model is self-consistent and does not require different models for encoding and decoding: As output spikes provide new, unpredictable, temporally independent evidence, they can be used directly as an input to other Bayesian neurons. Finally, we show that these neurons can be used as building blocks in a theory of approximate Bayesian inference in recurrent spiking networks. Connections between neurons implement an underlying Bayesian network, consisting of coupled hidden Markov models. Propagation of spikes is a form of belief propagation in this underlying graphical model. Our theory provides computational explanations of some general physiological properties of cortical neurons, such as spike frequency adaptation, Poisson statistics of spike trains, the existence of strong local inhibition in cortical columns, and the maintenance of a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the debate about temporal versus rate-based neural coding. 1 Spikes and log posterior odds 1.1 Synaptic integration seen as inference in a hidden Markov chain We propose that each neuron codes for an underlying ”hidden” binary variable, xt , whose state evolves over time. We assume that xt depends only on the state at the previous time step, xt−dt , and is conditionally independent of other past states. The state xt can switch 1 from 0 to 1 with a constant rate ron = dt limdt→0 P (xt = 1|xt−dt = 0), and from 1 to 0 with a constant rate roﬀ . For example, these transition rates could represent how often motion in a preferred direction appears the receptive ﬁeld and how long it is likely to stay there. The neuron infers the state of its hidden variable from N noisy synaptic inputs, considered to be observations of the hidden state. In this initial version of the model, we assume that these inputs are conditionally independent homogeneous Poisson processes, synapse i i emitting a spike between time t and t + dt (si = 1) with constant probability qon dt if t i xt = 1, and another constant probability qoﬀ dt if xt = 0. The synaptic spikes are assumed to be otherwise independent of previous synaptic spikes, previous states and spikes at other synapses. The resulting generative model is a hidden Markov chain (ﬁgure 1-A). However, rather than estimating the state of its hidden variable and communicating this estimate to other neurons (for example by emitting a spike when sensory evidence for xt = 1 goes above a threshold) the neuron reports and communicates its certainty that the current state is 1. This certainty takes the form of the log of the ratio of the probability that the hidden state is 1, and the probability that the state is 0, given all the synaptic inputs P (xt =1|s0→t ) received so far: Lt = log P (xt =0|s0→t ) . We use s0→t as a short hand notation for the N synaptic inputs received at present and in the past. We will refer to it as the log odds ratio. Thanks to the conditional independencies assumed in the generative model, we can compute this Log odds ratio iteratively. Taking the limit as dt goes to zero, we get the following differential equation: ˙ L = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + i wi δ(si − 1) − θ t B.

Each synaptic spike (si = 1) gives an impulse to the log t off odds ratio, which is positive if this synapse is more active when the hidden state if 1 (i.e it increases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1), and negative if this synapse is more active when xt = 0 (i.e it decreases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1). The bias, θ, is determined by how informative it is not to receive any spike, e.g. θ = i i i qon − qoﬀ . By convention, we will consider that the ”bias” is positive or zero (if not, we need simply to invert the status of the state x). 1.2 Generation of output spikes The spike train should convey a sparse representation of Lt , so that each spike reports new information about the state xt that is not redundant with that reported by other, preceding, spikes. This proposition is based on three arguments: First, spikes, being metabolically expensive, should be kept to a minimum. Second, spikes conveying redundant information would require a decoding of the entire spike train, whereas independent spike can be taken into account individually. And ﬁnally, we seek a self consistent model, with the spiking output having a similar semantics to its spiking input. To maximize the independence of the spikes (conditioned on xt ), we propose that the neuron ﬁres only when the difference between its log odds ratio Lt and a prediction Gt of this log odds ratio based on the output spikes emitted so far reaches a certain threshold. Indeed, supposing that downstream elements predicts Lt as best as they can, the neuron only needs to ﬁre when it expects that prediction to be too inaccurate (ﬁgure 1-B). In practice, this will happen when the neuron receives new evidence for xt = 1. Gt should thereby follow the same dynamics as Lt when spikes are not received. The equation for Gt and the output Ot (Ot = 1 when an output spike is ﬁred) are given by: ˙ G = Ot = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + go δ(Ot − 1) go 1. when Lt > Gt + , 0 otherwise, 2 (1) (2) Here go , a positive constant, is the only free parameter, the other parameters being constrained by the statistics of the synaptic input. 1.3 Results Figure 1-C plots a typical trial, showing the behavior of L, G and O before, during and after presentation of the stimulus. As random synaptic inputs are integrated, L ﬂuctuates and eventually exceeds G + 0.5, leading to an output spike. Immediately after a spike, G jumps to G + go , which prevents (except in very rare cases) a second spike from immediately following the ﬁrst. Thus, this ”jump” implements a relative refractory period. However, ron G decays as it tends to converge back to its stable level gstable = log roff . Thus L eventually exceeds G again, leading to a new spike. This threshold crossing happens more often during stimulation (xt = 1) as the net synaptic input alters to create a higher overall level of certainty, Lt . Mean Log odds ratio and output ﬁring rate ¯ The mean ﬁring rate Ot of the Bayesian neuron during presentation of its preferred stimulus (i.e. when xt switches from 0 to 1 and back to 0) is plotted in ﬁgure 1-D, together with the ¯ mean log posterior ratio Lt , both averaged over trials. Not surprisingly, the log-posterior ratio reﬂects the leaky integration of synaptic evidence, with an effective time constant that depends on the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ . If the state is very stable (ron = roﬀ ∼ 0), synaptic evidence is integrated over almost inﬁnite time periods, the mean log posterior ratio tending to either increase or decrease linearly with time. In the example in ﬁgure 1D, the state is less stable, so ”old” synaptic evidence are discounted and Lt saturates. ¯ In contrast, the mean output ﬁring rate Ot tracks the state of xt almost perfectly. This is because, as a form of predictive coding, the output spikes reﬂect the new synaptic i evidence, It = i δ(st − 1) − θ, rather than the log posterior ratio itself. In particular, the mean output ﬁring rate is a rectiﬁed linear function of the mean input, e. g. + ¯ ¯ wi q i −θ . O= 1I= go i on(oﬀ) Analogy with a leaky integrate and ﬁre neuron We can get an interesting insight into the computation performed by this neuron by linearizing L and G around their mean levels over trials. Here we reduce the analysis to prolonged, statistically stable periods when the state is constant (either ON or OFF). In this case, the ¯ ¯ mean level of certainty L and its output prediction G are also constant over time. We make the rough approximation that the post spike jump, go , and the input ﬂuctuations are small ¯ compared to the mean level of certainty L.

The membrane potential Vt integrates its input, Jt = It − ∆go , with a leak kL . The neuron ﬁres when its membrane potential reaches a constant threshold go . After ¯ each spikes, Vt is reset to 0. Interestingly, for appropriately chosen compression factor go , the mean input to the lin¯ ¯ earized neuron J = I − ∆go ≈ 0 1 . This means that the membrane potential is purely driven to its threshold by input ﬂuctuations, or a random walk in membrane potential. As a consequence, the neuron’s ﬁring will be memoryless, and close to a Poisson process. In particular, we found Fano factor close to 1 and quasi-exponential ISI distribution (ﬁgure 1E) on the entire range of parameters tested. Indeed, LIF neurons with balanced inputs have been proposed as a model to reproduce the statistics of real cortical neurons [8]. This balance is implemented in our model by the neuron’s effective self-inhibition, even when the synaptic input itself is not balanced. Decoding As we previously said, downstream elements could predict the log odds ratio Lt by computing Gt from the output spikes (Eq 1, ﬁg 1-B). Of course, this requires an estimate of the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ , that could be learned from the observed spike trains. However, we show next that explicit decoding is not necessary to perform bayesian inference in spiking networks. Intuitively, this is because the quantity that our model neurons receive and transmit, eg new information, is exactly what probabilistic inference algorithm propagate between connected statistical elements. 1 ¯ Even if go is not chosen optimally, the inﬂuence of the drift J is usually negligible compared to the large ﬂuctuations in membrane potential. 2 Bayesian inference in cortical networks The model neurons, having the same input and output semantics, can be used as building blocks to implement more complex generative models consisting of coupled Markov chains. Consider, for example, the example in ﬁgure 2-A. Here, a ”parent” variable x1 t (the presence of a tiger) can cause the state of n other ”children” variables ([xk ]k=2...n ), t of whom two are represented (the presence of stripes,x2 , and motion, x3 ). The ”chilt t dren” variables are Bayesian neurons identical to those described previously. The resulting bayesian network consist of n + 1 coupled hidden Markov chains. Inference in this architecture corresponds to computing the log posterior odds ratio for the tiger, x1 , and the log t posterior of observing stripes or motion, ([xk ]k=2...n ), given the synaptic inputs received t by the entire network so far, i.e. s2 , . . . , sk . 0→t 0→t Unfortunately, inference and learning in this network (and in general in coupled Markov chains) requires very expensive computations, and cannot be performed by simply propagating messages over time and among the variable nodes. In particular, the state of a child k variable xt depends on xk , sk , x1 and the state of all other children at the previous t t t−dt time step, [xj ]2</p><p>4 0.30576545 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Reducing_Spike_Train_Variability%3A_A_Computational_Theory_Of_Spike-Timing_Dependent_Plasticity.html">153 nips-2004-Reducing Spike Train Variability: A Computational Theory Of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron’s variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron’s output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic eﬃcacy increases. We compare our account to other eﬀorts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation. 1</p><p>5 0.29894367 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Rate-_and_Phase-coded_Autoassociative_Memory.html">151 nips-2004-Rate- and Phase-coded Autoassociative Memory</a></p>
<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Areas of the brain involved in various forms of memory exhibit patterns of neural activity quite unlike those in canonical computational models. We show how to use well-founded Bayesian probabilistic autoassociative recall to derive biologically reasonable neuronal dynamics in recurrently coupled models, together with appropriate values for parameters such as the membrane time constant and inhibition. We explicitly treat two cases. One arises from a standard Hebbian learning rule, and involves activity patterns that are coded by graded ﬁring rates. The other arises from a spike timing dependent learning rule, and involves patterns coded by the phase of spike times relative to a coherent local ﬁeld potential oscillation. Our model offers a new and more complete understanding of how neural dynamics may support autoassociation. 1</p><p>6 0.28506726 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Marcelo A. Montemurro, Stefano Panzeri</p><p>Abstract: A typical neuron in visual cortex receives most inputs from other cortical neurons with a roughly similar stimulus preference. Does this arrangement of inputs allow efﬁcient readout of sensory information by the target cortical neuron? We address this issue by using simple modelling of neuronal population activity and information theoretic tools. We ﬁnd that efﬁcient synaptic information transmission requires that the tuning curve of the afferent neurons is approximately as wide as the spread of stimulus preferences of the afferent neurons reaching the target neuron. By meta analysis of neurophysiological data we found that this is the case for cortico-cortical inputs to neurons in visual cortex. We suggest that the organization of V1 cortico-cortical synaptic inputs allows optimal information transmission. 1</p><p>2 0.86122727 <a title="140-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Bayesian_Inference_in_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">76 nips-2004-Hierarchical Bayesian Inference in Networks of Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: There is growing evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies that the brain utilizes Bayesian principles for inference and decision making. An important open question is how Bayesian inference for arbitrary graphical models can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons. In this paper, we show that recurrent networks of noisy integrate-and-ﬁre neurons can perform approximate Bayesian inference for dynamic and hierarchical graphical models. The membrane potential dynamics of neurons is used to implement belief propagation in the log domain. The spiking probability of a neuron is shown to approximate the posterior probability of the preferred state encoded by the neuron, given past inputs. We illustrate the model using two examples: (1) a motion detection network in which the spiking probability of a direction-selective neuron becomes proportional to the posterior probability of motion in a preferred direction, and (2) a two-level hierarchical network that produces attentional effects similar to those observed in visual cortical areas V2 and V4. The hierarchical model offers a new Bayesian interpretation of attentional modulation in V2 and V4. 1</p><p>3 0.74048287 <a title="140-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: R. J. Vogelstein, Udayan Mallik, Eugenio Culurciello, Gert Cauwenberghs, Ralph Etienne-Cummings</p><p>Abstract: We have constructed a system that uses an array of 9,600 spiking silicon neurons, a fast microcontroller, and digital memory, to implement a reconﬁgurable network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons. The system is designed for rapid prototyping of spiking neural networks that require high-throughput communication with external address-event hardware. Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to speciﬁc internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective ﬁeld mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by conﬁguring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience. 1</p><p>4 0.73542368 <a title="140-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Reducing_Spike_Train_Variability%3A_A_Computational_Theory_Of_Spike-Timing_Dependent_Plasticity.html">153 nips-2004-Reducing Spike Train Variability: A Computational Theory Of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron’s variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron’s output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic eﬃcacy increases. We compare our account to other eﬀorts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation. 1</p><p>5 0.71950585 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Theory_of_localized_synfire_chain%3A_characteristic_propagation_speed_of_stable_spike_pattern.html">194 nips-2004-Theory of localized synfire chain: characteristic propagation speed of stable spike pattern</a></p>
<p>Author: Kosuke Hamaguchi, Masato Okada, Kazuyuki Aihara</p><p>Abstract: Repeated spike patterns have often been taken as evidence for the synﬁre chain, a phenomenon that a stable spike synchrony propagates through a feedforward network. Inter-spike intervals which represent a repeated spike pattern are inﬂuenced by the propagation speed of a spike packet. However, the relation between the propagation speed and network structure is not well understood. While it is apparent that the propagation speed depends on the excitatory synapse strength, it might also be related to spike patterns. We analyze a feedforward network with Mexican-Hattype connectivity (FMH) using the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that both a uniform and a localized spike packet are stable in the FMH in a certain parameter region. We also demonstrate that the propagation speed depends on the distinct ﬁring patterns in the same network.</p><p>6 0.67937928 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_inference_in_spiking_neurons.html">28 nips-2004-Bayesian inference in spiking neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>3 0.6766963 <a title="140-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-New_Criteria_and_a_New_Algorithm_for_Learning_in_Multi-Agent_Systems.html">129 nips-2004-New Criteria and a New Algorithm for Learning in Multi-Agent Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Powers, Yoav Shoham</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new set of criteria for learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, one that is more stringent and (we argue) better justiﬁed than previous proposed criteria. Our criteria, which apply most straightforwardly in repeated games with average rewards, consist of three requirements: (a) against a speciﬁed class of opponents (this class is a parameter of the criterion) the algorithm yield a payoff that approaches the payoff of the best response, (b) against other opponents the algorithm’s payoff at least approach (and possibly exceed) the security level payoff (or maximin value), and (c) subject to these requirements, the algorithm achieve a close to optimal payoff in self-play. We furthermore require that these average payoffs be achieved quickly. We then present a novel algorithm, and show that it meets these new criteria for a particular parameter class, the class of stationary opponents. Finally, we show that the algorithm is effective not only in theory, but also empirically. Using a recently introduced comprehensive game theoretic test suite, we show that the algorithm almost universally outperforms previous learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.67312777 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Alternative_Splicing_Events_in_Microarray_Data.html">149 nips-2004-Probabilistic Inference of Alternative Splicing Events in Microarray Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Shai, Brendan J. Frey, Quaid D. Morris, Qun Pan, Christine Misquitta, Benjamin J. Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS. Boxes represent exons and lines represent introns, with the possible splicing alternatives indicated by the connectors. (a) Single cassette exon inclusion/exclusion. C1 and C2 are constitutive exons (exons that are included in all isoforms) and ﬂank a single alternative exon (A). The alternative exon is included in one isoform and excluded in the other. (b) Alternative 3’ (or donor) and alternative 5’ (acceptor) splicing sites. Both exons are constitutive, but may contain alternative donor and/or acceptor splicing sites. (c) Mutually exclusive exons. One of the two alternative exons (A1 and A2 ) may be included in the isoform, but not both. (d) Intron inclusion. An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(a) The data does not follow our notion of single cassette exon AS, but the AS level is predicted accurately by the model.(b) The probe C1 :A is marked as outlier, allowing the model to predict the other probes accurately. (c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

The sample is pulled through a viscous gel in an electric ﬁeld (DNA, being an acid, is positively charged). Shorter strands travel further through the gel than longer ones, resulting in two distinct bands, corresponding to the two isoforms, when exposed to a photosensitive or x-ray ﬁlm.

The AS model presented assumes a single weight matrix for all data cases. This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

<p>Author: Kosuke Hamaguchi, Masato Okada, Kazuyuki Aihara</p><p>Abstract: Repeated spike patterns have often been taken as evidence for the synﬁre chain, a phenomenon that a stable spike synchrony propagates through a feedforward network. Inter-spike intervals which represent a repeated spike pattern are inﬂuenced by the propagation speed of a spike packet. However, the relation between the propagation speed and network structure is not well understood. While it is apparent that the propagation speed depends on the excitatory synapse strength, it might also be related to spike patterns. We analyze a feedforward network with Mexican-Hattype connectivity (FMH) using the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that both a uniform and a localized spike packet are stable in the FMH in a certain parameter region. We also demonstrate that the propagation speed depends on the distinct ﬁring patterns in the same network.</p><p>6 0.49923706 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Computation_in_Spiking_Populations.html">148 nips-2004-Probabilistic Computation in Spiking Populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik, Fernando Pereira, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Embedding algorithms search for low dimensional structure in complex data, but most algorithms only handle objects of a single type for which pairwise distances are speciﬁed. This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semideﬁnite matrices. The local structure of our embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space. We quantify the performance of our method on two text datasets, and show that it consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms standard methods of statistical correspondence modeling, such as multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.17905928 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Parametric_Embedding_for_Class_Visualization.html">145 nips-2004-Parametric Embedding for Class Visualization</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomoharu Iwata, Kazumi Saito, Naonori Ueda, Sean Stromsten, Thomas L. Griffiths, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method, Parametric Embedding (PE), for visualizing the posteriors estimated over a mixture model. PE simultaneously embeds both objects and their classes in a low-dimensional space. PE takes as input a set of class posterior vectors for given data points, and tries to preserve the posterior structure in an embedding space by minimizing a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, under the assumption that samples are generated by a Gaussian mixture with equal covariances in the embedding space. PE has many potential uses depending on the source of the input data, providing insight into the classiﬁer’s behavior in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The PE algorithm has a computational advantage over conventional embedding methods based on pairwise object relations since its complexity scales with the product of the number of objects and the number of classes. We demonstrate PE by visualizing supervised categorization of web pages, semi-supervised categorization of digits, and the relations of words and latent topics found by an unsupervised algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 1</p><p>4 0.12393607 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Neighbourhood_Components_Analysis.html">127 nips-2004-Neighbourhood Components Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel method for learning a Mahalanobis distance measure to be used in the KNN classiﬁcation algorithm. The algorithm directly maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set. It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be used for data visualization and fast classiﬁcation. Unlike other methods, our classiﬁcation model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction. 1</p><p>5 0.11896978 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Object_Classification_from_a_Single_Example_Utilizing_Class_Relevance_Metrics.html">134 nips-2004-Object Classification from a Single Example Utilizing Class Relevance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Fink</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for learning an object classiﬁer from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overﬁtting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classiﬁer could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, deﬁne a nearest neighbor classiﬁer where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>6 0.11706271 <a title="125-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Dimension.html">114 nips-2004-Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension</a></p>

<p>Author: Nuttapong Chentanez, Andrew G. Barto, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists call behavior intrinsically motivated when it is engaged in for its own sake rather than as a step toward solving a speciﬁc problem of clear practical value. But what we learn during intrinsically motivated behavior is essential for our development as competent autonomous entities able to efﬁciently solve a wide range of practical problems as they arise. In this paper we present initial results from a computational study of intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning aimed at allowing artiﬁcial agents to construct and extend hierarchies of reusable skills that are needed for competent autonomy. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7455228 <a title="125-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Relational_Embedding.html">125 nips-2004-Multiple Relational Embedding</a></p>

In this paper we examine a decision tree based on dyadic splits that adapts to each of these conditions to achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence. The proposed classiﬁer is the ﬁrst known to achieve these optimal rates while being practical and implementable. 1</p><p>4 0.65058947 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Probabilistic_Curve_Clustering_and_Alignment.html">90 nips-2004-Joint Probabilistic Curve Clustering and Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott J. Gaffney, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a ﬁxed-dimensional featurevector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.</p><p>5 0.64630306 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>6 0.64554888 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Spike_Sorting%3A_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Non-Stationary_Data.html">174 nips-2004-Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Steyvers, David M. Blei, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to language learning typically focus on either short-range syntactic dependencies or long-range semantic dependencies between words. We present a generative model that uses both kinds of dependencies, and can be used to simultaneously ﬁnd syntactic classes and semantic topics despite having no representation of syntax or semantics beyond statistical dependency. This model is competitive on tasks like part-of-speech tagging and document classiﬁcation with models that exclusively use short- and long-range dependencies respectively. 1</p><p>3 0.15071155 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Sharing_Clusters_among_Related_Groups%3A_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes.html">169 nips-2004-Sharing Clusters among Related Groups: Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Michael I. Jordan, Matthew J. Beal, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We propose the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), a nonparametric Bayesian model for clustering problems involving multiple groups of data. Each group of data is modeled with a mixture, with the number of components being open-ended and inferred automatically by the model. Further, components can be shared across groups, allowing dependencies across groups to be modeled effectively as well as conferring generalization to new groups. Such grouped clustering problems occur often in practice, e.g. in the problem of topic discovery in document corpora. We report experimental results on three text corpora showing the effective and superior performance of the HDP over previous models.</p><p>4 0.13108149 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Euclidean_Embedding_of_Co-Occurrence_Data.html">62 nips-2004-Euclidean Embedding of Co-Occurrence Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik, Fernando Pereira, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Embedding algorithms search for low dimensional structure in complex data, but most algorithms only handle objects of a single type for which pairwise distances are speciﬁed. This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semideﬁnite matrices. The local structure of our embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space. We quantify the performance of our method on two text datasets, and show that it consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms standard methods of statistical correspondence modeling, such as multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.12378205 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Maximum_Margin_Clustering.html">115 nips-2004-Maximum Margin Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Linli Xu, James Neufeld, Bryce Larson, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for clustering based on ﬁnding maximum margin hyperplanes through data. By reformulating the problem in terms of the implied equivalence relation matrix, we can pose the problem as a convex integer program. Although this still yields a difﬁcult computational problem, the hard-clustering constraints can be relaxed to a soft-clustering formulation which can be feasibly solved with a semidefinite program. Since our clustering technique only depends on the data through the kernel matrix, we can easily achieve nonlinear clusterings in the same manner as spectral clustering. Experimental results show that our maximum margin clustering technique often obtains more accurate results than conventional clustering methods. The real beneﬁt of our approach, however, is that it leads naturally to a semi-supervised training method for support vector machines. By maximizing the margin simultaneously on labeled and unlabeled training data, we achieve state of the art performance by using a single, integrated learning principle. 1</p><p>6 0.1216853 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Information_Regularization_on_Graphs.html">54 nips-2004-Distributed Information Regularization on Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, Yee W. Teh, Roger Bock, Michael Maire, Grace Vesom, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method that can make a scanned, handwritten mediaeval latin manuscript accessible to full text search. A generalized HMM is ﬁtted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data. 1. Intoduction There are many large corpora of handwritten scanned documents, and their number is growing rapidly. Collections range from the complete works of Mark Twain to thousands of pages of zoological notes spanning two centuries. Large scale analyses of such corpora is currently very difﬁcult, because handwriting recognition works poorly. Recently, Rath and Manmatha have demonstrated that one can use small bodies of aligned material as supervised data to train a word spotting mechanism [7]. The result can make scanned handwritten documents searchable. Current techniques assume a closed vocabulary — one can search only for words in the training set — and search for instances of whole words. This approach is particularly unattractive for an inﬂected language, because individual words can take so many forms that one is unlikely to see all in the training set. Furthermore, one would like the method used to require very little aligned training data, so that it is possible to process documents written by different scribes with little overhead. Mediaeval Latin manuscripts are a natural ﬁrst corpus for studying this problem, because there are many scanned manuscripts and because the handwriting is relatively regular. We expect the primary user need to be search over a large body of documents — to allow comparisons between documents — rather than transcription of a particular document (which is usually relatively easy to do by hand). Desirable features for a system are: First, that it use little or no aligned training data (an ideal, which we believe may be attainable, is an unsupervised learning system). Second, that one can search the document for an arbitrary string (rather than, say, only complete words that appear in the training data). This would allow a user to determine whether a document contains curious or distinctive spellings, for example (ﬁgure 7). We show that, using a statistical model based on a generalized HMM, we can search a medieval manuscript with considerable accuracy, using only one instance each of each letter in the manuscript to train the method (22 instances in total; Latin has no j, k, w, or z). Furthermore, our method allows fairly accurate transcription of the manuscript. We train our system on 22 glyphs taken from a a 12th century latin manuscript of Terence’s Comedies (obtained from a repository of over 80 scanned medieval works maintained by Oxford University [1]). We evaluate searches using a considerable portion of this manuscript aligned by hand; we then show that fair search results are available on a different manuscript (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]) without change of letter templates. 1.1. Previous Work Handwriting recognition is a traditional problem, too well studied to review in detail here (see [6]). Typically, online handwriting recognition (where strokes can be recorded) works better than ofﬂine handwriting recognition. Handwritten digits can now be recognized with high accuracy [2, 5]. Handwritten amounts can be read with fair accuracy, which is signiﬁcantly improved if one segments the amount into digits at the same time as one recognizes it [4, 5]. Recently several authors have proposed new techniques for search and translation in this unrestricted setting. Manmatha et al [7] introduce the technique of “word spotting,” which segments text into word images, rectiﬁes the word images, and then uses an aligned training set to learn correspondences between rectiﬁed word images and strings. The method is not suitable for a heavily inﬂected language, because words take so many forms. In an inﬂected language, the natural unit to match to is a subset of a word, rather than a whole word, implying that one should segment the text into blocks — which may be smaller than words — while recognizing. Vinciarelli et al [8] introduce a method for line by line recognition based around an HMM and quite similar to techniques used in the speech recognition community. Their method uses a window that slides along the text to obtain features; this has the difﬁculty that the same window is in some places too small (and so uninformative) and in others too big (and so spans more than one letter, and is confusing). Their method requires a substantial body of aligned training data, which makes it impractical for our applications. Close in spirit to our work is the approach to machine translation of Koehn and Knight [3]. They demonstrate that the statistics of unaligned corpora may provide as powerful constraints for training models as aligned bitexts. 2. The Model Our models for both search and transcription are based on the generalized HMM and differ only in their choice of transition model. In an HMM, each hidden node ct emits a single evidence node xt . In a generalized HMM, we allow each ct to emit a series of x’s whose length is itself a random variable. In our model, the hidden nodes correspond to letters and each xt is a single column of pixels. Allowing letters to emit sets of columns lets us accomodate letter templates of variable width. In particular, this means that we can unify segmenting ink into letters and recognizing blocks of ink; ﬁgure 3 shows an example of how useful this is. 2.1. Generating a line of text Our hidden state consists of a character label c, width w and vertical position y. The statespace of c contains the characters ‘a’-‘z’, a space ‘ ’, and a special end state Ω. Let T c be the template associated with character c, Tch , Tcw be respectively the height and width of that template, and m be the height of the image. Figure 1: Left, a full page of our manuscript, a 12’th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies obtained from [1]. Top right, a set of lines from a page from that document and bottom right, some words in higher resolution. Note: (a) the richness of page layout; (b) the clear spacing of the lines; (c) the relatively regular handwriting. Figure 2: Left, the 22 instances, one per letter, used to train our emission model. These templates are extracted by hand from the Terence document. Right, the ﬁve image channels for a single letter. Beginning at image column 1 (and assuming a dummy space before the ﬁrst character), • • • • choose character c ∼ p(c|c−1...−n ) (an n-gram letter model) choose length w ∼ Uniform(Tcw − k, Tcw + k) (for some small k) choose vertical position y ∼ Uniform(1, m − Tch ) z,y and Tch now deﬁne a bounding box b of pixels. Let i and j be indexed from the top left of that bounding box. – draw pixel (i, j) ∼ N (Tcij , σcij ) for each pixel in b – draw all pixels above and below b from background gaussian N (µ0 , σ0 ) (See 2.2 for greater detail on pixel emission model) • move to column w + 1 and repeat until we enter the end state Ω. Inference on a gHMM is a relatively straighforward business of dynamic programming. We have used unigram, bigram and trigram models, with each transition model ﬁtted using an electronic version of Caesar’s Gallic Wars, obtained from http://www.thelatinlibrary.com. We do not believe that the choice of author should signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁtted transition model — which is at the level of characters — but have not experimented with this point. The important matter is the emission model. 2.2. The Emission Model Our emission model is as follows: Given the character c and width w, we generate a template of the required length. Each pixel in this template becomes the mean of a gaussian which generates the corresponding pixel in the image. This template has a separate mean image for each pixel channel. The channels are assumed independent given the means. We train the model by cutting out by hand a single instance of each letter from our corpus (ﬁgure 2). This forms the central portion of the template. Pixels above and below this Model Perfect transcription unigram bigram trigram matching chars 21019 14603 15572 15788 substitutions 0 5487 4597 4410 insertions 0 534 541 507 deletions 0 773 718 695 Table 1: Edit distance between our transcribed Terence and the editor’s version. Note the trigram model produces signiﬁcantly fewer letter errors than the unigram model, but that the error rate is still a substantial 25%. central box are generated from a single gaussian used to model background pixels (basically white pixels). We add a third variable yt to our hidden state indicating the vertical position of the central box. However, since we are uninterested in actually recovering this variable, during inference we sum it out of the model. The width of a character is constrained to be close to the width (tw ) of our hand cut example by setting p(w|c) = 0 for w < tw − k and w > tw + k. Here k is a small, user deﬁned integer. Within this range, p(w|c) is distributed uniformly, larger templates are created by appending pixels from the background model to the template and smaller ones by simply removing the right k-most columns of the hand cut example. For features, we generate ﬁve image representations, shown in ﬁgure 2. The ﬁrst is a grayscale version of the original color image. The second and third are generated by convolving the grayscale image with a vertical derivative of gaussian ﬁlter, separating the positive and negative components of this response, and smoothing each of these gradient images separately. The fourth and ﬁfth are generated similarly but with a horizontal derivative of gaussian ﬁlter. We have experimented with different weightings of these 5 channels. In practice we use the gray scale channel and the horizontal gradient channels. We emphasize the horizontal pieces since these seem the more discriminative. 2.3. Transcription For transcription, we model letters as coming from an n-gram language model, with no dependencies between words. Thus, the probability of a letter depends on the k letters before it, where k = n unless this would cross a word boundary in which case the history terminates at this boundary. We chose not to model word to word transition probabilities since, unlike in English, word order in Latin is highly arbitrary. This transition model is ﬁt from a corpus of ascii encoded latin. We have experimented with unigram (i.e. uniform transition probabilities), bigram and trigram letter models. We can perform transcription by ﬁtting the maximum likelihood path through any given line. Some results of this technique are shown in ﬁgure 3. 2.4. Search For search, we rank lines by the probability that they contain our search word. We set up a ﬁnite state machine like that in ﬁgure 4. In this ﬁgure, ‘bg’ represents our background model for that portion of the line not generated by our search word. We can use any of the n-gram letter models described for transcription as the transition model for ‘bg’. The probability that the line contains the search word is the probability that this FSM takes path 1. We use this FSM as the transition model for our gHMM, and output the posterior probability of the two arrows leading into the end state. 1 and 2 are user deﬁned weights, but in practice the algorithm does not appear to be particular sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The results presented here use the unigram model.

Results Figure 1 shows a page from our collection. This is a scanned 12th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies, obtained from the collection at [1]. In preprocessing, we extract individual lines of text by rotating the image to various degrees and projecting the sum of the pixel values onto the y-axis. We choose the orientation whose projection vector has the lowest entropy, and then segment lines by cutting at minima of this projection. Transcription is not our primary task, but methods that produce good transcriptions are going to support good searches. The gHMM can produce a surprisingly good transcription, given how little training data is used to train the emission model. We aligned an editors version of Terence with 25 pages from the manuscript by hand, and computed the edit distance between the transcribed text and the aligned text; as table 1 indicates, approximately 75% of letters are read correctly. Search results are strong. We show results for two documents. The ﬁrst set of results refers to the edition of Terence’s Comedies, from which we took the 22 letter instances. In particular, for any given search term, our process ranks the complete set of lines. We used a hand alignment of the manuscript to determine which lines contained each term; ﬁgure 5 shows an overview of searches performed using every word that appears in the 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 5: Our search ranks 587 manuscript lines, with higher ranking lines more likely to contain the relevant term. This ﬁgure shows complete search results for each term that appears more than three times in the 587 lines. Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. All 587 lines are represented. More common terms are represented by lower rows. More detailed results appear in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6; this summary ﬁgure suggests almost all searches are highly successful. document more than three times, in particular, showing which of the ranked set of lines actually contained the search term. For almost every search, the term appears mainly in the lines with higher rank. Figure 6 contains more detailed information for a smaller set of words. We do not score the position of a word in a line (for practical reasons). Figure 7 demonstrates (a) that our search respects the ink of the document and (b) that for the Terence document, word positions are accurately estimated. The spelling of mediaeval documents is typically cleaned up by editors; in our manuscript, the scribe reliably spells “michi” for the standard “mihi”. A search on “michi” produces many instances; a search on “mihi” produces none, because the ink doesn’t have any. Notice this phenomenon also in the bottom right line of ﬁgure 7, the scribe writes “habet, ut consumat nunc cum nichil obsint doli” and the editor gives “habet, ut consumat nunc quom nil obsint doli.” Figure 8 shows that searches on short strings produce many words containing that string as one would wish. 4. Discussion We have shown that it is possible to make at least some handwritten mediaeval manuscripts accessible to full text search, without requiring an aligned text or much supervisory data. Our documents have very regular letters, and letter frequencies — which can be obtained from transcribed Latin — appear to provide so powerful a cue that relatively little detailed information about letter shapes is required. Linking letter segmentation and recognition has thoroughly beneﬁcial effects. This suggests that the pool of manuscripts that can be made accessible in this way is large. In particular, we have used our method, trained on 22 instances of letters from one document, to search another document. Figure 9 shows the results from two searches of our second document (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]). No information from this document was used in training at all; but letter 1tu arbitror pater etiam nisi factum primum siet vero illi inter hic michi ibi qui tu ibi michi 0.9 0.8 0.7 qui hic 0.6 inter 0.5 illi 0.4 siet 0.3 vero 0.2 nisi 0.1 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 6: On the left, search results for selected words (indicated on the leftmost column). Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. Note only the top 300 results are represented, and that lines containing the search term are almost always at or close to the top of the search results (black marks to the left). On the right, we plot precision against recall for a set of different words by taking the top 10, 20, ... lines returned from the search, and checking them against the aligned manuscript. Note that, once all cases have been found, if the size of the pool is increased the precision will fall with 100% recall; many words work well, with most of the ﬁrst 20 or so lines returned containing the search term. shapes are sufﬁciently well shared that the search is still useful. All this suggests that one might be able to use EM to link three processes: one that clusters to determine letter shapes; one that segments letters; and one that imposes a language model. Such a system might be able to make handwritten Latin searchable with no training data. References [1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.

<p>Author: Scott J. Gaffney, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a ﬁxed-dimensional featurevector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.</p><p>6 0.45687598 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Clustering_of_a_Mixture_Model.html">77 nips-2004-Hierarchical Clustering of a Mixture Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael D. Colagrosso, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Theories of access consciousness address how it is that some mental states but not others are available for evaluation, choice behavior, and verbal report. Farah, O’Reilly, and Vecera (1994) argue that quality of representation is critical; Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeux (2003) argue that the ability to communicate representations is critical. We present a probabilistic information transmission or PIT model that suggests both of these conditions are essential for access consciousness. Having successfully modeled data from the repetition priming literature in the past, we use the PIT model to account for data from two experiments on subliminal priming, showing that the model produces priming even in the absence of accessibility and reportability of internal states. The model provides a mechanistic basis for understanding the dissociation of priming and awareness. Philosophy has made many attempts to identify distinct aspects of consciousness. Perhaps the most famous effort is Block’s (1995) delineation of phenomenal and access consciousness. Phenomenal consciousness has to do with “what it is like” to experience chocolate or a pin prick. Access consciousness refers to internal states whose content is “(1) inferentially promiscuous, i.e., poised to be used as a premise in reasoning, (2) poised for control of action, and (3) poised for rational control of speech.” (p. 230) The scientiﬁc study of consciousness has exploded in the past six years, and an important catalyst for this explosion has been the decision to focus on the problem of access consciousness: how is it that some mental states but not others become available for evaluation, choice behavior, verbal report, and storage in working memory. Another reason for the recent explosion of consciousness research is the availability of functional imaging techniques to explore differences in brain activation between conscious and unconscious states, as well as the development of clever psychological experiments that show that a stimulus that is not consciously perceived can nonetheless inﬂuence cognition, which we describe shortly. 1 Subliminal Priming The phenomena we address utilize an experimental paradigm known as repetition priming. Priming refers to an improvement in efﬁciency in processing a stimulus item as a result of previous exposure to the item. Efﬁciency is deﬁned in terms of shorter response times, lower error rates, or both. A typical long-term perceptual priming experiment consists of a study phase during which participants are asked to read aloud a list of words, and a test phase during which participants must name or categorize a series of words, presented one at a time. Reaction time is lower and/or accuracy is higher for test words that were also on the study list. Repetition priming occurs without strategic effort on the part of participants, and therefore appears to be a low level mechanism of learning, which likely serves as the mechanism underlying the reﬁnement of cognitive skills with practice. In traditional studies, priming is supraliminal—the prime is consciously perceived. In the studies we model here, primes are subliminal. Subliminal priming addresses fundamental issues concerning conscious access: How is it that a word or image that cannot be identiﬁed, detected, or even discriminated in forced choice can nonetheless inﬂuence the processing of a subsequent stimulus word? Answering this question in a computational framework would be a signiﬁcant advance toward understanding the nature of access consciousness. 2 Models of Conscious and Unconscious Processing In contrast to the wealth of experimental data, and the large number of speculative and philosophical papers on consciousness, concrete computational models are rare. The domain of consciousness is particularly ripe for theoretical perspectives, because it is a signiﬁcant contribution to simply provide an existence proof of a mechanism that can explain speciﬁc experimental data. Ordinarily, a theorist faces skepticism when presenting a model; it often seems that hundreds of alternative, equally plausible accounts must exist. However, when addressing data deemed central to issues of consciousness, simply providing a concrete handle on the phenomena serves to demystify consciousness and bring it into the realm of scientiﬁc understanding. We are familiar with only three computational models that address speciﬁc experimental data in the domain of consciousness. We summarize these models, and then present a novel model and describe its relationship to the previous efforts. Farah, O’Reilly, and Vecera (1994) were the ﬁrst to model speciﬁc phenomena pertaining to consciousness in a computational framework. The phenomena involve prosopagnosia, a deﬁcit of overt face recognition following brain damage. Nonetheless, prosopagnosia patients exhibit residual covert recognition by a variety of tests. For example, when patients are asked to categorize names as famous or nonfamous, their response times are faster to a famous name when the name is primed by a picture of a semantically related face (e.g., the name “Bill Clinton” when preceded by a photograph of Hillary), despite the fact that they could not identify the related face. Farah et al. model face recognition in a neural network, and show that when the network is damaged, it loses the ability to perform tasks requiring high ﬁdelity representations (e.g., identiﬁcation) but not tasks requiring only coarse information (e.g., semantic priming). They argue that conscious perception is associated with a certain minimal quality of representation. Dehaene and Naccache (2001) outline a framework based on Baars’ (1989) notion of conscious states as residing in a global workspace. They describe the workspace as a “distributed neural system...with long-distance connectivity that can potentially interconnect multiple specialized brain areas in a coordinated, though variable manner.” (p. 13) Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeaux (2003) implement this framework in a complicated architecture of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and show that the model can qualitatively account for the attentional blink phenomenon. The attentional blink is observed in experiments where participants are shown a rapid series of stimuli, which includes two targets (T1 and T2). If T2 appears shortly after T1, the ability to report T2 drops, as if attention is distracted. Dehane et al. explain this phenomenon as follows. When T1 is presented, its activation propagates to frontal cortical areas (the global workspace). Feedback connections lead to a resonance between frontal and posterior areas, which strengthen T1 but block T2 from entering the workspace. If the T1-T2 lag is sufﬁciently great, habituation of T1 sufﬁciently weakens the representation such that T2 can enter the workspace and suppress T1. In this account, conscious access is achieved via resonance between posterior and frontal areas. Although the Farah et al. and Dehaene et al. models might not seem to have much in common, they both make claims concerning what is required to achieve functional connectivity between perceptual and response systems. Farah et al. focus on aspects of the representation; Dehaene et al. focus on a pathway through which representations can be communicated. These two aspects are not incompatible, and in fact, a third model incorporates both. Mathis and Mozer (1996) describe an architecture with processing modules for perceptual and response processes, implemented as attractor neural nets. They argue that in order for a representation in some perceptual module to be assured of inﬂuencing a response module, (a) it must have certain characteristics–temporal persistence and well-formedness– which is quite similar to Farah et al.’s notion of quality, and (b) the two modules must be interconnected—which is the purpose of Dehaene et al.’s global workspace. The model has two limitations that restrict its value as a contemporary account of conscious access. First, it addressed classical subliminal priming data, but more reliable data has recently been reported. Second, like the other two models, Mathis and Mozer used a complex neural network architecture with arbitrary assumptions built in, and the sensitivity of the model’s behavior to these assumptions is far from clear. In this paper, we present a model that embodies the same assumptions as Mathis and Mozer, but overcomes its two limitations, and explains subliminal-priming data that has yet to be interpreted via a computational model. 3 The Probabilistic Information Transmission (PIT) Framework Our model is based on the probabilistic information transmission or PIT framework of Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2002, 2003). The framework characterizes the transmission of information from perceptual to response systems, and how the time course of information transmission changes with experience (i.e., priming). Mozer et al. used this framework to account for a variety of facilitation effects from supraliminal repetition priming. The framework describes cognition in terms of a collection of information-processing pathways, and supposes that any act of cognition involves coordination among multiple pathways. For example, to model a letter-naming task where a letter printed in upper or lower case is presented visually and the letter must be named, the framework would assume a perceptual pathway that maps the visual input to an identity representation, and a response pathway that maps a identity representation to a naming response. The framework is formalized as a probabilistic model: the pathway input and output are random variables and microinference in a pathway is carried out by Bayesian belief revision. The framework captures the time course of information processing for a single experimental trial. To elaborate, consider a pathway whose input at time t is a discrete random variable, denoted X(t), which can assume values x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , xnx corresponding to alternative input states. Similarly, the output of the pathway at time t is a discrete random variable, denoted Y (t), which can assume values y1 , y2 , y3 , . . . , yny . For example, in the letter-naming task, the input to the perceptual pathway would be one of nx = 52 visual patterns corresponding to the upper- and lower-case letters of the alphabet, and the output is one of ny = 26 letter identities. To present a particular input alternative, say xi , to the model for T time steps, we specify X(t) = xi for t = 1 . . . T , and allow the model to compute P(Y (t) | X(1) . . . X(t)). A pathway is modeled as a dynamic Bayes network; the minimal version of the model used in the present simulations is simply a hidden Markov model, where the X(t) are observations and the Y (t) are inferred state (see Figure 1a). In typical usage, an HMM is presented with a sequence of distinct inputs, whereas we maintain the same input for many successive time steps; and an HMM transitions through a sequence of distinct hidden states, whereas we attempt to converge with increasing conﬁdence on a single state. Figure 1b illustrates the time course of inference in a single pathway with 52 input and 26 output alternatives and two-to-one associations. The solid line in the Figure shows, as a function of time t, P(Y (t) = yi | X(1) = x2i . . . X(t) = x2i ), i.e., the probability that input i (say, the visual pattern of an upper case O) will produce its target output (the letter identity). Evidence for the target output accumulates gradually over time, yielding a speed-accuracy curve that relates the number of iterations to the accuracy of identiﬁcation. Y0 Y1 X1 Y2 X2 P(Output) 1 Y3 X3 (a) (b) 0.8 0.6 O 0.4 0.2 0 Q Time Figure 1: (a) basic pathway architecture—a hidden Markov model; (b) time course of inference in a pathway when the letter O is presented, causing activation of both O and the visually similar Q. The exact shape of the speed-accuracy curve—the pathway dynamics—are determined by three probability distributions, which embody the knowledge and past experience of the model. First, P(Y (0)) is the prior distribution over outputs in the absence of any information about the input. Second, P(Y (t) | Y (t − 1)) characterizes how the pathway output evolves over time. We assume the transition probability matrix serves as a memory with diffusion, i.e., P(Y (t) = yi |Y (t − 1) = yj ) = (1 − β)δij + βP(Y (0) = yi ), where β is the diffusion constant and δij is the Kronecker delta. Third, P(X(t) | Y (t)) characterizes the strength of association between inputs and outputs. The greater the association strength, the more rapidly that information about X will be communicated to Y . We parameterize this distribution as P(X(t) = xi |Y (t) = yj ) ∼ 1 + k γik αkj , where αij indicates the frequency of experience with the association between states xi and yj , and γik speciﬁes the similarity between states xi and xk . (Although the representation of states is localist, the γ terms allow us to design in the similarity structure inherent in a distributed representation.) These association strengths are highly constrained by the task structure and the similarity structure and familiarity of the inputs. Fundamental to the framework is the assumption that with each experience, a pathway becomes more efﬁcient at processing an input. Efﬁciency is reﬂected by a shift in the speedaccuracy curve to the left. In Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2002, 2003), we propose two distinct mechanisms to model phenomena of supraliminal priming. First, the association frequencies, αij , are increased following a trial in which xi leads to activation of yj , resulting in more efﬁcient transmission of information, corresponding to an increased slope of the solid line in Figure 1b. The increase is Hebbian, based on the maximum activation achieved by xi and yj : ∆αij = η maxt P(X(t) = xi )P(Y (t) = yj ), where η is a step size. Second, the priors, which serve as a model of the environment, are increased to indicate a greater likelihood of the same output occurring again in the future. In modeling data from supraliminal priming, we found that the increases to association frequencies are long lasting, but the increases to the priors decay over the course of a few minutes or a few trials. As a result, the prior updating does not play into the simulation we report here; we refer the reader to Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2003) for details. 4 Access Consciousness and PIT We have described the operation of a single pathway, but to model any cognitive task, we require a series of pathways in cascade. For a simple choice task, we use a percpetual pathway cascaded to a response pathway. The interconnection between the pathways is achieved by copying the output of the perceptual pathway, Y p (t), to the input of the response pathway, X r (t), at each time t. This multiple-pathway architecture allows us to characterize the notion of access consciousness. Considering the output of the perceptual pathway, access is achieved when: (1) the output representation is sufﬁcient to trigger the correct behavior in the response pathway, and (2) the perceptual and response pathways are functionally interconnected. In more general terms, access for a perceptual pathway output requires that these two condi- tions be met not just for a speciﬁc response pathway, but for arbitrary response pathways (e.g., pathways for naming, choice, evaluation, working memory, etc.). In Mozer and Colagrosso (in preparation) we characterize the sufﬁciency requirements of condition 1; they involve a representation of low entropy that stays active for long enough that the representation can propagate to the next pathway. As we will show, a brieﬂy presented stimulus fails to achieve a representation that supports choice and naming responses. Nonetheless, the stimulus evokes activity in the perceptual pathway. Because perceptual priming depends on the magnitude of the activation in the perceptual pathway, not on the activation being communicated to response pathways, the framework is consistent with the notion of priming occurring in the absence of awareness. 4.1 Simulation of Bar and Biederman (1998) Bar and Biederman (1998) presented a sequence of masked line drawings of objects and asked participants to name the objects, even if they had to guess. If the guess was incorrect, participants were required to choose the object name from a set of four alternatives. Unbeknownst to the participant, some of the drawings in the series were repeated, and Bar and Biederman were interested in whether participants would beneﬁt from the ﬁrst presentation even if it could not be identiﬁed. The repeated objects could be the same or a different exemplar of the object, and it could appear in either the same or a different display position. Participants were able to name 13.5% of drawings on presentation 1, but accuracy jumped to 34.5% on presentation 2. Accuracy did improve, though not as much, if the same shape was presented in a different position, but not if a different drawing of the same object was presented, suggesting a locus of priming early in the visual stream. The improvement in accuracy is not due to practice in general, because accuracy rose only 4.0% for novel control objects over the course of the experiment. The priming is ﬁrmly subliminal, because participants were not only unable to name objects on the ﬁrst presentation, but their fouralternative forced choice (4AFC) performance was not much above chance (28.5%). To model these phenomena, we created a response pathway with ﬁfty states representing names of objects that are used in the experiment, e.g., chair and lamp. We also created a perceptual pathway with states representing visual patterns that correspond to the names in the response pathway. Following the experimental design, every object identity was instantiated in two distinct shapes, and every shape could be in one of nine different visualﬁeld positions, leading to 900 distinct states in the perceptual pathway to model the possible visual stimuli. The following parameters were ﬁt to the data. If two perceptual states, xi and xk are the same shape in different positions, they are assigned a similarity coefﬁcient γik = 0.95; all other similarity coefﬁcients are zero. The association frequency, α, for valid associations in the perceptual pathway was 22, and the response pathway 18. Other parameters were β p = .05, β r = .01, and η = 1.0. The PIT model achieves a good ﬁt to the human experimental data (Figure 2). Speciﬁcally, priming is greatest for the same shape in the same position, some priming occurs for the same shape in a different position, and no substantial priming occurs for the different shape. Figure 3a shows the time course of activation of a stimulus representation in the perceptual pathway when the stimulus is presented for 50 iterations, on both the ﬁrst and third presentations. The third presentation was chosen instead of the second to make the effect of priming clearer. Even though a shape cannot be named on the ﬁrst presentation, partial information about the shape may nonetheless be available for report. The 4AFC test of Bar and Biederman provides a more sensitive measure of residual stimulus information. In past work, we modeled forced-choice tasks using a response pathway with only the alternatives under consideration. However, in this experiment, forced-choice performance must be estimated conditional on incorrect naming. In PIT framework, we achieve this using naming and 40 40 First Block Second Block 30 25 20 15 10 5 First Block 35 Percent Correct Naming Percent Correct Naming 35 Second Block 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0 Control Objects Prime SHAPE: Same Objects POSITION: Same Same Different Different Different Second Same Different Control Control Objects Prime SHAPE: Same Objects POSITION: Same Same Different Different Different Second Same Different Control Figure 2: (left panel) Data from Bar and Biederman (1998) (right panel) Simulation of PIT.

F (t) must be reestimated with the evidence that N (t) is not the target state. This inference problem is intractable. We therefore used a shortcut in which a single response pathway is used, augmented with a simple three-node belief net (Figure 3b) to capture the dependence between naming and forced choice. The belief net has a response pathway node Y r (t) connected to F (t) and N (t), with conditional distribution P (N (t) = ni |Y r (t) = yj ) = θδij + (1 − θ)/|Y r |, and an analogous distribution for P (F (t) = fi |Y r (t) = yj ). The free parameter θ determines how veridically naming and forced-choice actions reﬂect response-pathway output. Over a range of θ, θ < 1, the model obtains forced-choice performance near chance on the ﬁrst presentation when the naming response is incorrect. For example, with θ = 0.72, the model produces a forced-choice accuracy on presentation 1 of 26.1%. (Interestingly, the model also produces below chance performance on presentation 2 if the object is not named correctly—23.5%—which is also found in the human data—20.0%.) Thus, by the stringent criterion of 4AFC, the model shows no access consciousness, and therefore illustrates a dissociation between priming and access consciousness. In our simulation, we followed the procedure of Bar and Biederman by including distractor alternatives with visual and semantic similarity to the target. These distractors are critical: with unrelated distractors, the model’s 4AFC performance is signiﬁcantly above chance, illustrating that a perceptual representation can be adequate to support some responses but not others, as Farah et al. (1994) also argued. 4.2 Simulation of Abrams and Greenwald (2000) During an initial phase of the experiment, participants categorized 24 clearly visible target words as pleasant (e.g., HUMOR) or unpleasant (e.g., SMUT). They became quite familiar with the task by categorizing each word a total of eight times. In a second phase, participants were asked to classify the same targets and were given a response deadline to induce errors. The targets were preceded by masked primes that could not be identiﬁed. Of interest is the effective valence (or EV) of the target for different prime types, deﬁned as the error rate difference between unpleasant and pleasant targets. A positive (negative) EV indicates that responses are biased toward a pleasant (unpleasant) interpretation by the prime. As one would expect, pleasant primes resulted in a positive EV, unpleasant primes in a negative EV. Of critical interest is the ﬁnding that a nonword prime formed by recombining two pleasant targets (e.g., HULIP from HUMOR and TULIP) or unpleasant targets (e.g., BIUT from BILE and SMUT ) also served to bias the targets. More surprising, a positive EV resulted from unpleasant prime words formed by recombining two pleasant targets (TUMOR from TULIP and HUMOR ), indicating that subliminal priming arises from word fragments, not words as unitary entities, and providing further evidence for an early locus of subliminal priming. Note that the results depend critically on the ﬁrst phase of the experiment, which gave participants extensive practice on a relatively small set of words that were then used as and recombined to form primes.

HULIP-type primes are almost as strong as target repetitions, and TUMOR-type primes have a positive valence, contrary to the meaning of the word. no signiﬁcant EV effect when used as primes. In this simulation, we used a three pathway model: a perceptual pathway that maps visual patterns to orthography with 200 input states corresponding both to words, nonwords, and nonword recombinations of words; a semantic pathway that maps to 100 distinct lexical/semantic states; and a judgement pathway that maps to two responses, pleasant and unpleasant. In the perceptual pathway, similarity structure was based on letter overlap, so that HULIP was similar to both TULIP and HUMOR, with γ = 0.837. No similarity was assumed in the semantic state representation; consistent with the previous simulation, β p = .05, β s = .01, β j = .01, and η = .01. At the outset of the simulation, α frequencies for correct associations were 15, 19, and 25 in the perceptual, semantic, and judgement pathways. The initial phase of the experiment was simulated by repeated supraliminal presentation of words, which increased the association frequencies in all three pathways through the ∆αij learning rule. Long-term supraliminal priming is essential in establishing the association strengths, as we’ll explain. Short-term subliminal priming also plays a key role in the experiment. During the second phase of the experiment, residual activity from the prime—primarily in the judgement pathway—biases the response to the target. Residual activation of the prime is present even if the representation of the prime does not reach sufﬁcient strength that it could be named or otherwise reported. The outcome of the simulation is consistent with the human data (Figure 4). When a HULIP -type prime is presented, HUMOR and TULIP become active in the semantic pathway because of their visual similarity to HULIP. Partial activation of these two practiced words pushes the judgement pathway toward a pleasant response, resulting in a positive EV. When a TUMOR-type prime is presented, three different words become active in the semantic pathway: HUMOR, TULIP, and TUMOR itself. Although TUMOR is more active, it was not one of the words studied during the initial phase of the experiment, and as a result, it has a relatively weak association to the unpleasant judgement, in contrast to the other two words which have strong associations to the pleasant judgement. Orphan primes have little effect because they were not studied during the initial phase of the experiment, and consequently their association to pleasant and unpleasant judgements is also weak. In summary, activation of the prime along a critical, well-practiced pathway may not be sufﬁcient to support an overt naming response, yet it may be sufﬁcient to bias the processing of the immediately following target. 5 Discussion An important contribution of this work has been to demonstrate that speciﬁc experimental results relating to access consciousness and subliminal priming can be interpreted in a concrete computational framework. By necessity, the PIT framework, which we previously used to model supraliminal priming data, predicts the existence of subliminal priming, because the mechanisms giving rise to priming depend on degree of activation of a representation, whereas the processes giving rise to access consciousness also depend on the temporal persistence of a representation. Another contribution of this work has been to argue that two previous computational models each tell only part of the story. Farah et al. argue that quality of representation is critical; Dehaene et al. argue that pathways to communicate representations is critical. The PIT framework argues that both of these features are necessary for access consciousness. Although the PIT framework is not completely developed, it nonetheless makes a clear prediction: that subliminal priming is can never be stronger than supraliminal priming, because the maximal activation of subliminal primes is never greater than that of supraliminal primes. One might argue that many theoretical frameworks might predict the same, but no other computational model is sufﬁciently well developed—in terms of addressing both priming and access consciousness—to make this prediction. In its current stage of development, a weakness of the PIT framework is that it is silent as to how perceptual and response pathways become ﬂexibly interconnected based on task demands. However, the PIT framework is not alone in failing to address this critical issue: The Dehaene et al. model suggests that once a representation enters the global workspace, all response modules can access it, but the model does not specify how the appropriate perceptual module wins the competition to enter the global workspace, or how the appropriate response module is activated. Clearly, ﬂexible cognitive control structures that perform these functions are intricately related to mechanisms of consciousness.

<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a probabilistic model for online document clustering. We use non-parametric Dirichlet process prior to model the growing number of clusters, and use a prior of general English language model as the base distribution to handle the generation of novel clusters. Furthermore, cluster uncertainty is modeled with a Bayesian Dirichletmultinomial distribution. We use empirical Bayes method to estimate hyperparameters based on a historical dataset. Our probabilistic model is applied to the novelty detection task in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) and compared with existing approaches in the literature. 1</p><p>3 0.59145629 <a title="10-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Gaussian_Process_Kernels_via_Hierarchical_Bayes.html">98 nips-2004-Learning Gaussian Process Kernels via Hierarchical Bayes</a></p>
<p>Author: Anton Schwaighofer, Volker Tresp, Kai Yu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning with Gaussian process regression in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In a ﬁrst step, kernel matrices on a ﬁxed set of input points are learned from data using a simple and efﬁcient EM algorithm. This step is nonparametric, in that it does not require a parametric form of covariance function. In a second step, kernel functions are ﬁtted to approximate the learned covariance matrix using a generalized Nystr¨ m method, which results in a complex, data o driven kernel. We evaluate our approach as a recommendation engine for art images, where the proposed hierarchical Bayesian method leads to excellent prediction performance. 1</p><p>4 0.58834273 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Integrating_Topics_and_Syntax.html">87 nips-2004-Integrating Topics and Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Steyvers, David M. Blei, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to language learning typically focus on either short-range syntactic dependencies or long-range semantic dependencies between words. We present a generative model that uses both kinds of dependencies, and can be used to simultaneously ﬁnd syntactic classes and semantic topics despite having no representation of syntax or semantics beyond statistical dependency. This model is competitive on tasks like part-of-speech tagging and document classiﬁcation with models that exclusively use short- and long-range dependencies respectively. 1</p><p>5 0.58822531 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Active_Learning_for_Anomaly_and_Rare-Category_Detection.html">15 nips-2004-Active Learning for Anomaly and Rare-Category Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Pelleg, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel active-learning scenario in which a user wants to work with a learning algorithm to identify useful anomalies. These are distinguished from the traditional statistical deﬁnition of anomalies as outliers or merely ill-modeled points. Our distinction is that the usefulness of anomalies is categorized subjectively by the user. We make two additional assumptions. First, there exist extremely few useful anomalies to be hunted down within a massive dataset. Second, both useful and useless anomalies may sometimes exist within tiny classes of similar anomalies. The challenge is thus to identify “rare category” records in an unlabeled noisy set with help (in the form of class labels) from a human expert who has a small budget of datapoints that they are prepared to categorize. We propose a technique to meet this challenge, which assumes a mixture model ﬁt to the data, but otherwise makes no assumptions on the particular form of the mixture components. This property promises wide applicability in real-life scenarios and for various statistical models. We give an overview of several alternative methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and conclude with a detailed empirical analysis. We show that our method can quickly zoom in on an anomaly set containing a few tens of points in a dataset of hundreds of thousands. 1</p><p>6 0.58384258 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference.html">43 nips-2004-Conditional Models of Identity Uncertainty with Application to Noun Coreference</a></p>

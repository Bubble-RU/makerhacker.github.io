</p><p>5 These results offer a new perspective on the expansion of the number of neurons from retina to V1 and provide a theoretical model of incorporating useful redundancy into efﬁcient neural representations. [sent-11, score-0.279]
</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Efﬁcient coding theory posits that one of the primary goals of sensory coding is to eliminate redundancy from raw sensory signals, ideally representing the input by a set of statistically independent features [1]. [sent-12, score-0.698]
</p><p>7 In this framework, units are assumed to be non-redundant and so the number of units should be identical to the dimensionality of the data. [sent-14, score-0.226]
</p><p>8 Redundancy, however, can be beneﬁcial if it is used to compensate for inherent noise in the system [4]. [sent-15, score-0.274]
</p><p>9 The models above assume that the system noise is low and negligible so that redundancy in the representation is not necessary. [sent-16, score-0.569]
</p><p>10 This is equivalent to assuming that the representational capacity of individual units is unlimited. [sent-17, score-0.264]
</p><p>11 Real neurons, however, have limited capacity [5], and this should place constraints on how a neural population can best encode a sensory signal. [sent-18, score-0.36]
</p><p>12 The aim of this study is to evaluate how the optimal representation changes when the system  is constrained by limited capacity units. [sent-20, score-0.371]
</p><p>13 We propose a model that best balances redundancy reduction and redundant representation given the limited capacity units. [sent-21, score-0.667]
</p><p>14 In contrast to the efﬁcient coding models, it is possible to have a larger number of units than the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. [sent-22, score-0.258]
</p><p>15 This further allows to introduce redundancy in the population, enabling precise reconstruction using the imprecise representation of a single unit. [sent-23, score-0.64]
</p><p>16 We will refer to u as coefﬁcients because it is a set of clean coefﬁcients associated with the synthesis vectors in the decoding process, as described below. [sent-25, score-0.324]
</p><p>17 We deﬁne channel noise level as follows, (channel noise level) =  2 σn 2 × 100 [%] σt  (3)  2 where σt is a constant target value of the coefﬁcient variance. [sent-26, score-1.082]
</p><p>18 It is the inverse of the signalto-noise ratio in the representation, and therefore, we can control the information capacity of a single unit by varying the channel noise variance. [sent-27, score-1.048]
</p><p>19 Note that in the previous models [2, 3, 6] there is no channel noise; therefore r = u, where the signal-to-noise ratio of the representation is inﬁnite. [sent-28, score-0.751]
</p><p>20 Decoding The decoding process is assumed to be a linear transform of the representation, x = Ar, ˆ  (4)  where the columns of A are referred to as the synthesis vectors1 , and x is the reconstruction ˆ of the input. [sent-29, score-0.512]
</p><p>21 The reconstruction error e is then expressed as e  = x−x ˆ = (I − AW) x − An. [sent-30, score-0.336]
</p><p>22 (5) (6)  Note that no assumption on the reconstruction error is made, because eq. [sent-31, score-0.336]
</p><p>23 To make this clear, we call A and W as synthesis and analysis vectors. [sent-37, score-0.235]
</p><p>24 The optimal synthesis vectors (top row) and analysis vectors (bottom row) are shown as black bars. [sent-47, score-0.445]
</p><p>25 (a-c) shows the complete code with 0, 20, and 80% channel noise level. [sent-49, score-1.04]
</p><p>26 (d) shows the case of 80% channel noise using an 8x overcomplete code. [sent-50, score-1.021]
</p><p>27 Without this term, the coefﬁcient variance could become trivially large so that the signal-to-noise ratio is high, yielding smaller reconstruction error; or, the variance becomes small to satisfy only the sparseness constraint, which is not desirable either. [sent-61, score-0.532]
</p><p>28 Note that in order to introduce redundancy in the representation, we do not assume statistical independence of the coefﬁcients. [sent-62, score-0.218]
</p><p>29 If there is no channel noise, the optimal complete (1x) code is identical to the ICA solution (a), since it gives the most sparse, non-Gaussian solution with minimal error. [sent-66, score-0.857]
</p><p>30 As the channel noise increases (b and c), sparseness is compromised for minimizing the reconstruction error by choosing correlated, redundant representation. [sent-67, score-1.294]
</p><p>31 In an extreme case where the channel noise is high enough, the two units are almost completely redundant (c). [sent-68, score-0.984]
</p><p>32 It should be noted that in such a case two vectors represent the direction of the ﬁrst principal component of the data. [sent-69, score-0.222]
</p><p>33 In addition to de-emphasizing sparseness, there is another way to introduce redundancy in the representation. [sent-70, score-0.218]
</p><p>34 Since the goal of the representation is not the separation of independent sources, we can set an arbitrarily large number of units in the representation. [sent-71, score-0.237]
</p><p>35 When the information capacity of a single unit is limited, the capacity of a population can be made large  by increasing the number of units. [sent-72, score-0.394]
</p><p>36 As shown in Figure 1c-d, the reconstruction error decreases as we increase the degree of overcompleteness. [sent-73, score-0.4]
</p><p>37 Note that the optimal overcomplete code is not simply a duplication of the complete code. [sent-74, score-0.455]

</p><p>40 +λ1  3  Optimal representations for natural images  We examined optimal codes for natural image patches using the proposed model. [sent-84, score-0.242]
</p><p>41 Accordingly, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is 63, and an N-times overcomplete code consists of N×63 units. [sent-87, score-0.416]
</p><p>42 Here we ﬁrst descirbe how the presence of channel noise changes the optimal code in the complete case. [sent-90, score-1.084]
</p><p>43 Next, we examine the optimal code at different degree of overcompleteness given a high channel noise level. [sent-91, score-1.272]
</p><p>44 1  Optimal code at different channel noise level  We varied the channel noise level as 10, 20, 40, and 80%. [sent-93, score-1.895]
</p><p>45 As shown in Figure 2, learned synthesis and analysis vectors look somewhat similar to ICA (only 10 and 80% are shown for clarity). [sent-94, score-0.342]
</p><p>46 The comparison to the receptive ﬁelds of simple cells should be made with the analysis vectors [9, 10, 7]. [sent-95, score-0.267]
</p><p>47 Now, an additional characteristic to the Gabor-like structure is that the spatial-frequency tuning of the analysis vectors shifts towards lower spatial-frequencies as the channel noise increases (Figure 2d). [sent-97, score-1.038]
</p><p>48 The learned code is expected to be robust to the channel noise. [sent-98, score-0.807]
</p><p>49 The reconstruction error with respect to the data variance turned out to be 6. [sent-99, score-0.394]
</p><p>50 8% for 10, 20, 40, and 80% of channel noise level, respectively. [sent-103, score-0.825]
</p><p>51 The noise reduction is signiﬁcant considering the fact that any whitened representation including ICA should generate the reconstruction error of exactly the same amount of the channel noise level2 . [sent-104, score-1.576]
</p><p>52 For the learned ICA code shown in Figure 2a, the reconstruction error was 82. [sent-105, score-0.545]

</p><p>54 (d) Distribution of spatial-frequency tuning of the analysis vectors in the condition of (a)-(c). [sent-118, score-0.213]
</p><p>55 The robustness to channel noise can be explained by the shift of the representation towards lower spatial-frequencies. [sent-119, score-1.001]
</p><p>56 We analyzed the reconstruction error by projecting it to the principal axes of the data. [sent-120, score-0.453]
</p><p>57 Figure 3a shows the error spectrum of the code for 80% channel noise, along with the data spectrum (the percentage of the data variance along the principal axes). [sent-121, score-1.16]
</p><p>58 Note that the data variance of natural images is mostly explained by the ﬁrst principal components, which correspond to lower spatial-frequencies. [sent-122, score-0.239]
</p><p>59 In the proposed model, the ratio of the error to the data variance is relatively small around the ﬁrst principal components. [sent-123, score-0.269]
</p><p>60 It can be seen much clearer in Figure 3b, where the reconstruction percentage at each principal component is replotted. [sent-124, score-0.427]
</p><p>61 The reconstruction is more precise for more signiﬁcant principal components (i. [sent-125, score-0.428]
</p><p>62 For comparison, we analyzed the error for ICA code, where the synthesis and analysis vectors are optimized without channel noise and its robustness to channel noise is tested with 80% channel noise level. [sent-128, score-2.883]
</p><p>63 As shown in Figure 3, ICA reconstructs every component equally irrespective of their very different data variance3 , therefore the percentage of reconstruction is ﬂat. [sent-129, score-0.337]
</p><p>64 The proposed model can be robust to channel noise by primarily representing the principal components. [sent-130, score-0.969]
</p><p>65 Note that such a biased reconstruction depends on the channel noise level. [sent-131, score-1.123]
</p><p>66 In Figure 3b we also shows the reconstruction spectrum with 10% channel noise using the code for 10% channel noise level. [sent-132, score-2.167]
</p><p>67 It means that the model can represent ﬁner information if the information capacity of a single unit is large enough. [sent-134, score-0.219]
</p><p>68 2  Optimal code at different degree of overcompleteness  Now we examine how the optimal representation changes with the different number of available units. [sent-137, score-0.571]
</p><p>69 We ﬁxed the channel noise level at 80% and vary the degree of overcompleteness as 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x. [sent-138, score-1.048]
</p><p>70 Learned vectors for 8x are shown in Figure 4a, and those for 2 Since the error spectrum for a whitened representation is expressed as (Et e)2 = σn · T T 2 2 T T Diag(E xx E) = σn · Diag(D) = σn · (data spectrum), where EDE = xx is the eigen value decomposition of the data covariance matrix. [sent-139, score-0.488]
</p><p>71 (a) Power spectrum of the data (‘DAT’) and the reconstruction error with 80% channel noise. [sent-141, score-0.995]
</p><p>72 ‘80%’ is the error of the 1x code for 80% channel noise level. [sent-142, score-1.075]
</p><p>73 Compared to the 1x case, where the synthesis and analysis vectors look uniform in shape, the 8x code shows more diversity. [sent-151, score-0.503]
</p><p>74 To be precise, as illustrated in Figure 4b, the spatial-frequency tuning of the analysis vectors becomes more broadly distribued and cover a larger region as the degree of overcompleteness increases. [sent-152, score-0.406]
</p><p>75 Physiological data at the central fovea shows that the spatial-frequency tuning of V1 simple cells spans three [11] or two [12] octaves. [sent-153, score-0.212]
</p><p>76 It is important that the proposed model generates a broader tuning distribution under the presence of the channel noise and with the high degree of overcompleteness. [sent-155, score-1.045]
</p><p>77 An important property of the proposed model is that the reconstruction error decreases as the degree of overcompleteness increases. [sent-156, score-0.556]
</p><p>78 The noise analysis shows that the model comes to represent minor components as the degree of overcompleteness increases (Figure 3b). [sent-162, score-0.582]
</p><p>79 There is an interesting similarity between the error spectra of 8x code for 80% channel noise and 1x code for 10% channel noise. [sent-163, score-1.858]
</p><p>80 It is suggested that the population of units can represent the same amount and the same kind of information using N times larger number of units if the information capacity of a single unit is decreased with N times larger channel noise level. [sent-164, score-1.345]

</p><p>83 (b) Distribution of spatialfrequency tuning of the analysis vectors at different degree of overcompleteness. [sent-177, score-0.277]
</p><p>84 Another important characteristic of simple cells is the fact that the more numerous cells are tuned to the lower spatial-frequencies [11, 12]. [sent-178, score-0.228]
</p><p>85 An explanation of it is that the high data-variance components should be highly oversampled so that the reconstruction erorr is minimized given the limited precision of a single unit [12]. [sent-179, score-0.406]
</p><p>86 As we described earlier, such a biased representation for the high variance components is observed in our model (Figure 3b). [sent-180, score-0.249]
</p><p>87 However, the distribution of the spatial-frequency tuning of the analysis vectors does not correspond to this trend; instead, it is bell-shaped (Figure 4b). [sent-181, score-0.213]
</p><p>88 This apparent inconsistency might be resolved by considering the synthesis vectors, because the reconstruction error is determined by both synthesis and analysis vectors. [sent-182, score-0.774]
</p><p>89 It also utilizes redundancy in the representation but to compensate for sensory noise rather than channel noise; therefore, the two models explain different phenomena. [sent-184, score-1.355]
</p><p>90 Now, given a photopic environment where the sensory noise can reasonably be regarded to be small [14], it should rather be important to examine how the constraint of noisy, limited information capacity units changes the representation. [sent-186, score-0.676]
</p><p>91 It is reported that the information capacity is signiﬁcantly decreased from photoreceptors to spiking neurons [15], which supports our approach. [sent-187, score-0.205]
</p><p>92 In spite of its significance, to our knowledge the inﬂuence of channel noise on the representation had not been explored. [sent-188, score-0.949]
</p><p>93 5  Conclusion  We propose a model that both utilizes redundancy in the representation in order to compensate for the limited precision of a single unit and reduces unnecessary redundancy in order to yield an efﬁcient code. [sent-189, score-0.735]
</p><p>94 The noisy, overcomplete code for natural images generates a distributed spatial-frequency tuning in addition to the Gabor-like analysis vectors, showing a closer agreement with the physiological data than the previous efﬁcient coding models. [sent-190, score-0.744]
</p><p>95 The information capacity of a representation may be constrained either by the intrinsic noise in a single unit or by the number of units. [sent-191, score-0.58]
</p><p>96 In either case, the proposed model can adapt the parameters to primarily represent the high-variance, coarse information, yielding a robust representation to channel noise. [sent-192, score-0.83]
</p><p>97 As the limitation is relaxed by decreasing the channel noise level or by increasing the number of units, the model comes to represent low-variance, ﬁne information. [sent-193, score-0.905]

<p>Author: Hyun J. Park, Te W. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Capturing dependencies in images in an unsupervised manner is important for many image processing applications. We propose a new method for capturing nonlinear dependencies in images of natural scenes. This method is an extension of the linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method by building a hierarchical model based on ICA and mixture of Laplacian distribution. The model parameters are learned via an EM algorithm and it can accurately capture variance correlation and other high order structures in a simple manner. We visualize the learned variance structure and demonstrate applications to image segmentation and denoising. 1 In trod u ction Unsupervised learning has become an important tool for understanding biological information processing and building intelligent signal processing methods. Real biological systems however are much more robust and flexible than current artificial intelligence mostly due to a much more efficient representations used in biological systems. Therefore, unsupervised learning algorithms that capture more sophisticated representations can provide a better understanding of neural information processing and also provide improved algorithm for signal processing applications. For example, independent component analysis (ICA) can learn representations similar to simple cell receptive fields in visual cortex [1] and is also applied for feature extraction, image segmentation and denoising [2,3]. ICA can approximate statistics of natural image patches by Eq.(1,2), where X is the data and u is a source signal whose distribution is a product of sparse distributions like a generalized Laplacian distribution. X = Au (1) P (u ) = ∏ P (u i ) (2) But the representation learned by the ICA algorithm is relatively low-level. In biological systems there are more high-level representations such as contours, textures and objects, which are not well represented by the linear ICA model. ICA learns only linear dependency between pixels by finding strongly correlated linear axis. Therefore, the modeling capability of ICA is quite limited. Previous approaches showed that one can learn more sophisticated high-level representations by capturing nonlinear dependencies in a post-processing step after the ICA step [4,5,6,7,8]. The focus of these efforts has centered on variance correlation in natural images. After ICA, a source signal is not linearly predictable from others. However, given variance dependencies, a source signal is still ‘predictable’ in a nonlinear manner. It is not possible to de-correlate this variance dependency using a linear transformation. Several researchers have proposed extensions to capture the nonlinear dependencies. Portilla et al. used Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) to model variance dependency in wavelet domain. This model can learn variance correlation in source prior and showed improvement in image denoising [4]. But in this model, dependency is defined only between a subset of wavelet coefficients. Hyvarinen and Hoyer suggested using a special variance related distribution to model the variance correlated source prior. This model can learn grouping of dependent sources (Subspace ICA) or topographic arrangements of correlated sources (Topographic ICA) [5,6]. Similarly, Welling et al. suggested a product of expert model where each expert represents a variance correlated group [7]. The product form of the model enables applications to image denoising. But these models don’t reveal higher-order structures explicitly. Our model is motivated by Lewicki and Karklin who proposed a 2-stage model where the 1st stage is an ICA model (Eq. (3)) and the 2 nd-stage is a linear generative model where another source v generates logarithmic variance for the 1st stage (Eq. (4)) [8]. This model captures variance dependency structure explicitly, but treating variance as an additional random variable introduces another level of complexity and requires several approximations. Thus, it is difficult to obtain a simple analytic PDF of source signal u and to apply the model for image processing problems. ( P (u | λ ) = c exp − u / λ q ) (3) log[λ ] = Bv (4) We propose a hierarchical model based on ICA and a mixture of Laplacian distribution. Our model can be considered as a simplification of model in [8] by constraining v to be 0/1 random vector where only one element can be 1. Our model is computationally simpler but still can capture variance dependency. Experiments show that our model can reveal higher order structures similar to [8]. In addition, our model provides a simple parametric PDF of variance correlated priors, which is an important advantage for adaptive signal processing. Utilizing this, we demonstrate simple applications on image segmentation and image denoising. Our model provides an improved statistic model for natural images and can be used for other applications including feature extraction, image coding, or learning even higher order structures. 2 Modeling nonlinear dependencies We propose a hierarchical or 2-stage model where the 1 st stage is an ICA source signal model and the 2nd stage is modeled by a mixture model with different variances (figure 1). In natural images, the correlation of variance reflects different types of regularities in the real world. Such specialized regularities can be summarized as “context” information. To model the context dependent variance correlation, we use mixture models where Laplacian distributions with different variance represent different contexts. For each image patch, a context variable Z “selects” which Laplacian distribution will represent ICA source signal u. Laplacian distributions have 0-mean but different variances. The advantage of Laplacian distribution for modeling context is that we can model a sparse distribution using only one Laplacian distribution. But we need more than two Gaussian distributions to do the same thing. Also conventional ICA is a special case of our model with one Laplacian. We define the mixture model and its learning algorithm in the next sections. Figure 1: Proposed hierarchical model (1st stage is ICA generative model. 2nd stage is mixture of “context dependent” Laplacian distributions which model U. Z is a random variable that selects a Laplacian distribution that generates the given image patch) 2.1 Mixture of Laplacian Distribution We define a PDF for mixture of M-dimensional Laplacian Distribution as Eq.(5), where N is the number of data samples, and K is the number of mixtures. N N K M N K r r r P(U | Λ, Π) = ∏ P(u n | Λ, Π) = ∏∑ π k P(u n | λk ) = ∏∑ π k ∏ n n k n k m 1 (2λ ) k ,m  u n,m exp −  λk , m      (5) r r r r r un = (un,1 , un , 2 , , , un,M ) : n-th data sample, U = (u1 , u 2 , , , ui , , , u N ) r r r r r λk = (λk ,1 , λk , 2 ,..., λk ,M ) : Variance of k-th Laplacian distribution, Λ = (λ1 , λ2 , , , λk , , , λK ) πk : probability of Laplacian distribution k, Π = (π 1 , , , π K ) and ∑ k πk =1 It is not easy to maximize Eq.(5) directly, and we use EM (expectation maximization) algorithm for parameter estimation. Here we introduce a new hidden context variable Z that represents which Laplacian k, is responsible for a given data point. Assuming we know the hidden variable Z, we can write the likelihood of data and Z as Eq.(6), n zk K   N r  (π )zkn   1  ⋅ exp − z n u n ,m   P(U , Z | Λ, Π ) = ∏ P(u n , Z | Λ, Π ) = ∏ ∏ k ∏      k   k λk , m n n m   2λk ,m        N               (6) n z k : Hidden binary random variable, 1 if n-th data sample is generated from k-th n Laplacian, 0 other wise. ( Z = (z kn ) and ∑ z k = 1 for all n = 1…N) k 2.2 EM algorithm for learning the mixture model The EM algorithm maximizes the log likelihood of data averaged over hidden variable Z. The log likelihood and its expectation can be computed as in Eq.(7,8).   u 1 n n log P(U , Z | Λ, Π ) = ∑  z k log(π k ) + ∑ z k  log( ) − n ,m  2λk ,m λk , m n ,k  m       (7)   u 1 n E {log P (U , Z | Λ, Π )} = ∑ E z k log(π k ) + ∑  log( ) − n ,m  2λ k , m λk , m n ,k m    { }     (8) The expectation in Eq.(8) can be evaluated, if we are given the data U and estimated parameters Λ and Π. For Λ and Π, EM algorithm uses current estimation Λ’ and Π’. { } { } ∑ z P( z n n E z k ≡ E zk | U , Λ' , Π ' = 1 n z k =0 n k n k n | u n , Λ' , Π ' ) = P( z k = 1 | u n , Λ' , Π ' ) (9) = n n P (u n | z k = 1, Λ' , Π ' ) P( z k = 1 | Λ ' , Π ' ) P(u n | Λ' , Π ' ) = M u n ,m 1 1 1 ∏ 2λ ' exp(− λ ' ) ⋅ π k ' = c P (u n | Λ ' , Π ' ) m k ,m k ,m n M πk ' ∏ 2λ m k ,m ' exp(− u n ,m λk , m ' ) Where the normalization constant can be computed as K K M k k =1 m =1 n cn = P (u n | Λ ' , Π ' ) = ∑ P (u n | z k , Λ ' , Π ' ) P ( z kn | Λ ' , Π ' ) = ∑ π k ∏ 1 (2λ ) exp( − k ,m u n ,m λk ,m ) (10) The EM algorithm works by maximizing Eq.(8), given the expectation computed from Eq.(9,10). Eq.(9,10) can be computed using Λ’ and Π’ estimated in the previous iteration of EM algorithm. This is E-step of EM algorithm. Then in M-step of EM algorithm, we need to maximize Eq.(8) over parameter Λ and Π. First, we can maximize Eq.(8) with respect to Λ, by setting the derivative as 0.  1 u n,m  ∂E{log P (U , Z | Λ, Π )} n  = 0 = ∑ E z k  − +  λ k , m (λ k , m ) 2   ∂λ k ,m  n   { } ⇒ λ k ,m ∑ E{z }⋅ u = ∑ E{z } n k n ,m n (11) n k n Second, for maximization of Eq.(8) with respect to Π, we can rewrite Eq.(8) as below. n (12) E {log P (U , Z | Λ , Π )} = C + ∑ E {z k ' }log(π k ' ) n ,k ' As we see, the derivative of Eq.(12) with respect to Π cannot be 0. Instead, we need to use Lagrange multiplier method for maximization. A Lagrange function can be defined as Eq.(14) where ρ is a Lagrange multiplier. { } (13) n L (Π , ρ ) = − ∑ E z k ' log(π k ' ) + ρ (∑ π k ' − 1) n,k ' k' By setting the derivative of Eq.(13) to be 0 with respect to ρ and Π, we can simply get the maximization solution with respect to Π. We just show the solution in Eq.(14). ∂L(Π, ρ ) ∂L(Π, ρ ) =0 = 0, ∂Π ∂ρ  n   n  ⇒ π k =  ∑ E z k  /  ∑∑ E z k     k n  n { } { } (14) Then the EM algorithm can be summarized as figure 2.

We also provide visualization of learned variances that reveal the structure of variance correlation and an application to image denoising. 3.1 Learning Nonlinear Dependencies in Natural images As shown in figure 1, the 1 st stage of the proposed model is simply the linear ICA. The ICA matrix A and W(=A-1) are learned by the FastICA algorithm [9]. We sampled 105(=N) data from 16x16 patches (256 dim.) of natural images and use them for both first and second stage learning. ICA input dimension is 256, and source dimension is set to be 160(=M). The learned ICA basis is partially shown in figure 1. The 2nd stage mixture model is learned given the ICA source signals. In the 2 nd stage the number of mixtures is set to 16, 64, or 256(=K). Training by the EM algorithm is fast and several hundred iterations are sufficient for convergence (0.5 hour on a 1.7GHz Pentium PC). For the visualization of learned variance, we adapted the visualization method from [8]. Each dimension of ICA source signal corresponds to an ICA basis (columns of A) and each ICA basis is localized in both image and frequency space. Then for each Laplacian distribution, we can display its variance vector as a set of points in image and frequency space. Each point can be color coded by variance value as figure 3. (a1) (a2) (b1) (b2) Figure 3: Visualization of learned variances (a1 and a2 visualize variance of Laplacian #4 and b1 and 2 show that of Laplacian #5. High variance value is mapped to red color and low variance is mapped to blue. In Laplacian #4, variances for diagonally oriented edges are high. But in Laplacian #5, variances for edges at spatially right position are high. Variance structures are related to “contexts” in the image. For example, Laplacian #4 explains image patches that have oriented textures or edges. Laplacian #5 captures patches where left side of the patch is clean but right side is filled with randomly oriented edges.) A key idea of our model is that we can mix up independent distributions to get nonlinearly dependent distribution. This modeling power can be shown by figure 4. Figure 4: Joint distribution of nonlinearly dependent sources. ((a) is a joint histogram of 2 ICA sources, (b) is computed from learned mixture model, and (c) is from learned Laplacian model. In (a), variance of u2 is smaller than u1 at center area (arrow A), but almost equal to u1 at outside (arrow B). So the variance of u2 is dependent on u1. This nonlinear dependency is closely approximated by mixture model in (b), but not in (c).) 3.2 Unsupervised Image Segmentation The idea behind our model is that the image can be modeled as mixture of different variance correlated “contexts”. We show how the learned model can be used to classify different context by an unsupervised image segmentation task. Given learned model and data, we can compute the expectation of a hidden variable Z from Eq. (9). Then for an image patch, we can select a Laplacian distribution with highest probability, which is the most explaining Laplacian or “context”. For segmentation, we use the model with 16 Laplacians. This enables abstract partitioning of images and we can visualize organization of images more clearly (figure 5). Figure 5: Unsupervised image segmentation (left is original image, middle is color labeled image, right image shows color coded Laplacians with variance structure. Each color corresponds to a Laplacian distribution, which represents surface or textural organization of underlying contexts. Laplacian #14 captures smooth surface and Laplacian #9 captures contrast between clear sky and textured ground scenes.) 3.3 Application to Image Restoration The proposed mixture model provides a better parametric model of the ICA source distribution and hence an improved model of the image structure. An advantage is in the MAP (maximum a posterior) estimation of a noisy image. If we assume Gaussian noise n, the image generation model can be written as Eq.(15). Then, we can compute MAP estimation of ICA source signal u by Eq.(16) and reconstruct the original image. (15) X = Au + n (16) ˆ u = argmax log P (u | X , A) = argmax (log P ( X | u , A) + log P (u ) ) u u Since we assumed Gaussian noise, P(X|u,A) in Eq. (16) is Gaussian. P(u) in Eq. (16) can be modeled as a Laplacian or a mixture of Laplacian distribution. The mixture distribution can be approximated by a maximum explaining Laplacian. We evaluated 3 different methods for image restoration including ICA MAP estimation with simple Laplacian prior, same with Laplacian mixture prior, and the Wiener filter. Figure 6 shows an example and figure 7 summarizes the results obtained with different noise levels. As shown MAP estimation with the mixture prior performs better than the others in terms of SNR and SSIM (Structural Similarity Measure) [10].

The proposed mixture of Laplacian distribution model is a generalization of the conventional independent source priors and can model variance dependency given natural image signals. Experiments show that the proposed model can learn the variance correlated signals grouped as different mixtures and learn highlevel structures, which are highly correlated with the underlying physical properties captured in the image. Our model provides an analytic prior of nearly independent and variance-correlated signals, which was not viable in previous models [4,5,6,7,8]. The learned variances of the mixture model show structured localization in image and frequency space, which are similar to the result in [8]. Since the model is given no information about the spatial location or frequency of the source signals, we can assume that the dependency captured by the mixture model reveals regularity in the natural images. As shown in image labeling experiments, such regularities correspond to specific surface types (textures) or boundaries between surfaces. The learned mixture model can be used to discover hidden contexts that generated such regularity or correlated signal groups. Experiments also show that the labeling of image patches is highly correlated with the object surface types shown in the image. The segmentation results show regularity across image space and strong correlation with high-level concepts. Finally, we showed applications of the model for image restoration. We compare the performance with the conventional ICA MAP estimation and Wiener filter. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms other traditional methods. It is due to the estimation of the correlated variance structure, which provides an improved prior that has not been considered in other methods. In our future work, we plan to exploit the regularity of the image segmentation result to lean more high-level structures by building additional hierarchies on the current model. Furthermore, the application to image coding seems promising. References [1] A. J. Bell and T. J.

<p>Author: Evan C. Smith, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: The representation of acoustic signals at the cochlear nerve must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require exquisite sensitivity in both time and frequency. Lewicki (2002) demonstrated that many of the ﬁltering properties of the cochlea could be explained in terms of efﬁcient coding of natural sounds. This model, however, did not account for properties such as phase-locking or how sound could be encoded in terms of action potentials. Here, we extend this theoretical approach with algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a spiking population code. Here, we propose an algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a theoretical model for coding sound in terms of spikes. In this model, each spike encodes the precise time position and magnitude of a localized, time varying kernel function. By adapting the kernel functions to the statistics natural sounds, we show that, compared to conventional signal representations, the spike code achieves far greater coding efﬁciency. Furthermore, the inferred kernels show both striking similarities to measured cochlear ﬁlters and a similar bandwidth versus frequency dependence. 1</p><p>4 0.10596009 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Methods_Towards_Invasive_Human_Brain_Computer_Interfaces.html">117 nips-2004-Methods Towards Invasive Human Brain Computer Interfaces</a></p>

Elger, Niels Birbaumer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: During the last ten years there has been growing interest in the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). The ﬁeld has mainly been driven by the needs of completely paralyzed patients to communicate. With a few exceptions, most human BCIs are based on extracranial electroencephalography (EEG). However, reported bit rates are still low. One reason for this is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG [16]. We are currently investigating if BCIs based on electrocorticography (ECoG) are a viable alternative. In this paper we present the method and examples of intracranial EEG recordings of three epilepsy patients with electrode grids placed on the motor cortex. The patients were asked to repeatedly imagine movements of two kinds, e.g., tongue or ﬁnger movements. We analyze the classiﬁability of the data using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [18, 21] and Recursive Channel Elimination (RCE) [11]. 1</p><p>5 0.082599536 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-A_Direct_Formulation_for_Sparse_PCA_Using_Semidefinite_Programming.html">2 nips-2004-A Direct Formulation for Sparse PCA Using Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: It has been suggested that the primary goal of the sensory system is to represent input in such a way as to reduce the high degree of redundancy. Given a noisy neural representation, however, solely reducing redundancy is not desirable, since redundancy is the only clue to reduce the effects of noise. Here we propose a model that best balances redundancy reduction and redundant representation. Like previous models, our model accounts for the localized and oriented structure of simple cells, but it also predicts a different organization for the population. With noisy, limited-capacity units, the optimal representation becomes an overcomplete, multi-scale representation, which, compared to previous models, is in closer agreement with physiological data. These results offer a new perspective on the expansion of the number of neurons from retina to V1 and provide a theoretical model of incorporating useful redundancy into efﬁcient neural representations. 1</p><p>2 0.61657959 <a title="172-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Implicit_Wiener_Series_for_Higher-Order_Image_Analysis.html">81 nips-2004-Implicit Wiener Series for Higher-Order Image Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The computation of classical higher-order statistics such as higher-order moments or spectra is difﬁcult for images due to the huge number of terms to be estimated and interpreted. We propose an alternative approach in which multiplicative pixel interactions are described by a series of Wiener functionals. Since the functionals are estimated implicitly via polynomial kernels, the combinatorial explosion associated with the classical higher-order statistics is avoided. First results show that image structures such as lines or corners can be predicted correctly, and that pixel interactions up to the order of ﬁve play an important role in natural images. Most of the interesting structure in a natural image is characterized by its higher-order statistics. Arbitrarily oriented lines and edges, for instance, cannot be described by the usual pairwise statistics such as the power spectrum or the autocorrelation function: From knowing the intensity of one point on a line alone, we cannot predict its neighbouring intensities. This would require knowledge of a second point on the line, i.e., we have to consider some third-order statistics which describe the interactions between triplets of points. Analogously, the prediction of a corner neighbourhood needs at least fourth-order statistics, and so on. In terms of Fourier analysis, higher-order image structures such as edges or corners are described by phase alignments, i.e. phase correlations between several Fourier components of the image. Classically, harmonic phase interactions are measured by higher-order spectra [4]. Unfortunately, the estimation of these spectra for high-dimensional signals such as images involves the estimation and interpretation of a huge number of terms. For instance, a sixth-order spectrum of a 16×16 sized image contains roughly 1012 coefﬁcients, about 1010 of which would have to be estimated independently if all symmetries in the spectrum are considered. First attempts at estimating the higher-order structure of natural images were therefore restricted to global measures such as skewness or kurtosis [8], or to submanifolds of fourth-order spectra [9]. Here, we propose an alternative approach that models the interactions of image points in a series of Wiener functionals. A Wiener functional of order n captures those image components that can be predicted from the multiplicative interaction of n image points. In contrast to higher-order spectra or moments, the estimation of a Wiener model does not require the estimation of an excessive number of terms since it can be computed implicitly via polynomial kernels. This allows us to decompose an image into components that are characterized by interactions of a given order. In the next section, we introduce the Wiener expansion and discuss its capability of modeling higher-order pixel interactions. The implicit estimation method is described in Sect. 2, followed by some examples of use in Sect. 3. We conclude in Sect. 4 by brieﬂy discussing the results and possible improvements. 1 Modeling pixel interactions with Wiener functionals For our analysis, we adopt a prediction framework: Given a d × d neighbourhood of an image pixel, we want to predict its gray value from the gray values of the neighbours. We are particularly interested to which extent interactions of different orders contribute to the overall prediction. Our basic assumption is that the dependency of the central pixel value y on its neighbours xi , i = 1, . . . , m = d2 − 1 can be modeled as a series y = H0 [x] + H1 [x] + H2 [x] + · · · + Hn [x] + · · · (1) of discrete Volterra functionals H0 [x] = h0 = const. and Hn [x] = m i1 =1 ··· m in =1 (n) hi1 ...in xi1 . . . xin . (2) Here, we have stacked the grayvalues of the neighbourhood into the vector x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Rm . The discrete nth-order Volterra functional is, accordingly, a linear combination of all ordered nth-order monomials of the elements of x with mn coefﬁcients (n) hi1 ...in . Volterra functionals provide a controlled way of introducing multiplicative interactions of image points since a functional of order n contains all products of the input of order n. In terms of higher-order statistics, this means that we can control the order of the statistics used since an nth-order Volterra series leads to dependencies between maximally n + 1 pixels. Unfortunately, Volterra functionals are not orthogonal to each other, i.e., depending on the input distribution, a functional of order n generally leads to additional lower-order interactions. As a result, the output of the functional will contain components that are proportional to that of some lower-order monomials. For instance, the output of a second-order Volterra functional for Gaussian input generally has a mean different from zero [5]. If one wants to estimate the zeroeth-order component of an image (i.e., the constant component created without pixel interactions) the constant component created by the second-order interactions needs to be subtracted. For general Volterra series, this correction can be achieved by decomposing it into a new series y = G0 [x] + G1 [x] + · · · + Gn [x] + · · · of functionals Gn [x] that are uncorrelated, i.e., orthogonal with respect to the input. The resulting Wiener functionals1 Gn [x] are linear combinations of Volterra functionals up to order n. They are computed from the original Volterra series by a procedure akin to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization [5]. It can be shown that any Wiener expansion of ﬁnite degree minimizes the mean squared error between the true system output and its Volterra series model [5]. The orthogonality condition ensures that a Wiener functional of order n captures only the component of the image created by the multiplicative interaction of n pixels. In contrast to general Volterra functionals, a Wiener functional is orthogonal to all monomials of lower order [5]. So far, we have not gained anything compared to classical estimation of higher-order moments or spectra: an nth-order Volterra functional contains the same number of terms as 1 Strictly speaking, the term Wiener functional is reserved for orthogonal Volterra functionals with respect to Gaussian input. Here, the term will be used for orthogonalized Volterra functionals with arbitrary input distributions. the corresponding n + 1-order spectrum, and a Wiener functional of the same order has an even higher number of coefﬁcients as it consists also of lower-order Volterra functionals. In the next section, we will introduce an implicit representation of the Wiener series using polynomial kernels which allows for an efﬁcient computation of the Wiener functionals. 2 Estimating Wiener series by regression in RKHS Volterra series as linear functionals in RKHS. The nth-order Volterra functional is a weighted sum of all nth-order monomials of the input vector x. We can interpret the evaluation of this functional for a given input x as a map φn deﬁned for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . as φ0 (x) = 1 and φn (x) = (xn , xn−1 x2 , . . . , x1 xn−1 , xn , . . . , xn ) 1 2 m 1 2 (3) n such that φn maps the input x ∈ Rm into a vector φn (x) ∈ Fn = Rm containing all mn ordered monomials of degree n. Using φn , we can write the nth-order Volterra functional in Eq. (2) as a scalar product in Fn , Hn [x] = ηn φn (x), (n) (4) (n) (n) with the coefﬁcients stacked into the vector ηn = (h1,1,..1 , h1,2,..1 , h1,3,..1 , . . . ) ∈ Fn . The same idea can be applied to the entire pth-order Volterra series. By stacking the maps φn into a single map φ(p) (x) = (φ0 (x), φ1 (x), . . . , φp (x)) , one obtains a mapping from p+1 2 p Rm into F(p) = R × Rm × Rm × . . . Rm = RM with dimensionality M = 1−m . The 1−m entire pth-order Volterra series can be written as a scalar product in F(p) p n=0 Hn [x] = (η (p) ) φ(p) (x) (5) with η (p) ∈ F(p) . Below, we will show how we can express η (p) as an expansion in terms of the training points. This will dramatically reduce the number of parameters we have to estimate. This procedure works because the space Fn of nth-order monomials has a very special property: it has the structure of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). As a consequence, the dot product in Fn can be computed by evaluating a positive deﬁnite kernel function kn (x1 , x2 ). For monomials, one can easily show that (e.g., [6]) φn (x1 ) φn (x2 ) = (x1 x2 )n =: kn (x1 , x2 ). (6) Since F(p) is generated as a direct sum of the single spaces Fn , the associated scalar product is simply the sum of the scalar products in the Fn : φ(p) (x1 ) φ(p) (x2 ) = p n=0 (x1 x2 )n = k (p) (x1 , x2 ). (7) Thus, we have shown that the discretized Volterra series can be expressed as a linear functional in a RKHS2 . Linear regression in RKHS. For our prediction problem (1), the RKHS property of the Volterra series leads to an efﬁcient solution which is in part due to the so called representer theorem (e.g., [6]). It states the following: suppose we are given N observations 2 A similar approach has been taken by [1] using the inhomogeneous polynomial kernel = (1 + x1 x2 )p . This kernel implies a map φinh into the same space of monomials, but it weights the degrees of the monomials differently as can be seen by applying the binomial theorem. (p) kinh (x1 , x2 ) (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xN , yN ) of the function (1) and an arbitrary cost function c, Ω is a nondecreasing function on R>0 and . F is the norm of the RKHS associated with the kernel k. If we minimize an objective function c((x1 , y1 , f (x1 )), . . . , (xN , yN , f (xN ))) + Ω( f F ), (8) 3 over all functions in the RKHS, then an optimal solution can be expressed as N f (x) = j=1 aj k(x, xj ), aj ∈ R. (9) In other words, although we optimized over the entire RKHS including functions which are deﬁned for arbitrary input points, it turns out that we can always express the solution in terms of the observations xj only. Hence the optimization problem over the extremely large number of coefﬁcients η (p) in Eq. (5) is transformed into one over N variables aj . Let us consider the special case where the cost function is the mean squared error, N 1 c((x1 , y1 , f (x1 )), . . . , (xN , yN , f (xN ))) = N j=1 (f (xj ) − yj )2 , and the regularizer Ω is zero4 . The solution for a = (a1 , . . . , aN ) is readily computed by setting the derivative of (8) with respect to the vector a equal to zero; it takes the form a = K −1 y with the Gram matrix deﬁned as Kij = k(xi , xj ), hence5 y = f (x) = a z(x) = y K −1 z(x), (10) N where z(x) = (k(x, x1 ), k(x, x2 ), . . . k(x, xN )) ∈ R . Implicit Wiener series estimation. As we stated above, the pth-degree Wiener expansion is the pth-order Volterra series that minimizes the squared error. This can be put into the regression framework: since any ﬁnite Volterra series can be represented as a linear functional in the corresponding RKHS, we can ﬁnd the pth-order Volterra series that minimizes the squared error by linear regression. This, by deﬁnition, must be the pth-degree Wiener series since no other Volterra series has this property6 . From Eqn. (10), we obtain the following expressions for the implicit Wiener series p p 1 −1 G0 [x] = y 1, Hn [x] = y Kp z(p) (x) (11) Gn [x] = n=0 n=0 N (p) where the Gram matrix Kp and the coefﬁcient vector z (x) are computed using the kernel from Eq. (7) and 1 = (1, 1, . . . ) ∈ RN . Note that the Wiener series is represented only implicitly since we are using the RKHS representation as a sum of scalar products with the training points. Thus, we can avoid the “curse of dimensionality”, i.e., there is no need to compute the possibly large number of coefﬁcients explicitly. The explicit Volterra and Wiener expansions can be recovered from Eq. (11) by collecting all terms containing monomials of the desired order and summing them up. The individual nth-order Volterra functionals in a Wiener series of degree p > 0 are given implicitly by −1 Hn [x] = y Kp zn (x) n n (12) n with zn (x) = ((x1 x) , (x2 x) , . . . , (xN x) ) . For p = 0 the only term is the constant zero-order Volterra functional H0 [x] = G0 [x]. The coefﬁcient vector ηn = (n) (n) (n) (h1,1,...1 , h1,2,...1 , h1,3,...1 , . . . ) of the explicit Volterra functional is obtained as −1 η n = Φ n Kp y 3 (13) for conditions on uniqueness of the solution, see [6] Note that this is different from the regularized approach used by [1]. If Ω is not zero, the resulting Volterra series are different from the Wiener series since they are not orthogonal with respect to the input. 5 If K is not invertible, K −1 denotes the pseudo-inverse of K. 6 assuming symmetrized Volterra kernels which can be obtained from any Volterra expanson. 4 using the design matrix Φn = (φn (x1 ) , φn (x1 ) , . . . , φn (x1 ) ) . The individual Wiener functionals can only be recovered by applying the regression procedure twice. If we are interested in the nth-degree Wiener functional, we have to compute the solution for the kernels k (n) (x1 , x2 ) and k (n−1) (x1 , x2 ). The Wiener functional for n > 0 is then obtained from the difference of the two results as Gn [x] = n i=0 Gi [x] − n−1 i=0 Gi [x] = y −1 −1 Kn z(n) (x) − Kn−1 z(n−1) (x) . (14) The corresponding ith-order Volterra functionals of the nth-degree Wiener functional are computed analogously to Eqns. (12) and (13) [3]. Orthogonality. The resulting Wiener functionals must fulﬁll the orthogonality condition which in its strictest form states that a pth-degree Wiener functional must be orthogonal to all monomials in the input of lower order. Formally, we will prove the following Theorem 1 The functionals obtained from Eq. (14) fulﬁll the orthogonality condition E [m(x)Gp [x]] = 0 (15) where E denotes the expectation over the input distribution and m(x) an arbitrary ithorder monomial with i < p. We will show that this a consequence of the least squares ﬁt of any linear expansion in a set M of basis functions of the form y = j=1 γj ϕj (x). In the case of the Wiener and Volterra expansions, the basis functions ϕj (x) are monomials of the components of x. M We denote the error of the expansion as e(x) = y − j=1 γj ϕj (xi ). The minimum of the expected quadratic loss L with respect to the expansion coefﬁcient γk is given by ∂ ∂L = E e(x) ∂γk ∂γk 2 = −2E [ϕk (x)e(x)] = 0. (16) This means that, for an expansion in a set of basis functions minimizing the squared error, the error is orthogonal to all basis functions used in the expansion. Now let us assume we know the Wiener series expansion (which minimizes the mean squared error) of a system up to degree p − 1. The approximation error is given by the ∞ sum of the higher-order Wiener functionals e(x) = n=p Gn [x], so Gp [x] is part of the error. As a consequence of the linearity of the expectation, Eq. (16) implies ∞ n=p ∞ E [ϕk (x)Gn [x]] = 0 and n=p+1 E [ϕk (x)Gn [x]] = 0 (17) for any φk of order less than p. The difference of both equations yields E [ϕk (x)Gp [x]] = 0, so that Gp [x] must be orthogonal to any of the lower order basis functions, namely to all monomials with order smaller than p. 3 Experiments Toy examples. In our ﬁrst experiment, we check whether our intuitions about higher-order statistics described in the introduction are captured by the proposed method. In particular, we expect that arbitrarily oriented lines can only be predicted using third-order statistics. As a consequence, we should need at least a second-order Wiener functional to predict lines correctly. Our ﬁrst test image (size 80 × 110, upper row in Fig. 1) contains only lines of varying orientations. Choosing a 5 × 5 neighbourhood, we predicted the central pixel using (11). original image 0th-order component/ reconstruction 1st-order reconstruction 1st-order component 2nd-order reconstruction 2nd-order component 3rd-order reconstruction mse = 583.7 mse = 0.006 mse = 0 mse = 1317 mse = 37.4 mse = 0.001 mse = 1845 mse = 334.9 3rd-order component mse = 19.0 Figure 1: Higher-order components of toy images. The image components of different orders are created by the corresponding Wiener functionals. They are added up to obtain the different orders of reconstruction. Note that the constant 0-order component and reconstruction are identical. The reconstruction error (mse) is given as the mean squared error between the true grey values of the image and the reconstruction. Although the linear ﬁrst-order model seems to reconstruct the lines, this is actually not true since the linear model just smoothes over the image (note its large reconstruction error). A correct prediction is only obtained by adding a second-order component to the model. The third-order component is only signiﬁcant at crossings, corners and line endings. Models of orders 0 . . . 3 were learned from the image by extracting the maximal training set of 76 × 106 patches of size 5 × 57 . The corresponding image components of order 0 to 3 were computed according to (14). Note the different components generated by the Wiener functionals can also be negative. In Fig. 1, they are scaled to the gray values [0..255]. The behaviour of the models conforms to our intuition: the linear model cannot capture the line structure of the image thus leading to a large reconstruction error which drops to nearly zero when a second-order model is used. The additional small correction achieved by the third-order model is mainly due to discretization effects. Similar to lines, we expect that we need at least a third-order model to predict crossings or corners correctly. This is conﬁrmed by the second and third test image shown in the corresponding row in Fig. 1. Note that the third-order component is only signiﬁcant at crossings, corners and line endings. The fourth- and ﬁfth-order terms (not shown) have only negligible contributions. The fact that the reconstruction error does not drop to zero for the third image is caused by the line endings which cannot be predicted to a higher accuracy than one pixel. Application to natural images. Are there further predictable structures in natural images that are not due to lines, crossings or corners? This can be investigated by applying our method to a set of natural images (an example of size 80 × 110 is depicted in Fig. 2). Our 7 In contrast to the usual setting in machine learning, training and test set are identical in our case since we are not interested in generalization to other images, but in analyzing the higher-order components of the image at hand. original image 0th-order component/ reconstruction 1st-order reconstruction mse = 1070 1st-order component 2nd-order reconstruction mse = 957.4 2nd-order component 3rd-order reconstruction mse = 414.6 3rd-order component 4th-order reconstruction mse = 98.5 4th-order component 5th-order reconstruction mse = 18.5 5th-order component 6th-order reconstruction mse = 4.98 6th-order component 7th-order reconstruction mse = 1.32 7th-order component 8th-order reconstruction mse = 0.41 8th-order component Figure 2: Higher-order components and reconstructions of a photograph. Interactions up to the ﬁfth order play an important role. Note that signiﬁcant components become sparser with increasing model order. results on a set of 10 natural images of size 50 × 70 show an an approximately exponential decay of the reconstruction error when more and more higher-order terms are added to the reconstruction (Fig. 3). Interestingly, terms up to order 5 still play a signiﬁcant role, although the image regions with a signiﬁcant component become sparser with increasing model order (see Fig. 2). Note that the nonlinear terms reduce the reconstruction error to almost 0. This suggests a high degree of higher-order redundancy in natural images that cannot be exploited by the usual linear prediction models. 4 Conclusion The implicit estimation of Wiener functionals via polynomial kernels opens up new possibilities for the estimation of higher-order image statistics. Compared to the classical methods such as higher-order spectra, moments or cumulants, our approach avoids the combinatorial explosion caused by the exponential increase of the number of terms to be estimated and interpreted. When put into a predictive framework, multiplicative pixel interactions of different orders are easily visualized and conform to the intuitive notions about image structures such as edges, lines, crossings or corners. There is no one-to-one mapping between the classical higher-order statistics and multiplicative pixel interactions. Any nonlinear Wiener functional, for instance, creates inﬁnitely many correlations or cumulants of higher order, and often also of lower order. On the other 700 Figure 3: Mean square reconstruction error of 600 models of different order for a set of 10 natural images. mse 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 model order hand, a Wiener functional of order n produces only harmonic phase interactions up to order n + 1, but sometimes also of lower orders. Thus, when one analyzes a classical statistic of a given order, one often cannot determine by which order of pixel interaction it was created. In contrast, our method is able to isolate image components that are created by a single order of interaction. Although of preliminary nature, our results on natural images suggest an important role of statistics up to the ﬁfth order. Most of the currently used low-level feature detectors such as edge or corner detectors maximally use third-order interactions. The investigation of fourth- or higher-order features is a ﬁeld that might lead to new insights into the nature and role of higher-order image structures. As often observed in the literature (e.g. [2][7]), our results seem to conﬁrm that a large proportion of the redundancy in natural images is contained in the higher-order pixel interactions. Before any further conclusions can be drawn, however, our study needs to be extended in several directions: 1. A representative image database has to be analyzed. The images must be carefully calibrated since nonlinear statistics can be highly calibrationsensitive. In addition, the contribution of image noise has to be investigated. 2. Currently, only images up to 9000 pixels can be analyzed due to the matrix inversion required by Eq. 11. To accomodate for larger images, our method has to be reformulated in an iterative algorithm. 3. So far, we only considered 5 × 5-patches. To systematically investigate patch size effects, the analysis has to be conducted in a multi-scale framework. References [1] T. J. Dodd and R. F. Harrison.

<p>Author: Hyun J. Park, Te W. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Capturing dependencies in images in an unsupervised manner is important for many image processing applications. We propose a new method for capturing nonlinear dependencies in images of natural scenes. This method is an extension of the linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method by building a hierarchical model based on ICA and mixture of Laplacian distribution. The model parameters are learned via an EM algorithm and it can accurately capture variance correlation and other high order structures in a simple manner. We visualize the learned variance structure and demonstrate applications to image segmentation and denoising. 1 In trod u ction Unsupervised learning has become an important tool for understanding biological information processing and building intelligent signal processing methods. Real biological systems however are much more robust and flexible than current artificial intelligence mostly due to a much more efficient representations used in biological systems. Therefore, unsupervised learning algorithms that capture more sophisticated representations can provide a better understanding of neural information processing and also provide improved algorithm for signal processing applications. For example, independent component analysis (ICA) can learn representations similar to simple cell receptive fields in visual cortex [1] and is also applied for feature extraction, image segmentation and denoising [2,3]. ICA can approximate statistics of natural image patches by Eq.(1,2), where X is the data and u is a source signal whose distribution is a product of sparse distributions like a generalized Laplacian distribution. X = Au (1) P (u ) = ∏ P (u i ) (2) But the representation learned by the ICA algorithm is relatively low-level. In biological systems there are more high-level representations such as contours, textures and objects, which are not well represented by the linear ICA model. ICA learns only linear dependency between pixels by finding strongly correlated linear axis. Therefore, the modeling capability of ICA is quite limited. Previous approaches showed that one can learn more sophisticated high-level representations by capturing nonlinear dependencies in a post-processing step after the ICA step [4,5,6,7,8]. The focus of these efforts has centered on variance correlation in natural images. After ICA, a source signal is not linearly predictable from others. However, given variance dependencies, a source signal is still ‘predictable’ in a nonlinear manner. It is not possible to de-correlate this variance dependency using a linear transformation. Several researchers have proposed extensions to capture the nonlinear dependencies. Portilla et al. used Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) to model variance dependency in wavelet domain. This model can learn variance correlation in source prior and showed improvement in image denoising [4]. But in this model, dependency is defined only between a subset of wavelet coefficients. Hyvarinen and Hoyer suggested using a special variance related distribution to model the variance correlated source prior. This model can learn grouping of dependent sources (Subspace ICA) or topographic arrangements of correlated sources (Topographic ICA) [5,6]. Similarly, Welling et al. suggested a product of expert model where each expert represents a variance correlated group [7]. The product form of the model enables applications to image denoising. But these models don’t reveal higher-order structures explicitly. Our model is motivated by Lewicki and Karklin who proposed a 2-stage model where the 1st stage is an ICA model (Eq. (3)) and the 2 nd-stage is a linear generative model where another source v generates logarithmic variance for the 1st stage (Eq. (4)) [8]. This model captures variance dependency structure explicitly, but treating variance as an additional random variable introduces another level of complexity and requires several approximations. Thus, it is difficult to obtain a simple analytic PDF of source signal u and to apply the model for image processing problems. ( P (u | λ ) = c exp − u / λ q ) (3) log[λ ] = Bv (4) We propose a hierarchical model based on ICA and a mixture of Laplacian distribution. Our model can be considered as a simplification of model in [8] by constraining v to be 0/1 random vector where only one element can be 1. Our model is computationally simpler but still can capture variance dependency. Experiments show that our model can reveal higher order structures similar to [8]. In addition, our model provides a simple parametric PDF of variance correlated priors, which is an important advantage for adaptive signal processing. Utilizing this, we demonstrate simple applications on image segmentation and image denoising. Our model provides an improved statistic model for natural images and can be used for other applications including feature extraction, image coding, or learning even higher order structures. 2 Modeling nonlinear dependencies We propose a hierarchical or 2-stage model where the 1 st stage is an ICA source signal model and the 2nd stage is modeled by a mixture model with different variances (figure 1). In natural images, the correlation of variance reflects different types of regularities in the real world. Such specialized regularities can be summarized as “context” information. To model the context dependent variance correlation, we use mixture models where Laplacian distributions with different variance represent different contexts. For each image patch, a context variable Z “selects” which Laplacian distribution will represent ICA source signal u. Laplacian distributions have 0-mean but different variances. The advantage of Laplacian distribution for modeling context is that we can model a sparse distribution using only one Laplacian distribution. But we need more than two Gaussian distributions to do the same thing. Also conventional ICA is a special case of our model with one Laplacian. We define the mixture model and its learning algorithm in the next sections. Figure 1: Proposed hierarchical model (1st stage is ICA generative model. 2nd stage is mixture of “context dependent” Laplacian distributions which model U. Z is a random variable that selects a Laplacian distribution that generates the given image patch) 2.1 Mixture of Laplacian Distribution We define a PDF for mixture of M-dimensional Laplacian Distribution as Eq.(5), where N is the number of data samples, and K is the number of mixtures.

The log likelihood and its expectation can be computed as in Eq.(7,8).   u 1 n n log P(U , Z | Λ, Π ) = ∑  z k log(π k ) + ∑ z k  log( ) − n ,m  2λk ,m λk , m n ,k  m       (7)   u 1 n E {log P (U , Z | Λ, Π )} = ∑ E z k log(π k ) + ∑  log( ) − n ,m  2λ k , m λk , m n ,k m    { }     (8) The expectation in Eq.(8) can be evaluated, if we are given the data U and estimated parameters Λ and Π.

Eq.(9,10) can be computed using Λ’ and Π’ estimated in the previous iteration of EM algorithm. This is E-step of EM algorithm. Then in M-step of EM algorithm, we need to maximize Eq.(8) over parameter Λ and Π. First, we can maximize Eq.(8) with respect to Λ, by setting the derivative as 0.  1 u n,m  ∂E{log P (U , Z | Λ, Π )} n  = 0 = ∑ E z k  − +  λ k , m (λ k , m ) 2   ∂λ k ,m  n   { } ⇒ λ k ,m ∑ E{z }⋅ u = ∑ E{z } n k n ,m n (11) n k n Second, for maximization of Eq.(8) with respect to Π, we can rewrite Eq.(8) as below. n (12) E {log P (U , Z | Λ , Π )} = C + ∑ E {z k ' }log(π k ' ) n ,k ' As we see, the derivative of Eq.(12) with respect to Π cannot be 0. Instead, we need to use Lagrange multiplier method for maximization. A Lagrange function can be defined as Eq.(14) where ρ is a Lagrange multiplier. { } (13) n L (Π , ρ ) = − ∑ E z k ' log(π k ' ) + ρ (∑ π k ' − 1) n,k ' k' By setting the derivative of Eq.(13) to be 0 with respect to ρ and Π, we can simply get the maximization solution with respect to Π.

We also provide visualization of learned variances that reveal the structure of variance correlation and an application to image denoising. 3.1 Learning Nonlinear Dependencies in Natural images As shown in figure 1, the 1 st stage of the proposed model is simply the linear ICA. The ICA matrix A and W(=A-1) are learned by the FastICA algorithm [9]. We sampled 105(=N) data from 16x16 patches (256 dim.) of natural images and use them for both first and second stage learning. ICA input dimension is 256, and source dimension is set to be 160(=M). The learned ICA basis is partially shown in figure 1. The 2nd stage mixture model is learned given the ICA source signals. In the 2 nd stage the number of mixtures is set to 16, 64, or 256(=K). Training by the EM algorithm is fast and several hundred iterations are sufficient for convergence (0.5 hour on a 1.7GHz Pentium PC). For the visualization of learned variance, we adapted the visualization method from [8]. Each dimension of ICA source signal corresponds to an ICA basis (columns of A) and each ICA basis is localized in both image and frequency space. Then for each Laplacian distribution, we can display its variance vector as a set of points in image and frequency space. Each point can be color coded by variance value as figure 3. (a1) (a2) (b1) (b2) Figure 3: Visualization of learned variances (a1 and a2 visualize variance of Laplacian #4 and b1 and 2 show that of Laplacian #5. High variance value is mapped to red color and low variance is mapped to blue. In Laplacian #4, variances for diagonally oriented edges are high. But in Laplacian #5, variances for edges at spatially right position are high. Variance structures are related to “contexts” in the image. For example, Laplacian #4 explains image patches that have oriented textures or edges. Laplacian #5 captures patches where left side of the patch is clean but right side is filled with randomly oriented edges.) A key idea of our model is that we can mix up independent distributions to get nonlinearly dependent distribution. This modeling power can be shown by figure 4. Figure 4: Joint distribution of nonlinearly dependent sources. ((a) is a joint histogram of 2 ICA sources, (b) is computed from learned mixture model, and (c) is from learned Laplacian model. In (a), variance of u2 is smaller than u1 at center area (arrow A), but almost equal to u1 at outside (arrow B). So the variance of u2 is dependent on u1. This nonlinear dependency is closely approximated by mixture model in (b), but not in (c).) 3.2 Unsupervised Image Segmentation The idea behind our model is that the image can be modeled as mixture of different variance correlated “contexts”. We show how the learned model can be used to classify different context by an unsupervised image segmentation task. Given learned model and data, we can compute the expectation of a hidden variable Z from Eq. (9). Then for an image patch, we can select a Laplacian distribution with highest probability, which is the most explaining Laplacian or “context”. For segmentation, we use the model with 16 Laplacians. This enables abstract partitioning of images and we can visualize organization of images more clearly (figure 5). Figure 5: Unsupervised image segmentation (left is original image, middle is color labeled image, right image shows color coded Laplacians with variance structure. Each color corresponds to a Laplacian distribution, which represents surface or textural organization of underlying contexts. Laplacian #14 captures smooth surface and Laplacian #9 captures contrast between clear sky and textured ground scenes.) 3.3 Application to Image Restoration The proposed mixture model provides a better parametric model of the ICA source distribution and hence an improved model of the image structure. An advantage is in the MAP (maximum a posterior) estimation of a noisy image. If we assume Gaussian noise n, the image generation model can be written as Eq.(15). Then, we can compute MAP estimation of ICA source signal u by Eq.(16) and reconstruct the original image. (15) X = Au + n (16) ˆ u = argmax log P (u | X , A) = argmax (log P ( X | u , A) + log P (u ) ) u u Since we assumed Gaussian noise, P(X|u,A) in Eq. (16) is Gaussian. P(u) in Eq. (16) can be modeled as a Laplacian or a mixture of Laplacian distribution. The mixture distribution can be approximated by a maximum explaining Laplacian. We evaluated 3 different methods for image restoration including ICA MAP estimation with simple Laplacian prior, same with Laplacian mixture prior, and the Wiener filter. Figure 6 shows an example and figure 7 summarizes the results obtained with different noise levels. As shown MAP estimation with the mixture prior performs better than the others in terms of SNR and SSIM (Structural Similarity Measure) [10].

The proposed mixture of Laplacian distribution model is a generalization of the conventional independent source priors and can model variance dependency given natural image signals. Experiments show that the proposed model can learn the variance correlated signals grouped as different mixtures and learn highlevel structures, which are highly correlated with the underlying physical properties captured in the image. Our model provides an analytic prior of nearly independent and variance-correlated signals, which was not viable in previous models [4,5,6,7,8]. The learned variances of the mixture model show structured localization in image and frequency space, which are similar to the result in [8]. Since the model is given no information about the spatial location or frequency of the source signals, we can assume that the dependency captured by the mixture model reveals regularity in the natural images. As shown in image labeling experiments, such regularities correspond to specific surface types (textures) or boundaries between surfaces. The learned mixture model can be used to discover hidden contexts that generated such regularity or correlated signal groups. Experiments also show that the labeling of image patches is highly correlated with the object surface types shown in the image. The segmentation results show regularity across image space and strong correlation with high-level concepts. Finally, we showed applications of the model for image restoration. We compare the performance with the conventional ICA MAP estimation and Wiener filter. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms other traditional methods. It is due to the estimation of the correlated variance structure, which provides an improved prior that has not been considered in other methods. In our future work, we plan to exploit the regularity of the image segmentation result to lean more high-level structures by building additional hierarchies on the current model. Furthermore, the application to image coding seems promising. References [1] A. J. Bell and T. J.

<p>Author: Yoshitatsu Matsuda, Kazunori Yamaguchi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, linear multilayer ICA (LMICA) is proposed for extracting independent components from quite high-dimensional observed signals such as large-size natural scenes. There are two phases in each layer of LMICA. One is the mapping phase, where a one-dimensional mapping is formed by a stochastic gradient algorithm which makes more highlycorrelated (non-independent) signals be nearer incrementally. Another is the local-ICA phase, where each neighbor (namely, highly-correlated) pair of signals in the mapping is separated by the MaxKurt algorithm. Because LMICA separates only the highly-correlated pairs instead of all ones, it can extract independent components quite efﬁciently from appropriate observed signals. In addition, it is proved that LMICA always converges. Some numerical experiments verify that LMICA is quite efﬁcient and effective in large-size natural image processing.</p><p>6 0.47058749 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Nonlinear_Blind_Source_Separation_by_Integrating_Independent_Component_Analysis_and_Slow_Feature_Analysis.html">132 nips-2004-Nonlinear Blind Source Separation by Integrating Independent Component Analysis and Slow Feature Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: It has been suggested that the primary goal of the sensory system is to represent input in such a way as to reduce the high degree of redundancy. Given a noisy neural representation, however, solely reducing redundancy is not desirable, since redundancy is the only clue to reduce the effects of noise. Here we propose a model that best balances redundancy reduction and redundant representation. Like previous models, our model accounts for the localized and oriented structure of simple cells, but it also predicts a different organization for the population. With noisy, limited-capacity units, the optimal representation becomes an overcomplete, multi-scale representation, which, compared to previous models, is in closer agreement with physiological data. These results offer a new perspective on the expansion of the number of neurons from retina to V1 and provide a theoretical model of incorporating useful redundancy into efﬁcient neural representations. 1</p><p>2 0.82573634 <a title="172-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Brain_Inspired_Reinforcement_Learning.html">33 nips-2004-Brain Inspired Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Françcois Rivest, Yoshua Bengio, John Kalaska</p><p>Abstract: Successful application of reinforcement learning algorithms often involves considerable hand-crafting of the necessary non-linear features to reduce the complexity of the value functions and hence to promote convergence of the algorithm. In contrast, the human brain readily and autonomously finds the complex features when provided with sufficient training. Recent work in machine learning and neurophysiology has demonstrated the role of the basal ganglia and the frontal cortex in mammalian reinforcement learning. This paper develops and explores new reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by neurological evidence that provides potential new approaches to the feature construction problem.

<p>Author: Evan C. Smith, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: The representation of acoustic signals at the cochlear nerve must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require exquisite sensitivity in both time and frequency. Lewicki (2002) demonstrated that many of the ﬁltering properties of the cochlea could be explained in terms of efﬁcient coding of natural sounds. This model, however, did not account for properties such as phase-locking or how sound could be encoded in terms of action potentials. Here, we extend this theoretical approach with algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a spiking population code. Here, we propose an algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a theoretical model for coding sound in terms of spikes. In this model, each spike encodes the precise time position and magnitude of a localized, time varying kernel function. By adapting the kernel functions to the statistics natural sounds, we show that, compared to conventional signal representations, the spike code achieves far greater coding efﬁciency. Furthermore, the inferred kernels show both striking similarities to measured cochlear ﬁlters and a similar bandwidth versus frequency dependence. 1</p><p>4 0.66568339 <a title="172-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty.html">178 nips-2004-Support Vector Classification with Input Data Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria-florina Balcan, Avrim Blum, Ke Yang</p><p>Abstract: Co-training is a method for combining labeled and unlabeled data when examples can be thought of as containing two distinct sets of features. It has had a number of practical successes, yet previous theoretical analyses have needed very strong assumptions on the data that are unlikely to be satisﬁed in practice. In this paper, we propose a much weaker “expansion” assumption on the underlying data distribution, that we prove is sufﬁcient for iterative cotraining to succeed given appropriately strong PAC-learning algorithms on each feature set, and that to some extent is necessary as well. This expansion assumption in fact motivates the iterative nature of the original co-training algorithm, unlike stronger assumptions (such as independence given the label) that allow a simpler one-shot co-training to succeed. We also heuristically analyze the effect on performance of noise in the data. Predicted behavior is qualitatively matched in synthetic experiments on expander graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.65481365 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Breaking_SVM_Complexity_with_Cross-Training.html">34 nips-2004-Breaking SVM Complexity with Cross-Training</a></p>

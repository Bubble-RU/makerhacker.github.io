<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether from quantization or other simpliﬁed message representations or from stochastic approximation methods. Introducing such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to adversely affect the solution obtained. We analyze this effect with respect to a particular measure of message error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This leads both to convergence conditions and error bounds in traditional and approximate BP message passing. 1</p><p>3 0.25578636 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Expectation_Consistent_Free_Energies_for_Approximate_Inference.html">63 nips-2004-Expectation Consistent Free Energies for Approximate Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel a framework for deriving approximations for intractable probabilistic models. This framework is based on a free energy (negative log marginal likelihood) and can be seen as a generalization of adaptive TAP [1, 2, 3] and expectation propagation (EP) [4, 5]. The free energy is constructed from two approximating distributions which encode different aspects of the intractable model such a single node constraints and couplings and are by construction consistent on a chosen set of moments. We test the framework on a difﬁcult benchmark problem with binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grid graphs. We ﬁnd good performance using sets of moments which either specify factorized nodes or a spanning tree on the nodes (structured approximation). Surprisingly, the Bethe approximation gives very inferior results even on grids. 1</p><p>4 0.1053704 <a title="203-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_on_Directed_Graphs.html">165 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning on Directed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Thomas Hofmann, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graph in which some of the nodes are labeled, we investigate the question of how to exploit the link structure of the graph to infer the labels of the remaining unlabeled nodes. To that extent we propose a regularization framework for functions deﬁned over nodes of a directed graph that forces the classiﬁcation function to change slowly on densely linked subgraphs. A powerful, yet computationally simple classiﬁcation algorithm is derived within the proposed framework. The experimental evaluation on real-world Web classiﬁcation problems demonstrates encouraging results that validate our approach. 1</p><p>5 0.10440401 <a title="203-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Occlusion_Reasoning_for_Tracking_with_Nonparametric_Belief_Propagation.html">55 nips-2004-Distributed Occlusion Reasoning for Tracking with Nonparametric Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Mandel, William T. Freeman, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We describe a three–dimensional geometric hand model suitable for visual tracking applications. The kinematic constraints implied by the model’s joints have a probabilistic structure which is well described by a graphical model. Inference in this model is complicated by the hand’s many degrees of freedom, as well as multimodal likelihoods caused by ambiguous image measurements. We use nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) to develop a tracking algorithm which exploits the graph’s structure to control complexity, while avoiding costly discretization. While kinematic constraints naturally have a local structure, self– occlusions created by the imaging process lead to complex interpendencies in color and edge–based likelihood functions. However, we show that local structure may be recovered by introducing binary hidden variables describing the occlusion state of each pixel. We augment the NBP algorithm to infer these occlusion variables in a distributed fashion, and then analytically marginalize over them to produce hand position estimates which properly account for occlusion events. We provide simulations showing that NBP may be used to reﬁne inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences. 1</p><p>6 0.098683462 <a title="203-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Comparing_Beliefs%2C_Surveys%2C_and_Random_Walks.html">41 nips-2004-Comparing Beliefs, Surveys, and Random Walks</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Aurell, Uri Gordon, Scott Kirkpatrick</p><p>Abstract: Survey propagation is a powerful technique from statistical physics that has been applied to solve the 3-SAT problem both in principle and in practice. We give, using only probability arguments, a common derivation of survey propagation, belief propagation and several interesting hybrid methods. We then present numerical experiments which use WSAT (a widely used random-walk based SAT solver) to quantify the complexity of the 3-SAT formulae as a function of their parameters, both as randomly generated and after simpli£cation, guided by survey propagation. Some properties of WSAT which have not previously been reported make it an ideal tool for this purpose – its mean cost is proportional to the number of variables in the formula (at a £xed ratio of clauses to variables) in the easy-SAT regime and slightly beyond, and its behavior in the hardSAT regime appears to re¤ect the underlying structure of the solution space that has been predicted by replica symmetry-breaking arguments. An analysis of the tradeoffs between the various methods of search for satisfying assignments shows WSAT to be far more powerful than has been appreciated, and suggests some interesting new directions for practical algorithm development. 1</p><p>5 0.47903585 <a title="203-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Modelling_Uncertainty_in_the_Game_of_Go.html">122 nips-2004-Modelling Uncertainty in the Game of Go</a></p>
<p>Author: David H. Stern, Thore Graepel, David MacKay</p><p>Abstract: Go is an ancient oriental game whose complexity has defeated attempts to automate it. We suggest using probability in a Bayesian sense to model the uncertainty arising from the vast complexity of the game tree. We present a simple conditional Markov random ﬁeld model for predicting the pointwise territory outcome of a game. The topology of the model reﬂects the spatial structure of the Go board. We describe a version of the Swendsen-Wang process for sampling from the model during learning and apply loopy belief propagation for rapid inference and prediction. The model is trained on several hundred records of professional games. Our experimental results indicate that the model successfully learns to predict territory despite its simplicity. 1</p><p>6 0.38751227 <a title="203-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Occlusion_Reasoning_for_Tracking_with_Nonparametric_Belief_Propagation.html">55 nips-2004-Distributed Occlusion Reasoning for Tracking with Nonparametric Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Andrea Tironi, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of hierarchical classiﬁcation when labels corresponding to partial and/or multiple paths in the underlying taxonomy are allowed. We introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, implementing the simple intuition that additional mistakes in the subtree of a mistaken class should not be charged for. Based on a probabilistic data model introduced in earlier work, we derive the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. We then empirically compare two incremental approximations of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer with a ﬂat SVM classiﬁer and with classiﬁers obtained by using hierarchical versions of the Perceptron and SVM algorithms. The experiments show that our simplest incremental approximation of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer performs, after just one training epoch, nearly as well as the hierarchical SVM classiﬁer (which performs best). For the same incremental algorithm we also derive an H-loss bound showing, when data are generated by our probabilistic data model, exponentially fast convergence to the H-loss of the hierarchical classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. 1 Introduction and basic deﬁnitions We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy of labels, where the taxonomy is speciﬁed as a tree forest. We assume that every data instance is labelled with a (possibly empty) set of class labels called multilabel, with the only requirement that multilabels including some node i in the taxonony must also include all ancestors of i. Thus, each multilabel corresponds to the union of one or more paths in the forest, where each path must start from a root but it can terminate on an internal node (rather than a leaf). Learning algorithms for hierarchical classiﬁcation have been investigated in, e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20]. However, the scenario where labelling includes multiple and partial paths has received very little attention. The analysis in [5], which is mainly theoretical, shows in the multiple and partial path case a 0/1-loss bound for a hierarchical learning algorithm based on regularized least-squares estimates. In this work we extend [5] in several ways. First, we introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, which is better suited than the 0/1-loss to analyze hierarchical classiﬁcation tasks, and we derive the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer under the parametric data model introduced in [5]. Second, considering various loss functions, including the H-loss, we empirically compare the performance of the following three incremental kernel-based ∗ This work was supported in part by the PASCAL Network of Excellence under EC grant no. 506778. This publication only reﬂects the authors’ views. algorithms: 1) a hierarchical version of the classical Perceptron algorithm [16]; 2) an approximation to the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer; 3) a simpliﬁed variant of this approximation. Finally, we show that, assuming data are indeed generated according to the parametric model mentioned before, the H-loss of the algorithm in 3) converges to the H-loss of the classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. Our incremental algorithms are based on training linear-threshold classiﬁers in each node of the taxonomy. A similar approach has been studied in [8], though their model does not consider multiple-path classiﬁcations as we do. Incremental algorithms are the main focus of this research, since we strongly believe that they are a key tool for coping with tasks where large quantities of data items are generated and the classiﬁcation system needs to be frequently adjusted to keep up with new items. However, we found it useful to provide a reference point for our empirical results. Thus we have also included in our experiments the results achieved by nonincremental algorithms. In particular, we have chosen a ﬂat and a hierarchical version of SVM [21, 7, 19], which are known to perform well on the textual datasets considered here. We assume data elements are encoded as real vectors x ∈ Rd which we call instances. A multilabel for an instance x is any subset of the set {1, . . . , N } of all labels/classes, including the empty set. We denote the multilabel associated with x by a vector y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N , where i belongs to the multilabel of x if and only if yi = 1. A taxonomy G is a forest whose trees are deﬁned over the set of labels. A multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N is said to respect a taxonomy G if and only if y is the union of one or more paths in G, where each path starts from a root but need not terminate on a leaf. See Figure 1. We assume the data-generating mechanism produces examples (x, y) such that y respects some ﬁxed underlying taxonomy G with N nodes. The set of roots in G is denoted by root(G). We use par(i) to denote the unique parent of node i, anc(i) to denote the set of ancestors of i, and sub(i) to denote the set of nodes in the subtree rooted at i (including i). Finally, given a predicate φ over a set Ω, we will use {φ} to denote both the subset of Ω where φ is true and the indicator function of this subset. 2 The H-loss Though several hierarchical losses have been proposed in the literature (e.g., in [11, 20]), no one has emerged as a standard yet. Since hierarchical losses are deﬁned over multilabels, we start by considering two very simple functions measuring the discrepancy between multilabels y = (y1 , ..., yN ) and y = (y1 , ..., yN ): the 0/1-loss 0/1 (y, y) = {∃i : yi = yi } and the symmetric difference loss ∆ (y, y) = {y1 = y1 } + . . . + {yN = yN }. There are several ways of making these losses depend on a given taxonomy G. In this work, we follow the intuition “if a mistake is made at node i, then further mistakes made in the subtree rooted at i are unimportant”. That is, we do not require the algorithm be able to make ﬁne-grained distinctions on tasks when it is unable to make coarse-grained ones. For example, if an algorithm failed to label a document with the class SPORTS, then the algorithm should not be charged more loss because it also failed to label the same document with the subclass SOCCER and the sub-subclass CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. A function implementing this intuition is deﬁned by N H (y, y) = i=1 ci {yi = yi ∧ yj = yj , j ∈ anc(i)}, where c1 , . . . , cN > 0 are ﬁxed cost coefﬁcients. This loss, which we call H-loss, can also be described as follows: all paths in G from a root down to a leaf are examined and, whenever we encounter a node i such that yi = yi , we add ci to the loss, whereas all the loss contributions in the subtree rooted at i are discarded. Note that if c1 = . . . = cN = 1 then 0/1 ≤ H ≤ ∆ . Choices of ci depending on the structure of G are proposed in Section 4. Given a multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N deﬁne its G-truncation as the multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N where, for each i = 1, . . . , N , yi = 1 iff yi = 1 and yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Note that the G-truncation of any multilabel always respects G. A graphical (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: A one-tree forest (repeated four times). Each node corresponds to a class in the taxonomy G, hence in this case N = 12. Gray nodes are included in the multilabel under consideration, white nodes are not.

(d) Superposition of multilabel (b) on multilabel (c): Only the checked nodes contribute to the H-loss between (b) and (c). representation of the notions introduced so far is given in Figure 1. In the next lemma we show that whenever y respects G, then H (y, y) cannot be smaller than H (y , y). In other words, when the multilabel y to be predicted respects a taxonomy G then there is no loss of generality in restricting to predictions which respect G. Lemma 1 Let G be a taxonomy, y, y ∈ {0, 1}N be two multilabels such that y respects G, and y be the G-truncation of y. Then H (y , y) ≤ H (y, y) . Proof. For each i = 1, . . . , N we show that yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i) implies yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Pick some i and suppose yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Now suppose yj = 0 (and thus yj = 0) for some j ∈ anc(i). Then yi = 0 since y respects G. But this implies yi = 1, contradicting the fact that the G-truncation y respects G. Therefore, it must be the case that yj = yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Hence the G-truncation of y left each node j ∈ anc(i) unchanged, implying yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). But, since the G-truncation of y does not change the value of a node i whose ancestors j are such that yj = 1, this also implies yi = yi . Therefore yi = yi and the proof is concluded. 3 A probabilistic data model Our learning algorithms are based on the following statistical model for the data, originally introduced in [5]. The model deﬁnes a probability distribution fG over the set of multilabels respecting a given taxonomy G by associating with each node i of G a Bernoulli random variable Yi and deﬁning fG (y | x) = N i=1 P Yi = yi | Ypar(i) = ypar(i) , X = x . To guarantee that fG (y | x) = 0 whenever y ∈ {0, 1}N does not respect G, we set P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 0, X = x = 0. Notice that this deﬁnition of fG makes the (rather simplistic) assumption that all Yk with the same parent node i (i.e., the children of i) are independent when conditioned on Yi and x. Through fG we specify an i.i.d. process {(X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . .}, where, for t = 1, 2, . . ., the multilabel Y t is distributed according to fG (· | X t ) and X t is distributed according to a ﬁxed and unknown distribution D. Each example (xt , y t ) is thus a realization of the corresponding pair (X t , Y t ) of random variables. Our parametric model for fG is described as follows. First, we assume that the support of D is the surface of the d-dimensional unit sphere (i.e., instances x ∈ R d are such that ||x|| = 1). With each node i in the taxonomy, we associate a unit-norm weight vector ui ∈ Rd . Then, we deﬁne the conditional probabilities for a nonroot node i with parent j by P (Yi = 1 | Yj = 1, X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. If i is a root node, the previous equation simpliﬁes to P (Yi = 1 | X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. 3.1 The Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss We now describe a classiﬁer, called H - BAYES, that is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. In other words, H - BAYES classiﬁes any instance x with the multilabel y = argminy∈{0,1} E[ H (¯ , Y ) | x ]. Deﬁne pi (x) = P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 1, X = x . y ¯ When no ambiguity arises, we write pi instead of pi (x). Now, ﬁx any unit-length instance x and let y be a multilabel that respects G. For each node i in G, recursively deﬁne H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + k∈child(i) H k,x (y) . The classiﬁer H - BAYES operates as follows. It starts by putting all nodes of G in a set S; nodes are then removed from S one by one. A node i can be removed only if i is a leaf or if all nodes j in the subtree rooted at i have been already removed. When i is removed, its value yi is set to 1 if and only if pi 2 − k∈child(i) H k,x (y)/ci ≥ 1 . (1) (Note that if i is a leaf then (1) is equivalent to yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}.) If yi is set to zero, then all nodes in the subtree rooted at i are set to zero. Theorem 2 For any taxonomy G and all unit-length x ∈ Rd , the multilabel generated by H - BAYES is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁcation of x for the H-loss. Proof sketch. Let y be the multilabel assigned by H - BAYES and y ∗ be any multilabel minimizing the expected H-loss. Introducing the short-hand Ex [·] = E[· | x], we can write Ex H (y, Y )= N i=1 ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} . Note that we can recursively decompose the expected H-loss as Ex H (y, Y )= i∈root(G) where Ex Hi (y, Y ) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) Ex Hi (y, Y ), pj {yj = 1} + j∈anc(i) Ex Hk (y, Y ) . (2) k∈child(i) ∗ Pick a node i. If i is a leaf, then the sum in the RHS of (2) disappears and yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}, ∗ which is also the minimizer of H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ), implying yi = yi . ∗ Now let i be an internal node and inductively assume yj = yj for all j ∈ sub(i). Notice ∗ that the factors j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} occur in both terms in the RHS of (2). Hence yi does not depend on these factors and we can equivalently minimize ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + pi {yi = 1} k∈child(i) H k,x (y), (3) where we noted that, for each k ∈ child(i), Ex Hk (y, Y ) = j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} pi {yi = 1}H k,x (y) . ∗ Now observe that yi minimizing (3) is equivalent to the assignment produced by H - BAYES. ∗ ∗ To conclude the proof, note that whenever yi = 0, Lemma 1 requires that yj = 0 for all nodes j ∈ sub(i), which is exactly what H - BAYES does. 4 The algorithms We consider three incremental algorithms. Each one of these algorithms learns a hierarchical classiﬁer by training a decision function gi : Rd → {0, 1} at each node i = 1, . . . , N . For a given set g1 , . . . , gN of decision functions, the hierarchical classiﬁer generated by these algorithms classiﬁes an instance x through a multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) deﬁned as follows: yi = gi (x) 0 if i ∈ root(G) or yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i) otherwise. (4) Note that y computed this way respects G. The classiﬁers (4) are trained incrementally. Let gi,t be the decision function at node i after training on the ﬁrst t − 1 examples. When the next training example (xt , y t ) is available, the algorithms compute the multilabel y t using classiﬁer (4) based on g1,t (xt ), . . . , gN,t (xt ). Then, the algorithms consider for an update only those decision functions sitting at nodes i satisfying either i ∈ root(G) or ypar(i),t = 1. We call such nodes eligible at time t. The decision functions of all other nodes are left unchanged. The ﬁrst algorithm we consider is a simple hierarchical version of the Perceptron algorithm [16], which we call H - PERC. The decision functions at time t are deﬁned by gi,t (xt ) = {wi,t xt ≥ 0}. In the update phase, the Perceptron rule wi,t+1 = wi,t + yi,t xt is applied to every node i eligible at time t and such that yi,t = yi,t . The second algorithm, called APPROX - H - BAYES, approximates the H - BAYES classiﬁer of Section 3.1 by replacing the unknown quantities pi (xt ) with estimates (1+w i,t xt )/2. The weights w i,t are regularized least-squares estimates deﬁned by (i) wi,t = (I + Si,t−1 Si,t−1 + xt xt )−1 Si,t−1 y t−1 . (5) The columns of the matrix Si,t−1 are all past instances xs that have been stored at node i; (i) the s-th component of vector y t−1 is the i-th component yi,s of the multilabel y s associated with instance xs . In the update phase, an instance xt is stored at node i, causing an update of wi,t , whenever i is eligible at time t and |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t , where Ni,t is the number of instances stored at node i up to time t − 1. The corresponding decision functions gi,t are of the form gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ τi,t }, where the threshold τi,t ≥ 0 at node i depends on the margin values w j,t xt achieved by nodes j ∈ sub(i) — recall (1). Note that gi,t is not a linear-threshold function, as xt appears in the deﬁnition of w i,t . The margin threshold (5 ln t)/Ni,t , controlling the update of node i at time t, reduces the space requirements of the classiﬁer by keeping matrices Si,t suitably small. This threshold is motivated by the work [4] on selective sampling. The third algorithm, which we call H - RLS (Hierarchical Regularized Least Squares), is a simpliﬁed variant of APPROX - H - BAYES in which the thresholds τi,t are set to zero. That is, we have gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ 0} where the weights w i,t are deﬁned as in (5) and updated as in the APPROX - H - BAYES algorithm. Details on how to run APPROX - H - BAYES 2 and H - RLS in dual variables and perform an update at node i in time O(Ni,t ) are found in [3] (where a mistake-driven version of H - RLS is analyzed). 5 Experimental results The empirical evaluation of the algorithms was carried out on two well-known datasets of free-text documents. The ﬁrst dataset consists of the ﬁrst (in chronological order) 100,000 newswire stories from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1, RCV1 [2]. The associated taxonomy of labels, which are the topics of the documents, has 101 nodes organized in a forest of 4 trees. The forest is shallow: the longest path has length 3 and the the distribution of nodes, sorted by increasing path length, is {0.04, 0.53, 0.42, 0.01}. For this dataset, we used the bag-of-words vectorization performed by Xerox Research Center Europe within the EC project KerMIT (see [4] for details on preprocessing). The 100,000 documents were divided into 5 equally sized groups of chronologically consecutive documents. We then used each adjacent pair of groups as training and test set in an experiment (here the ﬁfth and ﬁrst group are considered adjacent), and then averaged the test set performance over the 5 experiments. The second dataset is a speciﬁc subtree of the OHSUMED corpus of medical abstracts [1]: the subtree rooted in “Quality of Health Care” (MeSH code N05.715). After removing overlapping classes (OHSUMED is not quite a tree but a DAG), we ended up with 94 Table 1: Experimental results on two hierarchical text classiﬁcation tasks under various loss functions. We report average test errors along with standard deviations (in parenthesis). In bold are the best performance ﬁgures among the incremental algorithms.

We made this choice based only on the structure of the subtree: the longest path has length 4, the distribution of nodes sorted by increasing path length is {0.26, 0.37, 0.22, 0.12, 0.03}, and there are a signiﬁcant number of partial and multiple path multilabels. The vectorization of the subtree was carried out as follows: after tokenization, we removed all stopwords and also those words that did not occur at least 3 times in the corpus. Then, we vectorized the documents using the Bow library [13] with a log(1 + TF) log(IDF) encoding. We ran 5 experiments by randomly splitting the corpus in a training set of 40,000 documents and a test set of 15,503 documents. Test set performances are averages over these 5 experiments. In the training set we kept more documents than in the RCV1 splits since the OHSUMED corpus turned out to be a harder classiﬁcation problem than RCV1. In both datasets instances have been normalized to unit length. We tested the hierarchical Perceptron algorithm (H - PERC), the hierarchical regularized leastsquares algorithm (H - RLS), and the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm (APPROX - H BAYES ), all described in Section 4. The results are summarized in Table 1. APPROX - H BAYES ( AH - BAY in Table 1) was trained using cost coefﬁcients c i chosen as follows: if i ∈ root(G) then ci = |root(G)|−1 . Otherwise, ci = cj /|child(j)|, where j is the parent of i. Note that this choice of coefﬁcients amounts to splitting a unit cost equally among the roots and then splitting recursively each node’s cost equally among its children. Since, in this case, 0 ≤ H ≤ 1, we call the resulting loss normalized H-loss. We also tested a hierarchical version of SVM (denoted by H - SVM in Table 1) in which each node is an SVM classiﬁer trained using a batch version of our hierarchical learning protocol. More precisely, each node i was trained only on those examples (xt , y t ) such that ypar(i),t = 1 (note that, as no conditions are imposed on yi,t , node i is actually trained on both positive and negative examples). The resulting set of linear-threshold functions was then evaluated on the test set using the hierachical classiﬁcation scheme (4). We tried both the C and ν parametrizations [18] for SVM and found the setting C = 1 to work best for our data. 1 We ﬁnally tested the “ﬂat” variants of Perceptron and SVM, denoted by PERC and SVM. In these variants, each node is trained and evaluated independently of the others, disregarding all taxonomical information. All SVM experiments were carried out using the libSVM implementation [6]. All the tested algorithms used a linear kernel. 1 It should be emphasized that this tuning of C was actually chosen in hindsight, with no crossvalidation. As far as loss functions are concerned, we considered the 0/1-loss, the H-loss with cost coefﬁcients set to 1 (denoted by uniform H-loss), the normalized H-loss, and the symmetric difference loss (denoted by ∆-loss). Note that H - SVM performs best, but our incremental algorithms were trained for a single epoch on the training set. The good performance of SVM (the ﬂat variant of H - SVM ) is surprising. However, with a single epoch of training H - RLS does not perform worse than SVM (except on OHSUMED under the normalized H-loss) and comes reasonably close to H - SVM. On the other hand, the performance of APPROX - H - BAYES is disappointing: on OHSUMED it is the best algorithm only for the uniform H-loss, though it was trained using the normalized H-loss; on RCV1 it never outperforms H - RLS, though it always does better than PERC and H - PERC. A possible explanation for this behavior is that APPROX - H - BAYES is very sensitive to errors in the estimates of pi (x) (recall Section 3.1). Indeed, the least-squares estimates (5), which we used to approximate H - BAYES, seem to work better in practice on simpler (and possibly more robust) algorithms, such as H - RLS. The lower values of normalized H-loss on OHSUMED (a harder corpus than RCV1) can be explained because a quarter of the 94 nodes in the OHSUMED taxonomy are roots, and thus each top-level mistake is only charged about 4/94. As a ﬁnal remark, we observe that the normalized H-loss gave too small a range of values to afford ﬁne comparisons among the best performing algorithms. 6 Regret bounds for the H-loss In this section we prove a theoretical bound on the H-loss of a slight variant of the algorithm H - RLS tested in Section 5. More precisely, we assume data are generated according to the probabilistic model introduced in Section 3 with unknown instance distribution D and unknown coefﬁcients u1 , . . . , uN . We deﬁne the regret of a classiﬁer assigning label y to instance X as E H (y, Y t ) − E H (y, Y ), where the expected value is with respect the random draw of (X, Y ) and y is the multilabel assigned by classiﬁer (4) when the decision functions gi are zero-threshold functions of the form gi (x) = {ui x ≥ 0}. The theorem below shows that the regret of the classiﬁer learned by a variant of H - RLS after t training examples, with t large enough, is exponentially small in t. In other words, H - RLS learns to classify as well as the algorithm that is given the true parameters u1 , . . . , uN of the underlying data-generating process. We have been able to prove the theorem only for the variant of H - RLS storing all instances at each node. That is, every eligible node at time t is updated, irrespective of whether |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t . Given the i.i.d. data-generating process (X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . ., for each node k we deﬁne the derived process X k1 , X k2 , . . . including all and only the instances X s of the original process that satisfy Ypar(k),s = 1. We call this derived process the process at node k. Note that, for each k, the process at node k is an i.i.d. process. However, its distribution might depend on k. The spectrum of the process at node k is the set of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix with entries E[Xk1 ,i Xk1 ,j ] for i, j = 1, . . . , d. We have the following theorem, whose proof is omitted due to space limitations. Theorem 3 Let G be a taxonomy with N nodes and let fG be a joint density for G parametrized by N unit-norm vectors u1 , . . . , uN ∈ Rd . Assume the instance distribution is such that there exist γ1 , . . . , γN > 0 satisfying P |ui X t | ≥ γi = 1 for i = 1, . . . , N .

We have introduced a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, derived the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer, and empirically compared an incremental approximation to this classiﬁer with some other incremental and nonincremental algorithms. Finally, we have derived a theoretical guarantee on the H-loss of a simpliﬁed variant of the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm. Our investigation leaves several open issues. The current approximation to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer is not satisfying, and this could be due to a bad choice of the model, of the estimators, of the datasets, or of a combination of them. Also, the normalized H-loss is not fully satisfying, since the resulting values are often too small. From the theoretical viewpoint, we would like to analyze the regret of our algorithms with respect to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer, rather than with respect to a classiﬁer that makes a suboptimal use of the true model parameters.

<p>Author: Laurent Zwald, Gilles Blanchard, Pascal Massart, Régis Vert</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) within the classiﬁcation framework, essentially the regularization properties of this dimensionality reduction method. KPCA has been previously used as a pre-processing step before applying an SVM but we point out that this method is somewhat redundant from a regularization point of view and we propose a new algorithm called Kernel Projection Machine to avoid this redundancy, based on an analogy with the statistical framework of regression for a Gaussian white noise model. Preliminary experimental results show that this algorithm reaches the same performances as an SVM. 1</p><p>4 0.58948249 <a title="203-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Incremental_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">83 nips-2004-Incremental Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Jongwoo Lim, David A. Ross, Ruei-sung Lin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing tracking algorithms construct a representation of a target object prior to the tracking task starts, and utilize invariant features to handle appearance variation of the target caused by lighting, pose, and view angle change. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient and effective online algorithm that incrementally learns and adapts a low dimensional eigenspace representation to reﬂect appearance changes of the target, thereby facilitating the tracking task. Furthermore, our incremental method correctly updates the sample mean and the eigenbasis, whereas existing incremental subspace update methods ignore the fact the sample mean varies over time. The tracking problem is formulated as a state inference problem within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and a particle ﬁlter is incorporated for propagating sample distributions over time. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large pose and lighting changes. 1</p><p>5 0.48091009 <a title="203-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Limits_of_Spectral_Clustering.html">103 nips-2004-Limits of Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike V. Luxburg, Olivier Bousquet, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: An important aspect of clustering algorithms is whether the partitions constructed on ﬁnite samples converge to a useful clustering of the whole data space as the sample size increases. This paper investigates this question for normalized and unnormalized versions of the popular spectral clustering algorithm. Surprisingly, the convergence of unnormalized spectral clustering is more difﬁcult to handle than the normalized case. Even though recently some ﬁrst results on the convergence of normalized spectral clustering have been obtained, for the unnormalized case we have to develop a completely new approach combining tools from numerical integration, spectral and perturbation theory, and probability. It turns out that while in the normalized case, spectral clustering usually converges to a nice partition of the data space, in the unnormalized case the same only holds under strong additional assumptions which are not always satisﬁed. We conclude that our analysis gives strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering. It also provides a basis for future exploration of other Laplacian-based methods. 1</p><p>6 0.48027912 <a title="203-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Selective_Sampling_for_Linear-Threshold_Algorithms.html">206 nips-2004-Worst-Case Analysis of Selective Sampling for Linear-Threshold Algorithms</a></p>

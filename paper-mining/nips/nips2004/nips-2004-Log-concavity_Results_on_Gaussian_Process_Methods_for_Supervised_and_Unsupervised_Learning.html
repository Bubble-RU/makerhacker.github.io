<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Rama Natarajan, Peter Dayan, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: As animals interact with their environments, they must constantly update estimates about their states. Bayesian models combine prior probabilities, a dynamical model and sensory evidence to update estimates optimally. These models are consistent with the results of many diverse psychophysical studies. However, little is known about the neural representation and manipulation of such Bayesian information, particularly in populations of spiking neurons. We consider this issue, suggesting a model based on standard neural architecture and activations. We illustrate the approach on a simple random walk example, and apply it to a sensorimotor integration task that provides a particularly compelling example of dynamic probabilistic computation. Bayesian models have been used to explain a gamut of experimental results in tasks which require estimates to be derived from multiple sensory cues. These include a wide range of psychophysical studies of perception;13 motor action;7 and decision-making.3, 5 Central to Bayesian inference is that computations are sensitive to uncertainties about afferent and efferent quantities, arising from ignorance, noise, or inherent ambiguity (e.g., the aperture problem), and that these uncertainties change over time as information accumulates and dissipates. Understanding how neurons represent and manipulate uncertain quantities is therefore key to understanding the neural instantiation of these Bayesian inferences. Most previous work on representing probabilistic inference in neural populations has focused on the representation of static information.1, 12, 15 These encompass various strategies for encoding and decoding uncertain quantities, but do not readily generalize to real-world dynamic information processing tasks, particularly the most interesting cases with stimuli changing over the same timescale as spiking itself.11 Notable exceptions are the recent, seminal, but, as we argue, representationally restricted, models proposed by Gold and Shadlen,5 Rao,10 and Deneve.4 In this paper, we ﬁrst show how probabilistic information varying over time can be represented in a spiking population code. Second, we present a method for producing spiking codes that facilitate further processing of the probabilistic information. Finally, we show the utility of this method by applying it to a temporal sensorimotor integration task. 1 TRAJECTORY ENCODING AND DECODING We assume that population spikes R(t) arise stochastically in relation to the trajectory X(t) of an underlying (but hidden) variable. We use RT and XT for the whole trajectory and spike trains respectively from time 0 to T . The spikes RT constitute the observations and are assumed to be probabilistically related to the signal by a tuning function f (X, θ i ): P (R(i, T )|X(T )) ∝ f (X, θi ) (1) for the spike train of the ith neuron, with parameters θi . Therefore, via standard Bayesian inference, RT determines a distribution over the hidden variable at time T , P (X(T )|RT ). We ﬁrst consider a version of the dynamics and input coding that permits an analytical examination of the impact of spikes. Let X(t) follow a stationary Gaussian process such that the joint distribution P (X(t1 ), X(t2 ), . . . , X(tm )) is Gaussian for any ﬁnite collection of times, with a covariance matrix which depends on time differences: Ctt = c(|t − t |). Function c(|∆t|) controls the smoothness of the resulting random walks. Then, P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) X(T ) dX(T )P (RT |X(T ))P (X(T )|X(T )) (2) where P (X(T )|X(T )) is the distribution over the whole trajectory X(T ) conditional on the value of X(T ) at its end point. If RT are a set of conditionally independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we have P (RT |X(T )) ∝ iτ f (X(tiτ ), θi ) exp − i τ dτ f (X(τ ), θi ) , (3) where tiτ ∀τ are the spike times τ of neuron i in RT . Let χ = [X(tiτ )] be the vector of stimulus positions at the times at which we observed a spike and Θ = [θ(tiτ )] be the vector of spike positions. If the tuning functions are Gaussian f (X, θi ) ∝ exp(−(X − θi )2 /2σ 2 ) and sufﬁciently dense that i τ dτ f (X, θi ) is independent of X (a standard assumption in population coding), then P (RT |X(T )) ∝ exp(− χ − Θ 2 /2σ 2 ) and in Equation 2, we can marginalize out X(T ) except at the spike times tiτ : P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) −1 χ dχ exp −[χ, X(T )]T C 2 [χ, X(T )] − χ−Θ 2σ 2 2 (4) and C is the block covariance matrix between X(tiτ ), x(T ) at the spike times [ttτ ] and the ﬁnal time T . This Gaussian integral has P (X(T )|RT ) ∼ N (µ(T ), ν(T )), with µ(T ) = CT t (Ctt + Iσ 2 )−1 Θ = kΘ ν(T ) = CT T − kCtT (5) CT T is the T, T th element of the covariance matrix and CT t is similarly a row vector. The dependence in µ on past spike times is speciﬁed chieﬂy by the inverse covariance matrix, and acts as an effective kernel (k). This kernel is not stationary, since it depends on factors such as the local density of spiking in the spike train RT . For example, consider where X(t) evolves according to a diffusion process with drift: dX = −αXdt + σ dN (t) (6) where α prevents it from wandering too far, N (t) is white Gaussian noise with mean zero and σ 2 variance. Figure 1A shows sample kernels for this process. Inspection of Figure 1A reveals some important traits. First, the monotonically decreasing kernel magnitude as the time span between the spike and the current time T grows matches the intuition that recent spikes play a more signiﬁcant role in determining the posterior over X(T ). Second, the kernel is nearly exponential, with a time constant that depends on the time constant of the covariance function and the density of the spikes; two settings of these parameters produced the two groupings of kernels in the ﬁgure. Finally, the fully adaptive kernel k can be locally well approximated by a metronomic kernel k  (shown in red in Figure 1A) that assumes regular spiking. This takes advantage of the general fact, indicated by the grouping of kernels, that the kernel depends weakly on the actual spike pattern, but strongly on the average rate. The merits of the metronomic kernel are that it is stationary and only depends on a single mean rate rather than the full spike train RT .

<p>Author: Jing Wang, Zhenyue Zhang, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there have been several advances in the machine learning and pattern recognition communities for developing manifold learning algorithms to construct nonlinear low-dimensional manifolds from sample data points embedded in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we develop algorithms that address two key issues in manifold learning: 1) the adaptive selection of the neighborhood sizes; and 2) better ﬁtting the local geometric structure to account for the variations in the curvature of the manifold and its interplay with the sampling density of the data set. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our methods on some synthetic data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.13625458 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Semigroup_Kernels_on_Finite_Sets.html">168 nips-2004-Semigroup Kernels on Finite Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: Complex objects can often be conveniently represented by ﬁnite sets of simpler components, such as images by sets of patches or texts by bags of words. We study the class of positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels for two such objects that can be expressed as a function of the merger of their respective sets of components. We prove a general integral representation of such kernels and present two particular examples. One of them leads to a kernel for sets of points living in a space endowed itself with a positive deﬁnite kernel. We provide experimental results on a benchmark experiment of handwritten digits image classiﬁcation which illustrate the validity of the approach. 1</p><p>5 0.12901929 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Variational_Minimax_Estimation_of_Discrete_Distributions_under_KL_Loss.html">204 nips-2004-Variational Minimax Estimation of Discrete Distributions under KL Loss</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We develop a family of upper and lower bounds on the worst-case expected KL loss for estimating a discrete distribution on a ﬁnite number m of points, given N i.i.d. samples. Our upper bounds are approximationtheoretic, similar to recent bounds for estimating discrete entropy; the lower bounds are Bayesian, based on averages of the KL loss under Dirichlet distributions. The upper bounds are convex in their parameters and thus can be minimized by descent methods to provide estimators with low worst-case error; the lower bounds are indexed by a one-dimensional parameter and are thus easily maximized. Asymptotic analysis of the bounds demonstrates the uniform KL-consistency of a wide class of estimators as c = N/m → ∞ (no matter how slowly), and shows that no estimator is consistent for c bounded (in contrast to entropy estimation). Moreover, the bounds are asymptotically tight as c → 0 or ∞, and are shown numerically to be tight within a factor of two for all c. Finally, in the sparse-data limit c → 0, we ﬁnd that the Dirichlet-Bayes (add-constant) estimator with parameter scaling like −c log(c) optimizes both the upper and lower bounds, suggesting an optimal choice of the “add-constant” parameter in this regime.</p><p>6 0.1194865 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Resolving_Perceptual_Aliasing_In_The_Presence_Of_Noisy_Sensors.html">154 nips-2004-Resolving Perceptual Aliasing In The Presence Of Noisy Sensors</a></p>

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Andrea Caponnetto, Ernesto D. Vito, Francesca Odone, Umberto D. Giovannini</p><p>Abstract: Many works have shown that strong connections relate learning from examples to regularization techniques for ill-posed inverse problems. Nevertheless by now there was no formal evidence neither that learning from examples could be seen as an inverse problem nor that theoretical results in learning theory could be independently derived using tools from regularization theory. In this paper we provide a positive answer to both questions. Indeed, considering the square loss, we translate the learning problem in the language of regularization theory and show that consistency results and optimal regularization parameter choice can be derived by the discretization of the corresponding inverse problem. 1</p><p>3 0.52898759 <a title="105-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Comparing_Beliefs%2C_Surveys%2C_and_Random_Walks.html">41 nips-2004-Comparing Beliefs, Surveys, and Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik Aurell, Uri Gordon, Scott Kirkpatrick</p><p>Abstract: Survey propagation is a powerful technique from statistical physics that has been applied to solve the 3-SAT problem both in principle and in practice. We give, using only probability arguments, a common derivation of survey propagation, belief propagation and several interesting hybrid methods. We then present numerical experiments which use WSAT (a widely used random-walk based SAT solver) to quantify the complexity of the 3-SAT formulae as a function of their parameters, both as randomly generated and after simpli£cation, guided by survey propagation. Some properties of WSAT which have not previously been reported make it an ideal tool for this purpose – its mean cost is proportional to the number of variables in the formula (at a £xed ratio of clauses to variables) in the easy-SAT regime and slightly beyond, and its behavior in the hardSAT regime appears to re¤ect the underlying structure of the solution space that has been predicted by replica symmetry-breaking arguments. An analysis of the tradeoffs between the various methods of search for satisfying assignments shows WSAT to be far more powerful than has been appreciated, and suggests some interesting new directions for practical algorithm development. 1</p><p>4 0.52679855 <a title="105-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Adaptive_Manifold_Learning.html">17 nips-2004-Adaptive Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Phillip Boyle, Marcus Frean</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are usually parameterised in terms of their covariance functions. However, this makes it difﬁcult to deal with multiple outputs, because ensuring that the covariance matrix is positive deﬁnite is problematic. An alternative formulation is to treat Gaussian processes as white noise sources convolved with smoothing kernels, and to parameterise the kernel instead. Using this, we extend Gaussian processes to handle multiple, coupled outputs. 1</p><p>6 0.48965809 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Variational_Minimax_Estimation_of_Discrete_Distributions_under_KL_Loss.html">204 nips-2004-Variational Minimax Estimation of Discrete Distributions under KL Loss</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik, Fernando Pereira, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Embedding algorithms search for low dimensional structure in complex data, but most algorithms only handle objects of a single type for which pairwise distances are speciﬁed. This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semideﬁnite matrices. The local structure of our embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space. We quantify the performance of our method on two text datasets, and show that it consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms standard methods of statistical correspondence modeling, such as multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81775361 <a title="105-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Log-concavity_Results_on_Gaussian_Process_Methods_for_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">105 nips-2004-Log-concavity Results on Gaussian Process Methods for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Log-concavity is an important property in the context of optimization, Laplace approximation, and sampling; Bayesian methods based on Gaussian process priors have become quite popular recently for classiﬁcation, regression, density estimation, and point process intensity estimation. Here we prove that the predictive densities corresponding to each of these applications are log-concave, given any observed data. We also prove that the likelihood is log-concave in the hyperparameters controlling the mean function of the Gaussian prior in the density and point process intensity estimation cases, and the mean, covariance, and observation noise parameters in the classiﬁcation and regression cases; this result leads to a useful parameterization of these hyperparameters, indicating a suitably large class of priors for which the corresponding maximum a posteriori problem is log-concave.</p><p>3 0.78330749 <a title="105-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Nonparametric_Transforms_of_Graph_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">133 nips-2004-Nonparametric Transforms of Graph Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojin Zhu, Jaz Kandola, Zoubin Ghahramani, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm based on convex optimization for constructing kernels for semi-supervised learning. The kernel matrices are derived from the spectral decomposition of graph Laplacians, and combine labeled and unlabeled data in a systematic fashion. Unlike previous work using diffusion kernels and Gaussian random ﬁeld kernels, a nonparametric kernel approach is presented that incorporates order constraints during optimization. This results in ﬂexible kernels and avoids the need to choose among different parametric forms. Our approach relies on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and is computationally feasible for large datasets. We evaluate the kernels on real datasets using support vector machines, with encouraging results. 1</p><p>4 0.76595253 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Computing_regularization_paths_for_learning_multiple_kernels.html">42 nips-2004-Computing regularization paths for learning multiple kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Romain Thibaux, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning a sparse conic combination of kernel functions or kernel matrices for classiﬁcation or regression can be achieved via the regularization by a block 1-norm [1]. In this paper, we present an algorithm that computes the entire regularization path for these problems. The path is obtained by using numerical continuation techniques, and involves a running time complexity that is a constant times the complexity of solving the problem for one value of the regularization parameter. Working in the setting of kernel linear regression and kernel logistic regression, we show empirically that the effect of the block 1-norm regularization differs notably from the (non-block) 1-norm regularization commonly used for variable selection, and that the regularization path is of particular value in the block case. 1</p><p>5 0.76449633 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Maximum-Margin_Matrix_Factorization.html">113 nips-2004-Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Srebro, Jason Rennie, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to collaborative prediction, using low-norm instead of low-rank factorizations. The approach is inspired by, and has strong connections to, large-margin linear discrimination. We show how to learn low-norm factorizations by solving a semi-deﬁnite program, and discuss generalization error bounds for them. 1</p><p>6 0.76305205 <a title="105-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Joint_MRI_Bias_Removal_Using_Entropy_Minimization_Across_Images.html">89 nips-2004-Joint MRI Bias Removal Using Entropy Minimization Across Images</a></p>

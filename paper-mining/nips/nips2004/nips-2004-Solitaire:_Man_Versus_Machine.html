The problem arises in the decomposition of a covariance matrix into sparse factors, and has wide applications ranging from biology to ﬁnance.

<p>Author: Rob Powers, Yoav Shoham</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new set of criteria for learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, one that is more stringent and (we argue) better justiﬁed than previous proposed criteria. Our criteria, which apply most straightforwardly in repeated games with average rewards, consist of three requirements: (a) against a speciﬁed class of opponents (this class is a parameter of the criterion) the algorithm yield a payoff that approaches the payoff of the best response, (b) against other opponents the algorithm’s payoff at least approach (and possibly exceed) the security level payoff (or maximin value), and (c) subject to these requirements, the algorithm achieve a close to optimal payoff in self-play. We furthermore require that these average payoffs be achieved quickly. We then present a novel algorithm, and show that it meets these new criteria for a particular parameter class, the class of stationary opponents. Finally, we show that the algorithm is effective not only in theory, but also empirically. Using a recently introduced comprehensive game theoretic test suite, we show that the algorithm almost universally outperforms previous learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.07020507 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Multi-agent_Cooperation_in_Diverse_Population_Games.html">123 nips-2004-Multi-agent Cooperation in Diverse Population Games</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, S. W. Lim, Z. Gao</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems whose agents compete for resources by striving to be in the minority group. The agents adapt to the environment by reinforcement learning of the preferences of the policies they hold. Diversity of preferences of policies is introduced by adding random biases to the initial cumulative payoffs of their policies. We explain and provide evidence that agent cooperation becomes increasingly important when diversity increases. Analyses of these mechanisms yield excellent agreement with simulations over nine decades of data. 1</p><p>5 0.067956053 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Sham M. Kakade, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider an MDP setting in which the reward function is allowed to change during each time step of play (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain ﬁxed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well can an agent do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efﬁcient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard. 1</p><p>6 0.067221545 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Convergence_and_No-Regret_in_Multiagent_Learning.html">48 nips-2004-Convergence and No-Regret in Multiagent Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: David H. Stern, Thore Graepel, David MacKay</p><p>Abstract: Go is an ancient oriental game whose complexity has defeated attempts to automate it. We suggest using probability in a Bayesian sense to model the uncertainty arising from the vast complexity of the game tree. We present a simple conditional Markov random ﬁeld model for predicting the pointwise territory outcome of a game. The topology of the model reﬂects the spatial structure of the Go board. We describe a version of the Swendsen-Wang process for sampling from the model during learning and apply loopy belief propagation for rapid inference and prediction. The model is trained on several hundred records of professional games. Our experimental results indicate that the model successfully learns to predict territory despite its simplicity. 1</p><p>4 0.51323211 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-A_Direct_Formulation_for_Sparse_PCA_Using_Semidefinite_Programming.html">2 nips-2004-A Direct Formulation for Sparse PCA Using Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Taro Toyoizumi, Jean-pascal Pfister, Kazuyuki Aihara, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: We derive an optimal learning rule in the sense of mutual information maximization for a spiking neuron model. Under the assumption of small ﬂuctuations of the input, we ﬁnd a spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) function which depends on the time course of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the autocorrelation function of the postsynaptic neuron. We show that the STDP function has both positive and negative phases. The positive phase is related to the shape of the EPSP while the negative phase is controlled by neuronal refractoriness. 1</p><p>3 0.61227435 <a title="171-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Dependent_Gaussian_Processes.html">50 nips-2004-Dependent Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Phillip Boyle, Marcus Frean</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are usually parameterised in terms of their covariance functions. However, this makes it difﬁcult to deal with multiple outputs, because ensuring that the covariance matrix is positive deﬁnite is problematic. An alternative formulation is to treat Gaussian processes as white noise sources convolved with smoothing kernels, and to parameterise the kernel instead. Using this, we extend Gaussian processes to handle multiple, coupled outputs. 1</p><p>4 0.47424534 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_first-order_Markov_models_for_control.html">102 nips-2004-Learning first-order Markov models for control</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: First-order Markov models have been successfully applied to many problems, for example in modeling sequential data using Markov chains, and modeling control problems using the Markov decision processes (MDP) formalism. If a ﬁrst-order Markov model’s parameters are estimated from data, the standard maximum likelihood estimator considers only the ﬁrst-order (single-step) transitions. But for many problems, the ﬁrstorder conditional independence assumptions are not satisﬁed, and as a result the higher order transition probabilities may be poorly approximated. Motivated by the problem of learning an MDP’s parameters for control, we propose an algorithm for learning a ﬁrst-order Markov model that explicitly takes into account higher order interactions during training. Our algorithm uses an optimization criterion different from maximum likelihood, and allows us to learn models that capture longer range effects, but without giving up the beneﬁts of using ﬁrst-order Markov models. Our experimental results also show the new algorithm outperforming conventional maximum likelihood estimation in a number of control problems where the MDP’s parameters are estimated from data. 1</p><p>5 0.46954715 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Reducing_Spike_Train_Variability%3A_A_Computational_Theory_Of_Spike-Timing_Dependent_Plasticity.html">153 nips-2004-Reducing Spike Train Variability: A Computational Theory Of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron’s variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron’s output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic eﬃcacy increases. We compare our account to other eﬀorts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation. 1</p><p>6 0.4501887 <a title="171-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Modelling_Uncertainty_in_the_Game_of_Go.html">122 nips-2004-Modelling Uncertainty in the Game of Go</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Andrea Tironi, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of hierarchical classiﬁcation when labels corresponding to partial and/or multiple paths in the underlying taxonomy are allowed. We introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, implementing the simple intuition that additional mistakes in the subtree of a mistaken class should not be charged for. Based on a probabilistic data model introduced in earlier work, we derive the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. We then empirically compare two incremental approximations of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer with a ﬂat SVM classiﬁer and with classiﬁers obtained by using hierarchical versions of the Perceptron and SVM algorithms. The experiments show that our simplest incremental approximation of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer performs, after just one training epoch, nearly as well as the hierarchical SVM classiﬁer (which performs best). For the same incremental algorithm we also derive an H-loss bound showing, when data are generated by our probabilistic data model, exponentially fast convergence to the H-loss of the hierarchical classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. 1 Introduction and basic deﬁnitions We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy of labels, where the taxonomy is speciﬁed as a tree forest. We assume that every data instance is labelled with a (possibly empty) set of class labels called multilabel, with the only requirement that multilabels including some node i in the taxonony must also include all ancestors of i. Thus, each multilabel corresponds to the union of one or more paths in the forest, where each path must start from a root but it can terminate on an internal node (rather than a leaf). Learning algorithms for hierarchical classiﬁcation have been investigated in, e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20]. However, the scenario where labelling includes multiple and partial paths has received very little attention. The analysis in [5], which is mainly theoretical, shows in the multiple and partial path case a 0/1-loss bound for a hierarchical learning algorithm based on regularized least-squares estimates. In this work we extend [5] in several ways. First, we introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, which is better suited than the 0/1-loss to analyze hierarchical classiﬁcation tasks, and we derive the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer under the parametric data model introduced in [5]. Second, considering various loss functions, including the H-loss, we empirically compare the performance of the following three incremental kernel-based ∗ This work was supported in part by the PASCAL Network of Excellence under EC grant no. 506778. This publication only reﬂects the authors’ views. algorithms: 1) a hierarchical version of the classical Perceptron algorithm [16]; 2) an approximation to the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer; 3) a simpliﬁed variant of this approximation. Finally, we show that, assuming data are indeed generated according to the parametric model mentioned before, the H-loss of the algorithm in 3) converges to the H-loss of the classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. Our incremental algorithms are based on training linear-threshold classiﬁers in each node of the taxonomy. A similar approach has been studied in [8], though their model does not consider multiple-path classiﬁcations as we do. Incremental algorithms are the main focus of this research, since we strongly believe that they are a key tool for coping with tasks where large quantities of data items are generated and the classiﬁcation system needs to be frequently adjusted to keep up with new items. However, we found it useful to provide a reference point for our empirical results. Thus we have also included in our experiments the results achieved by nonincremental algorithms. In particular, we have chosen a ﬂat and a hierarchical version of SVM [21, 7, 19], which are known to perform well on the textual datasets considered here. We assume data elements are encoded as real vectors x ∈ Rd which we call instances. A multilabel for an instance x is any subset of the set {1, . . . , N } of all labels/classes, including the empty set. We denote the multilabel associated with x by a vector y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N , where i belongs to the multilabel of x if and only if yi = 1. A taxonomy G is a forest whose trees are deﬁned over the set of labels. A multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N is said to respect a taxonomy G if and only if y is the union of one or more paths in G, where each path starts from a root but need not terminate on a leaf. See Figure 1. We assume the data-generating mechanism produces examples (x, y) such that y respects some ﬁxed underlying taxonomy G with N nodes. The set of roots in G is denoted by root(G). We use par(i) to denote the unique parent of node i, anc(i) to denote the set of ancestors of i, and sub(i) to denote the set of nodes in the subtree rooted at i (including i). Finally, given a predicate φ over a set Ω, we will use {φ} to denote both the subset of Ω where φ is true and the indicator function of this subset. 2 The H-loss Though several hierarchical losses have been proposed in the literature (e.g., in [11, 20]), no one has emerged as a standard yet. Since hierarchical losses are deﬁned over multilabels, we start by considering two very simple functions measuring the discrepancy between multilabels y = (y1 , ..., yN ) and y = (y1 , ..., yN ): the 0/1-loss 0/1 (y, y) = {∃i : yi = yi } and the symmetric difference loss ∆ (y, y) = {y1 = y1 } + . . . + {yN = yN }. There are several ways of making these losses depend on a given taxonomy G. In this work, we follow the intuition “if a mistake is made at node i, then further mistakes made in the subtree rooted at i are unimportant”. That is, we do not require the algorithm be able to make ﬁne-grained distinctions on tasks when it is unable to make coarse-grained ones. For example, if an algorithm failed to label a document with the class SPORTS, then the algorithm should not be charged more loss because it also failed to label the same document with the subclass SOCCER and the sub-subclass CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. A function implementing this intuition is deﬁned by N H (y, y) = i=1 ci {yi = yi ∧ yj = yj , j ∈ anc(i)}, where c1 , . . . , cN > 0 are ﬁxed cost coefﬁcients. This loss, which we call H-loss, can also be described as follows: all paths in G from a root down to a leaf are examined and, whenever we encounter a node i such that yi = yi , we add ci to the loss, whereas all the loss contributions in the subtree rooted at i are discarded. Note that if c1 = . . . = cN = 1 then 0/1 ≤ H ≤ ∆ . Choices of ci depending on the structure of G are proposed in Section 4. Given a multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N deﬁne its G-truncation as the multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N where, for each i = 1, . . . , N , yi = 1 iff yi = 1 and yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Note that the G-truncation of any multilabel always respects G. A graphical (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: A one-tree forest (repeated four times). Each node corresponds to a class in the taxonomy G, hence in this case N = 12. Gray nodes are included in the multilabel under consideration, white nodes are not.

(d) Superposition of multilabel (b) on multilabel (c): Only the checked nodes contribute to the H-loss between (b) and (c). representation of the notions introduced so far is given in Figure 1. In the next lemma we show that whenever y respects G, then H (y, y) cannot be smaller than H (y , y). In other words, when the multilabel y to be predicted respects a taxonomy G then there is no loss of generality in restricting to predictions which respect G. Lemma 1 Let G be a taxonomy, y, y ∈ {0, 1}N be two multilabels such that y respects G, and y be the G-truncation of y. Then H (y , y) ≤ H (y, y) . Proof. For each i = 1, . . . , N we show that yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i) implies yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Pick some i and suppose yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Now suppose yj = 0 (and thus yj = 0) for some j ∈ anc(i). Then yi = 0 since y respects G. But this implies yi = 1, contradicting the fact that the G-truncation y respects G. Therefore, it must be the case that yj = yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Hence the G-truncation of y left each node j ∈ anc(i) unchanged, implying yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). But, since the G-truncation of y does not change the value of a node i whose ancestors j are such that yj = 1, this also implies yi = yi . Therefore yi = yi and the proof is concluded. 3 A probabilistic data model Our learning algorithms are based on the following statistical model for the data, originally introduced in [5]. The model deﬁnes a probability distribution fG over the set of multilabels respecting a given taxonomy G by associating with each node i of G a Bernoulli random variable Yi and deﬁning fG (y | x) = N i=1 P Yi = yi | Ypar(i) = ypar(i) , X = x . To guarantee that fG (y | x) = 0 whenever y ∈ {0, 1}N does not respect G, we set P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 0, X = x = 0. Notice that this deﬁnition of fG makes the (rather simplistic) assumption that all Yk with the same parent node i (i.e., the children of i) are independent when conditioned on Yi and x. Through fG we specify an i.i.d. process {(X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . .}, where, for t = 1, 2, . . ., the multilabel Y t is distributed according to fG (· | X t ) and X t is distributed according to a ﬁxed and unknown distribution D. Each example (xt , y t ) is thus a realization of the corresponding pair (X t , Y t ) of random variables. Our parametric model for fG is described as follows. First, we assume that the support of D is the surface of the d-dimensional unit sphere (i.e., instances x ∈ R d are such that ||x|| = 1). With each node i in the taxonomy, we associate a unit-norm weight vector ui ∈ Rd . Then, we deﬁne the conditional probabilities for a nonroot node i with parent j by P (Yi = 1 | Yj = 1, X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. If i is a root node, the previous equation simpliﬁes to P (Yi = 1 | X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. 3.1 The Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss We now describe a classiﬁer, called H - BAYES, that is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. In other words, H - BAYES classiﬁes any instance x with the multilabel y = argminy∈{0,1} E[ H (¯ , Y ) | x ]. Deﬁne pi (x) = P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 1, X = x . y ¯ When no ambiguity arises, we write pi instead of pi (x). Now, ﬁx any unit-length instance x and let y be a multilabel that respects G. For each node i in G, recursively deﬁne H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + k∈child(i) H k,x (y) . The classiﬁer H - BAYES operates as follows. It starts by putting all nodes of G in a set S; nodes are then removed from S one by one. A node i can be removed only if i is a leaf or if all nodes j in the subtree rooted at i have been already removed. When i is removed, its value yi is set to 1 if and only if pi 2 − k∈child(i) H k,x (y)/ci ≥ 1 . (1) (Note that if i is a leaf then (1) is equivalent to yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}.) If yi is set to zero, then all nodes in the subtree rooted at i are set to zero. Theorem 2 For any taxonomy G and all unit-length x ∈ Rd , the multilabel generated by H - BAYES is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁcation of x for the H-loss. Proof sketch. Let y be the multilabel assigned by H - BAYES and y ∗ be any multilabel minimizing the expected H-loss. Introducing the short-hand Ex [·] = E[· | x], we can write Ex H (y, Y )= N i=1 ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} . Note that we can recursively decompose the expected H-loss as Ex H (y, Y )= i∈root(G) where Ex Hi (y, Y ) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) Ex Hi (y, Y ), pj {yj = 1} + j∈anc(i) Ex Hk (y, Y ) . (2) k∈child(i) ∗ Pick a node i. If i is a leaf, then the sum in the RHS of (2) disappears and yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}, ∗ which is also the minimizer of H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ), implying yi = yi . ∗ Now let i be an internal node and inductively assume yj = yj for all j ∈ sub(i). Notice ∗ that the factors j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} occur in both terms in the RHS of (2). Hence yi does not depend on these factors and we can equivalently minimize ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + pi {yi = 1} k∈child(i) H k,x (y), (3) where we noted that, for each k ∈ child(i), Ex Hk (y, Y ) = j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} pi {yi = 1}H k,x (y) . ∗ Now observe that yi minimizing (3) is equivalent to the assignment produced by H - BAYES. ∗ ∗ To conclude the proof, note that whenever yi = 0, Lemma 1 requires that yj = 0 for all nodes j ∈ sub(i), which is exactly what H - BAYES does. 4 The algorithms We consider three incremental algorithms. Each one of these algorithms learns a hierarchical classiﬁer by training a decision function gi : Rd → {0, 1} at each node i = 1, . . . , N . For a given set g1 , . . . , gN of decision functions, the hierarchical classiﬁer generated by these algorithms classiﬁes an instance x through a multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) deﬁned as follows: yi = gi (x) 0 if i ∈ root(G) or yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i) otherwise. (4) Note that y computed this way respects G. The classiﬁers (4) are trained incrementally. Let gi,t be the decision function at node i after training on the ﬁrst t − 1 examples. When the next training example (xt , y t ) is available, the algorithms compute the multilabel y t using classiﬁer (4) based on g1,t (xt ), . . . , gN,t (xt ). Then, the algorithms consider for an update only those decision functions sitting at nodes i satisfying either i ∈ root(G) or ypar(i),t = 1. We call such nodes eligible at time t. The decision functions of all other nodes are left unchanged. The ﬁrst algorithm we consider is a simple hierarchical version of the Perceptron algorithm [16], which we call H - PERC. The decision functions at time t are deﬁned by gi,t (xt ) = {wi,t xt ≥ 0}. In the update phase, the Perceptron rule wi,t+1 = wi,t + yi,t xt is applied to every node i eligible at time t and such that yi,t = yi,t . The second algorithm, called APPROX - H - BAYES, approximates the H - BAYES classiﬁer of Section 3.1 by replacing the unknown quantities pi (xt ) with estimates (1+w i,t xt )/2. The weights w i,t are regularized least-squares estimates deﬁned by (i) wi,t = (I + Si,t−1 Si,t−1 + xt xt )−1 Si,t−1 y t−1 . (5) The columns of the matrix Si,t−1 are all past instances xs that have been stored at node i; (i) the s-th component of vector y t−1 is the i-th component yi,s of the multilabel y s associated with instance xs . In the update phase, an instance xt is stored at node i, causing an update of wi,t , whenever i is eligible at time t and |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t , where Ni,t is the number of instances stored at node i up to time t − 1. The corresponding decision functions gi,t are of the form gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ τi,t }, where the threshold τi,t ≥ 0 at node i depends on the margin values w j,t xt achieved by nodes j ∈ sub(i) — recall (1). Note that gi,t is not a linear-threshold function, as xt appears in the deﬁnition of w i,t . The margin threshold (5 ln t)/Ni,t , controlling the update of node i at time t, reduces the space requirements of the classiﬁer by keeping matrices Si,t suitably small. This threshold is motivated by the work [4] on selective sampling. The third algorithm, which we call H - RLS (Hierarchical Regularized Least Squares), is a simpliﬁed variant of APPROX - H - BAYES in which the thresholds τi,t are set to zero. That is, we have gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ 0} where the weights w i,t are deﬁned as in (5) and updated as in the APPROX - H - BAYES algorithm. Details on how to run APPROX - H - BAYES 2 and H - RLS in dual variables and perform an update at node i in time O(Ni,t ) are found in [3] (where a mistake-driven version of H - RLS is analyzed). 5 Experimental results The empirical evaluation of the algorithms was carried out on two well-known datasets of free-text documents. The ﬁrst dataset consists of the ﬁrst (in chronological order) 100,000 newswire stories from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1, RCV1 [2]. The associated taxonomy of labels, which are the topics of the documents, has 101 nodes organized in a forest of 4 trees. The forest is shallow: the longest path has length 3 and the the distribution of nodes, sorted by increasing path length, is {0.04, 0.53, 0.42, 0.01}. For this dataset, we used the bag-of-words vectorization performed by Xerox Research Center Europe within the EC project KerMIT (see [4] for details on preprocessing). The 100,000 documents were divided into 5 equally sized groups of chronologically consecutive documents. We then used each adjacent pair of groups as training and test set in an experiment (here the ﬁfth and ﬁrst group are considered adjacent), and then averaged the test set performance over the 5 experiments. The second dataset is a speciﬁc subtree of the OHSUMED corpus of medical abstracts [1]: the subtree rooted in “Quality of Health Care” (MeSH code N05.715). After removing overlapping classes (OHSUMED is not quite a tree but a DAG), we ended up with 94 Table 1: Experimental results on two hierarchical text classiﬁcation tasks under various loss functions.

We made this choice based only on the structure of the subtree: the longest path has length 4, the distribution of nodes sorted by increasing path length is {0.26, 0.37, 0.22, 0.12, 0.03}, and there are a signiﬁcant number of partial and multiple path multilabels. The vectorization of the subtree was carried out as follows: after tokenization, we removed all stopwords and also those words that did not occur at least 3 times in the corpus. Then, we vectorized the documents using the Bow library [13] with a log(1 + TF) log(IDF) encoding. We ran 5 experiments by randomly splitting the corpus in a training set of 40,000 documents and a test set of 15,503 documents. Test set performances are averages over these 5 experiments. In the training set we kept more documents than in the RCV1 splits since the OHSUMED corpus turned out to be a harder classiﬁcation problem than RCV1. In both datasets instances have been normalized to unit length. We tested the hierarchical Perceptron algorithm (H - PERC), the hierarchical regularized leastsquares algorithm (H - RLS), and the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm (APPROX - H BAYES ), all described in Section 4. The results are summarized in Table 1. APPROX - H BAYES ( AH - BAY in Table 1) was trained using cost coefﬁcients c i chosen as follows: if i ∈ root(G) then ci = |root(G)|−1 . Otherwise, ci = cj /|child(j)|, where j is the parent of i. Note that this choice of coefﬁcients amounts to splitting a unit cost equally among the roots and then splitting recursively each node’s cost equally among its children. Since, in this case, 0 ≤ H ≤ 1, we call the resulting loss normalized H-loss. We also tested a hierarchical version of SVM (denoted by H - SVM in Table 1) in which each node is an SVM classiﬁer trained using a batch version of our hierarchical learning protocol. More precisely, each node i was trained only on those examples (xt , y t ) such that ypar(i),t = 1 (note that, as no conditions are imposed on yi,t , node i is actually trained on both positive and negative examples). The resulting set of linear-threshold functions was then evaluated on the test set using the hierachical classiﬁcation scheme (4). We tried both the C and ν parametrizations [18] for SVM and found the setting C = 1 to work best for our data. 1 We ﬁnally tested the “ﬂat” variants of Perceptron and SVM, denoted by PERC and SVM. In these variants, each node is trained and evaluated independently of the others, disregarding all taxonomical information. All SVM experiments were carried out using the libSVM implementation [6]. All the tested algorithms used a linear kernel. 1 It should be emphasized that this tuning of C was actually chosen in hindsight, with no crossvalidation. As far as loss functions are concerned, we considered the 0/1-loss, the H-loss with cost coefﬁcients set to 1 (denoted by uniform H-loss), the normalized H-loss, and the symmetric difference loss (denoted by ∆-loss). Note that H - SVM performs best, but our incremental algorithms were trained for a single epoch on the training set. The good performance of SVM (the ﬂat variant of H - SVM ) is surprising. However, with a single epoch of training H - RLS does not perform worse than SVM (except on OHSUMED under the normalized H-loss) and comes reasonably close to H - SVM. On the other hand, the performance of APPROX - H - BAYES is disappointing: on OHSUMED it is the best algorithm only for the uniform H-loss, though it was trained using the normalized H-loss; on RCV1 it never outperforms H - RLS, though it always does better than PERC and H - PERC. A possible explanation for this behavior is that APPROX - H - BAYES is very sensitive to errors in the estimates of pi (x) (recall Section 3.1). Indeed, the least-squares estimates (5), which we used to approximate H - BAYES, seem to work better in practice on simpler (and possibly more robust) algorithms, such as H - RLS. The lower values of normalized H-loss on OHSUMED (a harder corpus than RCV1) can be explained because a quarter of the 94 nodes in the OHSUMED taxonomy are roots, and thus each top-level mistake is only charged about 4/94. As a ﬁnal remark, we observe that the normalized H-loss gave too small a range of values to afford ﬁne comparisons among the best performing algorithms. 6 Regret bounds for the H-loss In this section we prove a theoretical bound on the H-loss of a slight variant of the algorithm H - RLS tested in Section 5. More precisely, we assume data are generated according to the probabilistic model introduced in Section 3 with unknown instance distribution D and unknown coefﬁcients u1 , . . . , uN . We deﬁne the regret of a classiﬁer assigning label y to instance X as E H (y, Y t ) − E H (y, Y ), where the expected value is with respect the random draw of (X, Y ) and y is the multilabel assigned by classiﬁer (4) when the decision functions gi are zero-threshold functions of the form gi (x) = {ui x ≥ 0}. The theorem below shows that the regret of the classiﬁer learned by a variant of H - RLS after t training examples, with t large enough, is exponentially small in t. In other words, H - RLS learns to classify as well as the algorithm that is given the true parameters u1 , . . . , uN of the underlying data-generating process. We have been able to prove the theorem only for the variant of H - RLS storing all instances at each node. That is, every eligible node at time t is updated, irrespective of whether |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t . Given the i.i.d. data-generating process (X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . ., for each node k we deﬁne the derived process X k1 , X k2 , . . . including all and only the instances X s of the original process that satisfy Ypar(k),s = 1. We call this derived process the process at node k. Note that, for each k, the process at node k is an i.i.d. process. However, its distribution might depend on k. The spectrum of the process at node k is the set of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix with entries E[Xk1 ,i Xk1 ,j ] for i, j = 1, . . . , d. We have the following theorem, whose proof is omitted due to space limitations. Theorem 3 Let G be a taxonomy with N nodes and let fG be a joint density for G parametrized by N unit-norm vectors u1 , . . . , uN ∈ Rd . Assume the instance distribution is such that there exist γ1 , . . . , γN > 0 satisfying P |ui X t | ≥ γi = 1 for i = 1, . . . , N . Then, for all t > max maxi=1,...,N E H (y t , Y t ) −E 16 µ i λ i γi , maxi=1,...,N 192d µi λ 2 i the regret H (y t , Y t ) of the modiﬁed H - RLS algorithm is at most N 2 2 µi t e−κ1 γi λi t µi + t2 e−κ2 λi t µi cj , i=1 j∈sub(i) where κ1 , κ2 are constants, µi = E j∈anc(i) (1 + uj X)/2 eigenvalue in the spectrum of the process at node i. and λi is the smallest 7 Conclusions and open problems In this work we have studied the problem of hierarchical classiﬁcation of data instances in the presence of partial and multiple path labellings. We have introduced a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, derived the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer, and empirically compared an incremental approximation to this classiﬁer with some other incremental and nonincremental algorithms. Finally, we have derived a theoretical guarantee on the H-loss of a simpliﬁed variant of the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm. Our investigation leaves several open issues. The current approximation to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer is not satisfying, and this could be due to a bad choice of the model, of the estimators, of the datasets, or of a combination of them. Also, the normalized H-loss is not fully satisfying, since the resulting values are often too small. From the theoretical viewpoint, we would like to analyze the regret of our algorithms with respect to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer, rather than with respect to a classiﬁer that makes a suboptimal use of the true model parameters.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Classification algorithms typically induce population-wide models that are trained to perform well on average on expected future instances. We introduce a Bayesian framework for learning instance-specific models from data that are optimized to predict well for a particular instance. Based on this framework, we present a lazy instance-specific algorithm called ISA that performs selective model averaging over a restricted class of Bayesian networks. On experimental evaluation, this algorithm shows superior performance over model selection. We intend to apply such instance-specific algorithms to improve the performance of patient-specific predictive models induced from medical data. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n Commonly used classification algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian networks and support vector machines, typically induce a single model from a training set of instances, with the intent of applying it to all future instances. We call such a model a population-wide model because it is intended to be applied to an entire population of future instances. A population-wide model is optimized to predict well on average when applied to expected future instances. In contrast, an instance-specific model is one that is constructed specifically for a particular instance. The structure and parameters of an instance-specific model are specialized to the particular features of an instance, so that it is optimized to predict especially well for that instance. Usually, methods that induce population-wide models employ eager learning in which the model is induced from the training data before the test instance is encountered. In contrast, lazy learning defers most or all processing until a response to a test instance is required. Learners that induce instance-specific models are necessarily lazy in nature since they take advantage of the information in the test instance. An example of a lazy instance-specific method is the lazy Bayesian rule (LBR) learner, implemented by Zheng and Webb [1], which induces rules in a lazy fashion from examples in the neighborhood of the test instance. A rule generated by LBR consists of a conjunction of the attribute-value pairs present in the test instance as the antecedent and a local simple (naïve) Bayes classifier as the consequent. The structure of the local simple Bayes classifier consists of the attribute of interest as the parent of all other attributes that do not appear in the antecedent, and the parameters of the classifier are estimated from the subset of training instances that satisfy the antecedent. A greedy step-forward search selects the optimal LBR rule for a test instance to be classified. When evaluated on 29 UCI datasets, LBR had the lowest average error rate when compared to several eager learning methods [1]. Typically, both eager and lazy algorithms select a single model from some model space, ignoring the uncertainty in model selection. Bayesian model averaging is a coherent approach to dealing with the uncertainty in model selection, and it has been shown to improve the predictive performance of classifiers [2]. However, since the number of models in practically useful model spaces is enormous, exact model averaging over the entire model space is usually not feasible. In this paper, we describe a lazy instance-specific averaging (ISA) algorithm for classification that approximates Bayesian model averaging in an instance-sensitive manner. ISA extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging to an instance-specific model selection algorithm. While the ISA algorithm is currently able to directly handle only discrete variables and is computationally more intensive than comparable eager algorithms, the results in this paper show that it performs well. In medicine, such lazy instance-specific algorithms can be applied to patient-specific modeling for improving the accuracy of diagnosis, prognosis and risk assessment. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces a Bayesian framework for instance-specific learning. Section 3 describes the implementation of ISA. In Section 4, we evaluate ISA and compare its performance to that of LBR. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the results of the comparison. 2 Deci si on Th eo ret i c F rame wo rk We use the following notation. Capital letters like X, Z, denote random variables and corresponding lower case letters, x, z, denote specific values assigned to them. Thus, X = x denotes that variable X is assigned the value x. Bold upper case letters, such as X, Z, represent sets of variables or random vectors and their realization is denoted by the corresponding bold lower case letters, x, z. Hence, X = x denotes that the variables in X have the states given by x. In addition, Z denotes the target variable being predicted, X denotes the set of attribute variables, M denotes a model, D denotes the training dataset, and   denotes a generic test instance that is not in D. We now characterize population-wide and instance-specific model selection in decision theoretic terms. Given training data D and a separate generic test instance , the Bayes optimal prediction for Zt is obtained by combining the predictions of all models weighted by their posterior probabilities, as follows: P (Z t | X t , D ) = ∫ P( Z t | X t , M ) P ( M | D )dM . (1) M The optimal population-wide model for predicting Zt is as follows:   max∑ U P( Z t | X t , D), P (Z t | X t , M ) P ( X | D) , M  Xt  [ ] (2) where the function U gives the utility of approximating the Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt , D), with the estimate P(Zt | Xt , M) obtained from model M. The term P(X | D) is given by: P ( X | D) = ∫ P ( X | M ) P ( M | D)dM . (3) M The optimal instance-specific model for predicting Zt is as follows: { [ ]} max U P ( Z t | X t = x t , D), P (Z t | X t = x t , M ) , M (4) where xt are the values of the attributes of the test instance Xt for which we want to predict Zt. The Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt = xt, D), in Equation 4 is derived using Equation 1, for the special case in which Xt = xt . The difference between the population-wide and the instance-specific models can be noted by comparing Equations 2 and 4. Equation 2 for the population-wide model selects the model that on average will have the greatest utility. Equation 4 for the instance-specific model, however, selects the model that will have the greatest expected utility for the specific instance Xt = xt . For predicting Zt in a given instance Xt = xt, the model selected using Equation 2 can never have an expected utility greater than the model selected using Equation 4. This observation provides support for developing instance-specific models. Equations 2 and 4 represent theoretical ideals for population-wide and instancespecific model selection, respectively; we are not suggesting they are practical to compute. The current paper focuses on model averaging, rather than model selection. Ideal Bayesian model averaging is given by Equation 1. Model averaging has previously been applied using population-wide models. Studies have shown that approximate Bayesian model averaging using population-wide models can improve predictive performance over population-wide model selection [2]. The current paper concentrates on investigating the predictive performance of approximate Bayesian model averaging using instance-specific models. 3 In st an ce- S p eci fi c Algo ri t h m We present the implementation of the lazy instance-specific algorithm based on the above framework. ISA searches the space of a restricted class of Bayesian networks to select a subset of the models over which to derive a weighted (averaged) posterior of the target variable Zt . A key characteristic of the search is the use of a heuristic to select models that will have a significant influence on the weighted posterior. We introduce Bayesian networks briefly and then describe ISA in detail. 3.1 B ay e s i a n N e t w or k s A Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that combines a graphical representation (the Bayesian network structure) with quantitative information (the parameters of the Bayesian network) to represent the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables [3]. Specifically, a Bayesian network M representing the set of variables X consists of a pair (G, ΘG ). G is a directed acyclic graph that contains a node for every variable in X and an arc between every pair of nodes if the corresponding variables are directly probabilistically dependent. Conversely, the absence of an arc between a pair of nodes denotes probabilistic independence between the corresponding variables. ΘG represents the parameterization of the model. In a Bayesian network M, the immediate predecessors of a node X i in X are called the parents of X i and the successors, both immediate and remote, of Xi in X are called the descendants of X i . The immediate successors of X i are called the children of X i . For each node Xi there is a local probability distribution (that may be discrete or continuous) on that node given the state of its parents. The complete joint probability distribution over X, represented by the parameterization ΘG, can be factored into a product of local probability distributions defined on each node in the network. This factorization is determined by the independences captured by the structure of the Bayesian network and is formalized in the Bayesian network Markov condition: A node (representing a variable) is independent of its nondescendants given just its parents. According to this Markov condition, the joint probability distribution on model variables X = (X1 , X 2, …, X n ) can be factored as follows: n P ( X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) = ∏ P ( X i | parents( X i )) , (5) i =1 where parents(Xi ) denotes the set of nodes that are the parents of X i . If Xi has no parents, then the set parents(Xi ) is empty and P(Xi | parents(X i)) is just P(Xi ). 3.2 I S A M od e l s The LBR models of Zheng and Webb [1] can be represented as members of a restricted class of Bayesian networks (see Figure 1). We use the same class of Bayesian networks for the ISA models, to facilitate comparison between the two algorithms. In Figure 1, all nodes represent attributes that are discrete. Each node in X has either an outgoing arc into target node, Z, or receives an arc from Z. That is, each node is either a parent or a child of Z. Thus, X is partitioned into two sets: the first containing nodes (X 1 , …, X j in Figure 1) each of which is a parent of Z and every node in the second set, and the second containing nodes (X j+1 , …, X k in Figure 1) that have as parents the node Z and every node in the first set. The nodes in the first set are instantiated to the corresponding values in the test instance for which Zt is to be predicted. Thus, the first set of nodes represents the antecedent of the LBR rule and the second set of nodes represents the consequent. ... X1= x1 Xi = xi Z Xi+1 ... Xk Figure 1: An example of a Bayesian network LBR model with target node Z and k attribute nodes of which X1 , …, X j are instantiated to values x 1 , …, x j in xt . X 1, …, X j are present in the antecedent of the LBR rule and Z, X j+1 , …, X k (that form the local simple Bayes classifier) are present in the consequent. The indices need not be ordered as shown, but are presented in this example for convenience of exposition. 3.3 M od e l A ve r ag i n g For Bayesian networks, Equation 1 can be evaluated as follows: P ( Z t | x t , D ) = ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( M | D ) , (6) M with M being a Bayesian network comprised of structure G and parameters ΘG. The probability distribution of interest is a weighted average of the posterior distribution over all possible Bayesian networks where the weight is the probability of the Bayesian network given the data. Since exhaustive enumeration of all possible models is not feasible, even for this class of simple Bayesian networks, we approximate exact model averaging with selective model averaging. Let R be the set of models selected by the search procedure from all possible models in the model space, as described in the next section. Then, with selective model averaging, P(Zt | xt, D) is estimated as: ∑RP( Z t | x t , M ) P(M | D) P (Z t | x t , D) ≅ M ∈ . ∑RP(M | D) M∈ (7) Assuming uniform prior belief over all possible models, the model posterior P(M | D) in Equation 7 can be replaced by the marginal likelihood P(D | M), to obtain the following equation: P ( Z | x , D) ≅ t t ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( D | M ) . ∑RP( D | M ) M∈ M ∈R (8) The (unconditional) marginal likelihood P(D | M) in Equation 8, is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model to the data and is also known as the model score. While this score is suitable for assessing the model’s fit to the joint probability distribution, it is not necessarily appropriate for assessing the goodness of fit to a conditional probability distribution which is the focus in prediction and classification tasks, as is the case here. A more suitable score in this situation is a conditional model score that is computed from training data D of d instances as: d score( D, M ) = ∏ P ( z p | x1 ,..., x p ,z 1 ,...,z p −1 ,M ) . (9) p =1 This score is computed in a predictive and sequential fashion: for the pth training instance the probability of predicting the observed value zp for the target variable is computed based on the values of all the variables in the preceding p-1 training instances and the values xp of the attributes in the pth instance. One limitation of this score is that its value depends on the ordering of the data. Despite this limitation, it has been shown to be an effective scoring criterion for classification models [4]. The parameters of the Bayesian network M, used in the above computations, are defined as follows: P ( X i = k | parents ( X i ) = j ) ≡ θ ijk = N ijk + α ijk N ij + α ij , (10) where (i) Nijk is the number of instances in the training dataset D where variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, (ii) N ij = ∑k N ijk , (iii) αijk is a parameter prior that can be interpreted as the belief equivalent of having previously observed αijk instances in which variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, and (iv) α ij = ∑k α ijk . 3.4 M od e l Se a r c h We use a two-phase best-first heuristic search to sample the model space. The first phase ignores the evidence xt in the test instance while searching for models that have high scores as given by Equation 9. This is followed by the second phase that searches for models having the greatest impact on the prediction of Zt for the test instance, which we formalize below. The first phase searches for models that predict Z in the training data very well; these are the models that have high conditional model scores. The initial model is the simple Bayes network that includes all the attributes in X as children of Z. A succeeding model is derived from a current model by reversing the arc of a child node in the current model, adding new outgoing arcs from it to Z and the remaining children, and instantiating this node to the value in the test instance. This process is performed for each child in the current model. An incoming arc of a child node is considered for reversal only if the node’s value is not missing in the test instance. The newly derived models are added to a priority queue, Q. During each iteration of the search, the model with the highest score (given by Equation 9) is removed from Q and placed in a set R, following which new models are generated as described just above, scored and added to Q. The first phase terminates after a user-specified number of models have accumulated in R. The second phase searches for models that change the current model-averaged estimate of P(Zt | xt , D) the most. The idea here is to find viable competing models for making this posterior probability prediction. When no competitive models can be found, the prediction becomes stable. During each iteration of the search, the highest ranked model M* is removed from Q and added to R. The ranking is based on how much the model changes the current estimate of P(Zt | xt , D). More change is better. In particular, M* is the model in Q that maximizes the following function: f ( R, M *) = g ( R) − g ( R U {M *}) , (11) where for a set of models S, the function g(S) computes the approximate model averaged prediction for Zt, as follows: g (S ) = ∑ P(Z M ∈S t | x t , M ) score( D, M ) ∑ score( D, M ) ∈ . (12) M S The second phase terminates when no new model can be found that has a value (as given by Equation 11) that is greater than a user-specified minimum threshold T. The final distribution of Zt is then computed from the models in R using Equation 8. 4 Ev a lu a t i o n We evaluated ISA on the 29 UCI datasets that Zheng and Webb used for the evaluation of LBR. On the same datasets, we also evaluated a simple Bayes classifier (SB) and LBR. For SB and LBR, we used the Weka implementations (Weka v3.3.6, http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) with default settings [5]. We implemented the ISA algorithm as a standalone application in Java. The following settings were used for ISA: a maximum of 100 phase-1 models, a threshold T of 0.001 in phase-2, and an upper limit of 500 models in R. For the parameter priors in Equation 10, all αijk were set to 1. All error rates were obtained by averaging the results from two stratified 10-fold cross-validation (20 trials total) similar to that used by Zheng and Webb. Since, both LBR and ISA can handle only discrete attributes, all numeric attributes were discretized in a pre-processing step using the entropy based discretization method described in [6]. For each pair of training and test folds, the discretization intervals were first estimated from the training fold and then applied to both folds. The error rates of two algorithms on a dataset were compared with a paired t-test carried out at the 5% significance level on the error rate statistics obtained from the 20 trials. The results are shown in Table 1. Compared to SB, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 9 datasets and significantly more errors on one dataset. Compared to LBR, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 7 datasets and significantly more errors on two datasets. On two datasets, chess and tic-tac-toe, ISA shows considerable improvement in performance over both SB and LBR. With respect to computation Table 1: Percent error rates of simple Bayes (SB), Lazy Bayesian Rule (LBR) and Instance-Specific Averaging (ISA). A - indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly lower than the marked SB or LBR error rate. A + indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly higher.

An instance-specific algorithm like LBR that does model selection has been shown by Zheng and Webb to perform classification better than several eager algorithms [1]. Our results show that ISA, which extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging, improves overall on LBR, which provides support that we can obtain additional prediction improvement by performing instance-specific model averaging rather than just instance-specific model selection. In future work, we plan to explore further the behavior of ISA with respect to the number of models being averaged and the effect of the number of models selected in each of the two phases of the search. We will also investigate methods to improve the computational efficiency of ISA. In addition, we plan to examine other heuristics for model search as well as more general model spaces such as unrestricted Bayesian networks. The instance-specific framework is not restricted to the Bayesian network models that we have used in this investigation. In the future, we plan to explore other models using this framework. Our ultimate interest is to apply these instancespecific algorithms to improve patient-specific predictions (for diagnosis, therapy selection, and prognosis) and thereby to improve patient care.

We propose a generalized version in which paired individual comparisons are extended to paired team comparisons. We introduce a simple algorithm with convergence proofs to solve the model and obtain individual skill. A useful application to multi-class probability estimates using error-correcting codes is demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.070452079 <a title="130-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-An_Investigation_of_Practical_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithms.html">22 nips-2004-An Investigation of Practical Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Ke Yang, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper concerns approximate nearest neighbor searching algorithms, which have become increasingly important, especially in high dimensional perception areas such as computer vision, with dozens of publications in recent years. Much of this enthusiasm is due to a successful new approximate nearest neighbor approach called Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In this paper we ask the question: can earlier spatial data structure approaches to exact nearest neighbor, such as metric trees, be altered to provide approximate answers to proximity queries and if so, how? We introduce a new kind of metric tree that allows overlap: certain datapoints may appear in both the children of a parent. We also introduce new approximate k-NN search algorithms on this structure. We show why these structures should be able to exploit the same randomprojection-based approximations that LSH enjoys, but with a simpler algorithm and perhaps with greater efﬁciency. We then provide a detailed empirical evaluation on ﬁve large, high dimensional datasets which show up to 31-fold accelerations over LSH. This result holds true throughout the spectrum of approximation levels. 1</p><p>6 0.062846005 <a title="130-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Validity_Estimates_for_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_on_Binary_Real-world_Networks.html">203 nips-2004-Validity Estimates for Loopy Belief Propagation on Binary Real-world Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Wojtek Kowalczyk, Nikos A. Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a gossip-based distributed algorithm for Gaussian mixture learning, Newscast EM. The algorithm operates on network topologies where each node observes a local quantity and can communicate with other nodes in an arbitrary point-to-point fashion. The main difference between Newscast EM and the standard EM algorithm is that the M-step in our case is implemented in a decentralized manner: (random) pairs of nodes repeatedly exchange their local parameter estimates and combine them by (weighted) averaging. We provide theoretical evidence and demonstrate experimentally that, under this protocol, nodes converge exponentially fast to the correct estimates in each M-step of the EM algorithm. 1</p><p>2 0.55446893 <a title="130-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Instance-Specific_Bayesian_Model_Averaging_for_Classification.html">86 nips-2004-Instance-Specific Bayesian Model Averaging for Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Classification algorithms typically induce population-wide models that are trained to perform well on average on expected future instances. We introduce a Bayesian framework for learning instance-specific models from data that are optimized to predict well for a particular instance. Based on this framework, we present a lazy instance-specific algorithm called ISA that performs selective model averaging over a restricted class of Bayesian networks. On experimental evaluation, this algorithm shows superior performance over model selection. We intend to apply such instance-specific algorithms to improve the performance of patient-specific predictive models induced from medical data. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n Commonly used classification algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian networks and support vector machines, typically induce a single model from a training set of instances, with the intent of applying it to all future instances. We call such a model a population-wide model because it is intended to be applied to an entire population of future instances. A population-wide model is optimized to predict well on average when applied to expected future instances. In contrast, an instance-specific model is one that is constructed specifically for a particular instance. The structure and parameters of an instance-specific model are specialized to the particular features of an instance, so that it is optimized to predict especially well for that instance. Usually, methods that induce population-wide models employ eager learning in which the model is induced from the training data before the test instance is encountered. In contrast, lazy learning defers most or all processing until a response to a test instance is required. Learners that induce instance-specific models are necessarily lazy in nature since they take advantage of the information in the test instance. An example of a lazy instance-specific method is the lazy Bayesian rule (LBR) learner, implemented by Zheng and Webb [1], which induces rules in a lazy fashion from examples in the neighborhood of the test instance. A rule generated by LBR consists of a conjunction of the attribute-value pairs present in the test instance as the antecedent and a local simple (naïve) Bayes classifier as the consequent. The structure of the local simple Bayes classifier consists of the attribute of interest as the parent of all other attributes that do not appear in the antecedent, and the parameters of the classifier are estimated from the subset of training instances that satisfy the antecedent. A greedy step-forward search selects the optimal LBR rule for a test instance to be classified. When evaluated on 29 UCI datasets, LBR had the lowest average error rate when compared to several eager learning methods [1]. Typically, both eager and lazy algorithms select a single model from some model space, ignoring the uncertainty in model selection. Bayesian model averaging is a coherent approach to dealing with the uncertainty in model selection, and it has been shown to improve the predictive performance of classifiers [2]. However, since the number of models in practically useful model spaces is enormous, exact model averaging over the entire model space is usually not feasible. In this paper, we describe a lazy instance-specific averaging (ISA) algorithm for classification that approximates Bayesian model averaging in an instance-sensitive manner. ISA extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging to an instance-specific model selection algorithm. While the ISA algorithm is currently able to directly handle only discrete variables and is computationally more intensive than comparable eager algorithms, the results in this paper show that it performs well. In medicine, such lazy instance-specific algorithms can be applied to patient-specific modeling for improving the accuracy of diagnosis, prognosis and risk assessment. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces a Bayesian framework for instance-specific learning. Section 3 describes the implementation of ISA. In Section 4, we evaluate ISA and compare its performance to that of LBR. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the results of the comparison. 2 Deci si on Th eo ret i c F rame wo rk We use the following notation. Capital letters like X, Z, denote random variables and corresponding lower case letters, x, z, denote specific values assigned to them. Thus, X = x denotes that variable X is assigned the value x. Bold upper case letters, such as X, Z, represent sets of variables or random vectors and their realization is denoted by the corresponding bold lower case letters, x, z. Hence, X = x denotes that the variables in X have the states given by x. In addition, Z denotes the target variable being predicted, X denotes the set of attribute variables, M denotes a model, D denotes the training dataset, and   denotes a generic test instance that is not in D. We now characterize population-wide and instance-specific model selection in decision theoretic terms. Given training data D and a separate generic test instance , the Bayes optimal prediction for Zt is obtained by combining the predictions of all models weighted by their posterior probabilities, as follows: P (Z t | X t , D ) = ∫ P( Z t | X t , M ) P ( M | D )dM . (1) M The optimal population-wide model for predicting Zt is as follows:   max∑ U P( Z t | X t , D), P (Z t | X t , M ) P ( X | D) , M  Xt  [ ] (2) where the function U gives the utility of approximating the Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt , D), with the estimate P(Zt | Xt , M) obtained from model M. The term P(X | D) is given by: P ( X | D) = ∫ P ( X | M ) P ( M | D)dM . (3) M The optimal instance-specific model for predicting Zt is as follows: { [ ]} max U P ( Z t | X t = x t , D), P (Z t | X t = x t , M ) , M (4) where xt are the values of the attributes of the test instance Xt for which we want to predict Zt. The Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt = xt, D), in Equation 4 is derived using Equation 1, for the special case in which Xt = xt . The difference between the population-wide and the instance-specific models can be noted by comparing Equations 2 and 4. Equation 2 for the population-wide model selects the model that on average will have the greatest utility. Equation 4 for the instance-specific model, however, selects the model that will have the greatest expected utility for the specific instance Xt = xt . For predicting Zt in a given instance Xt = xt, the model selected using Equation 2 can never have an expected utility greater than the model selected using Equation 4. This observation provides support for developing instance-specific models. Equations 2 and 4 represent theoretical ideals for population-wide and instancespecific model selection, respectively; we are not suggesting they are practical to compute. The current paper focuses on model averaging, rather than model selection. Ideal Bayesian model averaging is given by Equation 1. Model averaging has previously been applied using population-wide models. Studies have shown that approximate Bayesian model averaging using population-wide models can improve predictive performance over population-wide model selection [2]. The current paper concentrates on investigating the predictive performance of approximate Bayesian model averaging using instance-specific models. 3 In st an ce- S p eci fi c Algo ri t h m We present the implementation of the lazy instance-specific algorithm based on the above framework. ISA searches the space of a restricted class of Bayesian networks to select a subset of the models over which to derive a weighted (averaged) posterior of the target variable Zt . A key characteristic of the search is the use of a heuristic to select models that will have a significant influence on the weighted posterior. We introduce Bayesian networks briefly and then describe ISA in detail. 3.1 B ay e s i a n N e t w or k s A Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that combines a graphical representation (the Bayesian network structure) with quantitative information (the parameters of the Bayesian network) to represent the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables [3]. Specifically, a Bayesian network M representing the set of variables X consists of a pair (G, ΘG ). G is a directed acyclic graph that contains a node for every variable in X and an arc between every pair of nodes if the corresponding variables are directly probabilistically dependent. Conversely, the absence of an arc between a pair of nodes denotes probabilistic independence between the corresponding variables. ΘG represents the parameterization of the model. In a Bayesian network M, the immediate predecessors of a node X i in X are called the parents of X i and the successors, both immediate and remote, of Xi in X are called the descendants of X i . The immediate successors of X i are called the children of X i . For each node Xi there is a local probability distribution (that may be discrete or continuous) on that node given the state of its parents. The complete joint probability distribution over X, represented by the parameterization ΘG, can be factored into a product of local probability distributions defined on each node in the network. This factorization is determined by the independences captured by the structure of the Bayesian network and is formalized in the Bayesian network Markov condition: A node (representing a variable) is independent of its nondescendants given just its parents. According to this Markov condition, the joint probability distribution on model variables X = (X1 , X 2, …, X n ) can be factored as follows: n P ( X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) = ∏ P ( X i | parents( X i )) , (5) i =1 where parents(Xi ) denotes the set of nodes that are the parents of X i . If Xi has no parents, then the set parents(Xi ) is empty and P(Xi | parents(X i)) is just P(Xi ). 3.2 I S A M od e l s The LBR models of Zheng and Webb [1] can be represented as members of a restricted class of Bayesian networks (see Figure 1). We use the same class of Bayesian networks for the ISA models, to facilitate comparison between the two algorithms. In Figure 1, all nodes represent attributes that are discrete. Each node in X has either an outgoing arc into target node, Z, or receives an arc from Z. That is, each node is either a parent or a child of Z. Thus, X is partitioned into two sets: the first containing nodes (X 1 , …, X j in Figure 1) each of which is a parent of Z and every node in the second set, and the second containing nodes (X j+1 , …, X k in Figure 1) that have as parents the node Z and every node in the first set. The nodes in the first set are instantiated to the corresponding values in the test instance for which Zt is to be predicted. Thus, the first set of nodes represents the antecedent of the LBR rule and the second set of nodes represents the consequent. ... X1= x1 Xi = xi Z Xi+1 ... Xk Figure 1: An example of a Bayesian network LBR model with target node Z and k attribute nodes of which X1 , …, X j are instantiated to values x 1 , …, x j in xt . X 1, …, X j are present in the antecedent of the LBR rule and Z, X j+1 , …, X k (that form the local simple Bayes classifier) are present in the consequent. The indices need not be ordered as shown, but are presented in this example for convenience of exposition. 3.3 M od e l A ve r ag i n g For Bayesian networks, Equation 1 can be evaluated as follows: P ( Z t | x t , D ) = ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( M | D ) , (6) M with M being a Bayesian network comprised of structure G and parameters ΘG. The probability distribution of interest is a weighted average of the posterior distribution over all possible Bayesian networks where the weight is the probability of the Bayesian network given the data. Since exhaustive enumeration of all possible models is not feasible, even for this class of simple Bayesian networks, we approximate exact model averaging with selective model averaging. Let R be the set of models selected by the search procedure from all possible models in the model space, as described in the next section. Then, with selective model averaging, P(Zt | xt, D) is estimated as: ∑RP( Z t | x t , M ) P(M | D) P (Z t | x t , D) ≅ M ∈ . ∑RP(M | D) M∈ (7) Assuming uniform prior belief over all possible models, the model posterior P(M | D) in Equation 7 can be replaced by the marginal likelihood P(D | M), to obtain the following equation: P ( Z | x , D) ≅ t t ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( D | M ) . ∑RP( D | M ) M∈ M ∈R (8) The (unconditional) marginal likelihood P(D | M) in Equation 8, is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model to the data and is also known as the model score. While this score is suitable for assessing the model’s fit to the joint probability distribution, it is not necessarily appropriate for assessing the goodness of fit to a conditional probability distribution which is the focus in prediction and classification tasks, as is the case here. A more suitable score in this situation is a conditional model score that is computed from training data D of d instances as: d score( D, M ) = ∏ P ( z p | x1 ,..., x p ,z 1 ,...,z p −1 ,M ) . (9) p =1 This score is computed in a predictive and sequential fashion: for the pth training instance the probability of predicting the observed value zp for the target variable is computed based on the values of all the variables in the preceding p-1 training instances and the values xp of the attributes in the pth instance. One limitation of this score is that its value depends on the ordering of the data. Despite this limitation, it has been shown to be an effective scoring criterion for classification models [4]. The parameters of the Bayesian network M, used in the above computations, are defined as follows: P ( X i = k | parents ( X i ) = j ) ≡ θ ijk = N ijk + α ijk N ij + α ij , (10) where (i) Nijk is the number of instances in the training dataset D where variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, (ii) N ij = ∑k N ijk , (iii) αijk is a parameter prior that can be interpreted as the belief equivalent of having previously observed αijk instances in which variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, and (iv) α ij = ∑k α ijk . 3.4 M od e l Se a r c h We use a two-phase best-first heuristic search to sample the model space. The first phase ignores the evidence xt in the test instance while searching for models that have high scores as given by Equation 9. This is followed by the second phase that searches for models having the greatest impact on the prediction of Zt for the test instance, which we formalize below. The first phase searches for models that predict Z in the training data very well; these are the models that have high conditional model scores. The initial model is the simple Bayes network that includes all the attributes in X as children of Z. A succeeding model is derived from a current model by reversing the arc of a child node in the current model, adding new outgoing arcs from it to Z and the remaining children, and instantiating this node to the value in the test instance. This process is performed for each child in the current model. An incoming arc of a child node is considered for reversal only if the node’s value is not missing in the test instance. The newly derived models are added to a priority queue, Q. During each iteration of the search, the model with the highest score (given by Equation 9) is removed from Q and placed in a set R, following which new models are generated as described just above, scored and added to Q. The first phase terminates after a user-specified number of models have accumulated in R. The second phase searches for models that change the current model-averaged estimate of P(Zt | xt , D) the most. The idea here is to find viable competing models for making this posterior probability prediction. When no competitive models can be found, the prediction becomes stable. During each iteration of the search, the highest ranked model M* is removed from Q and added to R. The ranking is based on how much the model changes the current estimate of P(Zt | xt , D). More change is better. In particular, M* is the model in Q that maximizes the following function: f ( R, M *) = g ( R) − g ( R U {M *}) , (11) where for a set of models S, the function g(S) computes the approximate model averaged prediction for Zt, as follows: g (S ) = ∑ P(Z M ∈S t | x t , M ) score( D, M ) ∑ score( D, M ) ∈ . (12) M S The second phase terminates when no new model can be found that has a value (as given by Equation 11) that is greater than a user-specified minimum threshold T. The final distribution of Zt is then computed from the models in R using Equation 8. 4 Ev a lu a t i o n We evaluated ISA on the 29 UCI datasets that Zheng and Webb used for the evaluation of LBR. On the same datasets, we also evaluated a simple Bayes classifier (SB) and LBR. For SB and LBR, we used the Weka implementations (Weka v3.3.6, http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) with default settings [5]. We implemented the ISA algorithm as a standalone application in Java. The following settings were used for ISA: a maximum of 100 phase-1 models, a threshold T of 0.001 in phase-2, and an upper limit of 500 models in R. For the parameter priors in Equation 10, all αijk were set to 1. All error rates were obtained by averaging the results from two stratified 10-fold cross-validation (20 trials total) similar to that used by Zheng and Webb. Since, both LBR and ISA can handle only discrete attributes, all numeric attributes were discretized in a pre-processing step using the entropy based discretization method described in [6]. For each pair of training and test folds, the discretization intervals were first estimated from the training fold and then applied to both folds. The error rates of two algorithms on a dataset were compared with a paired t-test carried out at the 5% significance level on the error rate statistics obtained from the 20 trials. The results are shown in Table 1. Compared to SB, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 9 datasets and significantly more errors on one dataset. Compared to LBR, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 7 datasets and significantly more errors on two datasets. On two datasets, chess and tic-tac-toe, ISA shows considerable improvement in performance over both SB and LBR. With respect to computation Table 1: Percent error rates of simple Bayes (SB), Lazy Bayesian Rule (LBR) and Instance-Specific Averaging (ISA). A - indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly lower than the marked SB or LBR error rate. A + indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly higher.

An instance-specific algorithm like LBR that does model selection has been shown by Zheng and Webb to perform classification better than several eager algorithms [1]. Our results show that ISA, which extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging, improves overall on LBR, which provides support that we can obtain additional prediction improvement by performing instance-specific model averaging rather than just instance-specific model selection. In future work, we plan to explore further the behavior of ISA with respect to the number of models being averaged and the effect of the number of models selected in each of the two phases of the search. We will also investigate methods to improve the computational efficiency of ISA. In addition, we plan to examine other heuristics for model search as well as more general model spaces such as unrestricted Bayesian networks. The instance-specific framework is not restricted to the Bayesian network models that we have used in this investigation. In the future, we plan to explore other models using this framework. Our ultimate interest is to apply these instancespecific algorithms to improve patient-specific predictions (for diagnosis, therapy selection, and prognosis) and thereby to improve patient care.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Andrea Tironi, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of hierarchical classiﬁcation when labels corresponding to partial and/or multiple paths in the underlying taxonomy are allowed. We introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, implementing the simple intuition that additional mistakes in the subtree of a mistaken class should not be charged for. Based on a probabilistic data model introduced in earlier work, we derive the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. We then empirically compare two incremental approximations of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer with a ﬂat SVM classiﬁer and with classiﬁers obtained by using hierarchical versions of the Perceptron and SVM algorithms. The experiments show that our simplest incremental approximation of the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer performs, after just one training epoch, nearly as well as the hierarchical SVM classiﬁer (which performs best). For the same incremental algorithm we also derive an H-loss bound showing, when data are generated by our probabilistic data model, exponentially fast convergence to the H-loss of the hierarchical classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. 1 Introduction and basic deﬁnitions We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy of labels, where the taxonomy is speciﬁed as a tree forest. We assume that every data instance is labelled with a (possibly empty) set of class labels called multilabel, with the only requirement that multilabels including some node i in the taxonony must also include all ancestors of i. Thus, each multilabel corresponds to the union of one or more paths in the forest, where each path must start from a root but it can terminate on an internal node (rather than a leaf). Learning algorithms for hierarchical classiﬁcation have been investigated in, e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20]. However, the scenario where labelling includes multiple and partial paths has received very little attention. The analysis in [5], which is mainly theoretical, shows in the multiple and partial path case a 0/1-loss bound for a hierarchical learning algorithm based on regularized least-squares estimates. In this work we extend [5] in several ways. First, we introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, which is better suited than the 0/1-loss to analyze hierarchical classiﬁcation tasks, and we derive the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer under the parametric data model introduced in [5]. Second, considering various loss functions, including the H-loss, we empirically compare the performance of the following three incremental kernel-based ∗ This work was supported in part by the PASCAL Network of Excellence under EC grant no. 506778. This publication only reﬂects the authors’ views. algorithms: 1) a hierarchical version of the classical Perceptron algorithm [16]; 2) an approximation to the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer; 3) a simpliﬁed variant of this approximation. Finally, we show that, assuming data are indeed generated according to the parametric model mentioned before, the H-loss of the algorithm in 3) converges to the H-loss of the classiﬁer based on the true model parameters. Our incremental algorithms are based on training linear-threshold classiﬁers in each node of the taxonomy. A similar approach has been studied in [8], though their model does not consider multiple-path classiﬁcations as we do. Incremental algorithms are the main focus of this research, since we strongly believe that they are a key tool for coping with tasks where large quantities of data items are generated and the classiﬁcation system needs to be frequently adjusted to keep up with new items. However, we found it useful to provide a reference point for our empirical results. Thus we have also included in our experiments the results achieved by nonincremental algorithms. In particular, we have chosen a ﬂat and a hierarchical version of SVM [21, 7, 19], which are known to perform well on the textual datasets considered here. We assume data elements are encoded as real vectors x ∈ Rd which we call instances. A multilabel for an instance x is any subset of the set {1, . . . , N } of all labels/classes, including the empty set. We denote the multilabel associated with x by a vector y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N , where i belongs to the multilabel of x if and only if yi = 1. A taxonomy G is a forest whose trees are deﬁned over the set of labels. A multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N is said to respect a taxonomy G if and only if y is the union of one or more paths in G, where each path starts from a root but need not terminate on a leaf. See Figure 1. We assume the data-generating mechanism produces examples (x, y) such that y respects some ﬁxed underlying taxonomy G with N nodes. The set of roots in G is denoted by root(G). We use par(i) to denote the unique parent of node i, anc(i) to denote the set of ancestors of i, and sub(i) to denote the set of nodes in the subtree rooted at i (including i). Finally, given a predicate φ over a set Ω, we will use {φ} to denote both the subset of Ω where φ is true and the indicator function of this subset. 2 The H-loss Though several hierarchical losses have been proposed in the literature (e.g., in [11, 20]), no one has emerged as a standard yet. Since hierarchical losses are deﬁned over multilabels, we start by considering two very simple functions measuring the discrepancy between multilabels y = (y1 , ..., yN ) and y = (y1 , ..., yN ): the 0/1-loss 0/1 (y, y) = {∃i : yi = yi } and the symmetric difference loss ∆ (y, y) = {y1 = y1 } + . . . + {yN = yN }. There are several ways of making these losses depend on a given taxonomy G. In this work, we follow the intuition “if a mistake is made at node i, then further mistakes made in the subtree rooted at i are unimportant”. That is, we do not require the algorithm be able to make ﬁne-grained distinctions on tasks when it is unable to make coarse-grained ones. For example, if an algorithm failed to label a document with the class SPORTS, then the algorithm should not be charged more loss because it also failed to label the same document with the subclass SOCCER and the sub-subclass CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. A function implementing this intuition is deﬁned by N H (y, y) = i=1 ci {yi = yi ∧ yj = yj , j ∈ anc(i)}, where c1 , . . . , cN > 0 are ﬁxed cost coefﬁcients. This loss, which we call H-loss, can also be described as follows: all paths in G from a root down to a leaf are examined and, whenever we encounter a node i such that yi = yi , we add ci to the loss, whereas all the loss contributions in the subtree rooted at i are discarded. Note that if c1 = . . . = cN = 1 then 0/1 ≤ H ≤ ∆ . Choices of ci depending on the structure of G are proposed in Section 4. Given a multilabel y ∈ {0, 1}N deﬁne its G-truncation as the multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) ∈ {0, 1}N where, for each i = 1, . . . , N , yi = 1 iff yi = 1 and yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Note that the G-truncation of any multilabel always respects G. A graphical (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: A one-tree forest (repeated four times). Each node corresponds to a class in the taxonomy G, hence in this case N = 12. Gray nodes are included in the multilabel under consideration, white nodes are not.

(d) Superposition of multilabel (b) on multilabel (c): Only the checked nodes contribute to the H-loss between (b) and (c). representation of the notions introduced so far is given in Figure 1. In the next lemma we show that whenever y respects G, then H (y, y) cannot be smaller than H (y , y). In other words, when the multilabel y to be predicted respects a taxonomy G then there is no loss of generality in restricting to predictions which respect G. Lemma 1 Let G be a taxonomy, y, y ∈ {0, 1}N be two multilabels such that y respects G, and y be the G-truncation of y. Then H (y , y) ≤ H (y, y) . Proof. For each i = 1, . . . , N we show that yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i) implies yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Pick some i and suppose yi = yi and yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). Now suppose yj = 0 (and thus yj = 0) for some j ∈ anc(i). Then yi = 0 since y respects G. But this implies yi = 1, contradicting the fact that the G-truncation y respects G. Therefore, it must be the case that yj = yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i). Hence the G-truncation of y left each node j ∈ anc(i) unchanged, implying yj = yj for all j ∈ anc(i). But, since the G-truncation of y does not change the value of a node i whose ancestors j are such that yj = 1, this also implies yi = yi . Therefore yi = yi and the proof is concluded. 3 A probabilistic data model Our learning algorithms are based on the following statistical model for the data, originally introduced in [5]. The model deﬁnes a probability distribution fG over the set of multilabels respecting a given taxonomy G by associating with each node i of G a Bernoulli random variable Yi and deﬁning fG (y | x) = N i=1 P Yi = yi | Ypar(i) = ypar(i) , X = x . To guarantee that fG (y | x) = 0 whenever y ∈ {0, 1}N does not respect G, we set P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 0, X = x = 0. Notice that this deﬁnition of fG makes the (rather simplistic) assumption that all Yk with the same parent node i (i.e., the children of i) are independent when conditioned on Yi and x. Through fG we specify an i.i.d. process {(X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . .}, where, for t = 1, 2, . . ., the multilabel Y t is distributed according to fG (· | X t ) and X t is distributed according to a ﬁxed and unknown distribution D. Each example (xt , y t ) is thus a realization of the corresponding pair (X t , Y t ) of random variables. Our parametric model for fG is described as follows. First, we assume that the support of D is the surface of the d-dimensional unit sphere (i.e., instances x ∈ R d are such that ||x|| = 1). With each node i in the taxonomy, we associate a unit-norm weight vector ui ∈ Rd . Then, we deﬁne the conditional probabilities for a nonroot node i with parent j by P (Yi = 1 | Yj = 1, X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. If i is a root node, the previous equation simpliﬁes to P (Yi = 1 | X = x) = (1 + ui x)/2. 3.1 The Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss We now describe a classiﬁer, called H - BAYES, that is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer for the H-loss. In other words, H - BAYES classiﬁes any instance x with the multilabel y = argminy∈{0,1} E[ H (¯ , Y ) | x ]. Deﬁne pi (x) = P Yi = 1 | Ypar(i) = 1, X = x . y ¯ When no ambiguity arises, we write pi instead of pi (x). Now, ﬁx any unit-length instance x and let y be a multilabel that respects G. For each node i in G, recursively deﬁne H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + k∈child(i) H k,x (y) . The classiﬁer H - BAYES operates as follows. It starts by putting all nodes of G in a set S; nodes are then removed from S one by one. A node i can be removed only if i is a leaf or if all nodes j in the subtree rooted at i have been already removed. When i is removed, its value yi is set to 1 if and only if pi 2 − k∈child(i) H k,x (y)/ci ≥ 1 . (1) (Note that if i is a leaf then (1) is equivalent to yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}.) If yi is set to zero, then all nodes in the subtree rooted at i are set to zero. Theorem 2 For any taxonomy G and all unit-length x ∈ Rd , the multilabel generated by H - BAYES is the Bayes-optimal classiﬁcation of x for the H-loss. Proof sketch. Let y be the multilabel assigned by H - BAYES and y ∗ be any multilabel minimizing the expected H-loss. Introducing the short-hand Ex [·] = E[· | x], we can write Ex H (y, Y )= N i=1 ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} . Note that we can recursively decompose the expected H-loss as Ex H (y, Y )= i∈root(G) where Ex Hi (y, Y ) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) Ex Hi (y, Y ), pj {yj = 1} + j∈anc(i) Ex Hk (y, Y ) . (2) k∈child(i) ∗ Pick a node i. If i is a leaf, then the sum in the RHS of (2) disappears and yi = {pi ≥ 1/2}, ∗ which is also the minimizer of H i,x (y) = ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ), implying yi = yi . ∗ Now let i be an internal node and inductively assume yj = yj for all j ∈ sub(i). Notice ∗ that the factors j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} occur in both terms in the RHS of (2). Hence yi does not depend on these factors and we can equivalently minimize ci (pi (1 − yi ) + (1 − pi )yi ) + pi {yi = 1} k∈child(i) H k,x (y), (3) where we noted that, for each k ∈ child(i), Ex Hk (y, Y ) = j∈anc(i) pj {yj = 1} pi {yi = 1}H k,x (y) . ∗ Now observe that yi minimizing (3) is equivalent to the assignment produced by H - BAYES. ∗ ∗ To conclude the proof, note that whenever yi = 0, Lemma 1 requires that yj = 0 for all nodes j ∈ sub(i), which is exactly what H - BAYES does. 4 The algorithms We consider three incremental algorithms. Each one of these algorithms learns a hierarchical classiﬁer by training a decision function gi : Rd → {0, 1} at each node i = 1, . . . , N . For a given set g1 , . . . , gN of decision functions, the hierarchical classiﬁer generated by these algorithms classiﬁes an instance x through a multilabel y = (y1 , ..., yN ) deﬁned as follows: yi = gi (x) 0 if i ∈ root(G) or yj = 1 for all j ∈ anc(i) otherwise. (4) Note that y computed this way respects G. The classiﬁers (4) are trained incrementally. Let gi,t be the decision function at node i after training on the ﬁrst t − 1 examples. When the next training example (xt , y t ) is available, the algorithms compute the multilabel y t using classiﬁer (4) based on g1,t (xt ), . . . , gN,t (xt ). Then, the algorithms consider for an update only those decision functions sitting at nodes i satisfying either i ∈ root(G) or ypar(i),t = 1. We call such nodes eligible at time t. The decision functions of all other nodes are left unchanged. The ﬁrst algorithm we consider is a simple hierarchical version of the Perceptron algorithm [16], which we call H - PERC. The decision functions at time t are deﬁned by gi,t (xt ) = {wi,t xt ≥ 0}. In the update phase, the Perceptron rule wi,t+1 = wi,t + yi,t xt is applied to every node i eligible at time t and such that yi,t = yi,t . The second algorithm, called APPROX - H - BAYES, approximates the H - BAYES classiﬁer of Section 3.1 by replacing the unknown quantities pi (xt ) with estimates (1+w i,t xt )/2. The weights w i,t are regularized least-squares estimates deﬁned by (i) wi,t = (I + Si,t−1 Si,t−1 + xt xt )−1 Si,t−1 y t−1 . (5) The columns of the matrix Si,t−1 are all past instances xs that have been stored at node i; (i) the s-th component of vector y t−1 is the i-th component yi,s of the multilabel y s associated with instance xs . In the update phase, an instance xt is stored at node i, causing an update of wi,t , whenever i is eligible at time t and |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t , where Ni,t is the number of instances stored at node i up to time t − 1. The corresponding decision functions gi,t are of the form gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ τi,t }, where the threshold τi,t ≥ 0 at node i depends on the margin values w j,t xt achieved by nodes j ∈ sub(i) — recall (1). Note that gi,t is not a linear-threshold function, as xt appears in the deﬁnition of w i,t . The margin threshold (5 ln t)/Ni,t , controlling the update of node i at time t, reduces the space requirements of the classiﬁer by keeping matrices Si,t suitably small. This threshold is motivated by the work [4] on selective sampling. The third algorithm, which we call H - RLS (Hierarchical Regularized Least Squares), is a simpliﬁed variant of APPROX - H - BAYES in which the thresholds τi,t are set to zero. That is, we have gi,t (xt ) = {w i,t xt ≥ 0} where the weights w i,t are deﬁned as in (5) and updated as in the APPROX - H - BAYES algorithm. Details on how to run APPROX - H - BAYES 2 and H - RLS in dual variables and perform an update at node i in time O(Ni,t ) are found in [3] (where a mistake-driven version of H - RLS is analyzed). 5 Experimental results The empirical evaluation of the algorithms was carried out on two well-known datasets of free-text documents. The ﬁrst dataset consists of the ﬁrst (in chronological order) 100,000 newswire stories from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1, RCV1 [2]. The associated taxonomy of labels, which are the topics of the documents, has 101 nodes organized in a forest of 4 trees. The forest is shallow: the longest path has length 3 and the the distribution of nodes, sorted by increasing path length, is {0.04, 0.53, 0.42, 0.01}. For this dataset, we used the bag-of-words vectorization performed by Xerox Research Center Europe within the EC project KerMIT (see [4] for details on preprocessing). The 100,000 documents were divided into 5 equally sized groups of chronologically consecutive documents. We then used each adjacent pair of groups as training and test set in an experiment (here the ﬁfth and ﬁrst group are considered adjacent), and then averaged the test set performance over the 5 experiments. The second dataset is a speciﬁc subtree of the OHSUMED corpus of medical abstracts [1]: the subtree rooted in “Quality of Health Care” (MeSH code N05.715). After removing overlapping classes (OHSUMED is not quite a tree but a DAG), we ended up with 94 Table 1: Experimental results on two hierarchical text classiﬁcation tasks under various loss functions. We report average test errors along with standard deviations (in parenthesis). In bold are the best performance ﬁgures among the incremental algorithms.

We made this choice based only on the structure of the subtree: the longest path has length 4, the distribution of nodes sorted by increasing path length is {0.26, 0.37, 0.22, 0.12, 0.03}, and there are a signiﬁcant number of partial and multiple path multilabels. The vectorization of the subtree was carried out as follows: after tokenization, we removed all stopwords and also those words that did not occur at least 3 times in the corpus. Then, we vectorized the documents using the Bow library [13] with a log(1 + TF) log(IDF) encoding. We ran 5 experiments by randomly splitting the corpus in a training set of 40,000 documents and a test set of 15,503 documents. Test set performances are averages over these 5 experiments. In the training set we kept more documents than in the RCV1 splits since the OHSUMED corpus turned out to be a harder classiﬁcation problem than RCV1. In both datasets instances have been normalized to unit length. We tested the hierarchical Perceptron algorithm (H - PERC), the hierarchical regularized leastsquares algorithm (H - RLS), and the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm (APPROX - H BAYES ), all described in Section 4. The results are summarized in Table 1. APPROX - H BAYES ( AH - BAY in Table 1) was trained using cost coefﬁcients c i chosen as follows: if i ∈ root(G) then ci = |root(G)|−1 . Otherwise, ci = cj /|child(j)|, where j is the parent of i. Note that this choice of coefﬁcients amounts to splitting a unit cost equally among the roots and then splitting recursively each node’s cost equally among its children. Since, in this case, 0 ≤ H ≤ 1, we call the resulting loss normalized H-loss. We also tested a hierarchical version of SVM (denoted by H - SVM in Table 1) in which each node is an SVM classiﬁer trained using a batch version of our hierarchical learning protocol. More precisely, each node i was trained only on those examples (xt , y t ) such that ypar(i),t = 1 (note that, as no conditions are imposed on yi,t , node i is actually trained on both positive and negative examples). The resulting set of linear-threshold functions was then evaluated on the test set using the hierachical classiﬁcation scheme (4). We tried both the C and ν parametrizations [18] for SVM and found the setting C = 1 to work best for our data. 1 We ﬁnally tested the “ﬂat” variants of Perceptron and SVM, denoted by PERC and SVM. In these variants, each node is trained and evaluated independently of the others, disregarding all taxonomical information. All SVM experiments were carried out using the libSVM implementation [6]. All the tested algorithms used a linear kernel. 1 It should be emphasized that this tuning of C was actually chosen in hindsight, with no crossvalidation. As far as loss functions are concerned, we considered the 0/1-loss, the H-loss with cost coefﬁcients set to 1 (denoted by uniform H-loss), the normalized H-loss, and the symmetric difference loss (denoted by ∆-loss). Note that H - SVM performs best, but our incremental algorithms were trained for a single epoch on the training set. The good performance of SVM (the ﬂat variant of H - SVM ) is surprising. However, with a single epoch of training H - RLS does not perform worse than SVM (except on OHSUMED under the normalized H-loss) and comes reasonably close to H - SVM. On the other hand, the performance of APPROX - H - BAYES is disappointing: on OHSUMED it is the best algorithm only for the uniform H-loss, though it was trained using the normalized H-loss; on RCV1 it never outperforms H - RLS, though it always does better than PERC and H - PERC. A possible explanation for this behavior is that APPROX - H - BAYES is very sensitive to errors in the estimates of pi (x) (recall Section 3.1). Indeed, the least-squares estimates (5), which we used to approximate H - BAYES, seem to work better in practice on simpler (and possibly more robust) algorithms, such as H - RLS. The lower values of normalized H-loss on OHSUMED (a harder corpus than RCV1) can be explained because a quarter of the 94 nodes in the OHSUMED taxonomy are roots, and thus each top-level mistake is only charged about 4/94. As a ﬁnal remark, we observe that the normalized H-loss gave too small a range of values to afford ﬁne comparisons among the best performing algorithms. 6 Regret bounds for the H-loss In this section we prove a theoretical bound on the H-loss of a slight variant of the algorithm H - RLS tested in Section 5. More precisely, we assume data are generated according to the probabilistic model introduced in Section 3 with unknown instance distribution D and unknown coefﬁcients u1 , . . . , uN . We deﬁne the regret of a classiﬁer assigning label y to instance X as E H (y, Y t ) − E H (y, Y ), where the expected value is with respect the random draw of (X, Y ) and y is the multilabel assigned by classiﬁer (4) when the decision functions gi are zero-threshold functions of the form gi (x) = {ui x ≥ 0}. The theorem below shows that the regret of the classiﬁer learned by a variant of H - RLS after t training examples, with t large enough, is exponentially small in t. In other words, H - RLS learns to classify as well as the algorithm that is given the true parameters u1 , . . . , uN of the underlying data-generating process. We have been able to prove the theorem only for the variant of H - RLS storing all instances at each node. That is, every eligible node at time t is updated, irrespective of whether |w i,t xt | ≤ (5 ln t)/Ni,t . Given the i.i.d. data-generating process (X 1 , Y 1 ), (X 2 , Y 2 ), . . ., for each node k we deﬁne the derived process X k1 , X k2 , . . . including all and only the instances X s of the original process that satisfy Ypar(k),s = 1. We call this derived process the process at node k. Note that, for each k, the process at node k is an i.i.d. process. However, its distribution might depend on k. The spectrum of the process at node k is the set of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix with entries E[Xk1 ,i Xk1 ,j ] for i, j = 1, . . . , d. We have the following theorem, whose proof is omitted due to space limitations.

We have introduced a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, derived the corresponding Bayes-optimal classiﬁer, and empirically compared an incremental approximation to this classiﬁer with some other incremental and nonincremental algorithms. Finally, we have derived a theoretical guarantee on the H-loss of a simpliﬁed variant of the approximated Bayes-optimal algorithm. Our investigation leaves several open issues. The current approximation to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer is not satisfying, and this could be due to a bad choice of the model, of the estimators, of the datasets, or of a combination of them. Also, the normalized H-loss is not fully satisfying, since the resulting values are often too small. From the theoretical viewpoint, we would like to analyze the regret of our algorithms with respect to the Bayesoptimal classiﬁer, rather than with respect to a classiﬁer that makes a suboptimal use of the true model parameters.

<p>Author: Michael P. Holmes, Charles Jr.</p><p>Abstract: Schema learning is a way to discover probabilistic, constructivist, predictive action models (schemas) from experience. It includes methods for ﬁnding and using hidden state to make predictions more accurate. We extend the original schema mechanism [1] to handle arbitrary discrete-valued sensors, improve the original learning criteria to handle POMDP domains, and better maintain hidden state by using schema predictions. These extensions show large improvement over the original schema mechanism in several rewardless POMDPs, and achieve very low prediction error in a difﬁcult speech modeling task. Further, we compare extended schema learning to the recently introduced predictive state representations [2], and ﬁnd their predictions of next-step action effects to be approximately equal in accuracy. This work lays the foundation for a schema-based system of integrated learning and planning. 1</p><p>5 0.42749089 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Resolving_Perceptual_Aliasing_In_The_Presence_Of_Noisy_Sensors.html">154 nips-2004-Resolving Perceptual Aliasing In The Presence Of Noisy Sensors</a></p>

<p>Author: Kumar Chellapilla, Patrice Y. Simard</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is often used to automatically solve human tasks. In this paper, we look for tasks where machine learning algorithms are not as good as humans with the hope of gaining insight into their current limitations. We studied various Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) on the market, because they are systems designed to tell computers and humans apart by posing challenges presumably too hard for computers. We found that most HIPs are pure recognition tasks which can easily be broken using machine learning. The harder HIPs use a combination of segmentation and recognition tasks. From this observation, we found that building segmentation tasks is the most effective way to confuse machine learning algorithms. This has enabled us to build effective HIPs (which we deployed in MSN Passport), as well as design challenging segmentation tasks for machine learning algorithms. 1 In t rod u ct i on The OCR problem for high resolution printed text has virtually been solved 10 years ago [1]. On the other hand, cursive handwriting recognition today is still too poor for most people to rely on. Is there a fundamental difference between these two seemingly similar problems? To shed more light on this question, we study problems that have been designed to be difficult for computers. The hope is that we will get some insight on what the stumbling blocks are for machine learning and devise appropriate tests to further understand their similarities and differences. Work on distinguishing computers from humans traces back to the original Turing Test [2] which asks that a human distinguish between another human and a machine by asking questions of both. Recent interest has turned to developing systems that allow a computer to distinguish between another computer and a human. These systems enable the construction of automatic filters that can be used to prevent automated scripts from utilizing services intended for humans [4]. Such systems have been termed Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) [3] or Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) [4]. An overview of the work in this area can be found in [5]. Construction of HIPs that are of practical value is difficult because it is not sufficient to develop challenges at which humans are somewhat more successful than machines. This is because the cost of failure for an automatic attacker is minimal compared to the cost of failure for humans. Ideally a HIP should be solved by humans more than 80% of the time, while an automatic script with reasonable resource use should succeed less than 0.01% of the time. This latter ratio (1 in 10,000) is a function of the cost of an automatic trial divided by the cost of having a human perform the attack. This constraint of generating tasks that are failed 99.99% of the time by all automated algorithms has generated various solutions which can easily be sampled on the internet. Seven different HIPs, namely, Mailblocks, MSN (before April 28th, 2004), Ticketmaster, Yahoo, Yahoo v2 (after Sept’04), Register, and Google, will be given as examples in the next section. We will show in Section 3 that machinelearning-based attacks are far more successful than 1 in 10,000. Yet, some of these HIPs are harder than others and could be made even harder by identifying the recognition and segmentation parts, and emphasizing the latter. Section 4 presents examples of more difficult HIPs which are much more respectable challenges for machine learning, and yet surprisingly easy for humans. The final section discusses a (known) weakness of machine learning algorithms and suggests designing simple artificial datasets for studying this weakness. 2 Exa mp les o f H I Ps The HIPs explored in this paper are made of characters (or symbols) rendered to an image and presented to the user. Solving the HIP requires identifying all characters in the correct order. The following HIPs can be sampled from the web: Mailblocks: While signing up for free email service with (www.mailblocks.com), you will find HIP challenges of the type: mailblocks MSN: While signing up for free e-mail with MSN Hotmail (www.hotmail.com), you will find HIP challenges of the type: Register.com: While requesting a whois lookup for a domain at www.register.com, you will HIP challenges of the type: Yahoo!/EZ-Gimpy (CMU): While signing up for free e-mail service with Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), you will receive HIP challenges of the type: Yahoo! (version 2): Starting in August 2004, Yahoo! introduced their second generation HIP. Three examples are presented below: Ticketmaster: While looking for concert tickets at www.ticketmaster.com, you will receive HIP challenges of the type: Google/Gmail: While signing up for free e-mail with Gmail at www.google.com, one will receive HIP challenges of the type: While solutions to Yahoo HIPs are common English words, those for ticketmaster and Google do not necessarily belong to the English dictionary. They appear to have been created using a phonetic generator [8]. 3 Usi n g ma ch i n e lea rn i n g t o b rea k H IP s Breaking HIPs is not new. Mori and Malik [7] have successfully broken the EZGimpy (92% success) and Gimpy (33% success) HIPs from CMU. Our approach aims at an automatic process for solving multiple HIPs with minimum human intervention, using machine learning. In this paper, our main goal is to learn more about the common strengths and weaknesses of these HIPs rather than to prove that we can break any one HIP in particular with the highest possible success rate. We have results for six different HIPs: EZ-Gimpy/Yahoo, Yahoo v2, mailblocks, register, ticketmaster, and Google. To simplify our study, we will not be using language models in our attempt to break HIPs. For example, there are only about 600 words in the EZ-Gimpy dictionary [7], which means that a random guess attack would get a success rate of 1 in 600 (more than enough to break the HIP, i.e., greater than 0.01% success). HIPs become harder when no language model is used. Similarly, when a HIP uses a language model to generate challenges, success rate of attacks can be significantly improved by incorporating the language model. Further, since the language model is not common to all HIPs studied, it was not used in this paper. Our generic method for breaking all of these HIPs is to write a custom algorithm to locate the characters, and then use machine learning for recognition. Surprisingly, segmentation, or finding the characters, is simple for many HIPs which makes the process of breaking the HIP particularly easy. Gimpy uses a single constant predictable color (black) for letters even though the background color changes. We quickly realized that once the segmentation problem is solved, solving the HIP becomes a pure recognition problem, and it can trivially be solved using machine learning. Our recognition engine is based on neural networks [6][9]. It yielded a 0.4% error rate on the MNIST database, uses little memory, and is very fast for recognition (important for breaking HIPs). For each HIP, we have a segmentation step, followed by a recognition step. It should be stressed that we are not trying to solve every HIP of a given type i.e., our goal is not 100% success rate, but something efficient that can achieve much better than 0.01%. In each of the following experiments, 2500 HIPs were hand labeled and used as follows (a) recognition (1600 for training, 200 for validation, and 200 for testing), and (b) segmentation (500 for testing segmentation). For each of the five HIPs, a convolution neural network, identical to the one described in [6], was trained and tested on gray level character images centered on the guessed character positions (see below). The trained neural network became the recognizer. 3.1 M a i l b l oc k s To solve the HIP, we select the red channel, binarize and erode it, extract the largest connected components (CCs), and breakup CCs that are too large into two or three adjacent CCs. Further, vertically overlapping half character size CCs are merged. The resulting rough segmentation works most of the time. Here is an example: For instance, in the example above, the NN would be trained, and tested on the following images: … The end-to-end success rate is 88.8% for segmentation, 95.9% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.888)*(0.959)7 = 66.2% total. Note that most of the errors come from segmentation, even though this is where all the custom programming was invested. 3.2 Register The procedure to solve HIPs is very similar. The image was smoothed, binarized, and the largest 5 connected components were identified. Two examples are presented below: The end-to-end success rate is 95.4% for segmentation, 87.1% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.954)*(0.871)5 = 47.8% total. 3.3 Y a h oo/ E Z - G i mp y Unlike the mailblocks and register HIPs, the Yahoo/EZ-Gimpy HIPs are richer in that a variety of backgrounds and clutter are possible. Though some amount of text warping is present, the text color, size, and font have low variability. Three simple segmentation algorithms were designed with associated rules to identify which algorithm to use. The goal was to keep these simple yet effective: a) No mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: b) Black mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, remove vertical and horizontal line pixels that don’t have neighboring pixels, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: c) White mesh: Convert to grayscale image, threshold to black and white, add black pixels (in white line locations) if there exist neighboring pixels, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: Tests for black and white meshes were performed to determine which segmentation algorithm to use. The end-to-end success rate was 56.2% for segmentation (38.2% came from a), 11.8% from b), and 6.2% from c), 90.3% for recognition (given correct segmentation), and (0.562)*(0.903)4.8 = 34.4% total. The average length of a Yahoo HIP solution is 4.8 characters. 3.4 T i c k e t ma s t e r The procedure that solved the Yahoo HIP is fairly successful at solving some of the ticket master HIPs. These HIPs are characterized by cris-crossing lines at random angles clustered around 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees. A multipronged attack as in the Yahoo case (section 3.3) has potential. In the interests of simplicity, a single attack was developed: Convert to grayscale, threshold to black and white, up-sample image, dilate first then erode, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. One example: The dilate-erode combination causes the lines to be removed (along with any thin objects) but retains solid thick characters. This single attack is successful in achieving an end-to-end success rate of 16.6% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 82.3% (in spite of interfering lines), and (0.166)*(0.823)6.23 = 4.9% total. The average HIP solution length is 6.23 characters. 3.5 Y a h oo ve r s i on 2 The second generation HIP from Yahoo had several changes: a) it did not use words from a dictionary or even use a phonetic generator, b) it uses only black and white colors, c) uses both letters and digits, and d) uses connected lines and arcs as clutter. The HIP is somewhat similar to the MSN/Passport HIP which does not use a dictionary, uses two colors, uses letters and digits, and background and foreground arcs as clutter. Unlike the MSN/Passport HIP, several different fonts are used. A single segmentation attack was developed: Remove 6 pixel border, up-sample, dilate first then erode, select large CCs with sizes close to HIP char sizes. The attack is practically identical to that used for the ticketmaster HIP with different preprocessing stages and slightly modified parameters. Two examples: This single attack is successful in achieving an end-to-end success rate of 58.4% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 95.2%, and (0.584)*(0.952)5 = 45.7% total. The average HIP solution length is 5 characters. 3.6 G oog l e / G M a i l The Google HIP is unique in that it uses only image warp as a means of distorting the characters. Similar to the MSN/Passport and Yahoo version 2 HIPs, it is also two color. The HIP characters are arranged closed to one another (they often touch) and follow a curved baseline. The following very simple attack was used to segment Google HIPs: Convert to grayscale, up-sample, threshold and separate connected components. a) b) This very simple attack gives an end-to-end success rate of 10.2% for segmentation, the recognition rate was 89.3%, giving (0.102)*(0.893)6.5 = 4.89% total probability of breaking a HIP. Average Google HIP solution length is 6.5 characters. This can be significantly improved upon by judicious use of dilate-erode attack. A direct application doesn’t do as well as it did on the ticketmaster and yahoo HIPs (because of the shear and warp of the baseline of the word). More successful and complicated attacks might estimate and counter the shear and warp of the baseline to achieve better success rates. 4 Lesso n s lea rn ed f ro m b rea ki n g H IPs From the previous section, it is clear that most of the errors come from incorrect segmentations, even though most of the development time is spent devising custom segmentation schemes. This observation raises the following questions: Why is segmentation a hard problem? Can we devise harder HIPs and datasets? Can we build an automatic segmentor? Can we compare classification algorithms based on how useful they are for segmentation? 4.1 T h e s e g me n t a t i on p r ob l e m As a review, segmentation is difficult for the following reasons: 1. Segmentation is computationally expensive. In order to find valid patterns, a recognizer must attempt recognition at many different candidate locations. 2. The segmentation function is complex. To segment successfully, the system must learn to identify which patterns are valid among the set of all possible valid and non-valid patterns. This task is intrinsically more difficult than classification because the space of input is considerably larger. Unlike the space of valid patterns, the space of non-valid patterns is typically too vast to sample. This is a problem for many learning algorithms which yield too many false positives when presented non-valid patterns. 3. Identifying valid characters among a set of valid and invalid candidates is a combinatorial problem. For example, correctly identifying which 8 characters among 20 candidates (assuming 12 false positives), has a 1 in 125,970 (20 choose 8) chances of success by random guessing. 4.2 B ui l d i n g b e t te r / h a r de r H I P s We can use what we have learned to build better HIPs. For instance the HIP below was designed to make segmentation difficult and a similar version has been deployed by MSN Passport for hotmail registrations (www.hotmail.com): The idea is that the additional arcs are themselves good candidates for false characters. The previous segmentation attacks would fail on this HIP. Furthermore, simple change of fonts, distortions, or arc types would require extensive work for the attacker to adjust to. We believe HIPs that emphasize the segmentation problem, such as the above example, are much stronger than the HIPs we examined in this paper, which rely on recognition being difficult. Pushing this to the extreme, we can easily generate the following HIPs: Despite the apparent difficulty of these HIPs, humans are surprisingly good at solving these, indicating that humans are far better than computers at segmentation. This approach of adding several competing false positives can in principle be used to automatically create difficult segmentation problems or benchmarks to test classification algorithms. 4.3 B ui l d i n g a n a ut o ma t i c s e g me n t or To build an automatic segmentor, we could use the following procedure. Label characters based on their correct position and train a recognizer. Apply the trained recognizer at all locations in the HIP image. Collect all candidate characters identified with high confidence by the recognizer. Compute the probability of each combination of candidates (going from left to right), and output the solution string with the highest probability. This is better illustrated with an example. Consider the following HIP (to the right). The trained neural network has these maps (warm colors indicate recognition) that show that K, Y, and so on are correctly identified. However, the maps for 7 and 9 show several false positives. In general, we would get the following color coded map for all the different candidates: HIP K Y B 7 9 With a threshold of 0.5 on the network’s outputs, the map obtained is: We note that there are several false positives for each true positive. The number of false positives per true positive character was found to be between 1 and 4, giving a 1 in C(16,8) = 12,870 to 1 in C(32,8) = 10,518,300 random chance of guessing the correct segmentation for the HIP characters. These numbers can be improved upon by constraining solution strings to flow sequentially from left to right and by restricting overlap. For each combination, we compute a probability by multiplying the 8 probabilities of the classifier for each position. The combination with the highest probability is the one proposed by the classifier. We do not have results for such an automatic segmentor at this time. It is interesting to note that with such a method a classifier that is robust to false positives would do far better than one that is not. This suggests another axis for comparing classifiers. 5 Con clu si on In this paper, we have successfully applied machine learning to the problem of solving HIPs. We have learned that decomposing the HIP problem into segmentation and recognition greatly simplifies analysis. Recognition on even unprocessed images (given segmentation is a solved) can be done automatically using neural networks. Segmentation, on the other hand, is the difficulty differentiator between weaker and stronger HIPs and requires custom intervention for each HIP. We have used this observation to design new HIPs and new tests for machine learning algorithms with the hope of improving them.

<p>Author: Wojtek Kowalczyk, Nikos A. Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a gossip-based distributed algorithm for Gaussian mixture learning, Newscast EM. The algorithm operates on network topologies where each node observes a local quantity and can communicate with other nodes in an arbitrary point-to-point fashion. The main difference between Newscast EM and the standard EM algorithm is that the M-step in our case is implemented in a decentralized manner: (random) pairs of nodes repeatedly exchange their local parameter estimates and combine them by (weighted) averaging. We provide theoretical evidence and demonstrate experimentally that, under this protocol, nodes converge exponentially fast to the correct estimates in each M-step of the EM algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.70118564 <a title="130-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Collaborative_Prediction_with_Low-Rank_Matrices.html">71 nips-2004-Generalization Error Bounds for Collaborative Prediction with Low-Rank Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Srebro, Noga Alon, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We prove generalization error bounds for predicting entries in a partially observed matrix by ﬁtting the observed entries with a low-rank matrix. In justifying the analysis approach we take to obtain the bounds, we present an example of a class of functions of ﬁnite pseudodimension such that the sums of functions from this class have unbounded pseudodimension. 1</p><p>4 0.60677576 <a title="130-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Analysis_of_a_greedy_active_learning_strategy.html">23 nips-2004-Analysis of a greedy active learning strategy</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: We abstract out the core search problem of active learning schemes, to better understand the extent to which adaptive labeling can improve sample complexity. We give various upper and lower bounds on the number of labels which need to be queried, and we prove that a popular greedy active learning rule is approximately as good as any other strategy for minimizing this number of labels. 1</p><p>5 0.60210454 <a title="130-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>6 0.59617895 <a title="130-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_via_Gaussian_Processes.html">166 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning via Gaussian Processes</a></p>

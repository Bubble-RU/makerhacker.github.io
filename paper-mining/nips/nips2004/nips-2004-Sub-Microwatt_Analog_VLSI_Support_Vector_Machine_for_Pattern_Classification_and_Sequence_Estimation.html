</p><p>6 1  Introduction  The key to attaining autonomy in wireless sensory systems is to embed pattern recognition intelligence directly at the sensor interface. [sent-8, score-0.19]
</p><p>7 Severe power constraints in wireless integrated systems incur design optimization across device, circuit, architecture and system levels [1]. [sent-9, score-0.27]
</p><p>8 Although system-on-chip methodologies have been primarily digital, analog integrated systems are emerging as promising alternatives with higher energy efﬁciency and integration density, exploiting the analog sensory interface and computational primitives inherent in device physics [2]. [sent-10, score-0.461]
</p><p>9 Analog VLSI has been chosen, for instance, to implement Viterbi [3] and HMM-based [4] sequence decoding in communications and speech processing. [sent-11, score-0.354]
</p><p>10 Forward-Decoding Kernel Machines (FDKM) [5] provide an adaptive framework for general maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence decoding, that avoid the need for backward recursion over the data in Viterbi and HMM-based sequence decoding [6]. [sent-12, score-0.478]
</p><p>11 At the core of FDKM is a support vector machine (SVM) [7] for large-margin trainable pattern classiﬁcation, performing noise-robust regression of transition probabilities in forward sequence estimation. [sent-13, score-0.319]
</p><p>12 The achievable limits of FDKM power-consumption are determined by the number of support vectors (i. [sent-14, score-0.078]
</p><p>13 , regression templates), which in turn are determined by the complexity of the discrimination task and the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor interface [8]. [sent-16, score-0.046]

</p><p>15 In this paper we describe an implementation of FDKM in silicon, for use in adaptive sequence detection and pattern recognition. [sent-18, score-0.114]
</p><p>16 The chip is fully conﬁgurable with parameters directly downloadable onto an array of ﬂoating-gate CMOS computational memory cells. [sent-19, score-0.385]
</p><p>17 By means of calibration and chip-in-loop training, the effect of mismatch and non-linearity in the analog implementation is signiﬁcantly reduced. [sent-20, score-0.313]
</p><p>18 Section 3 describes the schematic details of hardware implementation of FDKM. [sent-22, score-0.082]
</p><p>19 Section 4 presents results from experiments conducted with the fabricated chip and Section 5 concludes with future directions. [sent-23, score-0.324]
</p><p>20 2  FDKM Sequence Decoding  FDKM recognition and sequence decoding are formulated in the framework of MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation, combining Markovian dynamics with kernel machines. [sent-24, score-0.449]
</p><p>21 The MAP forward decoder receives the sequence X[n] = {x[1], x[2], . [sent-25, score-0.184]
</p><p>22 , x[n]} and produces an estimate of conditional probability measure of state variables q[n] over all classes i ∈ 1, . [sent-28, score-0.048]
</p><p>23 Unlike hidden Markov models, the states directly encode the symbols, and the observations x modulate transition probabilities between states [6]. [sent-31, score-0.092]
</p><p>24 Forward decoding (1) expresses ﬁrst order Markovian sequential dependence of state probabilities conditioned on the data. [sent-33, score-0.328]
</p><p>25 The transition probabilities Pij [n] in (1) attached to each outgoing state j are obtained by normalizing the SVM regression outputs fij (x): Pij [n] = [fij (x[n]) − zj [n]]+  (2)  Vdd  M4  A  Vc  Vg ref  Vc  M1  Vtunn  Vg M2  M3  C  Vtunn  B  Iout  Iin (a) Vdd  (x. [sent-34, score-0.302]
</p><p>26 (a) Multiply accumulate cell and reference cell for the MVM blocks in Figure 1. [sent-36, score-0.104]
</p><p>27 The normalization mechanism is subtractive rather than divisive, with normalization offset factor zj [n] obtained using a reverse-waterﬁlling criterion with respect to a probability margin γ [10], [fij (x[n]) − zj [n]]+ = γ. [sent-41, score-0.331]
</p><p>28 (3)  i  Besides improved robustness [8], the advantage of the subtractive normalization (3) is its amenability to current mode implementation as opposed to logistic normalization [11] which requires exponentiation of currents. [sent-42, score-0.244]
</p><p>29 The SVM outputs (margin variables) fij (x) are given by: N  fij (x) =  λs K(x, xs ) + bij ij  (4)  s  where K(·, ·) denotes a symmetric positive-deﬁnite kernel1 satisfying the Mercer condition, such as a Gaussian radial basis function or a polynomial spline [7], and xs [m], m = 1, . [sent-43, score-0.45]
</p><p>30 The parameters λs in (4) and the support vectors xs [m] ij are determined by training on a labeled training set using a recursive FDKM procedure described in [5]. [sent-46, score-0.15]
</p><p>31 3  Hardware Implementation  A second order polynomial kernel K(x, y) = (x. [sent-47, score-0.068]
</p><p>32 This inner-product based architecture directly maps onto an analog computational array, where storage and computation share common circuit elements. [sent-49, score-0.426]
</p><p>33 The map Φ(·) need not be computed explicitly, as it only appears in inner-product form. [sent-52, score-0.032]

</p><p>35 It consists of several SVM stages that generates state transition probabilities Pij [n] modulated by input data x[n], and a forward decoding block that performs maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the state sequence αi [n]. [sent-55, score-0.689]
</p><p>36 1  SVM Stage  The SVM stage implements (4) to generate unnormalized probabilities. [sent-57, score-0.098]
</p><p>37 It consists of a kernel stage computing kernels K(xs , x) between input vector x and stored support vectors xs , and a coefﬁcient stage linearly combining kernels using stored training parameters λs . [sent-58, score-0.455]
</p><p>38 ij Both kernel and coefﬁcient blocks incorporate an analog matrix-vector multiplier (MVM) with embedded storage of support vectors and coefﬁcients. [sent-59, score-0.337]
</p><p>39 A single multiply-accumulate cell, using ﬂoating-gate CMOS non-volative analog storage, is shown in Figure 2(a). [sent-60, score-0.181]
</p><p>40 The ﬂoating gate node voltages (Vg ) of transistors M2 are programmed using hot-electron injection and tunneling [12]. [sent-61, score-0.675]
</p><p>41 The input stage comprising transistors M1, M3 and M4 forms a key component in the design of the array and sets the voltage at node A as a function of input current. [sent-62, score-0.569]
</p><p>42 The input stage eliminates the effect of the bulk on the output current, making it a function of the reference ﬂoating gate voltage which can be easily programmed for the entire row. [sent-66, score-0.622]
</p><p>43 The weight is differential in the ﬂoating gate voltages Vg − Vgref , allowing to increase or decrease the weight by hot electron injection only, without the need for repeated high-voltage tunneling. [sent-68, score-0.468]
</p><p>44 For instance, the leakage current in unused rows can be reduced signiﬁcantly by programming the reference gate voltage to a high value, leading to power savings. [sent-69, score-0.444]
</p><p>45 The feedback transistor in the input stage M3 reduces the output impedance of node A given by ro ≈ gd1 /gm1 gm2 . [sent-70, score-0.22]
</p><p>46 This makes the array scalable as additional memory elements can be added to the node without pulling the voltage down. [sent-71, score-0.254]
</p><p>47 An added beneﬁt of keeping the voltage at node A ﬁxed is reduced variation in back gate parameter κ in the ﬂoating gate elements. [sent-72, score-0.544]
</p><p>48 The current from each memory element is summed on a low impedance node established by two diode connected transistors M7-M10. [sent-73, score-0.282]
</p><p>49 This partially compensates for large Early voltage effects implicit in ﬂoating gate transistors. [sent-74, score-0.348]

</p><p>52 (b) After pre-distortion compensation of input and output coefﬁcients. [sent-78, score-0.041]
</p><p>53 The array of elements M2 with peripheral circuits as shown in Figure 2(a) thus implement a simple single quadrant matrix-vector multiplication module. [sent-79, score-0.287]
</p><p>54 The single quadrant operation is adequate for unsigned inputs, and hence unsigned support vectors. [sent-80, score-0.235]
</p><p>55 A simple squaring circuit M7-M10 is used to implement the non-linear kernel as shown in ﬁgure 2(b). [sent-81, score-0.171]
</p><p>56 The requirement on the type of non-linearity is not stringent and can be easily incorporated into the kernel in SVM training procedure [5]. [sent-82, score-0.068]
</p><p>57 For the general probability model given by (2) a single quadrant multiplication is sufﬁcient to model any distribution. [sent-84, score-0.096]
</p><p>58 2  Forward Decoding Stage  The forward recursion decoding is implemented by a modiﬁed version of the sum-product probability propagation circuit in [13], performing margin-based probability propagation according to (1). [sent-87, score-0.601]
</p><p>59 In contrast to divisive normalization that relies on the translinear principle using sub-threshold MOS or bipolar circuits in [13], the implementation of margin-based subtractive normalization shown in ﬁgure 3 [10] is device operation independent. [sent-88, score-0.534]
</p><p>60 The circuit consists of several normalization cells Aij along columns computing Pij = [fij − z]+ using transistors M1-M4. [sent-89, score-0.368]
</p><p>61 Transistors M5-M9 form a feedback loop that compares and stabilizes the circuit to the normalization criterion (3). [sent-90, score-0.17]
</p><p>62 The currents through transistors M4 are auto-normalized to the previous state value αj [n − 1] to produce a new estimate of αi [n1] based on recursion (1). [sent-91, score-0.314]
</p><p>63 The delay in equation (1) is implemented using a logdomain ﬁlter and a ﬁxed normalization current ensures that all output currents be properly scaled to stabilize the continuous-time feedback loop. [sent-92, score-0.115]
</p><p>64 4  Experimental Results  A 14-input, 24-state, and 24×30-support vector FDKM was integrated on a 3mm×3mm FDKM chip, fabricated in a 0. [sent-93, score-0.147]
</p><p>65 Figure 5(c) shows the micrograph of the fabricated chip. [sent-95, score-0.126]
</p><p>66 Labeled training data pertaining to a certain task were used to train an SVM, and the training coefﬁcients thus obtained were programmed onto the chip. [sent-96, score-0.184]

</p><p>68 (c) Micrograph of the FDKM chip  Programming of the trained coefﬁcients was performed by programming respective cells M2 along with the corresponding input stage M1, so as to establish the desired ratio of currents. [sent-101, score-0.447]
</p><p>69 The values were established by continuing hot electron injection until the desired current was attained. [sent-102, score-0.227]
</p><p>70 During hot electron injection, the control gate Vc was adjusted to set the injection current to a constant level for stable injection. [sent-103, score-0.426]
</p><p>71 All cells in the kernel and coefﬁcient modules of the SVM stage are random accessible for read, write and calibrate operations. [sent-104, score-0.196]
</p><p>72 The calibration procedure compensates for mismatch between different input/output paths by adapting the ﬂoating gate elements in the MVM cells. [sent-105, score-0.335]
</p><p>73 This is illustrated in Figure 4 where the measured square kernel transfer function is shown before and after calibration. [sent-106, score-0.068]
</p><p>74 The chip is fully reconﬁgurable and can perform different recognition tasks by programming different training parameters, as demonstrated through three examples below. [sent-107, score-0.345]
</p><p>75 Depending on the number of active support vectors and the absolute level of currents (in relation to decoding bandwidth), power dissipation is in the lower nanowatt to microwatt range. [sent-108, score-0.579]

</p><p>77 The state probability shown is for consonant /t/ in words “torn,” “rat,” and “error. [sent-111, score-0.048]
</p><p>78 ” Two peaks are located as expected from the input sequence, shown on top. [sent-112, score-0.041]
</p><p>79 The output of state q7 in the Markov chain is shown in ﬁgure 5(b). [sent-114, score-0.048]
</p><p>80 It can be clearly observed that state q7 “ﬁres” only when a rising sequence of pulse trains arrives. [sent-115, score-0.162]
</p><p>81 The FDKM chip thereby demonstrates probability propagation similar to that in the architecture of [4]. [sent-116, score-0.351]
</p><p>82 The main difference is that the present architecture can be conﬁgured for detecting other, more complex sequences through programming and training. [sent-117, score-0.129]
</p><p>83 For the second set of experiments the FDKM chip was programmed to perform speaker veriﬁcation using speech data from YOHO corpus. [sent-118, score-0.484]
</p><p>84 For training we chose 480 utterances corresponding to 10 separate speakers (101-110). [sent-119, score-0.089]
</p><p>85 For each of these utterances 12 mel-cepstra coefﬁcients were computed for every 25ms frames. [sent-120, score-0.089]
</p><p>86 These coefﬁcients were clustered using k-means clustering to obtain 50 clusters per speaker which were then used for training the SVM. [sent-121, score-0.057]
</p><p>87 For testing 480 utterances for those speakers were chosen, and conﬁdence scores returned by the SVMs were integrated over all frames of an utterance to obtain a ﬁnal decision. [sent-122, score-0.152]
</p><p>88 Veriﬁcation results obtained from the chip demonstrate 97% true acceptance at 1% false positive rate, identical to the performance obtained through ﬂoating point software simulations as shown by the receiver operating characteristic shown in ﬁgure 6(a). [sent-123, score-0.275]
</p><p>89 The total power consumption for this task is only 840nW, demonstrating its suitability for autonomous sensor applications. [sent-124, score-0.152]
</p><p>90 A third set of experiment aimed at detecting phone utterances in human speech. [sent-125, score-0.177]
</p><p>91 Melcepstra coefﬁcients of six phone utterances (/t/,/n/,/r/,/ow/,/ah/,/eh/) selected from the TIMIT corpus were transformed using singular value decomposition and thresholding. [sent-126, score-0.146]
</p><p>92 Even though the recognition was demonstrated for the reduced set of features, the chip operates internally with analog inputs. [sent-127, score-0.488]
</p><p>93 Figure 6(b) illustrates correct detection of phonemes as identiﬁed by the presence of phone /t/ at the expected time instances in the input sequence. [sent-128, score-0.098]
</p><p>94 5  Discussion and Conclusion  We designed an FDKM based sequence recognition system on silicon and demonstrated its performance on simple but general tasks. [sent-129, score-0.2]
</p><p>95 The chip is fully reconﬁgurable and different sequence recognition engines can be programmed using parameters obtained through  SVM training. [sent-130, score-0.53]
</p><p>96 FDKM decoding is performed in real-time and is ideally suited for sequence recognition and veriﬁcation problems involving speech features. [sent-131, score-0.421]
</p><p>97 All analog processing in the chip is performed by transistors operating in weak-inversion resulting in power dissipation in the nanowatt to microwatt range. [sent-132, score-0.874]
</p><p>98 Non-volatile storage of training parameters further reduces standby power dissipation. [sent-133, score-0.115]
</p><p>99 We also note that while low power dissipation is a virtue in many applications, increased power can be traded for increased bandwidth. [sent-134, score-0.224]
</p><p>100 For instance, the presented circuits could be adapted using heterojunction bipolar junction transistors in a SiGe process for ultra-high speed MAP decoding applications in digital communication, using essentially the same FDKM architecture as presented here. [sent-135, score-0.63]

Vogelstein, Udayan Mallik, Eugenio Culurciello, Gert Cauwenberghs, Ralph Etienne-Cummings</p><p>Abstract: We have constructed a system that uses an array of 9,600 spiking silicon neurons, a fast microcontroller, and digital memory, to implement a reconﬁgurable network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons. The system is designed for rapid prototyping of spiking neural networks that require high-throughput communication with external address-event hardware. Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to speciﬁc internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective ﬁeld mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by conﬁguring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience. 1</p><p>4 0.097018532 <a title="176-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-The_Cerebellum_Chip%3A_an_Analog_VLSI_Implementation_of_a_Cerebellar_Model_of_Classical_Conditioning.html">184 nips-2004-The Cerebellum Chip: an Analog VLSI Implementation of a Cerebellar Model of Classical Conditioning</a></p>

Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>6 0.090537541 <a title="176-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Edge_of_Chaos_Computation_in_Mixed-Mode_VLSI_-_A_Hard_Liquid.html">58 nips-2004-Edge of Chaos Computation in Mixed-Mode VLSI - A Hard Liquid</a></p>

<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

The system is designed for rapid prototyping of spiking neural networks that require high-throughput communication with external address-event hardware. Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to speciﬁc internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective ﬁeld mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by conﬁguring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience. 1</p><p>5 0.48661754 <a title="176-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Methods_for_Estimating_the_Computational_Power_and_Generalization_Capability_of_Neural_Microcircuits.html">118 nips-2004-Methods for Estimating the Computational Power and Generalization Capability of Neural Microcircuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>6 0.41638622 <a title="176-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Edge_of_Chaos_Computation_in_Mixed-Mode_VLSI_-_A_Hard_Liquid.html">58 nips-2004-Edge of Chaos Computation in Mixed-Mode VLSI - A Hard Liquid</a></p>

<p>Author: Giorgio Gia\-cin\-to, Fabio Roli</p><p>Abstract: High retrieval precision in content-based image retrieval can be attained by adopting relevance feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms require that the user judges the quality of the results of the query by marking all the retrieved images as being either relevant or not. Then, the search engine exploits this information to adapt the search to better meet user’s needs. At present, the vast majority of proposed relevance feedback mechanisms are formulated in terms of search model that has to be optimized. Such an optimization involves the modification of some search parameters so that the nearest neighbor of the query vector contains the largest number of relevant images. In this paper, a different approach to relevance feedback is proposed. After the user provides the first feedback, following retrievals are not based on knn search, but on the computation of a relevance score for each image of the database. This score is computed as a function of two distances, namely the distance from the nearest non-relevant image and the distance from the nearest relevant one. Images are then ranked according to this score and the top k images are displayed. Reported results on three image data sets show that the proposed mechanism outperforms other state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms. 1 In t rod u ct i on A large number of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems rely on the vector representation of images in a multidimensional feature space representing low-level image characteristics, e.g., color, texture, shape, etc. [1]. Content-based queries are often expressed by visual examples in order to retrieve from the database the images that are “similar” to the examples. This kind of retrieval is often referred to as K nearest-neighbor retrieval. It is easy to see that the effectiveness of content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) strongly depends on the choice of the set of visual features, on the choice of the “metric” used to model the user’s perception of image similarity, and on the choice of the image used to query the database [1]. Typically, if we allow different users to mark the images retrieved with a given query as relevant or non-relevant, different subsets of images will be marked as relevant. Accordingly, the need for mechanisms to adapt the CBIR system response based on some feedback from the user is widely recognized. It is interesting to note that while relevance feedback mechanisms have been first introduced in the information retrieval field [2], they are receiving more attention in the CBIR field (Huang). The vast majority of relevance feedback techniques proposed in the literature is based on modifying the values of the search parameters as to better represent the concept the user bears in mind. To this end, search parameters are computed as a function of the relevance values assigned by the user to all the images retrieved so far. As an example, relevance feedback is often formulated in terms of the modification of the query vector, and/or in terms of adaptive similarity metrics. [3]-[7]. Recently, pattern classification paradigms such as SVMs have been proposed [8]. Feedback is thus used to model the concept of relevant images and adjust the search consequently. Concept modeling may be difficult on account of the distribution of relevant images in the selected feature space. “Narrow domain” image databases allows extracting good features, so that images bearing similar concepts belong to compact clusters. On the other hand, “broad domain” databases, such as image collection used by graphic professionals, or those made up of images from the Internet, are more difficult to subdivide in cluster because of the high variability of concepts [1]. In these cases, it is worth extracting only low level, non-specialized features, and image retrieval is better formulated in terms of a search problem rather then concept modeling. The present paper aims at offering an original contribution in this direction. Rather then modeling the concept of “relevance” the user bears in mind, feedback is used to assign each image of the database a relevance score. Such a score depends only from two dissimilarities (distances) computed against the images already marked by the user: the dissimilarity from the set of relevant images, and the dissimilarity from the set of non-relevant images. Despite its computational simplicity, this mechanism allows outperforming state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms both on “narrow domain” databases, and on “broad domain” databases. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the idea behind the proposed mechanism and provides the basic assumptions. Section 3 details the proposed relevance feedback mechanism. Results on three image data sets are presented in Section 4, where performances of other relevance feedback mechanisms are compared. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 In st an ce- b ased rel evan ce est i m at i on The proposed mechanism has been inspired by classification techniques based on the “nearest case” [9]-[10]. Nearest-case theory provided the mechanism to compute the dissimilarity of each image from the sets of relevant and non–relevant images. The ratio between the nearest relevant image and the nearest non-relevant image has been used to compute the degree of relevance of each image of the database [11]. The present section illustrates the rationale behind the use of the nearest-case paradigm. Let us assume that each image of the database has been represented by a number of low-level features, and that a (dis)similarity measure has been defined so that the proximity between pairs of images represents some kind of “conceptual” similarity. In other words, the chosen feature space and similarity metric is meaningful at least for a restricted number of users. A search in image databases is usually performed by retrieving the k most similar images with respect to a given query. The dimension of k is usually small, to avoid displaying a large number of images at a time. Typical values for k are between 10 and 20. However, as the “relevant” images that the user wishes to retrieve may not fit perfectly with the similarity metric designed for the search engine, the user may be interested in exploring other regions of the feature space. To this end, the user marks the subset of “relevant” images out of the k retrieved. Usually, such relevance feedback is used to perform a new k-nn search by modifying some search parameters, i.e., the position of the query point, the similarity metric, and other tuning parameters [1]-[7]. Recent works proposed the use of support vector machine to learn the distribution of relevant images [8]. These techniques require some assumption about the general form of the distribution of relevant images in the feature space. As it is difficult to make any assumption about such a distribution for broad domain databases, we propose to exploit the information about the relevance of the images retrieved so far in a nearest-neighbor fashion. Nearest-neighbor techniques, as used in statistical pattern recognition, case-based reasoning, or instance-based learning, are effective in all applications where it is difficult to produce a high-level generalization of a “class” of objects [9]-[10],[12][13]. Relevance learning in content base image retrieval may well fit into this definition, as it is difficult to provide a general model that can be adapted to represent different concepts of similarity. In addition, the number of available cases may be too small to estimate the optimal set of parameters for such a general model. On the other hand, it can be more effective to use each “relevant” image as well as each “non-relevant” image, as “cases” or “instances” against which the images of the database should be compared. Consequently, we assume that an image is as much as relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest relevant image is small. Analogously, an image is as much as non-relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest non-relevant image is small. 3 Rel evan ce S core Com p u t ati on According to previous section, each image of the database can be thus characterized by a “degree of relevance” and a “degree of non-relevance” according to the dissimilarities from the nearest relevant image, and from the nearest non-relevant image, respectively. However, it should be noted that these degrees should be treated differently because only “relevant” images represent a “concept” in the user’s mind, while “non-relevant” images may represent a number of other concepts different from user’s interest. In other words, while it is meaningful to treat the degree of relevance as a degree of membership to the class of relevant images, the same does not apply to the degree of non-relevance. For this reason, we propose to use the “degree of non-relevance” to weight the “degree of relevance”. Let us denote with R the subset of indexes j ∈ {1,...,k} related to the set of relevant images retrieved so far and the original query (that is relevant by default), and with NR the subset of indexes j ∈ (1,...,k} related to the set of non-relevant images retrieved so far. For each image I of the database, according to the nearest neighbor rule, let us compute the dissimilarity from the nearest image in R and the dissimilarity from the nearest image in NR. Let us denote these dissimilarities as dR(I) and dNR(I), respectively. The value of dR(I) can be clearly used to measure the degree of relevance of image I, assuming that small values of dR(I) are related to very relevant images. On the other hand, the hypothesis that image I is relevant to the user’s query can be supported by a high value of dNR(I). Accordingly, we defined the relevance score ! dR ( I ) $ relevance ( I ) = # 1 + dN ( I ) &</p><p>2 0.96633607 <a title="176-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution (BRAND) is proposed for estimating time delays of acoustic signals in reverberant environments. Sparsity of the nonnegative ﬁlter coefﬁcients is enforced using an L1 -norm regularization. A probabilistic generative model is used to simultaneously estimate the regularization parameters and ﬁlter coefﬁcients from the signal data. Iterative update rules are derived under a Bayesian framework using the Expectation-Maximization procedure. The resulting time delay estimation algorithm is demonstrated on noisy acoustic data.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.96090716 <a title="176-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt_Analog_VLSI_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Pattern_Classification_and_Sequence_Estimation.html">176 nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt Analog VLSI Support Vector Machine for Pattern Classification and Sequence Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shantanu Chakrabartty, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: An analog system-on-chip for kernel-based pattern classiﬁcation and sequence estimation is presented. State transition probabilities conditioned on input data are generated by an integrated support vector machine. Dot product based kernels and support vector coefﬁcients are implemented in analog programmable ﬂoating gate translinear circuits, and probabilities are propagated and normalized using sub-threshold current-mode circuits. A 14-input, 24-state, and 720-support vector forward decoding kernel machine is integrated on a 3mm×3mm chip in 0.5µm CMOS technology. Experiments with the processor trained for speaker veriﬁcation and phoneme sequence estimation demonstrate real-time recognition accuracy at par with ﬂoating-point software, at sub-microwatt power. 1</p><p>4 0.93067235 <a title="176-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Online_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2004-Online Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a competitive analysis of Bayesian learning algorithms in the online learning setting and show that many simple Bayesian algorithms (such as Gaussian linear regression and Bayesian logistic regression) perform favorably when compared, in retrospect, to the single best model in the model class. The analysis does not assume that the Bayesian algorithms’ modeling assumptions are “correct,” and our bounds hold even if the data is adversarially chosen. For Gaussian linear regression (using logloss), our error bounds are comparable to the best bounds in the online learning literature, and we also provide a lower bound showing that Gaussian linear regression is optimal in a certain worst case sense. We also give bounds for some widely used maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation algorithms, including regularized logistic regression. 1</p><p>5 0.92316937 <a title="176-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Dimension.html">114 nips-2004-Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension</a></p>
<p>Author: Elizaveta Levina, Peter J. Bickel</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating intrinsic dimension of a dataset derived by applying the principle of maximum likelihood to the distances between close neighbors. We derive the estimator by a Poisson process approximation, assess its bias and variance theoretically and by simulations, and apply it to a number of simulated and real datasets. We also show it has the best overall performance compared with two other intrinsic dimension estimators. 1</p><p>6 0.87934506 <a title="176-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Class-size_Independent_Generalization_Analsysis_of_Some_Discriminative_Multi-Category_Classification.html">36 nips-2004-Class-size Independent Generalization Analsysis of Some Discriminative Multi-Category Classification</a></p>

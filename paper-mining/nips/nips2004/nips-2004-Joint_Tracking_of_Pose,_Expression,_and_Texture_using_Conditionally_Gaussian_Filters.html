Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Nils Bertschinger, Thomas Natschläger, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relationship between the computational capabilities of randomly connected networks of threshold gates in the timeseries domain and their dynamical properties. In particular we propose a complexity measure which we ﬁnd to assume its highest values near the edge of chaos, i.e. the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics. Furthermore we show that the proposed complexity measure predicts the computational capabilities very well: only near the edge of chaos are such networks able to perform complex computations on time series. Additionally a simple synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality is presented and analyzed. 1</p><p>3 0.20403321 <a title="91-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Selective_Sampling_for_Linear-Threshold_Algorithms.html">206 nips-2004-Worst-Case Analysis of Selective Sampling for Linear-Threshold Algorithms</a></p>

The algorithms considered in this paper are Perceptron-like algorithms, i.e., algorithms which can be efﬁciently run in any reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our algorithms exploit a simple margin-based randomized rule to decide whether to query the current label. We obtain selective sampling algorithms achieving on average the same bounds as those proven for their deterministic counterparts, but using much fewer labels. We complement our theoretical ﬁndings with an empirical comparison on two text categorization tasks. The outcome of these experiments is largely predicted by our theoretical results: Our selective sampling algorithms tend to perform as good as the algorithms receiving the true label after each classiﬁcation, while observing in practice substantially fewer labels. 1</p><p>4 0.1667143 <a title="91-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Nearly_Tight_Bounds_for_the_Continuum-Armed_Bandit_Problem.html">126 nips-2004-Nearly Tight Bounds for the Continuum-Armed Bandit Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert D. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: In the multi-armed bandit problem, an online algorithm must choose from a set of strategies in a sequence of n trials so as to minimize the total cost of the chosen strategies. While nearly tight upper and lower bounds are known in the case when the strategy set is ﬁnite, much less is known when there is an inﬁnite strategy set. Here we consider the case when the set of strategies is a subset of Rd , and the cost functions are continuous. In the d = 1 case, we improve on the best-known upper and lower bounds, closing the gap to a sublogarithmic factor. We also consider the case where d > 1 and the cost functions are convex, adapting a recent online convex optimization algorithm of Zinkevich to the sparser feedback model of the multi-armed bandit problem. 1</p><p>5 0.16615218 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation_Tradeoffs_for_Experts_Algorithms_in_Reactive_Environments.html">65 nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoffs for Experts Algorithms in Reactive Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Nimrod Megiddo</p><p>Abstract: A reactive environment is one that responds to the actions of an agent rather than evolving obliviously. In reactive environments, experts algorithms must balance exploration and exploitation of experts more carefully than in oblivious ones. In addition, a more subtle deﬁnition of a learnable value of an expert is required. A general exploration-exploitation experts method is presented along with a proper deﬁnition of value. The method is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best available expert. Several variants are analyzed from the viewpoint of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, including explore-then-exploit, polynomially vanishing exploration, constant-frequency exploration, and constant-size exploration phases. Complexity and performance bounds are proven. 1</p><p>6 0.12487484 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Message_Errors_in_Belief_Propagation.html">116 nips-2004-Message Errors in Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Nils Bertschinger, Thomas Natschläger, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relationship between the computational capabilities of randomly connected networks of threshold gates in the timeseries domain and their dynamical properties. In particular we propose a complexity measure which we ﬁnd to assume its highest values near the edge of chaos, i.e. the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics. Furthermore we show that the proposed complexity measure predicts the computational capabilities very well: only near the edge of chaos are such networks able to perform complex computations on time series. Additionally a simple synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality is presented and analyzed. 1</p><p>3 0.53872001 <a title="91-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation_Tradeoffs_for_Experts_Algorithms_in_Reactive_Environments.html">65 nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoffs for Experts Algorithms in Reactive Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Nimrod Megiddo</p><p>Abstract: A reactive environment is one that responds to the actions of an agent rather than evolving obliviously. In reactive environments, experts algorithms must balance exploration and exploitation of experts more carefully than in oblivious ones. In addition, a more subtle deﬁnition of a learnable value of an expert is required. A general exploration-exploitation experts method is presented along with a proper deﬁnition of value. The method is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best available expert. Several variants are analyzed from the viewpoint of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, including explore-then-exploit, polynomially vanishing exploration, constant-frequency exploration, and constant-size exploration phases. Complexity and performance bounds are proven. 1</p><p>4 0.45966026 <a title="91-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Nearly_Tight_Bounds_for_the_Continuum-Armed_Bandit_Problem.html">126 nips-2004-Nearly Tight Bounds for the Continuum-Armed Bandit Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert D. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: In the multi-armed bandit problem, an online algorithm must choose from a set of strategies in a sequence of n trials so as to minimize the total cost of the chosen strategies. While nearly tight upper and lower bounds are known in the case when the strategy set is ﬁnite, much less is known when there is an inﬁnite strategy set. Here we consider the case when the set of strategies is a subset of Rd , and the cost functions are continuous. In the d = 1 case, we improve on the best-known upper and lower bounds, closing the gap to a sublogarithmic factor. We also consider the case where d > 1 and the cost functions are convex, adapting a recent online convex optimization algorithm of Zinkevich to the sparser feedback model of the multi-armed bandit problem. 1</p><p>5 0.34642571 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Sham M. Kakade, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider an MDP setting in which the reward function is allowed to change during each time step of play (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain ﬁxed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well can an agent do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efﬁcient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard. 1</p><p>6 0.34634593 <a title="91-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Selective_Sampling_for_Linear-Threshold_Algorithms.html">206 nips-2004-Worst-Case Analysis of Selective Sampling for Linear-Threshold Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Tanzeem Choudhury, Sumit Basu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we quantitatively investigate the ways in which a given person influences the joint turn-taking behavior in a conversation. After collecting an auditory database of social interactions among a group of twenty-three people via wearable sensors (66 hours of data each over two weeks), we apply speech and conversation detection methods to the auditory streams. These methods automatically locate the conversations, determine their participants, and mark which participant was speaking when. We then model the joint turn-taking behavior as a Mixed-Memory Markov Model [1] that combines the statistics of the individual subjects' self-transitions and the partners ' cross-transitions. The mixture parameters in this model describe how much each person 's individual behavior contributes to the joint turn-taking behavior of the pair. By estimating these parameters, we thus estimate how much influence each participant has in determining the joint turntaking behavior. We show how this measure correlates significantly with betweenness centrality [2], an independent measure of an individual's importance in a social network. This result suggests that our estimate of conversational influence is predictive of social influence. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70862603 <a title="91-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Tracking_of_Pose%2C_Expression%2C_and_Texture_using_Conditionally_Gaussian_Filters.html">91 nips-2004-Joint Tracking of Pose, Expression, and Texture using Conditionally Gaussian Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Sophie Deneve</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of spiking neurons as Bayesian integrators accumulating evidence over time about events in the external world or the body, and communicating to other neurons their certainties about these events. In this model, spikes signal the occurrence of new information, i.e. what cannot be predicted from the past activity. As a result, ﬁring statistics are close to Poisson, albeit providing a deterministic representation of probabilities. We proceed to develop a theory of Bayesian inference in spiking neural networks, recurrent interactions implementing a variant of belief propagation. Many perceptual and motor tasks performed by the central nervous system are probabilistic, and can be described in a Bayesian framework [4, 3]. A few important but hidden properties, such as direction of motion, or appropriate motor commands, are inferred from many noisy, local and ambiguous sensory cues. These evidences are combined with priors about the sensory world and body. Importantly, because most of these inferences should lead to quick and irreversible decisions in a perpetually changing world, noisy cues have to be integrated on-line, but in a way that takes into account unpredictable events, such as a sudden change in motion direction or the appearance of a new stimulus. This raises the question of how this temporal integration can be performed at the neural level. It has been proposed that single neurons in sensory cortices represent and compute the log probability that a sensory variable takes on a certain value (eg Is visual motion in the neuron’s preferred direction?) [9, 7]. Alternatively, to avoid normalization issues and provide an appropriate signal for decision making, neurons could represent the log probability ratio of a particular hypothesis (eg is motion more likely to be towards the right than towards the left) [7, 6]. Log probabilities are convenient here, since under some assumptions, independent noisy cues simply combine linearly. Moreover, there are physiological evidence for the neural representation of log probabilities and log probability ratios [9, 6, 7]. However, these models assume that neurons represent probabilities in their ﬁring rates. We argue that it is important to study how probabilistic information are encoded in spikes. Indeed, it seems spurious to marry the idea of an exquisite on-line integration of noisy cues with an underlying rate code that requires averaging on large populations of noisy neurons and long periods of time. In particular, most natural tasks require this integration to take place on the time scale of inter-spike intervals. Spikes are more efﬁciently signaling events ∗ Institute of Cognitive Science, 69645 Bron, France than analog quantities. In addition, a neural theory of inference with spikes will bring us closer to the physiological level and generate more easily testable predictions. Thus, we propose a new theory of neural processing in which spike trains provide a deterministic, online representation of a log-probability ratio. Spikes signals events, eg that the log-probability ratio has exceeded what could be predicted from previous spikes. This form of coding was loosely inspired by the idea of ”energy landscape” coding proposed by Hinton and Brown [2]. However, contrary to [2] and other theories using rate-based representation of probabilities, this model is self-consistent and does not require different models for encoding and decoding: As output spikes provide new, unpredictable, temporally independent evidence, they can be used directly as an input to other Bayesian neurons. Finally, we show that these neurons can be used as building blocks in a theory of approximate Bayesian inference in recurrent spiking networks. Connections between neurons implement an underlying Bayesian network, consisting of coupled hidden Markov models. Propagation of spikes is a form of belief propagation in this underlying graphical model. Our theory provides computational explanations of some general physiological properties of cortical neurons, such as spike frequency adaptation, Poisson statistics of spike trains, the existence of strong local inhibition in cortical columns, and the maintenance of a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the debate about temporal versus rate-based neural coding. 1 Spikes and log posterior odds 1.1 Synaptic integration seen as inference in a hidden Markov chain We propose that each neuron codes for an underlying ”hidden” binary variable, xt , whose state evolves over time. We assume that xt depends only on the state at the previous time step, xt−dt , and is conditionally independent of other past states. The state xt can switch 1 from 0 to 1 with a constant rate ron = dt limdt→0 P (xt = 1|xt−dt = 0), and from 1 to 0 with a constant rate roﬀ . For example, these transition rates could represent how often motion in a preferred direction appears the receptive ﬁeld and how long it is likely to stay there. The neuron infers the state of its hidden variable from N noisy synaptic inputs, considered to be observations of the hidden state. In this initial version of the model, we assume that these inputs are conditionally independent homogeneous Poisson processes, synapse i i emitting a spike between time t and t + dt (si = 1) with constant probability qon dt if t i xt = 1, and another constant probability qoﬀ dt if xt = 0. The synaptic spikes are assumed to be otherwise independent of previous synaptic spikes, previous states and spikes at other synapses. The resulting generative model is a hidden Markov chain (ﬁgure 1-A). However, rather than estimating the state of its hidden variable and communicating this estimate to other neurons (for example by emitting a spike when sensory evidence for xt = 1 goes above a threshold) the neuron reports and communicates its certainty that the current state is 1. This certainty takes the form of the log of the ratio of the probability that the hidden state is 1, and the probability that the state is 0, given all the synaptic inputs P (xt =1|s0→t ) received so far: Lt = log P (xt =0|s0→t ) . We use s0→t as a short hand notation for the N synaptic inputs received at present and in the past. We will refer to it as the log odds ratio. Thanks to the conditional independencies assumed in the generative model, we can compute this Log odds ratio iteratively. Taking the limit as dt goes to zero, we get the following differential equation: ˙ L = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + i wi δ(si − 1) − θ t B.

Each synaptic spike (si = 1) gives an impulse to the log t off odds ratio, which is positive if this synapse is more active when the hidden state if 1 (i.e it increases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1), and negative if this synapse is more active when xt = 0 (i.e it decreases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1). The bias, θ, is determined by how informative it is not to receive any spike, e.g. θ = i i i qon − qoﬀ . By convention, we will consider that the ”bias” is positive or zero (if not, we need simply to invert the status of the state x). 1.2 Generation of output spikes The spike train should convey a sparse representation of Lt , so that each spike reports new information about the state xt that is not redundant with that reported by other, preceding, spikes. This proposition is based on three arguments: First, spikes, being metabolically expensive, should be kept to a minimum. Second, spikes conveying redundant information would require a decoding of the entire spike train, whereas independent spike can be taken into account individually. And ﬁnally, we seek a self consistent model, with the spiking output having a similar semantics to its spiking input. To maximize the independence of the spikes (conditioned on xt ), we propose that the neuron ﬁres only when the difference between its log odds ratio Lt and a prediction Gt of this log odds ratio based on the output spikes emitted so far reaches a certain threshold. Indeed, supposing that downstream elements predicts Lt as best as they can, the neuron only needs to ﬁre when it expects that prediction to be too inaccurate (ﬁgure 1-B). In practice, this will happen when the neuron receives new evidence for xt = 1. Gt should thereby follow the same dynamics as Lt when spikes are not received. The equation for Gt and the output Ot (Ot = 1 when an output spike is ﬁred) are given by: ˙ G = Ot = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + go δ(Ot − 1) go 1. when Lt > Gt + , 0 otherwise, 2 (1) (2) Here go , a positive constant, is the only free parameter, the other parameters being constrained by the statistics of the synaptic input. 1.3 Results Figure 1-C plots a typical trial, showing the behavior of L, G and O before, during and after presentation of the stimulus. As random synaptic inputs are integrated, L ﬂuctuates and eventually exceeds G + 0.5, leading to an output spike. Immediately after a spike, G jumps to G + go , which prevents (except in very rare cases) a second spike from immediately following the ﬁrst. Thus, this ”jump” implements a relative refractory period. However, ron G decays as it tends to converge back to its stable level gstable = log roff . Thus L eventually exceeds G again, leading to a new spike. This threshold crossing happens more often during stimulation (xt = 1) as the net synaptic input alters to create a higher overall level of certainty, Lt . Mean Log odds ratio and output ﬁring rate ¯ The mean ﬁring rate Ot of the Bayesian neuron during presentation of its preferred stimulus (i.e. when xt switches from 0 to 1 and back to 0) is plotted in ﬁgure 1-D, together with the ¯ mean log posterior ratio Lt , both averaged over trials. Not surprisingly, the log-posterior ratio reﬂects the leaky integration of synaptic evidence, with an effective time constant that depends on the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ . If the state is very stable (ron = roﬀ ∼ 0), synaptic evidence is integrated over almost inﬁnite time periods, the mean log posterior ratio tending to either increase or decrease linearly with time. In the example in ﬁgure 1D, the state is less stable, so ”old” synaptic evidence are discounted and Lt saturates. ¯ In contrast, the mean output ﬁring rate Ot tracks the state of xt almost perfectly. This is because, as a form of predictive coding, the output spikes reﬂect the new synaptic i evidence, It = i δ(st − 1) − θ, rather than the log posterior ratio itself. In particular, the mean output ﬁring rate is a rectiﬁed linear function of the mean input, e. g. + ¯ ¯ wi q i −θ . O= 1I= go i on(oﬀ) Analogy with a leaky integrate and ﬁre neuron We can get an interesting insight into the computation performed by this neuron by linearizing L and G around their mean levels over trials. Here we reduce the analysis to prolonged, statistically stable periods when the state is constant (either ON or OFF). In this case, the ¯ ¯ mean level of certainty L and its output prediction G are also constant over time. We make the rough approximation that the post spike jump, go , and the input ﬂuctuations are small ¯ compared to the mean level of certainty L.

The membrane potential Vt integrates its input, Jt = It − ∆go , with a leak kL . The neuron ﬁres when its membrane potential reaches a constant threshold go . After ¯ each spikes, Vt is reset to 0. Interestingly, for appropriately chosen compression factor go , the mean input to the lin¯ ¯ earized neuron J = I − ∆go ≈ 0 1 . This means that the membrane potential is purely driven to its threshold by input ﬂuctuations, or a random walk in membrane potential. As a consequence, the neuron’s ﬁring will be memoryless, and close to a Poisson process. In particular, we found Fano factor close to 1 and quasi-exponential ISI distribution (ﬁgure 1E) on the entire range of parameters tested. Indeed, LIF neurons with balanced inputs have been proposed as a model to reproduce the statistics of real cortical neurons [8]. This balance is implemented in our model by the neuron’s effective self-inhibition, even when the synaptic input itself is not balanced. Decoding As we previously said, downstream elements could predict the log odds ratio Lt by computing Gt from the output spikes (Eq 1, ﬁg 1-B). Of course, this requires an estimate of the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ , that could be learned from the observed spike trains. However, we show next that explicit decoding is not necessary to perform bayesian inference in spiking networks. Intuitively, this is because the quantity that our model neurons receive and transmit, eg new information, is exactly what probabilistic inference algorithm propagate between connected statistical elements. 1 ¯ Even if go is not chosen optimally, the inﬂuence of the drift J is usually negligible compared to the large ﬂuctuations in membrane potential. 2 Bayesian inference in cortical networks The model neurons, having the same input and output semantics, can be used as building blocks to implement more complex generative models consisting of coupled Markov chains. Consider, for example, the example in ﬁgure 2-A. Here, a ”parent” variable x1 t (the presence of a tiger) can cause the state of n other ”children” variables ([xk ]k=2...n ), t of whom two are represented (the presence of stripes,x2 , and motion, x3 ). The ”chilt t dren” variables are Bayesian neurons identical to those described previously. The resulting bayesian network consist of n + 1 coupled hidden Markov chains. Inference in this architecture corresponds to computing the log posterior odds ratio for the tiger, x1 , and the log t posterior of observing stripes or motion, ([xk ]k=2...n ), given the synaptic inputs received t by the entire network so far, i.e. s2 , . . . , sk . 0→t 0→t Unfortunately, inference and learning in this network (and in general in coupled Markov chains) requires very expensive computations, and cannot be performed by simply propagating messages over time and among the variable nodes. In particular, the state of a child k variable xt depends on xk , sk , x1 and the state of all other children at the previous t t t−dt time step, [xj ]2</p><p>4 0.56699419 <a title="91-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Assignment_of_Multiplicative_Mixtures_in_Natural_Images.html">25 nips-2004-Assignment of Multiplicative Mixtures in Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: In the analysis of natural images, Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM) have been used to account for the statistics of ﬁlter responses, and to inspire hierarchical cortical representational learning schemes. GSMs pose a critical assignment problem, working out which ﬁlter responses were generated by a common multiplicative factor. We present a new approach to solving this assignment problem through a probabilistic extension to the basic GSM, and show how to perform inference in the model using Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the approach on both synthetic and image data. Understanding the statistical structure of natural images is an important goal for visual neuroscience. Neural representations in early cortical areas decompose images (and likely other sensory inputs) in a way that is sensitive to sophisticated aspects of their probabilistic structure. This structure also plays a key role in methods for image processing and coding. A striking aspect of natural images that has reﬂections in both top-down and bottom-up modeling is coordination across nearby locations, scales, and orientations. From a topdown perspective, this structure has been modeled using what is known as a Gaussian Scale Mixture model (GSM).1–3 GSMs involve a multi-dimensional Gaussian (each dimension of which captures local structure as in a linear ﬁlter), multiplied by a spatialized collection of common hidden scale variables or mixer variables∗ (which capture the coordination). GSMs have wide implications in theories of cortical receptive ﬁeld development, eg the comprehensive bubbles framework of Hyv¨ rinen.4 The mixer variables provide the a top-down account of two bottom-up characteristics of natural image statistics, namely the ‘bowtie’ statistical dependency,5, 6 and the fact that the marginal distributions of receptive ﬁeld-like ﬁlters have high kurtosis.7, 8 In hindsight, these ideas also bear a close relationship with Ruderman and Bialek’s multiplicative bottom-up image analysis framework 9 and statistical models for divisive gain control.6 Coordinated structure has also been addressed in other image work,10–14 and in other domains such as speech15 and ﬁnance.16 Many approaches to the unsupervised speciﬁcation of representations in early cortical areas rely on the coordinated structure.17–21 The idea is to learn linear ﬁlters (eg modeling simple cells as in22, 23 ), and then, based on the coordination, to ﬁnd combinations of these (perhaps non-linearly transformed) as a way of ﬁnding higher order ﬁlters (eg complex cells). One critical facet whose speciﬁcation from data is not obvious is the neighborhood arrangement, ie which linear ﬁlters share which mixer variables. ∗ Mixer variables are also called mutlipliers, but are unrelated to the scales of a wavelet. Here, we suggest a method for ﬁnding the neighborhood based on Bayesian inference of the GSM random variables. In section 1, we consider estimating these components based on information from different-sized neighborhoods and show the modes of failure when inference is too local or too global. Based on these observations, in section 2 we propose an extension to the GSM generative model, in which the mixer variables can overlap probabilistically. We solve the neighborhood assignment problem using Gibbs sampling, and demonstrate the technique on synthetic data. In section 3, we apply the technique to image data. 1 GSM inference of Gaussian and mixer variables In a simple, n-dimensional, version of a GSM, ﬁlter responses l are synthesized † by multiplying an n-dimensional Gaussian with values g = {g1 . . . gn }, by a common mixer variable v. l = vg (1) We assume g are uncorrelated (σ 2 along diagonal of the covariance matrix). For the analytical calculations, we assume that v has a Rayleigh distribution: where 0 < a ≤ 1 parameterizes the strength of the prior p[v] ∝ [v exp −v 2 /2]a (2) For ease, we develop the theory for a = 1. As is well known,2 and repeated in ﬁgure 1(B), the marginal distribution of the resulting GSM is sparse and highly kurtotic. The joint conditional distribution of two elements l1 and l2 , follows a bowtie shape, with the width of the distribution of one dimension increasing for larger values (both positive and negative) of the other dimension. The inverse problem is to estimate the n+1 variables g1 . . . gn , v from the n ﬁlter responses l1 . . . ln . It is formally ill-posed, though regularized through the prior distributions. Four posterior distributions are particularly relevant, and can be derived analytically from the model: rv distribution posterior mean ” “ √ σ |l1 | 2 2 l1 |l1 | B“ 1, σ ” |l1 | ” exp − v − “ p[v|l1 ] 2 2v 2 σ 2 σ 1 |l1 | 1 |l1 | B p[v|l] p[|g1 ||l1 ] p[|g1 ||l] √ B 2, σ 1 (n−2) 2 2 2 ( ) −(n−1) exp − v2 − 2vl2 σ2 l v B(1− n , σ ) 2 √ σ|l1 | g2 l2 “ ” 1 exp − 12 − 12 2σ 1 |l1 | g2 2g l σ B −2, σ|l1 | ”1 |l1 | 2 (2−n) l n l 2 −1, σ “ B( ) σ (n−3) g1 1 l σ σ 1 g2 2 1 exp − 2σ2 l2 − l 1 2 l1 2 2g1 σ |l1 | σ ( ( 2, σ ) ) l B 3−n,σ 2 2 l B 1− n , σ “ 2 ” |l1 | B 0, σ |l1 | “ ” σ B − 1 , |l1 | 2 σ n 1 l |l1 | B( 2 − 2 , σ ) n l B( −1, l ) 2 σ 2 where B(n, x) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind (see also24 ), l = i li and gi is forced to have the same sign as li , since the mixer variables are always positive. Note that p[v|l1 ] and p[g1 |l1 ] (rows 1,3) are local estimates, while p[v|l] and p[g|l] (rows 2,4) are estimates according to ﬁlter outputs {l1 . . . ln }. The posterior p[v|l] has also been estimated numerically in noise removal for other mixer priors, by Portilla et al 25 The full GSM speciﬁes a hierarchy of mixer variables. Wainwright2 considered a prespeciﬁed tree-based hierarhical arrangement. In practice, for natural sensory data, given a heterogeneous collection of li , it is advantageous to learn the hierachical arrangement from examples. In an approach related to that of the GSM, Karklin and Lewicki19 suggested We describe the l as being ﬁlter responses even in the synthetic case, to facilitate comparison with images. † B A α 1 ... g v 20 1 ... β 0.1 l 0 -5 0 l 2 0 21 0 0 5 l 1 0 l 1 1 l ... l 21 40 20 Actual Distribution 0 D Gaussian 0 5 0 0 -5 0 0 5 0 5 -5 0 g 1 0 5 E(g 1 | l1) 1 .. 40 ) 0.06 -5 0 0 5 2 E(g |l 1 1 .. 20 ) 0 1 E(g | l ) -5 5 E(g | l 1 2 1 .. 20 5 α E(g |l 1 .. 20 ) E(g |l 0 E(v | l α 0.06 E(g | l2) 2 2 0 5 E(v | l 1 .. 20 ) E(g | l1) 1 1 g 0 1 0.06 0 0.06 E(vαl | ) g 40 filters, too global 0.06 0.06 0.06 Distribution 20 filters 1 filter, too local 0.06 vα E Gaussian joint conditional 40 l l C Mixer g ... 21 Multiply Multiply l g Distribution g v 1 .. 40 1 .. 40 ) ) E(g | l 1 1 .. 40 ) Figure 1: A Generative model: each ﬁlter response is generated by multiplying its Gaussian variable by either mixer variable vα , or mixer variable vβ .

Here, we consider the problem in terms of multiple mixer variables, with the linear ﬁlters being clustered into groups that share a single mixer. This poses a critical assignment problem of working out which ﬁlter responses share which mixer variables. We ﬁrst study this issue using synthetic data in which two groups of ﬁlter responses l1 . . . l20 and l21 . . . l40 are generated by two mixer variables vα and vβ (ﬁgure 1). We attempt to infer the components of the GSM model from the synthetic data. Figure 1C;D shows the empirical distributions of estimates of the conditional means of a mixer variable E(vα |{l}) and one of the Gaussian variables E(g1 |{l}) based on different assumed assignments. For estimation based on too few ﬁlter responses, the estimates do not well match the actual distributions. For example, for a local estimate based on a single ﬁlter response, the Gaussian estimate peaks away from zero. For assignments including more ﬁlter responses, the estimates become good. However, inference is also compromised if the estimates for vα are too global, including ﬁlter responses actually generated from vβ (C and D, last column).

C Statistics of generated ﬁlter responses, and of Gaussian and mixer estimates from Gibbs sampling. estimating their respective g1 and g2 . Again, as the number of ﬁlter responses increases, the estimates improve, provided that they are taken from the right group of ﬁlter responses with the same mixer variable. Speciﬁcally, the mean estimates of g1 and g2 become more independent (E, third column). Note that for estimations based on a single ﬁlter response, the joint conditional distribution of the Gaussian appears correlated rather than independent (E, second column); for estimation based on too many ﬁlter responses (40 in this example), the joint conditional distribution of the Gaussian estimates shows a dependent (rather than independent) bowtie shape (E, last column). Mixer variable joint statistics also deviate from the actual when the estimations are too local or global (not shown). We have observed qualitatively similar statistics for estimation based on coefﬁcients in natural images. Neighborhood size has also been discussed in the context of the quality of noise removal, assuming a GSM model.26 2 Neighborhood inference: solving the assignment problem The plots in ﬁgure 1 suggest that it should be possible to infer the assignments, ie work out which ﬁlter responses share common mixers, by learning from the statistics of the resulting joint dependencies. Hard assignment problems (in which each ﬁlter response pays allegiance to just one mixer) are notoriously computationally brittle. Soft assignment problems (in which there is a probabilistic relationship between ﬁlter responses and mixers) are computationally better behaved. Further, real world stimuli are likely better captured by the possibility that ﬁlter responses are coordinated in somewhat different collections in different images. We consider a richer, mixture GSM as a generative model (Figure 2). To model the generation of ﬁlter responses li for a single image patch, we multiply each Gaussian variable gi by a single mixer variable from the set v1 . . . vm . We assume that gi has association probabil- ity pij (satisfying j pij = 1, ∀i) of being assigned to mixer variable vj . The assignments are assumed to be made independently for each patch. We use si ∈ {1, 2, . . . m} for the assignments: li = g i vs i (3) Inference and learning in this model proceeds in two stages, according to the expectation maximization algorithm. First, given a ﬁlter response li , we use Gibbs sampling for the E phase to ﬁnd possible appropriate (posterior) assignments. Williams et al.27 suggested using Gibbs sampling to solve a similar assignment problem in the context of dynamic tree models. Second, for the M phase, given the collection of assignments across multiple ﬁlter responses, we update the association probabilities pij . Given sample mixer assignments, we can estimate the Gaussian and mixer components of the GSM using the table of section 1, but restricting the ﬁlter response samples just to those associated with each mixer variable. We tested the ability of this inference method to ﬁnd the associations in the probabilistic mixer variable synthetic example shown in ﬁgure 2, (A,B). The true generative model speciﬁes probabilistic overlap of 3 mixer variables. We generated 5000 samples for each ﬁlter according to the generative model. We ran the Gibbs sampling procedure, setting the number of possible neighborhoods to 5 (e.g., > 3); after 500 iterations the weights converged near to the proper probabilities. In (B, top), we plot the actual probability distributions for the ﬁlter associations with each of the mixer variables. In (B, bottom), we show the estimated associations: the three non-zero estimates closely match the actual distributions; the other two estimates are zero (not shown). The procedure consistently ﬁnds correct associations even in larger examples of data generated with up to 10 mixer variables. In (C) we show an example of the actual and estimated distributions of the mixer and Gaussian components of the GSM. Note that the joint conditional statistics of both mixer and Gaussian are independent, since the variables were generated as such in the synthetic example. The Gibbs procedure can be adjusted for data generated with different parameters a of equation 2, and for related mixers,2 allowing for a range of image coefﬁcient behaviors. 3 Image data Having validated the inference model using synthetic data, we turned to natural images. We derived linear ﬁlters from a multi-scale oriented steerable pyramid,28 with 100 ﬁlters, at 2 preferred orientations, 25 non-overlapping spatial positions (with spatial subsampling of 8 pixels), and two phases (quadrature pairs), and a single spatial frequency peaked at 1/6 cycles/pixel. The image ensemble is 4 images from a standard image compression database (boats, goldhill, plant leaves, and mountain) and 4000 samples. We ran our method with the same parameters as for synthetic data, with 7 possible neighborhoods and Rayleigh parameter a = .1 (as in ﬁgure 2). Figure 3 depicts the association weights pij of the coefﬁcients for each of the obtained mixer variables. In (A), we show a schematic (template) of the association representation that will follow in (B, C) for the actual data. Each mixer variable neighborhood is shown for coefﬁcients of two phases and two orientations along a spatial grid (one grid for each phase). The neighborhood is illustrated via the probability of each coefﬁcient to be generated from a given mixer variable. For the ﬁrst two neighborhoods (B), we also show the image patches that yielded the maximum log likelihood of P (v|patch). The ﬁrst neighborhood (in B) prefers vertical patterns across most of its “receptive ﬁeld”, while the second has a more localized region of horizontal preference. This can also be seen by averaging the 200 image patches with the maximum log likelihood. Strikingly, all the mixer variables group together two phases of quadrature pair (B, C). Quadrature pairs have also been extracted from cortical data, and are the components of ideal complex cell models. Another tendency is to group Phase 2 Phase 1 19 Y position Y position A 0 -19 Phase 1 Phase 2 19 0 -19 -19 0 19 X position -19 0 19 X position B Neighborhood Example max patches Average Neighborhood Example max patches C Neighborhood Average Gaussian 0.25 l2 0 -50 0 l 1 50 0 l 1 Mixer Gibbs fit assumed Gibbs fit assumed Distribution Distribution Distribution D Coefficient 0.12 E(g | l ) 0 2 0 -5 0 E(g 1 | l ) 5 0 E(g 1 | l ) 0.15 ) E(v | l ) β 0 00 15 E(v | l ) α 0 E(v | l ) α Figure 3: A Schematic of the mixer variable neighborhood representation.

D Statistics of representative coefﬁcients of two spatially displaced vertical ﬁlters, and of inferred Gaussian and mixer variables. orientations across space. The phase and iso-orientation grouping bear some interesting similarity to other recent suggestions;17, 18 as do the maximal patches.19 Wavelet ﬁlters have the advantage that they can span a wider spatial extent than is possible with current ICA techniques, and the analysis of parameters such as phase grouping is more controlled. We are comparing the analysis with an ICA ﬁrst-stage representation, which has other obvious advantages. We are also extending the analysis to correlated wavelet ﬁlters; 25 and to simulations with a larger number of neighborhoods. From the obtained associations, we estimated the mixer and Gaussian variables according to our model. In (D) we show representative statistics of the coefﬁcients and of the inferred variables. The learned distributions of Gaussian and mixer variables are quite close to our assumptions. The Gaussian estimates exhibit joint conditional statistics that are roughly independent, and the mixer variables are weakly dependent. We have thus far demonstrated neighborhood inference for an image ensemble, but it is also interesting and perhaps more intuitive to consider inference for particular images or image classes. In ﬁgure 4 (A-B) we demonstrate example mixer variable neighborhoods derived from learning patches of a zebra image (Corel CD-ROM). As before, the neighborhoods are composed of quadrature pairs; however, the spatial conﬁgurations are richer and have A Neighborhood B Neighborhood Average Example max patches Top 25 max patches Average Example max patches Top 25 max patches Figure 4: Example of Gibbs on Zebra image.

Right: Image and marked on top of it example patches that yielded the maximum likelihood of P (v|patch). not been previously reported with unsupervised hierarchical methods: for example, in (A), the mixture neighborhood captures a horizontal-bottom/vertical-top spatial conﬁguration. This appears particularly relevant in segmenting regions of the front zebra, as shown by marking in the image the patches i that yielded the maximum log likelihood of P (v|patch). In (B), the mixture neighborhood captures a horizontal conﬁguration, more focused on the horizontal stripes of the front zebra. This example demonstrates the logic behind a probabilistic mixture: coefﬁcients corresponding to the bottom horizontal stripes might be linked with top vertical stripes (A) or to more horizontal stripes (B). 4 Discussion Work on the study of natural image statistics has recently evolved from issues about scalespace hierarchies, wavelets, and their ready induction through unsupervised learning models (loosely based on cortical development) towards the coordinated statistical structure of the wavelet components. This includes bottom-up (eg bowties, hierarchical representations such as complex cells) and top-down (eg GSM) viewpoints. The resulting new insights inform a wealth of models and ideas and form the essential backdrop for the work in this paper. They also link to impressive engineering results in image coding and processing. A most critical aspect of an hierarchical representational model is the way that the structure of the hierarchy is induced. We addressed the hierarchy question using a novel extension to the GSM generative model in which mixer variables (at one level of the hierarchy) enjoy probabilistic assignments to ﬁlter responses (at a lower level). We showed how these assignments can be learned (using Gibbs sampling), and illustrated some of their attractive properties using both synthetic and a variety of image data. We grounded our method ﬁrmly in Bayesian inference of the posterior distributions over the two classes of random variables in a GSM (mixer and Gaussian), placing particular emphasis on the interplay between the generative model and the statistical properties of its components. An obvious question raised by our work is the neural correlate of the two different posterior variables. The Gaussian variable has characteristics resembling those of the output of divisively normalized simple cells;6 the mixer variable is more obviously related to the output of quadrature pair neurons (such as orientation energy or motion energy cells, which may also be divisively normalized). How these different information sources may subsequently be used is of great interest. Acknowledgements This work was funded by the HHMI (OS, TJS) and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation (PD).

<p>Author: Le Lu, Gregory D. Hager, Laurent Younes</p><p>Abstract: Visual action recognition is an important problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a new method to probabilistically model and recognize actions of articulated objects, such as hand or body gestures, in image sequences. Our method consists of three levels of representation. At the low level, we ﬁrst extract a feature vector invariant to scale and in-plane rotation by using the Fourier transform of a circular spatial histogram. Then, spectral partitioning [20] is utilized to obtain an initial clustering; this clustering is then reﬁned using a temporal smoothness constraint. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based clustering and density estimation in the subspace of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are then applied to thousands of image feature vectors to obtain an intermediate level representation. Finally, at the high level we build a temporal multiresolution histogram model for each action by aggregating the clustering weights of sampled images belonging to that action. We discuss how this high level representation can be extended to achieve temporal scaling invariance and to include Bi-gram or Multi-gram transition information. Both image clustering and action recognition/segmentation results are given to show the validity of our three tiered representation.</p><p>6 0.5575211 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Generative_Affine_Localisation_and_Tracking.html">73 nips-2004-Generative Affine Localisation and Tracking</a></p>

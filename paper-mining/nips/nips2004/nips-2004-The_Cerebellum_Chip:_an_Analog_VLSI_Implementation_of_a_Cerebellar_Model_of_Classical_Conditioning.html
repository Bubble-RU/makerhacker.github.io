Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

The algorithm carries out a form of cost shaping and minimizes a version of Bellman error. We establish an error bound that scales gracefully with the number of states without imposing the (strong) Lyapunov condition required by its counterpart in [6]. We propose a path-following method that automates selection of important algorithm parameters which represent counterparts to the “state-relevance weights” studied in [6]. 1</p><p>3 0.11446295 <a title="184-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Methods_for_Estimating_the_Computational_Power_and_Generalization_Capability_of_Neural_Microcircuits.html">118 nips-2004-Methods for Estimating the Computational Power and Generalization Capability of Neural Microcircuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>4 0.097018532 <a title="184-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt_Analog_VLSI_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Pattern_Classification_and_Sequence_Estimation.html">176 nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt Analog VLSI Support Vector Machine for Pattern Classification and Sequence Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron ﬁres shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron’s variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron’s output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic eﬃcacy increases. We compare our account to other eﬀorts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation. 1</p><p>6 0.074701756 <a title="184-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

Roy</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm based on linear programming that approximates the diﬀerential value function of an average-cost Markov decision process via a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions. The algorithm carries out a form of cost shaping and minimizes a version of Bellman error. We establish an error bound that scales gracefully with the number of states without imposing the (strong) Lyapunov condition required by its counterpart in [6]. We propose a path-following method that automates selection of important algorithm parameters which represent counterparts to the “state-relevance weights” studied in [6]. 1</p><p>4 0.48900235 <a title="184-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt_Analog_VLSI_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Pattern_Classification_and_Sequence_Estimation.html">176 nips-2004-Sub-Microwatt Analog VLSI Support Vector Machine for Pattern Classification and Sequence Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>6 0.4174889 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

We consider the design of incremental algorithms which follow paths of regularized solutions, as the regularization varies. These approaches often result in methods which are both efﬁcient and highly ﬂexible. We suggest a general path-following algorithm based on second-order approximations, prove that under mild conditions it remains “very close” to the path of optimal solutions and illustrate it with examples.</p><p>4 0.31223419 <a title="184-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Synergies_between_Intrinsic_and_Synaptic_Plasticity_in_Individual_Model_Neurons.html">181 nips-2004-Synergies between Intrinsic and Synaptic Plasticity in Individual Model Neurons</a></p>

It proposes a new intrinsic plasticity mechanism for a continuous activation model neuron based on low order moments of the neuron’s ﬁring rate distribution.

<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We develop a family of upper and lower bounds on the worst-case expected KL loss for estimating a discrete distribution on a ﬁnite number m of points, given N i.i.d. samples. Our upper bounds are approximationtheoretic, similar to recent bounds for estimating discrete entropy; the lower bounds are Bayesian, based on averages of the KL loss under Dirichlet distributions. The upper bounds are convex in their parameters and thus can be minimized by descent methods to provide estimators with low worst-case error; the lower bounds are indexed by a one-dimensional parameter and are thus easily maximized. Asymptotic analysis of the bounds demonstrates the uniform KL-consistency of a wide class of estimators as c = N/m → ∞ (no matter how slowly), and shows that no estimator is consistent for c bounded (in contrast to entropy estimation). Moreover, the bounds are asymptotically tight as c → 0 or ∞, and are shown numerically to be tight within a factor of two for all c. Finally, in the sparse-data limit c → 0, we ﬁnd that the Dirichlet-Bayes (add-constant) estimator with parameter scaling like −c log(c) optimizes both the upper and lower bounds, suggesting an optimal choice of the “add-constant” parameter in this regime.</p><p>6 0.30698121 <a title="184-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>

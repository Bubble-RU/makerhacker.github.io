The proposed algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML), treats all possible labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class categorization problem. To cope with the data sparseness caused by the huge number of possible labels, MML combines some prior knowledge about label prototypes and a maximal margin criterion in a novel way. Experiments with multi-topic Web pages show that MML outperforms existing learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines. 1 Multi-topic Text Categorization (MTC) This paper addresses the problem of learning for multi-topic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to select all topics relevant to a text from a given set of topics. In MTC, multiple topics may be relevant to a single text. We thus call a set of topics label, and say that a text is assigned a label, not a topic. In almost all previous text categorization studies (e.g. [1, 2]), the label is predicted by judging each topic’s relevance to the text. In this decomposition approach, the features speciﬁc to a topic, not a label, are regarded as important features. However, the approach may result in inefﬁcient learning as we will explain in the following example. Imagine an MTC problem of scientiﬁc papers where quantum computing papers are assigned multi-topic label “quantum physics (QP) & computer science (CS)”. (QP and CS are topics in this example.) Since there are some words speciﬁc to quantum computing such as “qbit1 ”, one can say that efﬁcient MTC learners should use such words to assign label QP & CS. However, the decomposition approach is likely to ignore these words since they are only speciﬁc to a small portion of the whole QP or CS papers (there are many more QP and CS papers than quantum computing papers), and therefore are not discriminative features for either topic QP or CS. 1 Qbit is a unit of quantum information, and frequently appears in real quantum computing literatures, but rarely seen in other literatures.

The set of all possible labels Training samples Table 1: Notation Parametric Mixture Model (PMM) [3] adopts another approach to MTC. It is assumed in PMM that multi-topic texts are generated from a mixture of topic-speciﬁc word distributions. Its decision on labeling is done at once, not separately for each topic. However, PMM also has a problem with multi-topic speciﬁc features such as “qbit” since it is impossible for texts to have such features given PMM’s mixture process. These problems with multi-topic speciﬁc features are caused by dependency assumptions between labels, which are explicitly or implicitly made in existing methods. To solve these problems, we propose Maximal Margin Labeling, which treats labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class problem. In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss why multi-class classiﬁers cannot be directly applied to MTC in Section 2. We then propose MML in Section 3, and address implementation issues in Section 4. In Section 5, MML is experimentally compared with existing methods using a collection of multi-topic Web pages. We summarize this paper in Section 6. 2 Solving MTC as a Multi-Class Categorization To discuss why existing multi-class classiﬁers do not work in MTC, we start from the multi-class classiﬁer proposed in [4]. Hereafter we use the notation given in Table 1. The multi-class classiﬁer in [4] categorizes an object into the class whose prototype vector is the closest to the object’s feature vector. By substituting label for class, the classiﬁer can be written as follows. f (x) = arg max x, mλ (1) X λ∈Λ where , X is the the inner product of Rd , and mλ ∈ Rd is the prototype vector of label λ. Following the similar argument as in [4], the prototype vectors are learned by solving the following maximal margin problem2 . min M s.t. 1 M 2 2 λ ξi +C xi , mLi 1≤i≤m λ∈Λ,λ=Li X − xi , m λ X λ ≥ 1 − ξi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (2) where M is the prototype matrix whose columns are the prototype vectors, and M is the Frobenius matrix norm of M . Note that Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) cover only training samples’ labels, but also all possible labels. This is because the labels unseen in training samples may be relevant to test samples. In 2 In Eq.(2), we penalize all violation of the margin constraints. On the other hand, Crammer and Singer penalize only the largest violation of the margin constraint for each training sample [4]. We chose the “penalize-all” approach since it leads to an optimization problem without equality constraints (see Eq.(7)), which is much easier to solve than the one in [4]. usual multi-class problems, such unseen labels seldom exist. In MTC, however, the number of labels is generally very large (e.g. one of our datasets has 1,054 labels (Table 2)), and unseen labels often exist. Thus it is necessary to consider all possible labels in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) since it is impossible to know which unseen labels are present in the test samples. There are two problems with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The ﬁrst problem is that they involve the prototype vectors of seldom or never seen labels. Without the help of prior knowledge about where the prototype vectors should be, it is impossible to obtain appropriate prototype vectors for such labels. The second problem is that these equations are computationally too demanding since they involve combinatorial maximization and summation over all possible labels, whose number can be quite large. (For example, the number is around 230 in the datasets used in our experiments.) We will address the ﬁrst problem in Section 3 and the second problem in Section 4. 3 Maximal Margin Labeling In this section, we incorporate some prior knowledge about the location of prototype vectors into Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), and propose a novel MTC learning algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML). As prior knowledge, we simply assume that the prototype vectors of similar labels should be placed close to each other. Based on this assumption, we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (1) to yield f (x) = arg max M T x, eλ L, (3) λ∈Λ where , L is the inner product of R|Λ| and {eλ }λ∈Λ is the orthonormal basis of R|Λ| . The classiﬁer of Eq. (3) can be interpreted as a two-step process: the ﬁrst step is to map the vector x into R|Λ| by M T , and the second step is to ﬁnd the closest eλ to image M T x. Then we replace {eλ }λ∈Λ with (generally) non-orthogonal vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ whose geometrical conﬁguration reﬂects label similarity. More formally speaking, we use vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ that satisfy the condition φ(λ1 ), φ(λ2 ) S = S(λ1 , λ2 ) for ∀λ1 , λ2 ∈ Λ, (4) where , S is an inner product of the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ , and S is a Mercer kernel [5] on Λ × Λ and is a similarity measure between labels. We call the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)} VS . With this replacement, MML’s classiﬁer is written as follows. f (x) = arg max W x, φ(λ) S , (5) λ∈Λ where W is a linear map from Rd to VS . W is the solution of the following problem. min W 1 W 2 m 2 λ ξi +C i=1 λ∈Λ,λ=Li φ(Li )−φ(λ) λ λ s.t. W xi , ≥ 1−ξi , ξi ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li . (6) φ(Li )−φ(λ) Note that if φ(λ) is replaced by eλ , Eq. (6) becomes identical to Eq. (2) except for a scale factor. Thus Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are natural extensions of the multi-class classiﬁer in [4]. We call the MTC classiﬁer of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) “Maximal Margin Labeling (MML)”. Figure 1 explains the margin (the inner product in Eq. (6)) in MML. The margin represents the distance from the image of the training sample xi to the boundary between the correct label Li and wrong label λ. MML optimizes the linear map W so that the smallest margin between all training samples and all possible labels becomes maximal, along with a penalty C for the case that samples penetrate into the margin. Figure 1: Maximal Margin Labeling Dual Form For numerical computation, the following Wolfe dual form of Eq. (6) is more convenient. (We omit its derivation due to space limits.) S(Li , Li′ )−S(Li , λ′ )−S(λ, Li′ )+S(λ, λ′ ) 1 λ λ′ λ αi αi′ (xi ·xi′ ) max αi − 2 αλ 2 (1−S(Li , λ))(1−S(Li′ , λ′ )) i ′ ′ i,λ i,λ i ,λ λ s.t. 0 ≤ αi ≤ C for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (7) m λ where we denote i=1 λ∈Λ,∀λ=Li by i,λ , and αi are the dual variables corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraints in Eq. (6). Note that Eq. (7) does not contain φ(λ): all the computations involving φ can be done through the label similarity S. Additionally xi only appears in the inner products, and therefore can be replaced by any kernel of x. λ Using the solution αi of Eq. (7), the MML’s classiﬁer in Eq. (5) can be written as follows. S(Li , L)−S(λ, L) λ . (8) f (x) = arg max αi (x·xi ) 2(1−S(Li , λ)) L∈Λ i,λ Label Similarity3 As examples of label similarity, we use two similarity measures: Dice measure and cosine measure. Dice measure4 4.1 SC (λ1 , λ2 ) = |λ1 ∩ λ2 | 2 |λ1 | |λ2 | = l j=1 l j=1 2|λ1 ∩λ2 | = |λ1 |+|λ2 | Cosine measure 4 SD (λ1 , λ2 ) = λ1 [j] + λ1 [j]λ2 [j] l j=1 l j=1 l j=1 λ2 [j] . λ1 [j]λ2 [j] λ1 [j] l j=1 (9) . 10) ( λ2 [j] Efﬁcient Implementation Approximation in Learning Eq. (7) contains the sum over all possible labels. As the number of topics (l) increases, this summation rapidly becomes intractable since |Λ| grows exponentially as 2l . To circumvent 3 The following discussion is easily extended to include the case that both λ1 and λ2 are empty although we do not discuss the case due to space limits. this problem, we approximate the sum over all possible labels in Eq. (7) by the partial sum λ λ over αi of |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1 and set all the other αi to zero. This approximation reduces the burden of the summation quite a lot: the number of summands is reduced from 2l to l, which is a huge reduction especially when many topics exist. λ To understand the rationale behind the approximation, ﬁrst note that αi is the dual variable λ corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraint (the margin constraint) in Eq. (7). Thus αi is non-zero if and only if W xi falls in the margin between φ(Li ) and φ(λ). We assume that this margin violation mainly occurs when φ(λ) is “close” to φ(Li ), i.e. |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1. If this assumption holds well, the proposed approximation of the sum will lead to a good approximation of the exact solution. 4.2 Polynomial Time Algorithms for Classiﬁcation The classiﬁcation of MML (Eq. (8)) involves the combinatorial maximization over all possible labels, so it can be a computationally demanding process. However, efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms are available when either the cosine measure or dice measure is used as label similarity. Eq. (8) can be divided into the subproblems by the number of topics in a label. f (x) = arg max g(x, L), (11) ˆ ˆ ˆ L∈{L1 ,L2 ,...,Ll } ˆ Ln = arg max g(x, L). (12) L∈Λ,|L|=n where g(x) is l g(x, L) cn [j]L[j], = j=1 cn [j] =      i,λ √ i,λ √ αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SD (Li ,λ)) αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SC (Li ,λ)) . 2Li [j] |Li |+n − 2λ[j] |λ|+n √Li [j] − √λ[j] √ √ |Li | n |λ| n if SD is used. (13) if SC is used. Here n = |L|. The computational cost of Eq. (13) for all j is O(nα l) (nα is the number of non-zero α), and that of Eq. (12) is O(l log l). Thus the total cost of the classiﬁcation by Eq. (11) is O(nα l2 + l2 log l). On the other hand, nα is O(ml) under the approximation described above. Therefore, the classiﬁcation can be done within O(ml3 ) computational steps, which is a signiﬁcant reduction from the case that the brute force search is used in Eq. (8). 5 Experiments In this section, we report experiments that compared MML to PMM [3], SVM5 [6], and BoosTexter [2] using a collection of Web pages. We used a normalized linear kernel k(x, x′ ) = x · x′ / x x′ in MML and SVM. As for BoosTexter, “real abstaining AdaBoost.MH” was used as the weak learner. 5.1 Experimental Setup The datasets used in our experiment represent the Web page collection used in [3] (Table 2). The Web pages were collected through the hyperlinks from Yahoo!’s top directory 5 For each topic, an SVM classiﬁer is trained to predict whether the topic is relevant (positive) or irrelevant (negative) to input doucments.

(R is the number of weak hypotheses.) The underlined fetures and parameters were selected for the evaluation with the test data. (www.yahoo.com), and then divided into 11 datasets by Yahoo’s top category. Each page is labeled with the Yahoo’s second level sub-categories from which the page is hyperlinked. (Thus, the sub-categories are topics in our term.) See [3] for more details about the collection. Then the Web pages were converted into three types of feature vectors: (a) Binary vectors, where each feature indicates the presence (absence) of a term by 1 (0); (b) TF vectors, where each feature is the number of appearances of a term (term frequency); and (c) TF×IDF vectors, where each feature is the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency [7]. To select the best combinations of feature types and learning parameters such as the penalty C for MML, the learners were trained on 2,000 Web pages with all combinations of feature and parameter listed in Table 3, and then were evaluated by labeling F-measure on independently drawn development data. The combinations which achieve the best labeling F-measures (underlined in Table 3) were used in the following experiments. 5.2 Evaluation Measures We used three measures to evaluate labeling performance: labeling F-measure, exact match ratio, and retrieval F-measure.

Retrieval F-measure6 For real tasks, it is also important to evaluate retrieval performance, i.e. how accurately classiﬁers can ﬁnd relevant texts for a given topic. Retrieval F-measure FR measures the average retrieval performance over all topics. FR = 5.3 1 l l j=1 n pred [j]Ltrue [j] i i=1 Li . n (Lpred [j] + Ltrue [j]) i i i=1 2 (16) Results First we trained the classiﬁers with randomly chosen 2,000 samples. We then calculated the three evaluation measures for 3,000 other randomly chosen samples. This process was repeated ﬁve times, and the resulting averaged values are shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the MMLs with Dice measure outperform other methods in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. The MMLs also show the best performance with regard to retrieval Fmeasure although the margins to the other methods are not as large as observed in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. Note that no classiﬁer except MML with Dice measure achieves good labeling on all the three measures. For example, PMM shows high labeling F-measures, but its performance is rather poor when evaluated in retrieval F-measure. As the second experiment, we evaluated the classiﬁers trained with 250–2000 training samples on the same test samples. Figure 2 shows each measure averaged over all datasets. It is observed that the MMLs show high generalization even when training data is small. An interesting point is that MML with cosine measure achieves rather high labeling F-measures and retrieval F-measure with training data of smaller size. Such high-performace, however, does not continue when trained on larger data. 6 FR is called “the macro average of F-measures” in the text categorization community. Figure 2: The learning curve of labeling F-measure (left), exact match ratio (middle) and retrieval F-measure (right). MD, MC, PM, SV, BO mean the same as in Table 4. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a novel learning algorithm for multi-topic text categorization. The algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling, embeds labels (sets of topics) into a similarityinduced vector space, and learns a large margin classiﬁer in the space. To overcome the demanding computational cost of MML, we provide an approximation method in learning and efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms. In experiments on a collection of Web pages, MML outperformed other methods including SVM and showed better generalization.

<p>Author: Hideto Kazawa, Tomonori Izumitani, Hirotoshi Taira, Eisaku Maeda</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of statistical learning for multitopic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to choose all relevant topics (a label) from a given set of topics. The proposed algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML), treats all possible labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class categorization problem. To cope with the data sparseness caused by the huge number of possible labels, MML combines some prior knowledge about label prototypes and a maximal margin criterion in a novel way. Experiments with multi-topic Web pages show that MML outperforms existing learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines. 1 Multi-topic Text Categorization (MTC) This paper addresses the problem of learning for multi-topic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to select all topics relevant to a text from a given set of topics. In MTC, multiple topics may be relevant to a single text. We thus call a set of topics label, and say that a text is assigned a label, not a topic. In almost all previous text categorization studies (e.g. [1, 2]), the label is predicted by judging each topic’s relevance to the text. In this decomposition approach, the features speciﬁc to a topic, not a label, are regarded as important features. However, the approach may result in inefﬁcient learning as we will explain in the following example. Imagine an MTC problem of scientiﬁc papers where quantum computing papers are assigned multi-topic label “quantum physics (QP) & computer science (CS)”. (QP and CS are topics in this example.) Since there are some words speciﬁc to quantum computing such as “qbit1 ”, one can say that efﬁcient MTC learners should use such words to assign label QP & CS. However, the decomposition approach is likely to ignore these words since they are only speciﬁc to a small portion of the whole QP or CS papers (there are many more QP and CS papers than quantum computing papers), and therefore are not discriminative features for either topic QP or CS. 1 Qbit is a unit of quantum information, and frequently appears in real quantum computing literatures, but rarely seen in other literatures.

The set of all possible labels Training samples Table 1: Notation Parametric Mixture Model (PMM) [3] adopts another approach to MTC. It is assumed in PMM that multi-topic texts are generated from a mixture of topic-speciﬁc word distributions. Its decision on labeling is done at once, not separately for each topic. However, PMM also has a problem with multi-topic speciﬁc features such as “qbit” since it is impossible for texts to have such features given PMM’s mixture process. These problems with multi-topic speciﬁc features are caused by dependency assumptions between labels, which are explicitly or implicitly made in existing methods. To solve these problems, we propose Maximal Margin Labeling, which treats labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class problem. In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss why multi-class classiﬁers cannot be directly applied to MTC in Section 2. We then propose MML in Section 3, and address implementation issues in Section 4. In Section 5, MML is experimentally compared with existing methods using a collection of multi-topic Web pages. We summarize this paper in Section 6. 2 Solving MTC as a Multi-Class Categorization To discuss why existing multi-class classiﬁers do not work in MTC, we start from the multi-class classiﬁer proposed in [4]. Hereafter we use the notation given in Table 1. The multi-class classiﬁer in [4] categorizes an object into the class whose prototype vector is the closest to the object’s feature vector. By substituting label for class, the classiﬁer can be written as follows. f (x) = arg max x, mλ (1) X λ∈Λ where , X is the the inner product of Rd , and mλ ∈ Rd is the prototype vector of label λ. Following the similar argument as in [4], the prototype vectors are learned by solving the following maximal margin problem2 . min M s.t. 1 M 2 2 λ ξi +C xi , mLi 1≤i≤m λ∈Λ,λ=Li X − xi , m λ X λ ≥ 1 − ξi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (2) where M is the prototype matrix whose columns are the prototype vectors, and M is the Frobenius matrix norm of M . Note that Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) cover only training samples’ labels, but also all possible labels. This is because the labels unseen in training samples may be relevant to test samples. In 2 In Eq.(2), we penalize all violation of the margin constraints. On the other hand, Crammer and Singer penalize only the largest violation of the margin constraint for each training sample [4]. We chose the “penalize-all” approach since it leads to an optimization problem without equality constraints (see Eq.(7)), which is much easier to solve than the one in [4]. usual multi-class problems, such unseen labels seldom exist. In MTC, however, the number of labels is generally very large (e.g. one of our datasets has 1,054 labels (Table 2)), and unseen labels often exist. Thus it is necessary to consider all possible labels in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) since it is impossible to know which unseen labels are present in the test samples. There are two problems with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The ﬁrst problem is that they involve the prototype vectors of seldom or never seen labels. Without the help of prior knowledge about where the prototype vectors should be, it is impossible to obtain appropriate prototype vectors for such labels. The second problem is that these equations are computationally too demanding since they involve combinatorial maximization and summation over all possible labels, whose number can be quite large. (For example, the number is around 230 in the datasets used in our experiments.) We will address the ﬁrst problem in Section 3 and the second problem in Section 4. 3 Maximal Margin Labeling In this section, we incorporate some prior knowledge about the location of prototype vectors into Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), and propose a novel MTC learning algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML). As prior knowledge, we simply assume that the prototype vectors of similar labels should be placed close to each other. Based on this assumption, we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (1) to yield f (x) = arg max M T x, eλ L, (3) λ∈Λ where , L is the inner product of R|Λ| and {eλ }λ∈Λ is the orthonormal basis of R|Λ| . The classiﬁer of Eq. (3) can be interpreted as a two-step process: the ﬁrst step is to map the vector x into R|Λ| by M T , and the second step is to ﬁnd the closest eλ to image M T x. Then we replace {eλ }λ∈Λ with (generally) non-orthogonal vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ whose geometrical conﬁguration reﬂects label similarity. More formally speaking, we use vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ that satisfy the condition φ(λ1 ), φ(λ2 ) S = S(λ1 , λ2 ) for ∀λ1 , λ2 ∈ Λ, (4) where , S is an inner product of the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ , and S is a Mercer kernel [5] on Λ × Λ and is a similarity measure between labels. We call the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)} VS . With this replacement, MML’s classiﬁer is written as follows. f (x) = arg max W x, φ(λ) S , (5) λ∈Λ where W is a linear map from Rd to VS . W is the solution of the following problem. min W 1 W 2 m 2 λ ξi +C i=1 λ∈Λ,λ=Li φ(Li )−φ(λ) λ λ s.t. W xi , ≥ 1−ξi , ξi ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li . (6) φ(Li )−φ(λ) Note that if φ(λ) is replaced by eλ , Eq. (6) becomes identical to Eq. (2) except for a scale factor. Thus Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are natural extensions of the multi-class classiﬁer in [4]. We call the MTC classiﬁer of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) “Maximal Margin Labeling (MML)”. Figure 1 explains the margin (the inner product in Eq. (6)) in MML. The margin represents the distance from the image of the training sample xi to the boundary between the correct label Li and wrong label λ. MML optimizes the linear map W so that the smallest margin between all training samples and all possible labels becomes maximal, along with a penalty C for the case that samples penetrate into the margin. Figure 1: Maximal Margin Labeling Dual Form For numerical computation, the following Wolfe dual form of Eq. (6) is more convenient. (We omit its derivation due to space limits.) S(Li , Li′ )−S(Li , λ′ )−S(λ, Li′ )+S(λ, λ′ ) 1 λ λ′ λ αi αi′ (xi ·xi′ ) max αi − 2 αλ 2 (1−S(Li , λ))(1−S(Li′ , λ′ )) i ′ ′ i,λ i,λ i ,λ λ s.t. 0 ≤ αi ≤ C for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (7) m λ where we denote i=1 λ∈Λ,∀λ=Li by i,λ , and αi are the dual variables corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraints in Eq. (6). Note that Eq. (7) does not contain φ(λ): all the computations involving φ can be done through the label similarity S. Additionally xi only appears in the inner products, and therefore can be replaced by any kernel of x. λ Using the solution αi of Eq. (7), the MML’s classiﬁer in Eq. (5) can be written as follows. S(Li , L)−S(λ, L) λ . (8) f (x) = arg max αi (x·xi ) 2(1−S(Li , λ)) L∈Λ i,λ Label Similarity3 As examples of label similarity, we use two similarity measures: Dice measure and cosine measure. Dice measure4 4.1 SC (λ1 , λ2 ) = |λ1 ∩ λ2 | 2 |λ1 | |λ2 | = l j=1 l j=1 2|λ1 ∩λ2 | = |λ1 |+|λ2 | Cosine measure 4 SD (λ1 , λ2 ) = λ1 [j] + λ1 [j]λ2 [j] l j=1 l j=1 l j=1 λ2 [j] . λ1 [j]λ2 [j] λ1 [j] l j=1 (9) . 10) ( λ2 [j] Efﬁcient Implementation Approximation in Learning Eq. (7) contains the sum over all possible labels. As the number of topics (l) increases, this summation rapidly becomes intractable since |Λ| grows exponentially as 2l . To circumvent 3 The following discussion is easily extended to include the case that both λ1 and λ2 are empty although we do not discuss the case due to space limits. this problem, we approximate the sum over all possible labels in Eq. (7) by the partial sum λ λ over αi of |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1 and set all the other αi to zero. This approximation reduces the burden of the summation quite a lot: the number of summands is reduced from 2l to l, which is a huge reduction especially when many topics exist. λ To understand the rationale behind the approximation, ﬁrst note that αi is the dual variable λ corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraint (the margin constraint) in Eq. (7). Thus αi is non-zero if and only if W xi falls in the margin between φ(Li ) and φ(λ). We assume that this margin violation mainly occurs when φ(λ) is “close” to φ(Li ), i.e. |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1. If this assumption holds well, the proposed approximation of the sum will lead to a good approximation of the exact solution. 4.2 Polynomial Time Algorithms for Classiﬁcation The classiﬁcation of MML (Eq. (8)) involves the combinatorial maximization over all possible labels, so it can be a computationally demanding process. However, efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms are available when either the cosine measure or dice measure is used as label similarity. Eq. (8) can be divided into the subproblems by the number of topics in a label. f (x) = arg max g(x, L), (11) ˆ ˆ ˆ L∈{L1 ,L2 ,...,Ll } ˆ Ln = arg max g(x, L). (12) L∈Λ,|L|=n where g(x) is l g(x, L) cn [j]L[j], = j=1 cn [j] =      i,λ √ i,λ √ αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SD (Li ,λ)) αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SC (Li ,λ)) . 2Li [j] |Li |+n − 2λ[j] |λ|+n √Li [j] − √λ[j] √ √ |Li | n |λ| n if SD is used. (13) if SC is used. Here n = |L|. The computational cost of Eq. (13) for all j is O(nα l) (nα is the number of non-zero α), and that of Eq. (12) is O(l log l). Thus the total cost of the classiﬁcation by Eq. (11) is O(nα l2 + l2 log l). On the other hand, nα is O(ml) under the approximation described above. Therefore, the classiﬁcation can be done within O(ml3 ) computational steps, which is a signiﬁcant reduction from the case that the brute force search is used in Eq. (8). 5 Experiments In this section, we report experiments that compared MML to PMM [3], SVM5 [6], and BoosTexter [2] using a collection of Web pages. We used a normalized linear kernel k(x, x′ ) = x · x′ / x x′ in MML and SVM. As for BoosTexter, “real abstaining AdaBoost.MH” was used as the weak learner. 5.1 Experimental Setup The datasets used in our experiment represent the Web page collection used in [3] (Table 2). The Web pages were collected through the hyperlinks from Yahoo!’s top directory 5 For each topic, an SVM classiﬁer is trained to predict whether the topic is relevant (positive) or irrelevant (negative) to input doucments.

(Label size is the number of topics in a label.)

(R is the number of weak hypotheses.) The underlined fetures and parameters were selected for the evaluation with the test data. (www.yahoo.com), and then divided into 11 datasets by Yahoo’s top category. Each page is labeled with the Yahoo’s second level sub-categories from which the page is hyperlinked. (Thus, the sub-categories are topics in our term.) See [3] for more details about the collection. Then the Web pages were converted into three types of feature vectors: (a) Binary vectors, where each feature indicates the presence (absence) of a term by 1 (0); (b) TF vectors, where each feature is the number of appearances of a term (term frequency); and (c) TF×IDF vectors, where each feature is the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency [7]. To select the best combinations of feature types and learning parameters such as the penalty C for MML, the learners were trained on 2,000 Web pages with all combinations of feature and parameter listed in Table 3, and then were evaluated by labeling F-measure on independently drawn development data. The combinations which achieve the best labeling F-measures (underlined in Table 3) were used in the following experiments. 5.2 Evaluation Measures We used three measures to evaluate labeling performance: labeling F-measure, exact match ratio, and retrieval F-measure. In the following deﬁnitions, {Lpred }n and {Ltrue }n i=1 i i=1 i mean the predicted labels and the true labels, respectively.

MD, MC, PM, SV, and BO represent MML with SD , MML with SC , PMM, SVM and BoosTexter, respectively. Exact Match Ratio Exact match ratio EX counts only exact matches between the predicted label and the true label. EX = 1 n n I[Lpred = Ltrue ], i i (15) i=1 where I[S] is 1 if the statement S is true and 0 otherwise. Retrieval F-measure6 For real tasks, it is also important to evaluate retrieval performance, i.e. how accurately classiﬁers can ﬁnd relevant texts for a given topic. Retrieval F-measure FR measures the average retrieval performance over all topics. FR = 5.3 1 l l j=1 n pred [j]Ltrue [j] i i=1 Li . n (Lpred [j] + Ltrue [j]) i i i=1 2 (16) Results First we trained the classiﬁers with randomly chosen 2,000 samples. We then calculated the three evaluation measures for 3,000 other randomly chosen samples. This process was repeated ﬁve times, and the resulting averaged values are shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the MMLs with Dice measure outperform other methods in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. The MMLs also show the best performance with regard to retrieval Fmeasure although the margins to the other methods are not as large as observed in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. Note that no classiﬁer except MML with Dice measure achieves good labeling on all the three measures. For example, PMM shows high labeling F-measures, but its performance is rather poor when evaluated in retrieval F-measure. As the second experiment, we evaluated the classiﬁers trained with 250–2000 training samples on the same test samples. Figure 2 shows each measure averaged over all datasets. It is observed that the MMLs show high generalization even when training data is small. An interesting point is that MML with cosine measure achieves rather high labeling F-measures and retrieval F-measure with training data of smaller size. Such high-performace, however, does not continue when trained on larger data. 6 FR is called “the macro average of F-measures” in the text categorization community. Figure 2: The learning curve of labeling F-measure (left), exact match ratio (middle) and retrieval F-measure (right). MD, MC, PM, SV, BO mean the same as in Table 4. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a novel learning algorithm for multi-topic text categorization. The algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling, embeds labels (sets of topics) into a similarityinduced vector space, and learns a large margin classiﬁer in the space. To overcome the demanding computational cost of MML, we provide an approximation method in learning and efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms. In experiments on a collection of Web pages, MML outperformed other methods including SVM and showed better generalization.

To that extent we propose a regularization framework for functions deﬁned over nodes of a directed graph that forces the classiﬁcation function to change slowly on densely linked subgraphs. A powerful, yet computationally simple classiﬁcation algorithm is derived within the proposed framework.

The prior utilizes both labelled and unlabelled data; it also integrates features from multiple views of a given sample (e.g., multiple sensors), thus implementing a Bayesian form of co-training. An EM algorithm for training the classiﬁer automatically adjusts the tradeoff between the contributions of: (a) the labelled data; (b) the unlabelled data; and (c) the co-training information. Active label query selection is performed using a mutual information based criterion that explicitly uses the unlabelled data and the co-training information.

We suggest a method of moments for estimating this stochastic dependence using the unlabeled data. This is potentially useful for two distinct purposes: a. As an input to a supervised learning procedure which can be used to “de-bias” its results using labeled data only and b. As a potentially interesting learning task in itself.

<p>Author: Adrian Corduneanu, Tommi S.

The side information is expressed in terms of identities of sets of points or regions with the purpose of biasing the labels in each region to be the same. The resulting regularization objective is convex, has a unique solution, and the solution can be found with a pair of local propagation operations on graphs induced by the regions. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on document classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.089027755 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Exponentiated_Gradient_Algorithms_for_Large-margin_Structured_Classification.html">67 nips-2004-Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms for Large-margin Structured Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Hideto Kazawa, Tomonori Izumitani, Hirotoshi Taira, Eisaku Maeda</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of statistical learning for multitopic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to choose all relevant topics (a label) from a given set of topics. The proposed algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML), treats all possible labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class categorization problem. To cope with the data sparseness caused by the huge number of possible labels, MML combines some prior knowledge about label prototypes and a maximal margin criterion in a novel way. Experiments with multi-topic Web pages show that MML outperforms existing learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines. 1 Multi-topic Text Categorization (MTC) This paper addresses the problem of learning for multi-topic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to select all topics relevant to a text from a given set of topics. In MTC, multiple topics may be relevant to a single text. We thus call a set of topics label, and say that a text is assigned a label, not a topic. In almost all previous text categorization studies (e.g. [1, 2]), the label is predicted by judging each topic’s relevance to the text. In this decomposition approach, the features speciﬁc to a topic, not a label, are regarded as important features. However, the approach may result in inefﬁcient learning as we will explain in the following example. Imagine an MTC problem of scientiﬁc papers where quantum computing papers are assigned multi-topic label “quantum physics (QP) & computer science (CS)”. (QP and CS are topics in this example.) Since there are some words speciﬁc to quantum computing such as “qbit1 ”, one can say that efﬁcient MTC learners should use such words to assign label QP & CS. However, the decomposition approach is likely to ignore these words since they are only speciﬁc to a small portion of the whole QP or CS papers (there are many more QP and CS papers than quantum computing papers), and therefore are not discriminative features for either topic QP or CS. 1 Qbit is a unit of quantum information, and frequently appears in real quantum computing literatures, but rarely seen in other literatures.

The set of all possible labels Training samples Table 1: Notation Parametric Mixture Model (PMM) [3] adopts another approach to MTC. It is assumed in PMM that multi-topic texts are generated from a mixture of topic-speciﬁc word distributions. Its decision on labeling is done at once, not separately for each topic. However, PMM also has a problem with multi-topic speciﬁc features such as “qbit” since it is impossible for texts to have such features given PMM’s mixture process. These problems with multi-topic speciﬁc features are caused by dependency assumptions between labels, which are explicitly or implicitly made in existing methods. To solve these problems, we propose Maximal Margin Labeling, which treats labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class problem. In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss why multi-class classiﬁers cannot be directly applied to MTC in Section 2. We then propose MML in Section 3, and address implementation issues in Section 4. In Section 5, MML is experimentally compared with existing methods using a collection of multi-topic Web pages. We summarize this paper in Section 6. 2 Solving MTC as a Multi-Class Categorization To discuss why existing multi-class classiﬁers do not work in MTC, we start from the multi-class classiﬁer proposed in [4]. Hereafter we use the notation given in Table 1. The multi-class classiﬁer in [4] categorizes an object into the class whose prototype vector is the closest to the object’s feature vector. By substituting label for class, the classiﬁer can be written as follows. f (x) = arg max x, mλ (1) X λ∈Λ where , X is the the inner product of Rd , and mλ ∈ Rd is the prototype vector of label λ. Following the similar argument as in [4], the prototype vectors are learned by solving the following maximal margin problem2 . min M s.t. 1 M 2 2 λ ξi +C xi , mLi 1≤i≤m λ∈Λ,λ=Li X − xi , m λ X λ ≥ 1 − ξi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (2) where M is the prototype matrix whose columns are the prototype vectors, and M is the Frobenius matrix norm of M . Note that Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) cover only training samples’ labels, but also all possible labels. This is because the labels unseen in training samples may be relevant to test samples. In 2 In Eq.(2), we penalize all violation of the margin constraints. On the other hand, Crammer and Singer penalize only the largest violation of the margin constraint for each training sample [4]. We chose the “penalize-all” approach since it leads to an optimization problem without equality constraints (see Eq.(7)), which is much easier to solve than the one in [4]. usual multi-class problems, such unseen labels seldom exist. In MTC, however, the number of labels is generally very large (e.g. one of our datasets has 1,054 labels (Table 2)), and unseen labels often exist. Thus it is necessary to consider all possible labels in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) since it is impossible to know which unseen labels are present in the test samples. There are two problems with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The ﬁrst problem is that they involve the prototype vectors of seldom or never seen labels. Without the help of prior knowledge about where the prototype vectors should be, it is impossible to obtain appropriate prototype vectors for such labels. The second problem is that these equations are computationally too demanding since they involve combinatorial maximization and summation over all possible labels, whose number can be quite large. (For example, the number is around 230 in the datasets used in our experiments.) We will address the ﬁrst problem in Section 3 and the second problem in Section 4. 3 Maximal Margin Labeling In this section, we incorporate some prior knowledge about the location of prototype vectors into Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), and propose a novel MTC learning algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML). As prior knowledge, we simply assume that the prototype vectors of similar labels should be placed close to each other. Based on this assumption, we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (1) to yield f (x) = arg max M T x, eλ L, (3) λ∈Λ where , L is the inner product of R|Λ| and {eλ }λ∈Λ is the orthonormal basis of R|Λ| . The classiﬁer of Eq. (3) can be interpreted as a two-step process: the ﬁrst step is to map the vector x into R|Λ| by M T , and the second step is to ﬁnd the closest eλ to image M T x. Then we replace {eλ }λ∈Λ with (generally) non-orthogonal vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ whose geometrical conﬁguration reﬂects label similarity. More formally speaking, we use vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ that satisfy the condition φ(λ1 ), φ(λ2 ) S = S(λ1 , λ2 ) for ∀λ1 , λ2 ∈ Λ, (4) where , S is an inner product of the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ , and S is a Mercer kernel [5] on Λ × Λ and is a similarity measure between labels. We call the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)} VS . With this replacement, MML’s classiﬁer is written as follows. f (x) = arg max W x, φ(λ) S , (5) λ∈Λ where W is a linear map from Rd to VS . W is the solution of the following problem. min W 1 W 2 m 2 λ ξi +C i=1 λ∈Λ,λ=Li φ(Li )−φ(λ) λ λ s.t. W xi , ≥ 1−ξi , ξi ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li . (6) φ(Li )−φ(λ) Note that if φ(λ) is replaced by eλ , Eq. (6) becomes identical to Eq. (2) except for a scale factor. Thus Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are natural extensions of the multi-class classiﬁer in [4]. We call the MTC classiﬁer of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) “Maximal Margin Labeling (MML)”. Figure 1 explains the margin (the inner product in Eq. (6)) in MML. The margin represents the distance from the image of the training sample xi to the boundary between the correct label Li and wrong label λ. MML optimizes the linear map W so that the smallest margin between all training samples and all possible labels becomes maximal, along with a penalty C for the case that samples penetrate into the margin. Figure 1: Maximal Margin Labeling Dual Form For numerical computation, the following Wolfe dual form of Eq. (6) is more convenient. (We omit its derivation due to space limits.) S(Li , Li′ )−S(Li , λ′ )−S(λ, Li′ )+S(λ, λ′ ) 1 λ λ′ λ αi αi′ (xi ·xi′ ) max αi − 2 αλ 2 (1−S(Li , λ))(1−S(Li′ , λ′ )) i ′ ′ i,λ i,λ i ,λ λ s.t. 0 ≤ αi ≤ C for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (7) m λ where we denote i=1 λ∈Λ,∀λ=Li by i,λ , and αi are the dual variables corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraints in Eq. (6). Note that Eq. (7) does not contain φ(λ): all the computations involving φ can be done through the label similarity S. Additionally xi only appears in the inner products, and therefore can be replaced by any kernel of x. λ Using the solution αi of Eq. (7), the MML’s classiﬁer in Eq. (5) can be written as follows. S(Li , L)−S(λ, L) λ . (8) f (x) = arg max αi (x·xi ) 2(1−S(Li , λ)) L∈Λ i,λ Label Similarity3 As examples of label similarity, we use two similarity measures: Dice measure and cosine measure.

(7) contains the sum over all possible labels. As the number of topics (l) increases, this summation rapidly becomes intractable since |Λ| grows exponentially as 2l . To circumvent 3 The following discussion is easily extended to include the case that both λ1 and λ2 are empty although we do not discuss the case due to space limits. this problem, we approximate the sum over all possible labels in Eq. (7) by the partial sum λ λ over αi of |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1 and set all the other αi to zero. This approximation reduces the burden of the summation quite a lot: the number of summands is reduced from 2l to l, which is a huge reduction especially when many topics exist. λ To understand the rationale behind the approximation, ﬁrst note that αi is the dual variable λ corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraint (the margin constraint) in Eq. (7). Thus αi is non-zero if and only if W xi falls in the margin between φ(Li ) and φ(λ). We assume that this margin violation mainly occurs when φ(λ) is “close” to φ(Li ), i.e. |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1. If this assumption holds well, the proposed approximation of the sum will lead to a good approximation of the exact solution. 4.2 Polynomial Time Algorithms for Classiﬁcation The classiﬁcation of MML (Eq. (8)) involves the combinatorial maximization over all possible labels, so it can be a computationally demanding process. However, efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms are available when either the cosine measure or dice measure is used as label similarity. Eq. (8) can be divided into the subproblems by the number of topics in a label. f (x) = arg max g(x, L), (11) ˆ ˆ ˆ L∈{L1 ,L2 ,...,Ll } ˆ Ln = arg max g(x, L). (12) L∈Λ,|L|=n where g(x) is l g(x, L) cn [j]L[j], = j=1 cn [j] =      i,λ √ i,λ √ αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SD (Li ,λ)) αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SC (Li ,λ)) . 2Li [j] |Li |+n − 2λ[j] |λ|+n √Li [j] − √λ[j] √ √ |Li | n |λ| n if SD is used. (13) if SC is used. Here n = |L|. The computational cost of Eq. (13) for all j is O(nα l) (nα is the number of non-zero α), and that of Eq. (12) is O(l log l). Thus the total cost of the classiﬁcation by Eq. (11) is O(nα l2 + l2 log l). On the other hand, nα is O(ml) under the approximation described above. Therefore, the classiﬁcation can be done within O(ml3 ) computational steps, which is a signiﬁcant reduction from the case that the brute force search is used in Eq. (8). 5 Experiments In this section, we report experiments that compared MML to PMM [3], SVM5 [6], and BoosTexter [2] using a collection of Web pages. We used a normalized linear kernel k(x, x′ ) = x · x′ / x x′ in MML and SVM. As for BoosTexter, “real abstaining AdaBoost.MH” was used as the weak learner. 5.1 Experimental Setup The datasets used in our experiment represent the Web page collection used in [3] (Table 2). The Web pages were collected through the hyperlinks from Yahoo!’s top directory 5 For each topic, an SVM classiﬁer is trained to predict whether the topic is relevant (positive) or irrelevant (negative) to input doucments.

(R is the number of weak hypotheses.) The underlined fetures and parameters were selected for the evaluation with the test data. (www.yahoo.com), and then divided into 11 datasets by Yahoo’s top category. Each page is labeled with the Yahoo’s second level sub-categories from which the page is hyperlinked. (Thus, the sub-categories are topics in our term.) See [3] for more details about the collection. Then the Web pages were converted into three types of feature vectors: (a) Binary vectors, where each feature indicates the presence (absence) of a term by 1 (0); (b) TF vectors, where each feature is the number of appearances of a term (term frequency); and (c) TF×IDF vectors, where each feature is the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency [7]. To select the best combinations of feature types and learning parameters such as the penalty C for MML, the learners were trained on 2,000 Web pages with all combinations of feature and parameter listed in Table 3, and then were evaluated by labeling F-measure on independently drawn development data. The combinations which achieve the best labeling F-measures (underlined in Table 3) were used in the following experiments. 5.2 Evaluation Measures We used three measures to evaluate labeling performance: labeling F-measure, exact match ratio, and retrieval F-measure. In the following deﬁnitions, {Lpred }n and {Ltrue }n i=1 i i=1 i mean the predicted labels and the true labels, respectively.

Exact Match Ratio Exact match ratio EX counts only exact matches between the predicted label and the true label. EX = 1 n n I[Lpred = Ltrue ], i i (15) i=1 where I[S] is 1 if the statement S is true and 0 otherwise. Retrieval F-measure6 For real tasks, it is also important to evaluate retrieval performance, i.e. how accurately classiﬁers can ﬁnd relevant texts for a given topic. Retrieval F-measure FR measures the average retrieval performance over all topics. FR = 5.3 1 l l j=1 n pred [j]Ltrue [j] i i=1 Li . n (Lpred [j] + Ltrue [j]) i i i=1 2 (16) Results First we trained the classiﬁers with randomly chosen 2,000 samples. We then calculated the three evaluation measures for 3,000 other randomly chosen samples. This process was repeated ﬁve times, and the resulting averaged values are shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the MMLs with Dice measure outperform other methods in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. The MMLs also show the best performance with regard to retrieval Fmeasure although the margins to the other methods are not as large as observed in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. Note that no classiﬁer except MML with Dice measure achieves good labeling on all the three measures. For example, PMM shows high labeling F-measures, but its performance is rather poor when evaluated in retrieval F-measure. As the second experiment, we evaluated the classiﬁers trained with 250–2000 training samples on the same test samples. Figure 2 shows each measure averaged over all datasets. It is observed that the MMLs show high generalization even when training data is small. An interesting point is that MML with cosine measure achieves rather high labeling F-measures and retrieval F-measure with training data of smaller size. Such high-performace, however, does not continue when trained on larger data. 6 FR is called “the macro average of F-measures” in the text categorization community. Figure 2: The learning curve of labeling F-measure (left), exact match ratio (middle) and retrieval F-measure (right). MD, MC, PM, SV, BO mean the same as in Table 4. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a novel learning algorithm for multi-topic text categorization. The algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling, embeds labels (sets of topics) into a similarityinduced vector space, and learns a large margin classiﬁer in the space. To overcome the demanding computational cost of MML, we provide an approximation method in learning and efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms. In experiments on a collection of Web pages, MML outperformed other methods including SVM and showed better generalization.

<p>Author: Johannes Mohr, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The standard approach to the classiﬁcation of objects is to consider the examples as independent and identically distributed (iid). In many real world settings, however, this assumption is not valid, because a topographical relationship exists between the objects. In this contribution we consider the special case of image segmentation, where the objects are pixels and where the underlying topography is a 2D regular rectangular grid. We introduce a classiﬁcation method which not only uses measured vectorial feature information but also the label conﬁguration within a topographic neighborhood. Due to the resulting dependence between the labels of neighboring pixels, a collective classiﬁcation of a set of pixels becomes necessary. We propose a new method called ’Topographic Support Vector Machine’ (TSVM), which is based on a topographic kernel and a self-consistent solution to the label assignment shown to be equivalent to a recurrent neural network. The performance of the algorithm is compared to a conventional SVM on a cell image segmentation task. 1</p><p>3 0.63721043 <a title="111-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-An_Application_of_Boosting_to_Graph_Classification.html">19 nips-2004-An Application of Boosting to Graph Classification</a></p>

The proposal consists of i) decision stumps that use subgraph as features, and ii) a Boosting algorithm in which subgraph-based decision stumps are used as weak learners. We also discuss the relation between our algorithm and SVMs with convolution kernels. Two experiments using natural language data and chemical compounds show that our method achieves comparable or even better performance than SVMs with convolution kernels as well as improves the testing efﬁciency. 1</p><p>4 0.63002527 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Information_Regularization_on_Graphs.html">54 nips-2004-Distributed Information Regularization on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Corduneanu, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We provide a principle for semi-supervised learning based on optimizing the rate of communicating labels for unlabeled points with side information. The side information is expressed in terms of identities of sets of points or regions with the purpose of biasing the labels in each region to be the same. The resulting regularization objective is convex, has a unique solution, and the solution can be found with a pair of local propagation operations on graphs induced by the regions. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on document classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.62200177 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Preferences_for_Multiclass_Problems.html">100 nips-2004-Learning Preferences for Multiclass Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting multiclass problems can be cast in the general framework of label ranking deﬁned on a given set of classes. The evaluation for such a ranking is generally given in terms of the number of violated order constraints between classes. In this paper, we propose the Preference Learning Model as a unifying framework to model and solve a large class of multiclass problems in a large margin perspective. In addition, an original kernel-based method is proposed and evaluated on a ranking dataset with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>6 0.58374292 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-On_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">136 nips-2004-On Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, Yee W. Teh, Roger Bock, Michael Maire, Grace Vesom, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method that can make a scanned, handwritten mediaeval latin manuscript accessible to full text search. A generalized HMM is ﬁtted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data. 1. Intoduction There are many large corpora of handwritten scanned documents, and their number is growing rapidly. Collections range from the complete works of Mark Twain to thousands of pages of zoological notes spanning two centuries. Large scale analyses of such corpora is currently very difﬁcult, because handwriting recognition works poorly. Recently, Rath and Manmatha have demonstrated that one can use small bodies of aligned material as supervised data to train a word spotting mechanism [7]. The result can make scanned handwritten documents searchable. Current techniques assume a closed vocabulary — one can search only for words in the training set — and search for instances of whole words. This approach is particularly unattractive for an inﬂected language, because individual words can take so many forms that one is unlikely to see all in the training set. Furthermore, one would like the method used to require very little aligned training data, so that it is possible to process documents written by different scribes with little overhead. Mediaeval Latin manuscripts are a natural ﬁrst corpus for studying this problem, because there are many scanned manuscripts and because the handwriting is relatively regular. We expect the primary user need to be search over a large body of documents — to allow comparisons between documents — rather than transcription of a particular document (which is usually relatively easy to do by hand). Desirable features for a system are: First, that it use little or no aligned training data (an ideal, which we believe may be attainable, is an unsupervised learning system). Second, that one can search the document for an arbitrary string (rather than, say, only complete words that appear in the training data). This would allow a user to determine whether a document contains curious or distinctive spellings, for example (ﬁgure 7). We show that, using a statistical model based on a generalized HMM, we can search a medieval manuscript with considerable accuracy, using only one instance each of each letter in the manuscript to train the method (22 instances in total; Latin has no j, k, w, or z). Furthermore, our method allows fairly accurate transcription of the manuscript. We train our system on 22 glyphs taken from a a 12th century latin manuscript of Terence’s Comedies (obtained from a repository of over 80 scanned medieval works maintained by Oxford University [1]). We evaluate searches using a considerable portion of this manuscript aligned by hand; we then show that fair search results are available on a different manuscript (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]) without change of letter templates. 1.1. Previous Work Handwriting recognition is a traditional problem, too well studied to review in detail here (see [6]). Typically, online handwriting recognition (where strokes can be recorded) works better than ofﬂine handwriting recognition. Handwritten digits can now be recognized with high accuracy [2, 5]. Handwritten amounts can be read with fair accuracy, which is signiﬁcantly improved if one segments the amount into digits at the same time as one recognizes it [4, 5]. Recently several authors have proposed new techniques for search and translation in this unrestricted setting. Manmatha et al [7] introduce the technique of “word spotting,” which segments text into word images, rectiﬁes the word images, and then uses an aligned training set to learn correspondences between rectiﬁed word images and strings. The method is not suitable for a heavily inﬂected language, because words take so many forms. In an inﬂected language, the natural unit to match to is a subset of a word, rather than a whole word, implying that one should segment the text into blocks — which may be smaller than words — while recognizing. Vinciarelli et al [8] introduce a method for line by line recognition based around an HMM and quite similar to techniques used in the speech recognition community. Their method uses a window that slides along the text to obtain features; this has the difﬁculty that the same window is in some places too small (and so uninformative) and in others too big (and so spans more than one letter, and is confusing). Their method requires a substantial body of aligned training data, which makes it impractical for our applications. Close in spirit to our work is the approach to machine translation of Koehn and Knight [3]. They demonstrate that the statistics of unaligned corpora may provide as powerful constraints for training models as aligned bitexts. 2. The Model Our models for both search and transcription are based on the generalized HMM and differ only in their choice of transition model. In an HMM, each hidden node ct emits a single evidence node xt . In a generalized HMM, we allow each ct to emit a series of x’s whose length is itself a random variable. In our model, the hidden nodes correspond to letters and each xt is a single column of pixels. Allowing letters to emit sets of columns lets us accomodate letter templates of variable width. In particular, this means that we can unify segmenting ink into letters and recognizing blocks of ink; ﬁgure 3 shows an example of how useful this is. 2.1. Generating a line of text Our hidden state consists of a character label c, width w and vertical position y. The statespace of c contains the characters ‘a’-‘z’, a space ‘ ’, and a special end state Ω. Let T c be the template associated with character c, Tch , Tcw be respectively the height and width of that template, and m be the height of the image. Figure 1: Left, a full page of our manuscript, a 12’th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies obtained from [1]. Top right, a set of lines from a page from that document and bottom right, some words in higher resolution. Note: (a) the richness of page layout; (b) the clear spacing of the lines; (c) the relatively regular handwriting. Figure 2: Left, the 22 instances, one per letter, used to train our emission model. These templates are extracted by hand from the Terence document. Right, the ﬁve image channels for a single letter. Beginning at image column 1 (and assuming a dummy space before the ﬁrst character), • • • • choose character c ∼ p(c|c−1...−n ) (an n-gram letter model) choose length w ∼ Uniform(Tcw − k, Tcw + k) (for some small k) choose vertical position y ∼ Uniform(1, m − Tch ) z,y and Tch now deﬁne a bounding box b of pixels. Let i and j be indexed from the top left of that bounding box. – draw pixel (i, j) ∼ N (Tcij , σcij ) for each pixel in b – draw all pixels above and below b from background gaussian N (µ0 , σ0 ) (See 2.2 for greater detail on pixel emission model) • move to column w + 1 and repeat until we enter the end state Ω. Inference on a gHMM is a relatively straighforward business of dynamic programming. We have used unigram, bigram and trigram models, with each transition model ﬁtted using an electronic version of Caesar’s Gallic Wars, obtained from http://www.thelatinlibrary.com. We do not believe that the choice of author should signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁtted transition model — which is at the level of characters — but have not experimented with this point. The important matter is the emission model. 2.2. The Emission Model Our emission model is as follows: Given the character c and width w, we generate a template of the required length. Each pixel in this template becomes the mean of a gaussian which generates the corresponding pixel in the image. This template has a separate mean image for each pixel channel. The channels are assumed independent given the means. We train the model by cutting out by hand a single instance of each letter from our corpus (ﬁgure 2). This forms the central portion of the template. Pixels above and below this Model Perfect transcription unigram bigram trigram matching chars 21019 14603 15572 15788 substitutions 0 5487 4597 4410 insertions 0 534 541 507 deletions 0 773 718 695 Table 1: Edit distance between our transcribed Terence and the editor’s version. Note the trigram model produces signiﬁcantly fewer letter errors than the unigram model, but that the error rate is still a substantial 25%. central box are generated from a single gaussian used to model background pixels (basically white pixels). We add a third variable yt to our hidden state indicating the vertical position of the central box. However, since we are uninterested in actually recovering this variable, during inference we sum it out of the model. The width of a character is constrained to be close to the width (tw ) of our hand cut example by setting p(w|c) = 0 for w < tw − k and w > tw + k. Here k is a small, user deﬁned integer. Within this range, p(w|c) is distributed uniformly, larger templates are created by appending pixels from the background model to the template and smaller ones by simply removing the right k-most columns of the hand cut example. For features, we generate ﬁve image representations, shown in ﬁgure 2. The ﬁrst is a grayscale version of the original color image. The second and third are generated by convolving the grayscale image with a vertical derivative of gaussian ﬁlter, separating the positive and negative components of this response, and smoothing each of these gradient images separately. The fourth and ﬁfth are generated similarly but with a horizontal derivative of gaussian ﬁlter. We have experimented with different weightings of these 5 channels. In practice we use the gray scale channel and the horizontal gradient channels. We emphasize the horizontal pieces since these seem the more discriminative. 2.3. Transcription For transcription, we model letters as coming from an n-gram language model, with no dependencies between words. Thus, the probability of a letter depends on the k letters before it, where k = n unless this would cross a word boundary in which case the history terminates at this boundary. We chose not to model word to word transition probabilities since, unlike in English, word order in Latin is highly arbitrary. This transition model is ﬁt from a corpus of ascii encoded latin. We have experimented with unigram (i.e. uniform transition probabilities), bigram and trigram letter models. We can perform transcription by ﬁtting the maximum likelihood path through any given line. Some results of this technique are shown in ﬁgure 3. 2.4. Search For search, we rank lines by the probability that they contain our search word. We set up a ﬁnite state machine like that in ﬁgure 4. In this ﬁgure, ‘bg’ represents our background model for that portion of the line not generated by our search word. We can use any of the n-gram letter models described for transcription as the transition model for ‘bg’. The probability that the line contains the search word is the probability that this FSM takes path 1. We use this FSM as the transition model for our gHMM, and output the posterior probability of the two arrows leading into the end state. 1 and 2 are user deﬁned weights, but in practice the algorithm does not appear to be particular sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The results presented here use the unigram model.

Below, we show the line as segmented and transcribed by unigram, bigram and trigram models; the unigram and bigram models transcribe one word as “vemo”, but the stronger trigram model forces the two letters to be segmented and correctly transcribes the word as “venio”, illustrating the considerable beneﬁt to be obtained by segmenting only at recognition time. 1 − ε1 Path 1 1 − ε2 a b bg ε1 Ω bg Path 2 ε2 Figure 4: The ﬁnite state machine to search for the word ‘ab.’ ‘bg’ is a place holder for the larger ﬁnite state machine deﬁned by our language model’s transition matrix. 3. Results Figure 1 shows a page from our collection. This is a scanned 12th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies, obtained from the collection at [1]. In preprocessing, we extract individual lines of text by rotating the image to various degrees and projecting the sum of the pixel values onto the y-axis. We choose the orientation whose projection vector has the lowest entropy, and then segment lines by cutting at minima of this projection. Transcription is not our primary task, but methods that produce good transcriptions are going to support good searches. The gHMM can produce a surprisingly good transcription, given how little training data is used to train the emission model. We aligned an editors version of Terence with 25 pages from the manuscript by hand, and computed the edit distance between the transcribed text and the aligned text; as table 1 indicates, approximately 75% of letters are read correctly. Search results are strong. We show results for two documents. The ﬁrst set of results refers to the edition of Terence’s Comedies, from which we took the 22 letter instances. In particular, for any given search term, our process ranks the complete set of lines. We used a hand alignment of the manuscript to determine which lines contained each term; ﬁgure 5 shows an overview of searches performed using every word that appears in the 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 5: Our search ranks 587 manuscript lines, with higher ranking lines more likely to contain the relevant term. This ﬁgure shows complete search results for each term that appears more than three times in the 587 lines. Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. All 587 lines are represented. More common terms are represented by lower rows. More detailed results appear in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6; this summary ﬁgure suggests almost all searches are highly successful. document more than three times, in particular, showing which of the ranked set of lines actually contained the search term. For almost every search, the term appears mainly in the lines with higher rank. Figure 6 contains more detailed information for a smaller set of words. We do not score the position of a word in a line (for practical reasons). Figure 7 demonstrates (a) that our search respects the ink of the document and (b) that for the Terence document, word positions are accurately estimated. The spelling of mediaeval documents is typically cleaned up by editors; in our manuscript, the scribe reliably spells “michi” for the standard “mihi”. A search on “michi” produces many instances; a search on “mihi” produces none, because the ink doesn’t have any. Notice this phenomenon also in the bottom right line of ﬁgure 7, the scribe writes “habet, ut consumat nunc cum nichil obsint doli” and the editor gives “habet, ut consumat nunc quom nil obsint doli.” Figure 8 shows that searches on short strings produce many words containing that string as one would wish. 4. Discussion We have shown that it is possible to make at least some handwritten mediaeval manuscripts accessible to full text search, without requiring an aligned text or much supervisory data. Our documents have very regular letters, and letter frequencies — which can be obtained from transcribed Latin — appear to provide so powerful a cue that relatively little detailed information about letter shapes is required. Linking letter segmentation and recognition has thoroughly beneﬁcial effects. This suggests that the pool of manuscripts that can be made accessible in this way is large. In particular, we have used our method, trained on 22 instances of letters from one document, to search another document. Figure 9 shows the results from two searches of our second document (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]). No information from this document was used in training at all; but letter 1tu arbitror pater etiam nisi factum primum siet vero illi inter hic michi ibi qui tu ibi michi 0.9 0.8 0.7 qui hic 0.6 inter 0.5 illi 0.4 siet 0.3 vero 0.2 nisi 0.1 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 6: On the left, search results for selected words (indicated on the leftmost column). Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. Note only the top 300 results are represented, and that lines containing the search term are almost always at or close to the top of the search results (black marks to the left). On the right, we plot precision against recall for a set of different words by taking the top 10, 20, ... lines returned from the search, and checking them against the aligned manuscript. Note that, once all cases have been found, if the size of the pool is increased the precision will fall with 100% recall; many words work well, with most of the ﬁrst 20 or so lines returned containing the search term. shapes are sufﬁciently well shared that the search is still useful. All this suggests that one might be able to use EM to link three processes: one that clusters to determine letter shapes; one that segments letters; and one that imposes a language model. Such a system might be able to make handwritten Latin searchable with no training data. References [1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.

<p>Author: Hideto Kazawa, Tomonori Izumitani, Hirotoshi Taira, Eisaku Maeda</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of statistical learning for multitopic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to choose all relevant topics (a label) from a given set of topics. The proposed algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML), treats all possible labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class categorization problem. To cope with the data sparseness caused by the huge number of possible labels, MML combines some prior knowledge about label prototypes and a maximal margin criterion in a novel way. Experiments with multi-topic Web pages show that MML outperforms existing learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines. 1 Multi-topic Text Categorization (MTC) This paper addresses the problem of learning for multi-topic text categorization (MTC), whose goal is to select all topics relevant to a text from a given set of topics. In MTC, multiple topics may be relevant to a single text. We thus call a set of topics label, and say that a text is assigned a label, not a topic. In almost all previous text categorization studies (e.g. [1, 2]), the label is predicted by judging each topic’s relevance to the text. In this decomposition approach, the features speciﬁc to a topic, not a label, are regarded as important features. However, the approach may result in inefﬁcient learning as we will explain in the following example. Imagine an MTC problem of scientiﬁc papers where quantum computing papers are assigned multi-topic label “quantum physics (QP) & computer science (CS)”. (QP and CS are topics in this example.) Since there are some words speciﬁc to quantum computing such as “qbit1 ”, one can say that efﬁcient MTC learners should use such words to assign label QP & CS. However, the decomposition approach is likely to ignore these words since they are only speciﬁc to a small portion of the whole QP or CS papers (there are many more QP and CS papers than quantum computing papers), and therefore are not discriminative features for either topic QP or CS. 1 Qbit is a unit of quantum information, and frequently appears in real quantum computing literatures, but rarely seen in other literatures.

The set of all possible labels Training samples Table 1: Notation Parametric Mixture Model (PMM) [3] adopts another approach to MTC. It is assumed in PMM that multi-topic texts are generated from a mixture of topic-speciﬁc word distributions. Its decision on labeling is done at once, not separately for each topic. However, PMM also has a problem with multi-topic speciﬁc features such as “qbit” since it is impossible for texts to have such features given PMM’s mixture process. These problems with multi-topic speciﬁc features are caused by dependency assumptions between labels, which are explicitly or implicitly made in existing methods. To solve these problems, we propose Maximal Margin Labeling, which treats labels as independent classes and learns a multi-class classiﬁer on the induced multi-class problem. In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss why multi-class classiﬁers cannot be directly applied to MTC in Section 2. We then propose MML in Section 3, and address implementation issues in Section 4. In Section 5, MML is experimentally compared with existing methods using a collection of multi-topic Web pages. We summarize this paper in Section 6. 2 Solving MTC as a Multi-Class Categorization To discuss why existing multi-class classiﬁers do not work in MTC, we start from the multi-class classiﬁer proposed in [4]. Hereafter we use the notation given in Table 1. The multi-class classiﬁer in [4] categorizes an object into the class whose prototype vector is the closest to the object’s feature vector. By substituting label for class, the classiﬁer can be written as follows. f (x) = arg max x, mλ (1) X λ∈Λ where , X is the the inner product of Rd , and mλ ∈ Rd is the prototype vector of label λ. Following the similar argument as in [4], the prototype vectors are learned by solving the following maximal margin problem2 . min M s.t. 1 M 2 2 λ ξi +C xi , mLi 1≤i≤m λ∈Λ,λ=Li X − xi , m λ X λ ≥ 1 − ξi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (2) where M is the prototype matrix whose columns are the prototype vectors, and M is the Frobenius matrix norm of M . Note that Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) cover only training samples’ labels, but also all possible labels. This is because the labels unseen in training samples may be relevant to test samples. In 2 In Eq.(2), we penalize all violation of the margin constraints. On the other hand, Crammer and Singer penalize only the largest violation of the margin constraint for each training sample [4]. We chose the “penalize-all” approach since it leads to an optimization problem without equality constraints (see Eq.(7)), which is much easier to solve than the one in [4]. usual multi-class problems, such unseen labels seldom exist. In MTC, however, the number of labels is generally very large (e.g. one of our datasets has 1,054 labels (Table 2)), and unseen labels often exist. Thus it is necessary to consider all possible labels in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) since it is impossible to know which unseen labels are present in the test samples. There are two problems with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The ﬁrst problem is that they involve the prototype vectors of seldom or never seen labels. Without the help of prior knowledge about where the prototype vectors should be, it is impossible to obtain appropriate prototype vectors for such labels. The second problem is that these equations are computationally too demanding since they involve combinatorial maximization and summation over all possible labels, whose number can be quite large. (For example, the number is around 230 in the datasets used in our experiments.) We will address the ﬁrst problem in Section 3 and the second problem in Section 4. 3 Maximal Margin Labeling In this section, we incorporate some prior knowledge about the location of prototype vectors into Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), and propose a novel MTC learning algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling (MML). As prior knowledge, we simply assume that the prototype vectors of similar labels should be placed close to each other. Based on this assumption, we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (1) to yield f (x) = arg max M T x, eλ L, (3) λ∈Λ where , L is the inner product of R|Λ| and {eλ }λ∈Λ is the orthonormal basis of R|Λ| . The classiﬁer of Eq. (3) can be interpreted as a two-step process: the ﬁrst step is to map the vector x into R|Λ| by M T , and the second step is to ﬁnd the closest eλ to image M T x. Then we replace {eλ }λ∈Λ with (generally) non-orthogonal vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ whose geometrical conﬁguration reﬂects label similarity. More formally speaking, we use vectors {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ that satisfy the condition φ(λ1 ), φ(λ2 ) S = S(λ1 , λ2 ) for ∀λ1 , λ2 ∈ Λ, (4) where , S is an inner product of the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)}λ∈Λ , and S is a Mercer kernel [5] on Λ × Λ and is a similarity measure between labels. We call the vector space spanned by {φ(λ)} VS . With this replacement, MML’s classiﬁer is written as follows. f (x) = arg max W x, φ(λ) S , (5) λ∈Λ where W is a linear map from Rd to VS . W is the solution of the following problem. min W 1 W 2 m 2 λ ξi +C i=1 λ∈Λ,λ=Li φ(Li )−φ(λ) λ λ s.t. W xi , ≥ 1−ξi , ξi ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li . (6) φ(Li )−φ(λ) Note that if φ(λ) is replaced by eλ , Eq. (6) becomes identical to Eq. (2) except for a scale factor. Thus Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are natural extensions of the multi-class classiﬁer in [4]. We call the MTC classiﬁer of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) “Maximal Margin Labeling (MML)”. Figure 1 explains the margin (the inner product in Eq. (6)) in MML. The margin represents the distance from the image of the training sample xi to the boundary between the correct label Li and wrong label λ. MML optimizes the linear map W so that the smallest margin between all training samples and all possible labels becomes maximal, along with a penalty C for the case that samples penetrate into the margin. Figure 1: Maximal Margin Labeling Dual Form For numerical computation, the following Wolfe dual form of Eq. (6) is more convenient. (We omit its derivation due to space limits.) S(Li , Li′ )−S(Li , λ′ )−S(λ, Li′ )+S(λ, λ′ ) 1 λ λ′ λ αi αi′ (xi ·xi′ ) max αi − 2 αλ 2 (1−S(Li , λ))(1−S(Li′ , λ′ )) i ′ ′ i,λ i,λ i ,λ λ s.t. 0 ≤ αi ≤ C for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, ∀λ = Li , (7) m λ where we denote i=1 λ∈Λ,∀λ=Li by i,λ , and αi are the dual variables corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraints in Eq. (6). Note that Eq. (7) does not contain φ(λ): all the computations involving φ can be done through the label similarity S. Additionally xi only appears in the inner products, and therefore can be replaced by any kernel of x. λ Using the solution αi of Eq. (7), the MML’s classiﬁer in Eq. (5) can be written as follows. S(Li , L)−S(λ, L) λ . (8) f (x) = arg max αi (x·xi ) 2(1−S(Li , λ)) L∈Λ i,λ Label Similarity3 As examples of label similarity, we use two similarity measures: Dice measure and cosine measure. Dice measure4 4.1 SC (λ1 , λ2 ) = |λ1 ∩ λ2 | 2 |λ1 | |λ2 | = l j=1 l j=1 2|λ1 ∩λ2 | = |λ1 |+|λ2 | Cosine measure 4 SD (λ1 , λ2 ) = λ1 [j] + λ1 [j]λ2 [j] l j=1 l j=1 l j=1 λ2 [j] . λ1 [j]λ2 [j] λ1 [j] l j=1 (9) . 10) ( λ2 [j] Efﬁcient Implementation Approximation in Learning Eq. (7) contains the sum over all possible labels. As the number of topics (l) increases, this summation rapidly becomes intractable since |Λ| grows exponentially as 2l . To circumvent 3 The following discussion is easily extended to include the case that both λ1 and λ2 are empty although we do not discuss the case due to space limits. this problem, we approximate the sum over all possible labels in Eq. (7) by the partial sum λ λ over αi of |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1 and set all the other αi to zero. This approximation reduces the burden of the summation quite a lot: the number of summands is reduced from 2l to l, which is a huge reduction especially when many topics exist. λ To understand the rationale behind the approximation, ﬁrst note that αi is the dual variable λ corresponding to the ﬁrst inequality constraint (the margin constraint) in Eq. (7). Thus αi is non-zero if and only if W xi falls in the margin between φ(Li ) and φ(λ). We assume that this margin violation mainly occurs when φ(λ) is “close” to φ(Li ), i.e. |(A ∩ B c ) ∪ (Ac ∩ B)| = 1. If this assumption holds well, the proposed approximation of the sum will lead to a good approximation of the exact solution. 4.2 Polynomial Time Algorithms for Classiﬁcation The classiﬁcation of MML (Eq. (8)) involves the combinatorial maximization over all possible labels, so it can be a computationally demanding process. However, efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms are available when either the cosine measure or dice measure is used as label similarity. Eq. (8) can be divided into the subproblems by the number of topics in a label. f (x) = arg max g(x, L), (11) ˆ ˆ ˆ L∈{L1 ,L2 ,...,Ll } ˆ Ln = arg max g(x, L). (12) L∈Λ,|L|=n where g(x) is l g(x, L) cn [j]L[j], = j=1 cn [j] =      i,λ √ i,λ √ αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SD (Li ,λ)) αλ (x·xi ) i 2(1−SC (Li ,λ)) . 2Li [j] |Li |+n − 2λ[j] |λ|+n √Li [j] − √λ[j] √ √ |Li | n |λ| n if SD is used. (13) if SC is used. Here n = |L|. The computational cost of Eq. (13) for all j is O(nα l) (nα is the number of non-zero α), and that of Eq. (12) is O(l log l). Thus the total cost of the classiﬁcation by Eq. (11) is O(nα l2 + l2 log l). On the other hand, nα is O(ml) under the approximation described above. Therefore, the classiﬁcation can be done within O(ml3 ) computational steps, which is a signiﬁcant reduction from the case that the brute force search is used in Eq. (8). 5 Experiments In this section, we report experiments that compared MML to PMM [3], SVM5 [6], and BoosTexter [2] using a collection of Web pages. We used a normalized linear kernel k(x, x′ ) = x · x′ / x x′ in MML and SVM. As for BoosTexter, “real abstaining AdaBoost.MH” was used as the weak learner. 5.1 Experimental Setup The datasets used in our experiment represent the Web page collection used in [3] (Table 2). The Web pages were collected through the hyperlinks from Yahoo!’s top directory 5 For each topic, an SVM classiﬁer is trained to predict whether the topic is relevant (positive) or irrelevant (negative) to input doucments.

(R is the number of weak hypotheses.) The underlined fetures and parameters were selected for the evaluation with the test data. (www.yahoo.com), and then divided into 11 datasets by Yahoo’s top category. Each page is labeled with the Yahoo’s second level sub-categories from which the page is hyperlinked. (Thus, the sub-categories are topics in our term.) See [3] for more details about the collection. Then the Web pages were converted into three types of feature vectors: (a) Binary vectors, where each feature indicates the presence (absence) of a term by 1 (0); (b) TF vectors, where each feature is the number of appearances of a term (term frequency); and (c) TF×IDF vectors, where each feature is the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency [7]. To select the best combinations of feature types and learning parameters such as the penalty C for MML, the learners were trained on 2,000 Web pages with all combinations of feature and parameter listed in Table 3, and then were evaluated by labeling F-measure on independently drawn development data. The combinations which achieve the best labeling F-measures (underlined in Table 3) were used in the following experiments. 5.2 Evaluation Measures We used three measures to evaluate labeling performance: labeling F-measure, exact match ratio, and retrieval F-measure. In the following deﬁnitions, {Lpred }n and {Ltrue }n i=1 i i=1 i mean the predicted labels and the true labels, respectively.

MD, MC, PM, SV, and BO represent MML with SD , MML with SC , PMM, SVM and BoosTexter, respectively. Exact Match Ratio Exact match ratio EX counts only exact matches between the predicted label and the true label. EX = 1 n n I[Lpred = Ltrue ], i i (15) i=1 where I[S] is 1 if the statement S is true and 0 otherwise. Retrieval F-measure6 For real tasks, it is also important to evaluate retrieval performance, i.e. how accurately classiﬁers can ﬁnd relevant texts for a given topic. Retrieval F-measure FR measures the average retrieval performance over all topics. FR = 5.3 1 l l j=1 n pred [j]Ltrue [j] i i=1 Li . n (Lpred [j] + Ltrue [j]) i i i=1 2 (16) Results First we trained the classiﬁers with randomly chosen 2,000 samples. We then calculated the three evaluation measures for 3,000 other randomly chosen samples. This process was repeated ﬁve times, and the resulting averaged values are shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the MMLs with Dice measure outperform other methods in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. The MMLs also show the best performance with regard to retrieval Fmeasure although the margins to the other methods are not as large as observed in labeling F-measure and exact match ratio. Note that no classiﬁer except MML with Dice measure achieves good labeling on all the three measures. For example, PMM shows high labeling F-measures, but its performance is rather poor when evaluated in retrieval F-measure. As the second experiment, we evaluated the classiﬁers trained with 250–2000 training samples on the same test samples. Figure 2 shows each measure averaged over all datasets. It is observed that the MMLs show high generalization even when training data is small. An interesting point is that MML with cosine measure achieves rather high labeling F-measures and retrieval F-measure with training data of smaller size. Such high-performace, however, does not continue when trained on larger data. 6 FR is called “the macro average of F-measures” in the text categorization community. Figure 2: The learning curve of labeling F-measure (left), exact match ratio (middle) and retrieval F-measure (right). MD, MC, PM, SV, BO mean the same as in Table 4. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a novel learning algorithm for multi-topic text categorization. The algorithm, Maximal Margin Labeling, embeds labels (sets of topics) into a similarityinduced vector space, and learns a large margin classiﬁer in the space. To overcome the demanding computational cost of MML, we provide an approximation method in learning and efﬁcient classiﬁcation algorithms. In experiments on a collection of Web pages, MML outperformed other methods including SVM and showed better generalization.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-conﬁdence is larger than that required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function with the same conﬁdence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. 1</p><p>4 0.49765065 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Face_Detection_---_Efficient_and_Rank_Deficient.html">68 nips-2004-Face Detection --- Efficient and Rank Deficient</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for computing fast approximations to support vector decision functions in the ﬁeld of object detection. In the present approach we are building on an existing algorithm where the set of support vectors is replaced by a smaller, so-called reduced set of synthesized input space points. In contrast to the existing method that ﬁnds the reduced set via unconstrained optimization, we impose a structural constraint on the synthetic points such that the resulting approximations can be evaluated via separable ﬁlters. For applications that require scanning large images, this decreases the computational complexity by a signiﬁcant amount. Experimental results show that in face detection, rank deﬁcient approximations are 4 to 6 times faster than unconstrained reduced set systems. 1</p><p>5 0.49253267 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Exponentiated_Gradient_Algorithms_for_Large-margin_Structured_Classification.html">67 nips-2004-Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms for Large-margin Structured Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael Collins, Ben Taskar, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of structured classiﬁcation, where the task is to predict a label y from an input x, and y has meaningful internal structure. Our framework includes supervised training of Markov random ﬁelds and weighted context-free grammars as special cases. We describe an algorithm that solves the large-margin optimization problem deﬁned in [12], using an exponential-family (Gibbs distribution) representation of structured objects. The algorithm is efﬁcient—even in cases where the number of labels y is exponential in size—provided that certain expectations under Gibbs distributions can be calculated efﬁciently. The method for structured labels relies on a more general result, speciﬁcally the application of exponentiated gradient updates [7, 8] to quadratic programs. 1</p><p>6 0.48896644 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>

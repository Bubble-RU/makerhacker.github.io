</p><p>2 edu  Abstract This paper analyzes generalization of the classic Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning algorithm and studies their relationship to Maximum Likelihood estimation of causal parameters. [sent-4, score-0.261]
</p><p>3 We prove that the parameters of two popular causal models, ∆P and P C, can be learnt by the same generalized linear Rescorla-Wagner (GLRW) algorithm provided genericity conditions apply. [sent-5, score-0.467]
</p><p>4 We characterize the ﬁxed points of these GLRW algorithms and calculate the ﬂuctuations about them, assuming that the input is a set of i. [sent-6, score-0.06]
</p><p>5 We describe how to determine convergence conditions and calculate convergence rates for the GLRW algorithms under these conditions. [sent-10, score-0.338]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction There has recently been growing interest in models of causal learning formulated as probabilistic inference [1,2,3,4,5]. [sent-11, score-0.206]
</p><p>7 In addition, there are studies of the equilibria of the Rescorla-Wagner model [6]. [sent-13, score-0.032]
</p><p>8 In Section (2), we describe two inﬂuential models, ∆P and P C, for causal inference and how their parameters can be learnt by maximum likelihood estimation from training data. [sent-15, score-0.291]
</p><p>9 Section (3) introduces the generalized linear Rescorla-Wagner (GLRW) algorithm, characterize its ﬁxed points and quantify its ﬂuctuations. [sent-16, score-0.081]
</p><p>10 We demonstrate that a simple GLRW can estimate the ML parameters for both the ∆P and P C models provided certain genericity conditions are satisﬁed. [sent-17, score-0.171]
</p><p>11 But the experimental conditions studied by Cheng [2] require a non-linear generalization of Rescorla-Wagner (Yuille, in preparation). [sent-18, score-0.108]
</p><p>12 Section (4) gives a way to determine convergence conditions and calculate the convergence rates of GLRW algorithms. [sent-19, score-0.338]
</p><p>13 2 Causal Learning and Probabilistic Inference The task is to estimate the causal effect of variables. [sent-21, score-0.206]
</p><p>14 There is an observed event E and two causes C1 , C2 . [sent-22, score-0.135]
</p><p>15 Observers are asked to determine the causal power of the two causes. [sent-23, score-0.231]
</p><p>16 E = 1 means the event occurs, E = 0 means it does not. [sent-25, score-0.095]
</p><p>17 Much of the work in this section can be generalized to cases where there are an arbitrary number of causes C1 , C2 , . [sent-27, score-0.184]
</p><p>18 µ µ The training data {(E µ , C1 , C2 )} is assumed to be samples from an unknown distribution Pemp (E, C1 , C2 ). [sent-31, score-0.067]
</p><p>19 Two simple models, ∆P [1] and P C [2,3], have been proposed to account for how people estimate causal power. [sent-32, score-0.206]
</p><p>20 The ∆P and P C theories are equivalent to assuming probability distributions for how the training data is generated. [sent-34, score-0.036]
</p><p>21 Then the power of the causes is given by the maximum likelihood estimation of the distribution parameters ω1 , ω2 . [sent-35, score-0.18]
</p><p>22 The two theories correspond to probability distributions P∆P (E|C1 , C2 , ω1 , ω2 ) and PP C (E|C1 , C2 , ω1 , ω2 ) given by: P∆P (E = 1|C1 , C2 , ω1 , ω2 ) = ω1 C1 + ω2 C2 . [sent-36, score-0.036]
</p><p>23 The event E = 1 can be caused by C1 = 1 with probability ω1 , by C2 = 1 with probability ω2 , or caused by both. [sent-41, score-0.035]
</p><p>24 We assume that there is also a distribution on the causes P (C1 , C2 |γ) which the observers also learn from the training data. [sent-43, score-0.13]
</p><p>25 there exist parameters ) ω1 , ω2 such Pemp (E|C1 , C2 ) = P (E|C1 , C2 , ω1 , ω2 – then we can calculate the solution directly. [sent-49, score-0.039]
</p><p>26 (4)  For the PP C model, we obtain Cheng’s measures of causality [2,3]. [sent-51, score-0.057]
</p><p>27 This iterative algorithm speciﬁes an update rule for weights. [sent-54, score-0.099]
</p><p>28 Following recent work [3,6], we seek to ﬁnd relationships between generalized linear RescorlaWagner (GLRW) and ML estimation. [sent-56, score-0.06]
</p><p>29 1  GLRW and two special cases  The Rescorla-Wagner algorithm updates weights {V } using training data {E µ , C µ }. [sent-58, score-0.044]
</p><p>30 (6) In this paper, we are particularly concerned with two special cases for choice of the update ∆V . [sent-60, score-0.069]
</p><p>31 The second (8) is a variant of RW with a natural interpretation – a weight V1 is updated only if one cause is present, C1 = 1, and the other cause is absent, C2 = 0. [sent-63, score-0.123]
</p><p>32 The most general GLRW is of form: N  ∆Vit =  Vjt fij (E t , C t ) + gi (E t , C t ), ∀i,  (9)  j=1  where {fij (. [sent-64, score-0.133]
</p><p>33 , N } are functions of the data samples E µ , C µ . [sent-73, score-0.046]
</p><p>34 2  GLRW and Stochastic Samples  Our analysis assumes that the data samples {E µ , C µ )} are independent identical (i. [sent-75, score-0.046]
</p><p>35 If certain conditions are satisﬁed (see section (4), the chain will converge to a ﬁxed distribution P ∗ (V ). [sent-82, score-0.1]
</p><p>36 This distribution can be characterized by its expected mean < V >∗ = V V P ∗ (V ) and its expected covariance Σ∗ = V (V − < V >∗ )(V − < V >∗ )T P ∗ (V ). [sent-83, score-0.139]
</p><p>37 In other words, even after convergence the weights will ﬂuctuate about the expected mean < V >∗ and the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations will be given by the expected covariance. [sent-84, score-0.223]
</p><p>38 We now compute the means and covariance of the ﬁxed point distribution P ∗ (V ). [sent-87, score-0.071]
</p><p>39 We ﬁrst do this for the GLRW, equation (9), and then we restrict ourselves to the two special cases, equations (7,8). [sent-88, score-0.064]
</p><p>40 The means have a unique solution provided E,C Pemp (E, C)fij (E, C) is an invertible matrix. [sent-91, score-0.053]
</p><p>41 We derive the formula for the means V ∗ by taking the expectation of the update rule, see equations (9), with respect to P ∗ (V ) and Pemp (E, C). [sent-93, score-0.118]
</p><p>42 To calculate the covariances, we express the update rule as: Vit+1 − Vi∗ =  (Vjt − Vj∗ )Aij (E, C) + Bi (E, C), ∀i  (13)  j  with Aij (E, C) and Bi (E, C) deﬁned as above. [sent-94, score-0.143]
</p><p>43 the left hand side by (Vk − Vk )) and taking the expec∗ tation with respect to P (V ) and Pemp (E, C) (making use of the result that the expected value of Vjt − Vj∗ is zero as t → ∞. [sent-97, score-0.049]
</p><p>44 We can apply these results to study the behaviour of the two special cases, equations (7,8), when the data is generated by either the ∆P or P C model. [sent-98, score-0.024]
</p><p>45 We can use Theorem 1 to rederive the result that < V >∗ = ω [3,6], and so basic RW performs ML estimation for the P∆P model. [sent-100, score-0.071]
</p><p>46 The expected means of the ﬁxed points of the variant RW equation (8) when the data is generated by probability model PP C (E|C, ω) or P∆P (E|C; ω) are given by: V1∗ = ω1 , V2∗ = ω2 ,  (14)  provided Pemp (C) satisﬁes genericity conditions so that < C1 (1−C2 ) >< C2 (1−C1 ) >= 0. [sent-105, score-0.315]
</p><p>47 The expected covariances are given by: α1 α2 Σ11 = ω1 (1 − ω1 ) , Σ22 = ω2 (1 − ω2 ) , Σ12 = Σ21 = 0. [sent-106, score-0.102]
</p><p>48 For example, we calculate the expected value of ∆V1 and ∆V2 ﬁrst with respect to P (E|C) and then with respect to P ∗ (V ). [sent-110, score-0.088]
</p><p>49 It is perhaps surprising that the same GLRW algorithm can perform ML estimation when the data is generated by either model P∆P or PP C (and this can be generalized, see section (5)). [sent-116, score-0.032]
</p><p>50 Moreover, the expected covariance is the same for both models. [sent-117, score-0.09]
</p><p>51 Observe that the covariance decreases if we make the update coefﬁcients α1 , α2 of the algorithm small. [sent-118, score-0.086]
</p><p>52 The convergence rates are given in the next section. [sent-119, score-0.133]
</p><p>53 The non-generic cases include the situation studied in [2] where C1 is a background cause that it assumed to be always present, so < C1 >= 1. [sent-120, score-0.097]
</p><p>54 It can be shown (Yuille, in preparation) that a nonlinear generalization of RW can perform ML on this problem (but it is eay to check that no GLRW can). [sent-122, score-0.023]
</p><p>55 cause C1 always causes event E), then there is no way to estimate ω2 and Cheng’s measure of causality, equation (5), becomes undeﬁned. [sent-125, score-0.224]
</p><p>56 4 Convergence of Rescorla-Wagner We now analyze the convergence of the GLRW algorithm. [sent-126, score-0.105]
</p><p>57 We obtain conditions for the algorithm to converge and give the convergence rates. [sent-127, score-0.205]
</p><p>58 Our results are based on the following theorem for the convergence of the state vector of a stochastic iterative equation. [sent-129, score-0.24]
</p><p>59 The theorem gives necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for convergence, shows what the expected state vector converges to, and gives the rate of convergence. [sent-130, score-0.218]
</p><p>60 Let zt+1 = At zt be an iterative update equation, where z is a state vector and the update matrices At are i. [sent-132, score-0.247]
</p><p>61 The convergence properties as t → ∞ depends on < A >= A AP (A). [sent-136, score-0.105]
</p><p>62 If < A > has a unit eigenvalue with eigenvector z ∗ and the next largest eigenvalue has modulus λ < 1, then limt→∞ < zt >∝ z ∗ and the rate of convergence is et log λ . [sent-137, score-0.324]
</p><p>63 If the moduli of the eigenvalues of < A > are all less than 1, then limt→∞ < zt >= 0. [sent-138, score-0.149]
</p><p>64 If < A > has an eigenvalue with modulus greater than 1, then < zt > diverges as t → ∞. [sent-139, score-0.174]
</p><p>65 Now take the expectation of zt+1 with respect to the samples {(at , bt )}. [sent-147, score-0.164]
</p><p>66 Let the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of < A > be {(λi , ei )}. [sent-153, score-0.094]
</p><p>67 Express the initial conditions as z1 = γi ei where the {γi } are coefﬁcients. [sent-154, score-0.094]
</p><p>68 Then < zt >= i γi λt ei , and the result follows. [sent-155, score-0.145]
</p><p>69 We use Theorem 3 to obtain convergence results for the GLRW algorithm. [sent-156, score-0.105]
</p><p>70 To ensure convergence, we need both the expected covariance and the expected means to converge. [sent-157, score-0.169]
</p><p>71 (If we just require the expected means to converge, then the ﬂuctuations of the weights may be inﬁnitely large). [sent-159, score-0.099]
</p><p>72 This can be done by a suitable choice of the state vector z. [sent-160, score-0.023]
</p><p>73 The update rule is Vt+1 = at Vt + bt where at , bt are random samples. [sent-162, score-0.275]
</p><p>74 We deﬁne the state vector to be z = (Vt2 , Vt , 1). [sent-163, score-0.023]
</p><p>75 Consider the stochastic update rule Vt+1 = at Vt + bt where at and bt are samples from distributions Pa (a) and Pb (b). [sent-165, score-0.347]
</p><p>76 a  aP (a), β1 =  b  γ α2 0  β1 β2 1  b2 P (b), β2 =  , b  bP (b), and  The eigenvalues {λ} and eigenvectors {e} of < A > are: β1 (1 − α2 ) + γβ2 β2 λ1 = 1, e1 ∝ ( , , 1) (1 − α1 )(1 − α2 ) 1 − α2 γ λ2 = α1 , e2 = (1, 0, 0), λ3 = α2 , e3 ∝ ( , 1, 0). [sent-172, score-0.061]
</p><p>77 (18)  Observe that if |α2 | < 1 but α1 > 1, then < Vt > will converge but the expected variance does not. [sent-174, score-0.088]
</p><p>78 We can extend Theorem 4 to the variant of RW equation (8). [sent-176, score-0.065]
</p><p>79 The algorithm speciﬁed by equation (8) converges provided λ∗ = 2 2 max{|λ2 |, |λ3 |, |λ4 |, |λ5 |} < 1, where λ2 = 1 − (2α1 − α1 )β12 , λ3 = 1 − (2α2 − α2 )β21 , t log λ∗ λ4 = 1 − α1 β12 λ5 = 1 − α2 β21 . [sent-180, score-0.084]
</p><p>80 The expected means and covariances can be calculated from the ﬁrst eigenvector. [sent-182, score-0.155]
</p><p>81 We deﬁne the state vector z = (V12 , V22 , V1 , V2 , 1) and derive the update matrix A from equation (8). [sent-184, score-0.108]
</p><p>82 The eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be calculated (calculations omitted due to space constraints). [sent-185, score-0.084]
</p><p>83 The convergence conditions and rates follow from Theorem 3. [sent-187, score-0.194]
</p><p>84 5 Generalization The results of the previous sections can be generalized to cases where there are more than two causes. [sent-189, score-0.084]
</p><p>85 For example, we can use the generalization of the P C model to include multiple generative causes C and preventative causes L, [5] extending [2]. [sent-190, score-0.288]
</p><p>86 We assume that there is a single background cause C0 which is always on (i. [sent-192, score-0.049]
</p><p>87 Then it can be shown that the following GLRW algorithm will converge to the ML estimates of the remaining parameters {ω1 : 1 = 1, . [sent-195, score-0.039]
</p><p>88 , m} of the generalized P C model: m t ∆Vk  =  Ck {  n  i=1 m  ∆Ult  =  t (1 − Cj )}(E − ω0 − (1 − ω0 )Vk ),  (1 − Li )  Ll {  j=1:j=k n  (1 − Lk ) k=1:k=l  (1 − Cj )}(E − ω0 − ω0 Ult ),  (23)  j=1  where {Vk : k = 1, . [sent-201, score-0.06]
</p><p>89 The proof is straightforward algebra and is based on the following identity for binary variables: j (1 − Ωj Lj ) j (1 − Lj ) = j (1 − Lj ). [sent-208, score-0.025]
</p><p>90 The GLRW algorithm (23) will also perform ML estimation for data generated by other probability distributions which share the same linear terms as the generalized P C model (i. [sent-209, score-0.092]
</p><p>91 ) The convergence conditions and the convergence rates can be calculated using the techniques in section (4). [sent-212, score-0.322]
</p><p>92 These results all assume genericity conditions so that none of the generative or preventative causes is either always on or always off (i. [sent-213, score-0.313]
</p><p>93 6 Conclusion This paper introduced and studied generalized linear Rescorla-Wagner (GLRW) algorithms. [sent-216, score-0.084]
</p><p>94 We showed that two inﬂuential theories, ∆P and P C, for estimating causal effects can be implemented by the same GLRW, see (8). [sent-217, score-0.206]
</p><p>95 We obtained convergence results for GLRW including classifying the ﬁxed points, calculating the asymptotic ﬂuctuations, and the convergence rates. [sent-218, score-0.21]

<p>Author: Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Learning in a multiagent system is a challenging problem due to two key factors. First, if other agents are simultaneously learning then the environment is no longer stationary, thus undermining convergence guarantees. Second, learning is often susceptible to deception, where the other agents may be able to exploit a learner’s particular dynamics. In the worst case, this could result in poorer performance than if the agent was not learning at all. These challenges are identiﬁable in the two most common evaluation criteria for multiagent learning algorithms: convergence and regret. Algorithms focusing on convergence or regret in isolation are numerous. In this paper, we seek to address both criteria in a single algorithm by introducing GIGA-WoLF, a learning algorithm for normalform games. We prove the algorithm guarantees at most zero average regret, while demonstrating the algorithm converges in many situations of self-play. We prove convergence in a limited setting and give empirical results in a wider variety of situations. These results also suggest a third new learning criterion combining convergence and regret, which we call negative non-convergence regret (NNR). 1</p><p>4 0.053123977 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Tracking_of_Pose%2C_Expression%2C_and_Texture_using_Conditionally_Gaussian_Filters.html">91 nips-2004-Joint Tracking of Pose, Expression, and Texture using Conditionally Gaussian Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Antonio Torralba, Kevin P. Murphy, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: We seek to both detect and segment objects in images. To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efﬁcient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in ofﬁce and street scenes. 1</p><p>6 0.049540237 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Selective_Sampling_for_Linear-Threshold_Algorithms.html">206 nips-2004-Worst-Case Analysis of Selective Sampling for Linear-Threshold Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Classification algorithms typically induce population-wide models that are trained to perform well on average on expected future instances. We introduce a Bayesian framework for learning instance-specific models from data that are optimized to predict well for a particular instance. Based on this framework, we present a lazy instance-specific algorithm called ISA that performs selective model averaging over a restricted class of Bayesian networks. On experimental evaluation, this algorithm shows superior performance over model selection. We intend to apply such instance-specific algorithms to improve the performance of patient-specific predictive models induced from medical data. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n Commonly used classification algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian networks and support vector machines, typically induce a single model from a training set of instances, with the intent of applying it to all future instances. We call such a model a population-wide model because it is intended to be applied to an entire population of future instances. A population-wide model is optimized to predict well on average when applied to expected future instances. In contrast, an instance-specific model is one that is constructed specifically for a particular instance. The structure and parameters of an instance-specific model are specialized to the particular features of an instance, so that it is optimized to predict especially well for that instance. Usually, methods that induce population-wide models employ eager learning in which the model is induced from the training data before the test instance is encountered. In contrast, lazy learning defers most or all processing until a response to a test instance is required. Learners that induce instance-specific models are necessarily lazy in nature since they take advantage of the information in the test instance. An example of a lazy instance-specific method is the lazy Bayesian rule (LBR) learner, implemented by Zheng and Webb [1], which induces rules in a lazy fashion from examples in the neighborhood of the test instance. A rule generated by LBR consists of a conjunction of the attribute-value pairs present in the test instance as the antecedent and a local simple (naïve) Bayes classifier as the consequent. The structure of the local simple Bayes classifier consists of the attribute of interest as the parent of all other attributes that do not appear in the antecedent, and the parameters of the classifier are estimated from the subset of training instances that satisfy the antecedent. A greedy step-forward search selects the optimal LBR rule for a test instance to be classified. When evaluated on 29 UCI datasets, LBR had the lowest average error rate when compared to several eager learning methods [1]. Typically, both eager and lazy algorithms select a single model from some model space, ignoring the uncertainty in model selection. Bayesian model averaging is a coherent approach to dealing with the uncertainty in model selection, and it has been shown to improve the predictive performance of classifiers [2]. However, since the number of models in practically useful model spaces is enormous, exact model averaging over the entire model space is usually not feasible. In this paper, we describe a lazy instance-specific averaging (ISA) algorithm for classification that approximates Bayesian model averaging in an instance-sensitive manner. ISA extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging to an instance-specific model selection algorithm. While the ISA algorithm is currently able to directly handle only discrete variables and is computationally more intensive than comparable eager algorithms, the results in this paper show that it performs well. In medicine, such lazy instance-specific algorithms can be applied to patient-specific modeling for improving the accuracy of diagnosis, prognosis and risk assessment. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces a Bayesian framework for instance-specific learning. Section 3 describes the implementation of ISA. In Section 4, we evaluate ISA and compare its performance to that of LBR. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the results of the comparison. 2 Deci si on Th eo ret i c F rame wo rk We use the following notation. Capital letters like X, Z, denote random variables and corresponding lower case letters, x, z, denote specific values assigned to them. Thus, X = x denotes that variable X is assigned the value x. Bold upper case letters, such as X, Z, represent sets of variables or random vectors and their realization is denoted by the corresponding bold lower case letters, x, z. Hence, X = x denotes that the variables in X have the states given by x. In addition, Z denotes the target variable being predicted, X denotes the set of attribute variables, M denotes a model, D denotes the training dataset, and   denotes a generic test instance that is not in D. We now characterize population-wide and instance-specific model selection in decision theoretic terms. Given training data D and a separate generic test instance , the Bayes optimal prediction for Zt is obtained by combining the predictions of all models weighted by their posterior probabilities, as follows: P (Z t | X t , D ) = ∫ P( Z t | X t , M ) P ( M | D )dM . (1) M The optimal population-wide model for predicting Zt is as follows:   max∑ U P( Z t | X t , D), P (Z t | X t , M ) P ( X | D) , M  Xt  [ ] (2) where the function U gives the utility of approximating the Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt , D), with the estimate P(Zt | Xt , M) obtained from model M. The term P(X | D) is given by: P ( X | D) = ∫ P ( X | M ) P ( M | D)dM . (3) M The optimal instance-specific model for predicting Zt is as follows: { [ ]} max U P ( Z t | X t = x t , D), P (Z t | X t = x t , M ) , M (4) where xt are the values of the attributes of the test instance Xt for which we want to predict Zt. The Bayes optimal estimate P(Zt | Xt = xt, D), in Equation 4 is derived using Equation 1, for the special case in which Xt = xt . The difference between the population-wide and the instance-specific models can be noted by comparing Equations 2 and 4. Equation 2 for the population-wide model selects the model that on average will have the greatest utility. Equation 4 for the instance-specific model, however, selects the model that will have the greatest expected utility for the specific instance Xt = xt . For predicting Zt in a given instance Xt = xt, the model selected using Equation 2 can never have an expected utility greater than the model selected using Equation 4. This observation provides support for developing instance-specific models. Equations 2 and 4 represent theoretical ideals for population-wide and instancespecific model selection, respectively; we are not suggesting they are practical to compute. The current paper focuses on model averaging, rather than model selection. Ideal Bayesian model averaging is given by Equation 1. Model averaging has previously been applied using population-wide models. Studies have shown that approximate Bayesian model averaging using population-wide models can improve predictive performance over population-wide model selection [2]. The current paper concentrates on investigating the predictive performance of approximate Bayesian model averaging using instance-specific models. 3 In st an ce- S p eci fi c Algo ri t h m We present the implementation of the lazy instance-specific algorithm based on the above framework. ISA searches the space of a restricted class of Bayesian networks to select a subset of the models over which to derive a weighted (averaged) posterior of the target variable Zt . A key characteristic of the search is the use of a heuristic to select models that will have a significant influence on the weighted posterior. We introduce Bayesian networks briefly and then describe ISA in detail. 3.1 B ay e s i a n N e t w or k s A Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that combines a graphical representation (the Bayesian network structure) with quantitative information (the parameters of the Bayesian network) to represent the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables [3]. Specifically, a Bayesian network M representing the set of variables X consists of a pair (G, ΘG ). G is a directed acyclic graph that contains a node for every variable in X and an arc between every pair of nodes if the corresponding variables are directly probabilistically dependent. Conversely, the absence of an arc between a pair of nodes denotes probabilistic independence between the corresponding variables. ΘG represents the parameterization of the model. In a Bayesian network M, the immediate predecessors of a node X i in X are called the parents of X i and the successors, both immediate and remote, of Xi in X are called the descendants of X i . The immediate successors of X i are called the children of X i . For each node Xi there is a local probability distribution (that may be discrete or continuous) on that node given the state of its parents. The complete joint probability distribution over X, represented by the parameterization ΘG, can be factored into a product of local probability distributions defined on each node in the network. This factorization is determined by the independences captured by the structure of the Bayesian network and is formalized in the Bayesian network Markov condition: A node (representing a variable) is independent of its nondescendants given just its parents. According to this Markov condition, the joint probability distribution on model variables X = (X1 , X 2, …, X n ) can be factored as follows: n P ( X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) = ∏ P ( X i | parents( X i )) , (5) i =1 where parents(Xi ) denotes the set of nodes that are the parents of X i . If Xi has no parents, then the set parents(Xi ) is empty and P(Xi | parents(X i)) is just P(Xi ). 3.2 I S A M od e l s The LBR models of Zheng and Webb [1] can be represented as members of a restricted class of Bayesian networks (see Figure 1). We use the same class of Bayesian networks for the ISA models, to facilitate comparison between the two algorithms. In Figure 1, all nodes represent attributes that are discrete. Each node in X has either an outgoing arc into target node, Z, or receives an arc from Z. That is, each node is either a parent or a child of Z. Thus, X is partitioned into two sets: the first containing nodes (X 1 , …, X j in Figure 1) each of which is a parent of Z and every node in the second set, and the second containing nodes (X j+1 , …, X k in Figure 1) that have as parents the node Z and every node in the first set. The nodes in the first set are instantiated to the corresponding values in the test instance for which Zt is to be predicted. Thus, the first set of nodes represents the antecedent of the LBR rule and the second set of nodes represents the consequent. ... X1= x1 Xi = xi Z Xi+1 ... Xk Figure 1: An example of a Bayesian network LBR model with target node Z and k attribute nodes of which X1 , …, X j are instantiated to values x 1 , …, x j in xt . X 1, …, X j are present in the antecedent of the LBR rule and Z, X j+1 , …, X k (that form the local simple Bayes classifier) are present in the consequent. The indices need not be ordered as shown, but are presented in this example for convenience of exposition. 3.3 M od e l A ve r ag i n g For Bayesian networks, Equation 1 can be evaluated as follows: P ( Z t | x t , D ) = ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( M | D ) , (6) M with M being a Bayesian network comprised of structure G and parameters ΘG. The probability distribution of interest is a weighted average of the posterior distribution over all possible Bayesian networks where the weight is the probability of the Bayesian network given the data. Since exhaustive enumeration of all possible models is not feasible, even for this class of simple Bayesian networks, we approximate exact model averaging with selective model averaging. Let R be the set of models selected by the search procedure from all possible models in the model space, as described in the next section. Then, with selective model averaging, P(Zt | xt, D) is estimated as: ∑RP( Z t | x t , M ) P(M | D) P (Z t | x t , D) ≅ M ∈ . ∑RP(M | D) M∈ (7) Assuming uniform prior belief over all possible models, the model posterior P(M | D) in Equation 7 can be replaced by the marginal likelihood P(D | M), to obtain the following equation: P ( Z | x , D) ≅ t t ∑ P ( Z t | x t , M ) P( D | M ) . ∑RP( D | M ) M∈ M ∈R (8) The (unconditional) marginal likelihood P(D | M) in Equation 8, is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model to the data and is also known as the model score. While this score is suitable for assessing the model’s fit to the joint probability distribution, it is not necessarily appropriate for assessing the goodness of fit to a conditional probability distribution which is the focus in prediction and classification tasks, as is the case here. A more suitable score in this situation is a conditional model score that is computed from training data D of d instances as: d score( D, M ) = ∏ P ( z p | x1 ,..., x p ,z 1 ,...,z p −1 ,M ) . (9) p =1 This score is computed in a predictive and sequential fashion: for the pth training instance the probability of predicting the observed value zp for the target variable is computed based on the values of all the variables in the preceding p-1 training instances and the values xp of the attributes in the pth instance. One limitation of this score is that its value depends on the ordering of the data. Despite this limitation, it has been shown to be an effective scoring criterion for classification models [4]. The parameters of the Bayesian network M, used in the above computations, are defined as follows: P ( X i = k | parents ( X i ) = j ) ≡ θ ijk = N ijk + α ijk N ij + α ij , (10) where (i) Nijk is the number of instances in the training dataset D where variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, (ii) N ij = ∑k N ijk , (iii) αijk is a parameter prior that can be interpreted as the belief equivalent of having previously observed αijk instances in which variable Xi has value k and the parents of X i are in state j, and (iv) α ij = ∑k α ijk . 3.4 M od e l Se a r c h We use a two-phase best-first heuristic search to sample the model space. The first phase ignores the evidence xt in the test instance while searching for models that have high scores as given by Equation 9. This is followed by the second phase that searches for models having the greatest impact on the prediction of Zt for the test instance, which we formalize below. The first phase searches for models that predict Z in the training data very well; these are the models that have high conditional model scores. The initial model is the simple Bayes network that includes all the attributes in X as children of Z. A succeeding model is derived from a current model by reversing the arc of a child node in the current model, adding new outgoing arcs from it to Z and the remaining children, and instantiating this node to the value in the test instance. This process is performed for each child in the current model. An incoming arc of a child node is considered for reversal only if the node’s value is not missing in the test instance. The newly derived models are added to a priority queue, Q. During each iteration of the search, the model with the highest score (given by Equation 9) is removed from Q and placed in a set R, following which new models are generated as described just above, scored and added to Q. The first phase terminates after a user-specified number of models have accumulated in R. The second phase searches for models that change the current model-averaged estimate of P(Zt | xt , D) the most. The idea here is to find viable competing models for making this posterior probability prediction. When no competitive models can be found, the prediction becomes stable. During each iteration of the search, the highest ranked model M* is removed from Q and added to R. The ranking is based on how much the model changes the current estimate of P(Zt | xt , D). More change is better. In particular, M* is the model in Q that maximizes the following function: f ( R, M *) = g ( R) − g ( R U {M *}) , (11) where for a set of models S, the function g(S) computes the approximate model averaged prediction for Zt, as follows: g (S ) = ∑ P(Z M ∈S t | x t , M ) score( D, M ) ∑ score( D, M ) ∈ . (12) M S The second phase terminates when no new model can be found that has a value (as given by Equation 11) that is greater than a user-specified minimum threshold T. The final distribution of Zt is then computed from the models in R using Equation 8. 4 Ev a lu a t i o n We evaluated ISA on the 29 UCI datasets that Zheng and Webb used for the evaluation of LBR. On the same datasets, we also evaluated a simple Bayes classifier (SB) and LBR. For SB and LBR, we used the Weka implementations (Weka v3.3.6, http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) with default settings [5]. We implemented the ISA algorithm as a standalone application in Java. The following settings were used for ISA: a maximum of 100 phase-1 models, a threshold T of 0.001 in phase-2, and an upper limit of 500 models in R. For the parameter priors in Equation 10, all αijk were set to 1. All error rates were obtained by averaging the results from two stratified 10-fold cross-validation (20 trials total) similar to that used by Zheng and Webb. Since, both LBR and ISA can handle only discrete attributes, all numeric attributes were discretized in a pre-processing step using the entropy based discretization method described in [6]. For each pair of training and test folds, the discretization intervals were first estimated from the training fold and then applied to both folds. The error rates of two algorithms on a dataset were compared with a paired t-test carried out at the 5% significance level on the error rate statistics obtained from the 20 trials. The results are shown in Table 1. Compared to SB, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 9 datasets and significantly more errors on one dataset. Compared to LBR, ISA has significantly fewer errors on 7 datasets and significantly more errors on two datasets. On two datasets, chess and tic-tac-toe, ISA shows considerable improvement in performance over both SB and LBR. With respect to computation Table 1: Percent error rates of simple Bayes (SB), Lazy Bayesian Rule (LBR) and Instance-Specific Averaging (ISA). A - indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly lower than the marked SB or LBR error rate. A + indicates that the ISA error rate is statistically significantly higher.

An instance-specific algorithm like LBR that does model selection has been shown by Zheng and Webb to perform classification better than several eager algorithms [1]. Our results show that ISA, which extends LBR by adding Bayesian model averaging, improves overall on LBR, which provides support that we can obtain additional prediction improvement by performing instance-specific model averaging rather than just instance-specific model selection. In future work, we plan to explore further the behavior of ISA with respect to the number of models being averaged and the effect of the number of models selected in each of the two phases of the search. We will also investigate methods to improve the computational efficiency of ISA. In addition, we plan to examine other heuristics for model search as well as more general model spaces such as unrestricted Bayesian networks. The instance-specific framework is not restricted to the Bayesian network models that we have used in this investigation. In the future, we plan to explore other models using this framework. Our ultimate interest is to apply these instancespecific algorithms to improve patient-specific predictions (for diagnosis, therapy selection, and prognosis) and thereby to improve patient care.

Indeed, considering the square loss, we translate the learning problem in the language of regularization theory and show that consistency results and optimal regularization parameter choice can be derived by the discretization of the corresponding inverse problem. 1</p><p>6 0.35898948 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Convergence_and_No-Regret_in_Multiagent_Learning.html">48 nips-2004-Convergence and No-Regret in Multiagent Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: This paper analyzes generalization of the classic Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning algorithm and studies their relationship to Maximum Likelihood estimation of causal parameters. We prove that the parameters of two popular causal models, ∆P and P C, can be learnt by the same generalized linear Rescorla-Wagner (GLRW) algorithm provided genericity conditions apply. We characterize the ﬁxed points of these GLRW algorithms and calculate the ﬂuctuations about them, assuming that the input is a set of i.i.d. samples from a ﬁxed (unknown) distribution. We describe how to determine convergence conditions and calculate convergence rates for the GLRW algorithms under these conditions.</p><p>2 0.63362175 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Efficient_Auditory_Codes_Using_Spikes_Predicts_Cochlear_Filters.html">97 nips-2004-Learning Efficient Auditory Codes Using Spikes Predicts Cochlear Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan C. Smith, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: The representation of acoustic signals at the cochlear nerve must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require exquisite sensitivity in both time and frequency. Lewicki (2002) demonstrated that many of the ﬁltering properties of the cochlea could be explained in terms of efﬁcient coding of natural sounds. This model, however, did not account for properties such as phase-locking or how sound could be encoded in terms of action potentials. Here, we extend this theoretical approach with algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a spiking population code. Here, we propose an algorithm for learning efﬁcient auditory codes using a theoretical model for coding sound in terms of spikes. In this model, each spike encodes the precise time position and magnitude of a localized, time varying kernel function. By adapting the kernel functions to the statistics natural sounds, we show that, compared to conventional signal representations, the spike code achieves far greater coding efﬁciency. Furthermore, the inferred kernels show both striking similarities to measured cochlear ﬁlters and a similar bandwidth versus frequency dependence. 1</p><p>3 0.62765467 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Co-Training_and_Expansion%3A_Towards_Bridging_Theory_and_Practice.html">37 nips-2004-Co-Training and Expansion: Towards Bridging Theory and Practice</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria-florina Balcan, Avrim Blum, Ke Yang</p><p>Abstract: Co-training is a method for combining labeled and unlabeled data when examples can be thought of as containing two distinct sets of features. It has had a number of practical successes, yet previous theoretical analyses have needed very strong assumptions on the data that are unlikely to be satisﬁed in practice. In this paper, we propose a much weaker “expansion” assumption on the underlying data distribution, that we prove is sufﬁcient for iterative cotraining to succeed given appropriately strong PAC-learning algorithms on each feature set, and that to some extent is necessary as well. This expansion assumption in fact motivates the iterative nature of the original co-training algorithm, unlike stronger assumptions (such as independence given the label) that allow a simpler one-shot co-training to succeed. We also heuristically analyze the effect on performance of noise in the data. Predicted behavior is qualitatively matched in synthetic experiments on expander graphs. 1</p><p>4 0.62614447 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Breaking_SVM_Complexity_with_Cross-Training.html">34 nips-2004-Breaking SVM Complexity with Cross-Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Léon Bottou, Jason Weston, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: We propose to selectively remove examples from the training set using probabilistic estimates related to editing algorithms (Devijver and Kittler, 1982). This heuristic procedure aims at creating a separable distribution of training examples with minimal impact on the position of the decision boundary. It breaks the linear dependency between the number of SVs and the number of training examples, and sharply reduces the complexity of SVMs during both the training and prediction stages. 1</p><p>5 0.61188966 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-The_Convergence_of_Contrastive_Divergences.html">185 nips-2004-The Convergence of Contrastive Divergences</a></p>

We relate the algorithm to the stochastic approximation literature. This enables us to specify conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution (with probability 1).

<p>Author: Jan E. Solem, Fredrik Kahl</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of geometrical surface reconstruction from one or several images using learned shape models. While humans can effortlessly retrieve 3D shape information, this inverse problem has turned out to be difﬁcult to perform automatically. We introduce a framework based on level set surface reconstruction and shape models for achieving this goal. Through this merging, we obtain an efﬁcient and robust method for reconstructing surfaces of an object category of interest. The shape model includes surface cues such as point, curve and silhouette features. Based on ideas from Active Shape Models, we show how both the geometry and the appearance of these features can be modelled consistently in a multi-view context. The complete surface is obtained by evolving a level set driven by a PDE, which tries to ﬁt the surface to the inferred 3D features. In addition, an a priori 3D surface model is used to regularize the solution, in particular, where surface features are sparse. Experiments are demonstrated on a database of real face images.</p><p>3 0.2106739 <a title="92-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-The_Correlated_Correspondence_Algorithm_for_Unsupervised_Registration_of_Nonrigid_Surfaces.html">186 nips-2004-The Correlated Correspondence Algorithm for Unsupervised Registration of Nonrigid Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Dragomir Anguelov, Praveen Srinivasan, Hoi-cheung Pang, Daphne Koller, Sebastian Thrun, James Davis</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised algorithm for registering 3D surface scans of an object undergoing signiﬁcant deformations. Our algorithm does not need markers, nor does it assume prior knowledge about object shape, the dynamics of its deformation, or scan alignment. The algorithm registers two meshes by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over all point-topoint correspondences between them. This model enforces preservation of local mesh geometry, as well as more global constraints that capture the preservation of geodesic distance between corresponding point pairs. The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically ﬁll in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different conﬁguration. We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of signiﬁcant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. Finally, we show that the output of the algorithm can be used for compelling computer graphics tasks such as interpolation between two scans of a non-rigid object and automatic recovery of articulated object models. 1</p><p>4 0.19430183 <a title="92-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Breaking_SVM_Complexity_with_Cross-Training.html">34 nips-2004-Breaking SVM Complexity with Cross-Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Léon Bottou, Jason Weston, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: We propose to selectively remove examples from the training set using probabilistic estimates related to editing algorithms (Devijver and Kittler, 1982). This heuristic procedure aims at creating a separable distribution of training examples with minimal impact on the position of the decision boundary. It breaks the linear dependency between the number of SVs and the number of training examples, and sharply reduces the complexity of SVMs during both the training and prediction stages. 1</p><p>5 0.18489954 <a title="92-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Outlier_Detection_with_One-class_Kernel_Fisher_Discriminants.html">142 nips-2004-Outlier Detection with One-class Kernel Fisher Discriminants</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Roth</p><p>Abstract: The problem of detecting “atypical objects” or “outliers” is one of the classical topics in (robust) statistics. Recently, it has been proposed to address this problem by means of one-class SVM classiﬁers. The main conceptual shortcoming of most one-class approaches, however, is that in a strict sense they are unable to detect outliers, since the expected fraction of outliers has to be speciﬁed in advance. The method presented in this paper overcomes this problem by relating kernelized one-class classiﬁcation to Gaussian density estimation in the induced feature space. Having established this relation, it is possible to identify “atypical objects” by quantifying their deviations from the Gaussian model. For RBF kernels it is shown that the Gaussian model is “rich enough” in the sense that it asymptotically provides an unbiased estimator for the true density. In order to overcome the inherent model selection problem, a cross-validated likelihood criterion for selecting all free model parameters is applied. 1</p><p>6 0.16606157 <a title="92-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-The_Entire_Regularization_Path_for_the_Support_Vector_Machine.html">187 nips-2004-The Entire Regularization Path for the Support Vector Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: On-line learning with a simple square loss and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to symmetric linear constraints. The updates generalize the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive deﬁnite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the analysis of each algorithm generalizes to the non-diagonal case. We apply both new algorithms, called the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost, to learn a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>3 0.887402 <a title="92-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Information_Regularization_on_Graphs.html">54 nips-2004-Distributed Information Regularization on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Corduneanu, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We provide a principle for semi-supervised learning based on optimizing the rate of communicating labels for unlabeled points with side information. The side information is expressed in terms of identities of sets of points or regions with the purpose of biasing the labels in each region to be the same. The resulting regularization objective is convex, has a unique solution, and the solution can be found with a pair of local propagation operations on graphs induced by the regions. We analyze the properties of the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on document classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.88674074 <a title="92-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Kernel_Methods_for_Implicit_Surface_Modeling.html">92 nips-2004-Kernel Methods for Implicit Surface Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Tamara L. Berg, Alexander C. Berg, Jaety Edwards, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: The context in which a name appears in a caption provides powerful cues as to who is depicted in the associated image. We obtain 44,773 face images, using a face detector, from approximately half a million captioned news images and automatically link names, obtained using a named entity recognizer, with these faces. A simple clustering method can produce fair results. We improve these results signiﬁcantly by combining the clustering process with a model of the probability that an individual is depicted given its context. Once the labeling procedure is over, we have an accurately labeled set of faces, an appearance model for each individual depicted, and a natural language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation. 1</p><p>3 0.15344121 <a title="182-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Face_Detection_---_Efficient_and_Rank_Deficient.html">68 nips-2004-Face Detection --- Efficient and Rank Deficient</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for computing fast approximations to support vector decision functions in the ﬁeld of object detection. In the present approach we are building on an existing algorithm where the set of support vectors is replaced by a smaller, so-called reduced set of synthesized input space points. In contrast to the existing method that ﬁnds the reduced set via unconstrained optimization, we impose a structural constraint on the synthetic points such that the resulting approximations can be evaluated via separable ﬁlters. For applications that require scanning large images, this decreases the computational complexity by a signiﬁcant amount. Experimental results show that in face detection, rank deﬁcient approximations are 4 to 6 times faster than unconstrained reduced set systems. 1</p><p>4 0.12231103 <a title="182-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-The_power_of_feature_clustering%3A_An_application_to_object_detection.html">192 nips-2004-The power of feature clustering: An application to object detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: We give a fast rejection scheme that is based on image segments and demonstrate it on the canonical example of face detection. However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classiﬁers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classiﬁers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classiﬁer. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable. 1</p><p>5 0.12165798 <a title="182-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Common-Frame_Model_for_Object_Recognition.html">40 nips-2004-Common-Frame Model for Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moreels, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A generative probabilistic model for objects in images is presented. An object consists of a constellation of features. Feature appearance and pose are modeled probabilistically. Scene images are generated by drawing a set of objects from a given database, with random clutter sprinkled on the remaining image surface. Occlusion is allowed. We study the case where features from the same object share a common reference frame. Moreover, parameters for shape and appearance densities are shared across features. This is to be contrasted with previous work on probabilistic ‘constellation’ models where features depend on each other, and each feature and model have different pose and appearance statistics [1, 2]. These two differences allow us to build models containing hundreds of features, as well as to train each model from a single example. Our model may also be thought of as a probabilistic revisitation of Lowe’s model [3, 4]. We propose an efﬁcient entropy-minimization inference algorithm that constructs the best interpretation of a scene as a collection of objects and clutter. We test our ideas with experiments on two image databases. We compare with Lowe’s algorithm and demonstrate better performance, in particular in presence of large amounts of background clutter.</p><p>6 0.11509794 <a title="182-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Non-Local_Manifold_Tangent_Learning.html">131 nips-2004-Non-Local Manifold Tangent Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Williams, Andrew Blake, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the past decade in the development of object classiﬁers for images, for example of faces, humans and vehicles. Here we address the problem of contaminations (e.g. occlusion, shadows) in test images which have not explicitly been encountered in training data. The Variational Ising Classiﬁer (VIC) algorithm models contamination as a mask (a ﬁeld of binary variables) with a strong spatial coherence prior. Variational inference is used to marginalize over contamination and obtain robust classiﬁcation. In this way the VIC approach can turn a kernel classiﬁer for clean data into one that can tolerate contamination, without any speciﬁc training on contaminated positives. 1</p><p>5 0.50790215 <a title="182-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Face_Detection_---_Efficient_and_Rank_Deficient.html">68 nips-2004-Face Detection --- Efficient and Rank Deficient</a></p>

<p>Author: Max Welling, Michal Rosen-zvi, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Directed graphical models with one layer of observed random variables and one or more layers of hidden random variables have been the dominant modelling paradigm in many research ﬁelds. Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difﬁcult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these “exponential family harmoniums” is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords.</p><p>2 0.80107534 <a title="182-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Seeing_through_water.html">160 nips-2004-Seeing through water</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexei Efros, Volkan Isler, Jianbo Shi, Mirkó Visontai</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an underwater image distorted by surface waves. A large amount of video data of the distorted image is acquired. The problem is posed in terms of ﬁnding an undistorted image patch at each spatial location. This challenging reconstruction task can be formulated as a manifold learning problem, such that the center of the manifold is the image of the undistorted patch. To compute the center, we present a new technique to estimate global distances on the manifold. Our technique achieves robustness through convex ﬂow computations and solves the “leakage” problem inherent in recent manifold embedding techniques. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77736467 <a title="182-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a probabilistic model for online document clustering. We use non-parametric Dirichlet process prior to model the growing number of clusters, and use a prior of general English language model as the base distribution to handle the generation of novel clusters. Furthermore, cluster uncertainty is modeled with a Bayesian Dirichletmultinomial distribution. We use empirical Bayes method to estimate hyperparameters based on a historical dataset. Our probabilistic model is applied to the novelty detection task in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) and compared with existing approaches in the literature. 1</p><p>5 0.6472351 <a title="182-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Alignment_of_Continuous_Time_Series.html">124 nips-2004-Multiple Alignment of Continuous Time Series</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Andrew Emili</p><p>Abstract: Multiple realizations of continuous-valued time series from a stochastic process often contain systematic variations in rate and amplitude. To leverage the information contained in such noisy replicate sets, we need to align them in an appropriate way (for example, to allow the data to be properly combined by adaptive averaging). We present the Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data. 1 A Proﬁle Model for Continuous Data When observing multiple time series generated by a noisy, stochastic process, large systematic sources of variability are often present. For example, within a set of nominally replicate time series, the time axes can be variously shifted, compressed and expanded, in complex, non-linear ways. Additionally, in some circumstances, the scale of the measured data can vary systematically from one replicate to the next, and even within a given replicate. We propose a Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) for simultaneously analyzing a set of such time series. In this model, each time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single latent trace. The latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series. Output time series are generated from this model by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as in an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a particular location in the latent trace, and the emitted value from the state depends on the value of the latent trace at that position. To account for changes in the amplitude of the signals across and within replicates, the latent time states are augmented by a set of scale states, which control how the emission signal will be scaled relative to the value of the latent trace. During training, the latent trace is learned, as well as the transition probabilities controlling the Markovian evolution of the scale and time states and the overall noise level of the observed data. After training, the latent trace learned by the model represents a higher resolution ’fusion’ of the experimental replicates. Figure 1 illustrate the model in action.

The 1 2 N temporal sampling rate within each xk need not be uniform, nor must it be the same across the different xk . Constraints on the variability of the sampling rate are discussed at the end of this section. For notational convenience, we henceforth assume N k = N for all k, but this is not a requirement of the model. The CPM is set up as follows: We assume that there is a latent trace, z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ), a canonical representation of the set of noisy input replicate time series. Any given observed time series in the set is modeled as a non-uniformly subsampled version of the latent trace to which local scale transformations have been applied. Ideally, M would be inﬁnite, or at least very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent trace is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made effectively to speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. The subsampling and local scaling used during the generation of each observed time series are determined by a sequence of hidden state variables. Let the state sequence for observation k be π k . Each state in the state sequence maps to a time state/scale state pair: k πi → {τik , φk }. Time states belong to the integer set (1..M ); scale states belong to an i ordered set (φ1 ..φQ ). (In our experiments we have used Q=7, evenly spaced scales in k logarithmic space). States, πi , and observation values, xk , are related by the emission i k probability distribution: Aπi (xk |z) ≡ p(xk |πi , z, σ, uk ) ≡ N (xk ; zτik φk uk , σ), where σ k i i i i is the noise level of the observed data, N (a; b, c) denotes a Gaussian probability density for a with mean b and standard deviation c. The uk are real-valued scale parameters, one per observed time series, that correct for any overall scale difference between time series k and the latent trace. To fully specify our model we also need to deﬁne the state transition probabilities. We deﬁne the transitions between time states and between scale states separately, so that k Tπi−1 ,πi ≡ p(πi |πi−1 ) = p(φi |φi−1 )pk (τi |τi−1 ). The constraint that time must move forward, cannot stand still, and that it can jump ahead no more than Jτ time states is enforced. (In our experiments we used Jτ = 3.) As well, we only allow scale state transitions between neighbouring scale states so that the local scale cannot jump arbitrarily. These constraints keep the number of legal transitions to a tractable computational size and work well in practice. Each observed time series has its own time transition probability distribution to account for experiment-speciﬁc patterns. Both the time and scale transition probability distributions are given by multinomials:  dk , if a − b = 1  1  k  d2 , if a − b = 2   k . p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = . .  k d , if a − b = J  τ  Jτ  0, otherwise p(φi = a|φi−1  s0 , if D(a, b) = 0   s1 , if D(a, b) = 1 = b) =  s1 , if D(a, b) = −1  0, otherwise where D(a, b) = 1 means that a is one scale state larger than b, and D(a, b) = −1 means that a is one scale state smaller than b, and D(a, b) = 0 means that a = b. The distributions Jτ are constrained by: i=1 dk = 1 and 2s1 + s0 = 1. i Jτ determines the maximum allowable instantaneous speedup of one portion of a time series relative to another portion, within the same series or across different series. However, the length of time for which any series can move so rapidly is constrained by the length of the latent trace; thus the maximum overall ratio in speeds achievable by the model between any two entire time series is given by min(Jτ , M ). N After training, one may examine either the latent trace or the alignment of each observable time series to the latent trace. Such alignments can be achieved by several methods, including use of the Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the highest likelihood path through the hidden states [1], or sampling from the posterior over hidden state sequences. We found Viterbi alignments to work well in the experiments below; samples from the posterior looked quite similar. 3 Training with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm As with HMMs, training with the EM algorithm (often referred to as Baum-Welch in the context of HMMs [1]), is a natural choice. In our model the E-Step is computed exactly using the Forward-Backward algorithm [1], which provides the posterior probability over k states for each time point of every observed time series, γs (i) ≡ p(πi = s|x) and also the pairwise state posteriors, ξs,t (i) ≡ p(πi−1 = s, πi = t|xk ). The algorithm is modiﬁed only in that the emission probabilities depend on the latent trace as described in Section 2. The M-Step consists of a series of analytical updates to the various parameters as detailed below. Given the latent trace (and the emission and state transition probabilities), the complete log likelihood of K observed time series, xk , is given by Lp ≡ L + P. L is the likelihood term arising in a (conditional) HMM model, and can be obtained from the Forward-Backward algorithm. It is composed of the emission and state transition terms. P is the log prior (or penalty term), regularizing various aspects of the model parameters as explained below. These two terms are: K N N L≡ log Aπi (xk |z) + i log p(π1 ) + τ −1 K (zj+1 − zj )2 + P ≡ −λ (1) i=2 i=1 k=1 k log Tπi−1 ,πi j=1 k log D(dk |{ηv }) + log D(sv |{ηv }), v (2) k=1 where p(π1 ) are priors over the initial states. The ﬁrst term in Equation 2 is a smoothing k penalty on the latent trace, with λ controlling the amount of smoothing. ηv and ηv are Dirichlet hyperprior parameters for the time and scale state transition probability distributions respectively. These ensure that all non-zero transition probabilities remain non-zero. k For the time state transitions, v ∈ {1, Jτ } and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for k the parameters d1 , d2 . . . dJτ . For the scale state transitions, v ∈ {0, 1} and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for the parameters s0 and s1 . Letting S be the total number of possible states, that is, the number of elements in the cross-product of possible time states and possible scale states, the expected complete log likelihood is: K S K p k k γs (1) log T0,s</p><p>6 0.6419301 <a title="182-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_by_Entropy_Minimization.html">164 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization</a></p>

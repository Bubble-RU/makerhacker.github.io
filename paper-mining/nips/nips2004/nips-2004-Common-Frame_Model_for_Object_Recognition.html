<p>Author: Ariadna Quattoni, Michael Collins, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition of object classes from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as ﬂexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a uniﬁed framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by ﬁnding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes.</p><p>3 0.14200655 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Hyper-Features_for_Visual_Identification.html">99 nips-2004-Learning Hyper-Features for Visual Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Andras D. Ferencz, Erik G. Learned-miller, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of identifying speciﬁc instances of a class (cars) from a set of images all belonging to that class. Although we cannot build a model for any particular instance (as we may be provided with only one “training” example of it), we can use information extracted from observing other members of the class. We pose this task as a learning problem, in which the learner is given image pairs, labeled as matching or not, and must discover which image features are most consistent for matching instances and discriminative for mismatches. We explore a patch based representation, where we model the distributions of similarity measurements deﬁned on the patches. Finally, we describe an algorithm that selects the most salient patches based on a mutual information criterion. This algorithm performs identiﬁcation well for our challenging dataset of car images, after matching only a few, well chosen patches. 1</p><p>4 0.14169699 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Clustering_of_a_Mixture_Model.html">77 nips-2004-Hierarchical Clustering of a Mixture Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an eﬃcient algorithm for reducing a large mixture of Gaussians into a smaller mixture while still preserving the component structure of the original model; this is achieved by clustering (grouping) the components. The method minimizes a new, easily computed distance measure between two Gaussian mixtures that can be motivated from a suitable stochastic model and the iterations of the algorithm use only the model parameters, avoiding the need for explicit resampling of datapoints. We demonstrate the method by performing hierarchical clustering of scenery images and handwritten digits. 1</p><p>5 0.13048851 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Contextual_Models_for_Object_Detection_Using_Boosted_Random_Fields.html">47 nips-2004-Contextual Models for Object Detection Using Boosted Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba, Kevin P. Murphy, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: We seek to both detect and segment objects in images. To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efﬁcient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in ofﬁce and street scenes. 1</p><p>6 0.12717818 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Analysis_of_a_greedy_active_learning_strategy.html">23 nips-2004-Analysis of a greedy active learning strategy</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: We give a fast rejection scheme that is based on image segments and demonstrate it on the canonical example of face detection. However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classiﬁers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classiﬁers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classiﬁer. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable. 1</p><p>4 0.64599442 <a title="40-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Hyper-Features_for_Visual_Identification.html">99 nips-2004-Learning Hyper-Features for Visual Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>4 0.68118995 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>5 0.68031561 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Spike_Sorting%3A_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Non-Stationary_Data.html">174 nips-2004-Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Aharon Bar-hillel, Adam Spiro, Eran Stark</p><p>Abstract: Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron. It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework. At a ﬁrst search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame. At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model. Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The method was applied to several recordings. The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters. 1</p><p>6 0.67999268 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Three_Tiered_Approach_for_Articulated_Object_Action_Modeling_and_Recognition.html">13 nips-2004-A Three Tiered Approach for Articulated Object Action Modeling and Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Pascal Poupart, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Existing algorithms for discrete partially observable Markov decision processes can at best solve problems of a few thousand states due to two important sources of intractability: the curse of dimensionality and the policy space complexity. This paper describes a new algorithm (VDCBPI) that mitigates both sources of intractability by combining the Value Directed Compression (VDC) technique [13] with Bounded Policy Iteration (BPI) [14]. The scalability of VDCBPI is demonstrated on synthetic network management problems with up to 33 million states.</p><p>3 0.14081657 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Information_Extraction.html">162 nips-2004-Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Information Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Sunita Sarawagi, William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe semi-Markov conditional random ﬁelds (semi-CRFs), a conditionally trained version of semi-Markov chains. Intuitively, a semiCRF on an input sequence x outputs a “segmentation” of x, in which labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x. Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time—often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on ﬁve named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs. 1</p><p>4 0.13542461 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Markov_Networks_for_Detecting_Overalpping_Elements_in_Sequence_Data.html">108 nips-2004-Markov Networks for Detecting Overalpping Elements in Sequence Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Craven, Joseph Bockhorst</p><p>Abstract: Many sequential prediction tasks involve locating instances of patterns in sequences. Generative probabilistic language models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), have been successfully applied to many of these tasks. A limitation of these models however, is that they cannot naturally handle cases in which pattern instances overlap in arbitrary ways. We present an alternative approach, based on conditional Markov networks, that can naturally represent arbitrarily overlapping elements. We show how to eﬃciently train and perform inference with these models. Experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on HMMs. 1</p><p>5 0.12258685 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation_Tradeoffs_for_Experts_Algorithms_in_Reactive_Environments.html">65 nips-2004-Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoffs for Experts Algorithms in Reactive Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Nimrod Megiddo</p><p>Abstract: A reactive environment is one that responds to the actions of an agent rather than evolving obliviously. In reactive environments, experts algorithms must balance exploration and exploitation of experts more carefully than in oblivious ones. In addition, a more subtle deﬁnition of a learnable value of an expert is required. A general exploration-exploitation experts method is presented along with a proper deﬁnition of value. The method is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best available expert. Several variants are analyzed from the viewpoint of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, including explore-then-exploit, polynomially vanishing exploration, constant-frequency exploration, and constant-size exploration phases. Complexity and performance bounds are proven. 1</p><p>6 0.10991357 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Collaborative_Prediction_with_Low-Rank_Matrices.html">71 nips-2004-Generalization Error Bounds for Collaborative Prediction with Low-Rank Matrices</a></p>

<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Andrew Zisserman, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm to overcome the local maxima problem in estimating the parameters of mixture models. It combines existing approaches from both EM and a robust ﬁtting algorithm, RANSAC, to give a data-driven stochastic learning scheme. Minimal subsets of data points, sufﬁcient to constrain the parameters of the model, are drawn from proposal densities to discover new regions of high likelihood. The proposal densities are learnt using EM and bias the sampling toward promising solutions. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, as well as effective at escaping from local maxima. We compare it with alternative methods, including EM and RANSAC, on both challenging synthetic data and the computer vision problem of alpha-matting. 1</p><p>3 0.9844768 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Message_Errors_in_Belief_Propagation.html">116 nips-2004-Message Errors in Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether from quantization or other simpliﬁed message representations or from stochastic approximation methods. Introducing such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to adversely affect the solution obtained. We analyze this effect with respect to a particular measure of message error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This leads both to convergence conditions and error bounds in traditional and approximate BP message passing. 1</p><p>4 0.98430151 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-A_Direct_Formulation_for_Sparse_PCA_Using_Semidefinite_Programming.html">2 nips-2004-A Direct Formulation for Sparse PCA Using Semidefinite Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandre D'aspremont, Laurent E. Ghaoui, Michael I. Jordan, Gert R. Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: We examine the problem of approximating, in the Frobenius-norm sense, a positive, semideﬁnite symmetric matrix by a rank-one matrix, with an upper bound on the cardinality of its eigenvector. The problem arises in the decomposition of a covariance matrix into sparse factors, and has wide applications ranging from biology to ﬁnance. We use a modiﬁcation of the classical variational representation of the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix, where cardinality is constrained, and derive a semideﬁnite programming based relaxation for our problem. 1</p><p>5 0.98267794 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-A_Cost-Shaping_LP_for_Bellman_Error_Minimization_with_Performance_Guarantees.html">1 nips-2004-A Cost-Shaping LP for Bellman Error Minimization with Performance Guarantees</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm based on linear programming that approximates the diﬀerential value function of an average-cost Markov decision process via a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions. The algorithm carries out a form of cost shaping and minimizes a version of Bellman error. We establish an error bound that scales gracefully with the number of states without imposing the (strong) Lyapunov condition required by its counterpart in [6]. We propose a path-following method that automates selection of important algorithm parameters which represent counterparts to the “state-relevance weights” studied in [6]. 1</p><p>6 0.97103715 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Neighbourhood_Components_Analysis.html">127 nips-2004-Neighbourhood Components Analysis</a></p>

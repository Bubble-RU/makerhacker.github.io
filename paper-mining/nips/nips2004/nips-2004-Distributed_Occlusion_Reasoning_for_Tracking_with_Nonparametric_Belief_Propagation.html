<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether from quantization or other simpliﬁed message representations or from stochastic approximation methods. Introducing such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to adversely affect the solution obtained. We analyze this effect with respect to a particular measure of message error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This leads both to convergence conditions and error bounds in traditional and approximate BP message passing. 1</p><p>3 0.18470991 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Incremental_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">83 nips-2004-Incremental Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Jongwoo Lim, David A. Ross, Ruei-sung Lin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing tracking algorithms construct a representation of a target object prior to the tracking task starts, and utilize invariant features to handle appearance variation of the target caused by lighting, pose, and view angle change. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient and effective online algorithm that incrementally learns and adapts a low dimensional eigenspace representation to reﬂect appearance changes of the target, thereby facilitating the tracking task. Furthermore, our incremental method correctly updates the sample mean and the eigenbasis, whereas existing incremental subspace update methods ignore the fact the sample mean varies over time. The tracking problem is formulated as a state inference problem within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and a particle ﬁlter is incorporated for propagating sample distributions over time. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large pose and lighting changes. 1</p><p>4 0.13186291 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty.html">178 nips-2004-Support Vector Classification with Input Data Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinbo Bi, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new learning model in which the input data is corrupted with noise. We present a general statistical framework to tackle this problem. Based on the statistical reasoning, we propose a novel formulation of support vector classiﬁcation, which allows uncertainty in input data. We derive an intuitive geometric interpretation of the proposed formulation, and develop algorithms to efﬁciently solve it. Empirical results are included to show that the newly formed method is superior to the standard SVM for problems with noisy input. 1</p><p>5 0.13060087 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>6 0.12969512 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Generative_Affine_Localisation_and_Tracking.html">73 nips-2004-Generative Affine Localisation and Tracking</a></p>

Using a probabilistic graphical model allows us to incorporate local information and global smoothness constraints in a principled manner. We evaluate our model on a set of varied and difﬁcult examples, and achieve impressive results. By using a fast dual-tree algorithm for graphical model inference, our system runs in less time than the duration of the music being processed. 1</p><p>3 0.61795825 <a title="55-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Generative_Affine_Localisation_and_Tracking.html">73 nips-2004-Generative Affine Localisation and Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: John Winn, Andrew Blake</p><p>Abstract: We present an extension to the Jojic and Frey (2001) layered sprite model which allows for layers to undergo afﬁne transformations. This extension allows for afﬁne object pose to be inferred whilst simultaneously learning the object shape and appearance. Learning is carried out by applying an augmented variational inference algorithm which includes a global search over a discretised transform space followed by a local optimisation. To aid correct convergence, we use bottom-up cues to restrict the space of possible afﬁne transformations. We present results on a number of video sequences and show how the model can be extended to track an object whose appearance changes throughout the sequence. 1</p><p>4 0.57470125 <a title="55-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Incremental_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">83 nips-2004-Incremental Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: We give a fast rejection scheme that is based on image segments and demonstrate it on the canonical example of face detection. However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classiﬁers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classiﬁers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classiﬁer. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable. 1</p><p>3 0.76983315 <a title="55-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Limits_of_Spectral_Clustering.html">103 nips-2004-Limits of Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike V. Luxburg, Olivier Bousquet, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: An important aspect of clustering algorithms is whether the partitions constructed on ﬁnite samples converge to a useful clustering of the whole data space as the sample size increases. This paper investigates this question for normalized and unnormalized versions of the popular spectral clustering algorithm. Surprisingly, the convergence of unnormalized spectral clustering is more difﬁcult to handle than the normalized case. Even though recently some ﬁrst results on the convergence of normalized spectral clustering have been obtained, for the unnormalized case we have to develop a completely new approach combining tools from numerical integration, spectral and perturbation theory, and probability. It turns out that while in the normalized case, spectral clustering usually converges to a nice partition of the data space, in the unnormalized case the same only holds under strong additional assumptions which are not always satisﬁed. We conclude that our analysis gives strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering. It also provides a basis for future exploration of other Laplacian-based methods. 1</p><p>4 0.76912957 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_first-order_Markov_models_for_control.html">102 nips-2004-Learning first-order Markov models for control</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: First-order Markov models have been successfully applied to many problems, for example in modeling sequential data using Markov chains, and modeling control problems using the Markov decision processes (MDP) formalism. If a ﬁrst-order Markov model’s parameters are estimated from data, the standard maximum likelihood estimator considers only the ﬁrst-order (single-step) transitions. But for many problems, the ﬁrstorder conditional independence assumptions are not satisﬁed, and as a result the higher order transition probabilities may be poorly approximated. Motivated by the problem of learning an MDP’s parameters for control, we propose an algorithm for learning a ﬁrst-order Markov model that explicitly takes into account higher order interactions during training. Our algorithm uses an optimization criterion different from maximum likelihood, and allows us to learn models that capture longer range effects, but without giving up the beneﬁts of using ﬁrst-order Markov models. Our experimental results also show the new algorithm outperforming conventional maximum likelihood estimation in a number of control problems where the MDP’s parameters are estimated from data. 1</p><p>5 0.76865143 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_by_Entropy_Minimization.html">164 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We consider the semi-supervised learning problem, where a decision rule is to be learned from labeled and unlabeled data. In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution beneﬁts from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are deﬁnitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspeciﬁed, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the “cluster assumption”. Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces. 1</p><p>6 0.76784825 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Outlier_Detection_with_One-class_Kernel_Fisher_Discriminants.html">142 nips-2004-Outlier Detection with One-class Kernel Fisher Discriminants</a></p>

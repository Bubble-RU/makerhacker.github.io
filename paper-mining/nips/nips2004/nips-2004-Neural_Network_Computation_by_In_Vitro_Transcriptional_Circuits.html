<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, Yee W. Teh, Roger Bock, Michael Maire, Grace Vesom, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method that can make a scanned, handwritten mediaeval latin manuscript accessible to full text search. A generalized HMM is ﬁtted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data. 1. Intoduction There are many large corpora of handwritten scanned documents, and their number is growing rapidly. Collections range from the complete works of Mark Twain to thousands of pages of zoological notes spanning two centuries. Large scale analyses of such corpora is currently very difﬁcult, because handwriting recognition works poorly. Recently, Rath and Manmatha have demonstrated that one can use small bodies of aligned material as supervised data to train a word spotting mechanism [7]. The result can make scanned handwritten documents searchable. Current techniques assume a closed vocabulary — one can search only for words in the training set — and search for instances of whole words. This approach is particularly unattractive for an inﬂected language, because individual words can take so many forms that one is unlikely to see all in the training set. Furthermore, one would like the method used to require very little aligned training data, so that it is possible to process documents written by different scribes with little overhead. Mediaeval Latin manuscripts are a natural ﬁrst corpus for studying this problem, because there are many scanned manuscripts and because the handwriting is relatively regular. We expect the primary user need to be search over a large body of documents — to allow comparisons between documents — rather than transcription of a particular document (which is usually relatively easy to do by hand). Desirable features for a system are: First, that it use little or no aligned training data (an ideal, which we believe may be attainable, is an unsupervised learning system). Second, that one can search the document for an arbitrary string (rather than, say, only complete words that appear in the training data). This would allow a user to determine whether a document contains curious or distinctive spellings, for example (ﬁgure 7). We show that, using a statistical model based on a generalized HMM, we can search a medieval manuscript with considerable accuracy, using only one instance each of each letter in the manuscript to train the method (22 instances in total; Latin has no j, k, w, or z). Furthermore, our method allows fairly accurate transcription of the manuscript. We train our system on 22 glyphs taken from a a 12th century latin manuscript of Terence’s Comedies (obtained from a repository of over 80 scanned medieval works maintained by Oxford University [1]). We evaluate searches using a considerable portion of this manuscript aligned by hand; we then show that fair search results are available on a different manuscript (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]) without change of letter templates. 1.1. Previous Work Handwriting recognition is a traditional problem, too well studied to review in detail here (see [6]). Typically, online handwriting recognition (where strokes can be recorded) works better than ofﬂine handwriting recognition. Handwritten digits can now be recognized with high accuracy [2, 5]. Handwritten amounts can be read with fair accuracy, which is signiﬁcantly improved if one segments the amount into digits at the same time as one recognizes it [4, 5]. Recently several authors have proposed new techniques for search and translation in this unrestricted setting. Manmatha et al [7] introduce the technique of “word spotting,” which segments text into word images, rectiﬁes the word images, and then uses an aligned training set to learn correspondences between rectiﬁed word images and strings. The method is not suitable for a heavily inﬂected language, because words take so many forms. In an inﬂected language, the natural unit to match to is a subset of a word, rather than a whole word, implying that one should segment the text into blocks — which may be smaller than words — while recognizing. Vinciarelli et al [8] introduce a method for line by line recognition based around an HMM and quite similar to techniques used in the speech recognition community. Their method uses a window that slides along the text to obtain features; this has the difﬁculty that the same window is in some places too small (and so uninformative) and in others too big (and so spans more than one letter, and is confusing). Their method requires a substantial body of aligned training data, which makes it impractical for our applications. Close in spirit to our work is the approach to machine translation of Koehn and Knight [3]. They demonstrate that the statistics of unaligned corpora may provide as powerful constraints for training models as aligned bitexts. 2. The Model Our models for both search and transcription are based on the generalized HMM and differ only in their choice of transition model. In an HMM, each hidden node ct emits a single evidence node xt . In a generalized HMM, we allow each ct to emit a series of x’s whose length is itself a random variable. In our model, the hidden nodes correspond to letters and each xt is a single column of pixels. Allowing letters to emit sets of columns lets us accomodate letter templates of variable width. In particular, this means that we can unify segmenting ink into letters and recognizing blocks of ink; ﬁgure 3 shows an example of how useful this is. 2.1. Generating a line of text Our hidden state consists of a character label c, width w and vertical position y. The statespace of c contains the characters ‘a’-‘z’, a space ‘ ’, and a special end state Ω. Let T c be the template associated with character c, Tch , Tcw be respectively the height and width of that template, and m be the height of the image. Figure 1: Left, a full page of our manuscript, a 12’th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies obtained from [1]. Top right, a set of lines from a page from that document and bottom right, some words in higher resolution. Note: (a) the richness of page layout; (b) the clear spacing of the lines; (c) the relatively regular handwriting. Figure 2: Left, the 22 instances, one per letter, used to train our emission model. These templates are extracted by hand from the Terence document. Right, the ﬁve image channels for a single letter. Beginning at image column 1 (and assuming a dummy space before the ﬁrst character), • • • • choose character c ∼ p(c|c−1...−n ) (an n-gram letter model) choose length w ∼ Uniform(Tcw − k, Tcw + k) (for some small k) choose vertical position y ∼ Uniform(1, m − Tch ) z,y and Tch now deﬁne a bounding box b of pixels. Let i and j be indexed from the top left of that bounding box. – draw pixel (i, j) ∼ N (Tcij , σcij ) for each pixel in b – draw all pixels above and below b from background gaussian N (µ0 , σ0 ) (See 2.2 for greater detail on pixel emission model) • move to column w + 1 and repeat until we enter the end state Ω. Inference on a gHMM is a relatively straighforward business of dynamic programming. We have used unigram, bigram and trigram models, with each transition model ﬁtted using an electronic version of Caesar’s Gallic Wars, obtained from http://www.thelatinlibrary.com. We do not believe that the choice of author should signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁtted transition model — which is at the level of characters — but have not experimented with this point. The important matter is the emission model. 2.2. The Emission Model Our emission model is as follows: Given the character c and width w, we generate a template of the required length. Each pixel in this template becomes the mean of a gaussian which generates the corresponding pixel in the image. This template has a separate mean image for each pixel channel. The channels are assumed independent given the means. We train the model by cutting out by hand a single instance of each letter from our corpus (ﬁgure 2). This forms the central portion of the template. Pixels above and below this Model Perfect transcription unigram bigram trigram matching chars 21019 14603 15572 15788 substitutions 0 5487 4597 4410 insertions 0 534 541 507 deletions 0 773 718 695 Table 1: Edit distance between our transcribed Terence and the editor’s version. Note the trigram model produces signiﬁcantly fewer letter errors than the unigram model, but that the error rate is still a substantial 25%. central box are generated from a single gaussian used to model background pixels (basically white pixels). We add a third variable yt to our hidden state indicating the vertical position of the central box. However, since we are uninterested in actually recovering this variable, during inference we sum it out of the model. The width of a character is constrained to be close to the width (tw ) of our hand cut example by setting p(w|c) = 0 for w < tw − k and w > tw + k. Here k is a small, user deﬁned integer. Within this range, p(w|c) is distributed uniformly, larger templates are created by appending pixels from the background model to the template and smaller ones by simply removing the right k-most columns of the hand cut example. For features, we generate ﬁve image representations, shown in ﬁgure 2. The ﬁrst is a grayscale version of the original color image. The second and third are generated by convolving the grayscale image with a vertical derivative of gaussian ﬁlter, separating the positive and negative components of this response, and smoothing each of these gradient images separately. The fourth and ﬁfth are generated similarly but with a horizontal derivative of gaussian ﬁlter. We have experimented with different weightings of these 5 channels. In practice we use the gray scale channel and the horizontal gradient channels. We emphasize the horizontal pieces since these seem the more discriminative. 2.3. Transcription For transcription, we model letters as coming from an n-gram language model, with no dependencies between words. Thus, the probability of a letter depends on the k letters before it, where k = n unless this would cross a word boundary in which case the history terminates at this boundary. We chose not to model word to word transition probabilities since, unlike in English, word order in Latin is highly arbitrary. This transition model is ﬁt from a corpus of ascii encoded latin. We have experimented with unigram (i.e. uniform transition probabilities), bigram and trigram letter models. We can perform transcription by ﬁtting the maximum likelihood path through any given line. Some results of this technique are shown in ﬁgure 3. 2.4. Search For search, we rank lines by the probability that they contain our search word. We set up a ﬁnite state machine like that in ﬁgure 4. In this ﬁgure, ‘bg’ represents our background model for that portion of the line not generated by our search word. We can use any of the n-gram letter models described for transcription as the transition model for ‘bg’. The probability that the line contains the search word is the probability that this FSM takes path 1. We use this FSM as the transition model for our gHMM, and output the posterior probability of the two arrows leading into the end state. 1 and 2 are user deﬁned weights, but in practice the algorithm does not appear to be particular sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The results presented here use the unigram model.

Below, we show the line as segmented and transcribed by unigram, bigram and trigram models; the unigram and bigram models transcribe one word as “vemo”, but the stronger trigram model forces the two letters to be segmented and correctly transcribes the word as “venio”, illustrating the considerable beneﬁt to be obtained by segmenting only at recognition time. 1 − ε1 Path 1 1 − ε2 a b bg ε1 Ω bg Path 2 ε2 Figure 4: The ﬁnite state machine to search for the word ‘ab.’ ‘bg’ is a place holder for the larger ﬁnite state machine deﬁned by our language model’s transition matrix. 3. Results Figure 1 shows a page from our collection. This is a scanned 12th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies, obtained from the collection at [1]. In preprocessing, we extract individual lines of text by rotating the image to various degrees and projecting the sum of the pixel values onto the y-axis. We choose the orientation whose projection vector has the lowest entropy, and then segment lines by cutting at minima of this projection. Transcription is not our primary task, but methods that produce good transcriptions are going to support good searches. The gHMM can produce a surprisingly good transcription, given how little training data is used to train the emission model. We aligned an editors version of Terence with 25 pages from the manuscript by hand, and computed the edit distance between the transcribed text and the aligned text; as table 1 indicates, approximately 75% of letters are read correctly. Search results are strong. We show results for two documents. The ﬁrst set of results refers to the edition of Terence’s Comedies, from which we took the 22 letter instances. In particular, for any given search term, our process ranks the complete set of lines. We used a hand alignment of the manuscript to determine which lines contained each term; ﬁgure 5 shows an overview of searches performed using every word that appears in the 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 5: Our search ranks 587 manuscript lines, with higher ranking lines more likely to contain the relevant term. This ﬁgure shows complete search results for each term that appears more than three times in the 587 lines. Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. All 587 lines are represented. More common terms are represented by lower rows. More detailed results appear in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6; this summary ﬁgure suggests almost all searches are highly successful. document more than three times, in particular, showing which of the ranked set of lines actually contained the search term. For almost every search, the term appears mainly in the lines with higher rank. Figure 6 contains more detailed information for a smaller set of words. We do not score the position of a word in a line (for practical reasons). Figure 7 demonstrates (a) that our search respects the ink of the document and (b) that for the Terence document, word positions are accurately estimated. The spelling of mediaeval documents is typically cleaned up by editors; in our manuscript, the scribe reliably spells “michi” for the standard “mihi”. A search on “michi” produces many instances; a search on “mihi” produces none, because the ink doesn’t have any. Notice this phenomenon also in the bottom right line of ﬁgure 7, the scribe writes “habet, ut consumat nunc cum nichil obsint doli” and the editor gives “habet, ut consumat nunc quom nil obsint doli.” Figure 8 shows that searches on short strings produce many words containing that string as one would wish. 4. Discussion We have shown that it is possible to make at least some handwritten mediaeval manuscripts accessible to full text search, without requiring an aligned text or much supervisory data. Our documents have very regular letters, and letter frequencies — which can be obtained from transcribed Latin — appear to provide so powerful a cue that relatively little detailed information about letter shapes is required. Linking letter segmentation and recognition has thoroughly beneﬁcial effects. This suggests that the pool of manuscripts that can be made accessible in this way is large. In particular, we have used our method, trained on 22 instances of letters from one document, to search another document. Figure 9 shows the results from two searches of our second document (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]). No information from this document was used in training at all; but letter 1tu arbitror pater etiam nisi factum primum siet vero illi inter hic michi ibi qui tu ibi michi 0.9 0.8 0.7 qui hic 0.6 inter 0.5 illi 0.4 siet 0.3 vero 0.2 nisi 0.1 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 6: On the left, search results for selected words (indicated on the leftmost column). Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. Note only the top 300 results are represented, and that lines containing the search term are almost always at or close to the top of the search results (black marks to the left). On the right, we plot precision against recall for a set of different words by taking the top 10, 20, ... lines returned from the search, and checking them against the aligned manuscript. Note that, once all cases have been found, if the size of the pool is increased the precision will fall with 100% recall; many words work well, with most of the ﬁrst 20 or so lines returned containing the search term. shapes are sufﬁciently well shared that the search is still useful. All this suggests that one might be able to use EM to link three processes: one that clusters to determine letter shapes; one that segments letters; and one that imposes a language model. Such a system might be able to make handwritten Latin searchable with no training data. References [1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>4 0.083181448 <a title="128-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Identifying_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Sites_on_a_Genome-Wide_Scale.html">80 nips-2004-Identifying Protein-Protein Interaction Sites on a Genome-Wide Scale</a></p>
<p>Author: Haidong Wang, Eran Segal, Asa Ben-Hur, Daphne Koller, Douglas L. Brutlag</p><p>Abstract: Protein interactions typically arise from a physical interaction of one or more small sites on the surface of the two proteins. Identifying these sites is very important for drug and protein design. In this paper, we propose a computational method based on probabilistic relational model that attempts to address this task using high-throughput protein interaction data and a set of short sequence motifs. We learn the model using the EM algorithm, with a branch-and-bound algorithm as an approximate inference for the E-step. Our method searches for motifs whose presence in a pair of interacting proteins can explain their observed interaction. It also tries to determine which motif pairs have high afﬁnity, and can therefore lead to an interaction. We show that our method is more accurate than others at predicting new protein-protein interactions. More importantly, by examining solved structures of protein complexes, we ﬁnd that 2/3 of the predicted active motifs correspond to actual interaction sites. 1</p><p>5 0.079862967 <a title="128-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Supervised_Graph_Inference.html">177 nips-2004-Supervised Graph Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Jongmin Kim, John Hopfield, Erik Winfree</p><p>Abstract: The structural similarity of neural networks and genetic regulatory networks to digital circuits, and hence to each other, was noted from the very beginning of their study [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components. 1</p><p>2 0.49044332 <a title="128-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Alternative_Splicing_Events_in_Microarray_Data.html">149 nips-2004-Probabilistic Inference of Alternative Splicing Events in Microarray Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Shai, Brendan J. Frey, Quaid D. Morris, Qun Pan, Christine Misquitta, Benjamin J. Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS. Boxes represent exons and lines represent introns, with the possible splicing alternatives indicated by the connectors. (a) Single cassette exon inclusion/exclusion. C1 and C2 are constitutive exons (exons that are included in all isoforms) and ﬂank a single alternative exon (A). The alternative exon is included in one isoform and excluded in the other. (b) Alternative 3’ (or donor) and alternative 5’ (acceptor) splicing sites. Both exons are constitutive, but may contain alternative donor and/or acceptor splicing sites.

An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

The AS model presented assumes a single weight matrix for all data cases. This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, Yee W. Teh, Roger Bock, Michael Maire, Grace Vesom, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method that can make a scanned, handwritten mediaeval latin manuscript accessible to full text search. A generalized HMM is ﬁtted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data. 1. Intoduction There are many large corpora of handwritten scanned documents, and their number is growing rapidly. Collections range from the complete works of Mark Twain to thousands of pages of zoological notes spanning two centuries. Large scale analyses of such corpora is currently very difﬁcult, because handwriting recognition works poorly. Recently, Rath and Manmatha have demonstrated that one can use small bodies of aligned material as supervised data to train a word spotting mechanism [7]. The result can make scanned handwritten documents searchable. Current techniques assume a closed vocabulary — one can search only for words in the training set — and search for instances of whole words. This approach is particularly unattractive for an inﬂected language, because individual words can take so many forms that one is unlikely to see all in the training set. Furthermore, one would like the method used to require very little aligned training data, so that it is possible to process documents written by different scribes with little overhead. Mediaeval Latin manuscripts are a natural ﬁrst corpus for studying this problem, because there are many scanned manuscripts and because the handwriting is relatively regular. We expect the primary user need to be search over a large body of documents — to allow comparisons between documents — rather than transcription of a particular document (which is usually relatively easy to do by hand). Desirable features for a system are: First, that it use little or no aligned training data (an ideal, which we believe may be attainable, is an unsupervised learning system). Second, that one can search the document for an arbitrary string (rather than, say, only complete words that appear in the training data). This would allow a user to determine whether a document contains curious or distinctive spellings, for example (ﬁgure 7). We show that, using a statistical model based on a generalized HMM, we can search a medieval manuscript with considerable accuracy, using only one instance each of each letter in the manuscript to train the method (22 instances in total; Latin has no j, k, w, or z). Furthermore, our method allows fairly accurate transcription of the manuscript. We train our system on 22 glyphs taken from a a 12th century latin manuscript of Terence’s Comedies (obtained from a repository of over 80 scanned medieval works maintained by Oxford University [1]). We evaluate searches using a considerable portion of this manuscript aligned by hand; we then show that fair search results are available on a different manuscript (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]) without change of letter templates. 1.1. Previous Work Handwriting recognition is a traditional problem, too well studied to review in detail here (see [6]). Typically, online handwriting recognition (where strokes can be recorded) works better than ofﬂine handwriting recognition. Handwritten digits can now be recognized with high accuracy [2, 5]. Handwritten amounts can be read with fair accuracy, which is signiﬁcantly improved if one segments the amount into digits at the same time as one recognizes it [4, 5]. Recently several authors have proposed new techniques for search and translation in this unrestricted setting. Manmatha et al [7] introduce the technique of “word spotting,” which segments text into word images, rectiﬁes the word images, and then uses an aligned training set to learn correspondences between rectiﬁed word images and strings. The method is not suitable for a heavily inﬂected language, because words take so many forms. In an inﬂected language, the natural unit to match to is a subset of a word, rather than a whole word, implying that one should segment the text into blocks — which may be smaller than words — while recognizing. Vinciarelli et al [8] introduce a method for line by line recognition based around an HMM and quite similar to techniques used in the speech recognition community. Their method uses a window that slides along the text to obtain features; this has the difﬁculty that the same window is in some places too small (and so uninformative) and in others too big (and so spans more than one letter, and is confusing). Their method requires a substantial body of aligned training data, which makes it impractical for our applications. Close in spirit to our work is the approach to machine translation of Koehn and Knight [3]. They demonstrate that the statistics of unaligned corpora may provide as powerful constraints for training models as aligned bitexts. 2. The Model Our models for both search and transcription are based on the generalized HMM and differ only in their choice of transition model. In an HMM, each hidden node ct emits a single evidence node xt . In a generalized HMM, we allow each ct to emit a series of x’s whose length is itself a random variable. In our model, the hidden nodes correspond to letters and each xt is a single column of pixels. Allowing letters to emit sets of columns lets us accomodate letter templates of variable width. In particular, this means that we can unify segmenting ink into letters and recognizing blocks of ink; ﬁgure 3 shows an example of how useful this is. 2.1. Generating a line of text Our hidden state consists of a character label c, width w and vertical position y. The statespace of c contains the characters ‘a’-‘z’, a space ‘ ’, and a special end state Ω. Let T c be the template associated with character c, Tch , Tcw be respectively the height and width of that template, and m be the height of the image. Figure 1: Left, a full page of our manuscript, a 12’th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies obtained from [1]. Top right, a set of lines from a page from that document and bottom right, some words in higher resolution. Note: (a) the richness of page layout; (b) the clear spacing of the lines; (c) the relatively regular handwriting. Figure 2: Left, the 22 instances, one per letter, used to train our emission model. These templates are extracted by hand from the Terence document. Right, the ﬁve image channels for a single letter. Beginning at image column 1 (and assuming a dummy space before the ﬁrst character), • • • • choose character c ∼ p(c|c−1...−n ) (an n-gram letter model) choose length w ∼ Uniform(Tcw − k, Tcw + k) (for some small k) choose vertical position y ∼ Uniform(1, m − Tch ) z,y and Tch now deﬁne a bounding box b of pixels. Let i and j be indexed from the top left of that bounding box. – draw pixel (i, j) ∼ N (Tcij , σcij ) for each pixel in b – draw all pixels above and below b from background gaussian N (µ0 , σ0 ) (See 2.2 for greater detail on pixel emission model) • move to column w + 1 and repeat until we enter the end state Ω. Inference on a gHMM is a relatively straighforward business of dynamic programming. We have used unigram, bigram and trigram models, with each transition model ﬁtted using an electronic version of Caesar’s Gallic Wars, obtained from http://www.thelatinlibrary.com. We do not believe that the choice of author should signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁtted transition model — which is at the level of characters — but have not experimented with this point. The important matter is the emission model. 2.2. The Emission Model Our emission model is as follows: Given the character c and width w, we generate a template of the required length. Each pixel in this template becomes the mean of a gaussian which generates the corresponding pixel in the image. This template has a separate mean image for each pixel channel. The channels are assumed independent given the means. We train the model by cutting out by hand a single instance of each letter from our corpus (ﬁgure 2). This forms the central portion of the template. Pixels above and below this Model Perfect transcription unigram bigram trigram matching chars 21019 14603 15572 15788 substitutions 0 5487 4597 4410 insertions 0 534 541 507 deletions 0 773 718 695 Table 1: Edit distance between our transcribed Terence and the editor’s version. Note the trigram model produces signiﬁcantly fewer letter errors than the unigram model, but that the error rate is still a substantial 25%. central box are generated from a single gaussian used to model background pixels (basically white pixels). We add a third variable yt to our hidden state indicating the vertical position of the central box. However, since we are uninterested in actually recovering this variable, during inference we sum it out of the model. The width of a character is constrained to be close to the width (tw ) of our hand cut example by setting p(w|c) = 0 for w < tw − k and w > tw + k. Here k is a small, user deﬁned integer. Within this range, p(w|c) is distributed uniformly, larger templates are created by appending pixels from the background model to the template and smaller ones by simply removing the right k-most columns of the hand cut example. For features, we generate ﬁve image representations, shown in ﬁgure 2. The ﬁrst is a grayscale version of the original color image. The second and third are generated by convolving the grayscale image with a vertical derivative of gaussian ﬁlter, separating the positive and negative components of this response, and smoothing each of these gradient images separately. The fourth and ﬁfth are generated similarly but with a horizontal derivative of gaussian ﬁlter. We have experimented with different weightings of these 5 channels. In practice we use the gray scale channel and the horizontal gradient channels. We emphasize the horizontal pieces since these seem the more discriminative. 2.3. Transcription For transcription, we model letters as coming from an n-gram language model, with no dependencies between words. Thus, the probability of a letter depends on the k letters before it, where k = n unless this would cross a word boundary in which case the history terminates at this boundary. We chose not to model word to word transition probabilities since, unlike in English, word order in Latin is highly arbitrary. This transition model is ﬁt from a corpus of ascii encoded latin. We have experimented with unigram (i.e. uniform transition probabilities), bigram and trigram letter models. We can perform transcription by ﬁtting the maximum likelihood path through any given line. Some results of this technique are shown in ﬁgure 3. 2.4. Search For search, we rank lines by the probability that they contain our search word. We set up a ﬁnite state machine like that in ﬁgure 4. In this ﬁgure, ‘bg’ represents our background model for that portion of the line not generated by our search word. We can use any of the n-gram letter models described for transcription as the transition model for ‘bg’. The probability that the line contains the search word is the probability that this FSM takes path 1. We use this FSM as the transition model for our gHMM, and output the posterior probability of the two arrows leading into the end state. 1 and 2 are user deﬁned weights, but in practice the algorithm does not appear to be particular sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The results presented here use the unigram model.

Results Figure 1 shows a page from our collection. This is a scanned 12th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies, obtained from the collection at [1]. In preprocessing, we extract individual lines of text by rotating the image to various degrees and projecting the sum of the pixel values onto the y-axis. We choose the orientation whose projection vector has the lowest entropy, and then segment lines by cutting at minima of this projection. Transcription is not our primary task, but methods that produce good transcriptions are going to support good searches. The gHMM can produce a surprisingly good transcription, given how little training data is used to train the emission model. We aligned an editors version of Terence with 25 pages from the manuscript by hand, and computed the edit distance between the transcribed text and the aligned text; as table 1 indicates, approximately 75% of letters are read correctly. Search results are strong. We show results for two documents. The ﬁrst set of results refers to the edition of Terence’s Comedies, from which we took the 22 letter instances. In particular, for any given search term, our process ranks the complete set of lines. We used a hand alignment of the manuscript to determine which lines contained each term; ﬁgure 5 shows an overview of searches performed using every word that appears in the 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 5: Our search ranks 587 manuscript lines, with higher ranking lines more likely to contain the relevant term. This ﬁgure shows complete search results for each term that appears more than three times in the 587 lines. Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. All 587 lines are represented. More common terms are represented by lower rows. More detailed results appear in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6; this summary ﬁgure suggests almost all searches are highly successful. document more than three times, in particular, showing which of the ranked set of lines actually contained the search term. For almost every search, the term appears mainly in the lines with higher rank. Figure 6 contains more detailed information for a smaller set of words. We do not score the position of a word in a line (for practical reasons). Figure 7 demonstrates (a) that our search respects the ink of the document and (b) that for the Terence document, word positions are accurately estimated. The spelling of mediaeval documents is typically cleaned up by editors; in our manuscript, the scribe reliably spells “michi” for the standard “mihi”. A search on “michi” produces many instances; a search on “mihi” produces none, because the ink doesn’t have any. Notice this phenomenon also in the bottom right line of ﬁgure 7, the scribe writes “habet, ut consumat nunc cum nichil obsint doli” and the editor gives “habet, ut consumat nunc quom nil obsint doli.” Figure 8 shows that searches on short strings produce many words containing that string as one would wish. 4. Discussion We have shown that it is possible to make at least some handwritten mediaeval manuscripts accessible to full text search, without requiring an aligned text or much supervisory data. Our documents have very regular letters, and letter frequencies — which can be obtained from transcribed Latin — appear to provide so powerful a cue that relatively little detailed information about letter shapes is required. Linking letter segmentation and recognition has thoroughly beneﬁcial effects. This suggests that the pool of manuscripts that can be made accessible in this way is large. In particular, we have used our method, trained on 22 instances of letters from one document, to search another document. Figure 9 shows the results from two searches of our second document (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]). No information from this document was used in training at all; but letter 1tu arbitror pater etiam nisi factum primum siet vero illi inter hic michi ibi qui tu ibi michi 0.9 0.8 0.7 qui hic 0.6 inter 0.5 illi 0.4 siet 0.3 vero 0.2 nisi 0.1 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 6: On the left, search results for selected words (indicated on the leftmost column). Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. Note only the top 300 results are represented, and that lines containing the search term are almost always at or close to the top of the search results (black marks to the left). On the right, we plot precision against recall for a set of different words by taking the top 10, 20, ... lines returned from the search, and checking them against the aligned manuscript. Note that, once all cases have been found, if the size of the pool is increased the precision will fall with 100% recall; many words work well, with most of the ﬁrst 20 or so lines returned containing the search term. shapes are sufﬁciently well shared that the search is still useful. All this suggests that one might be able to use EM to link three processes: one that clusters to determine letter shapes; one that segments letters; and one that imposes a language model. Such a system might be able to make handwritten Latin searchable with no training data. References [1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.

<p>Author: Mark Craven, Joseph Bockhorst</p><p>Abstract: Many sequential prediction tasks involve locating instances of patterns in sequences. Generative probabilistic language models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), have been successfully applied to many of these tasks. A limitation of these models however, is that they cannot naturally handle cases in which pattern instances overlap in arbitrary ways. We present an alternative approach, based on conditional Markov networks, that can naturally represent arbitrarily overlapping elements. We show how to eﬃciently train and perform inference with these models. Experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on HMMs. 1</p><p>5 0.41114056 <a title="128-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Identifying_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Sites_on_a_Genome-Wide_Scale.html">80 nips-2004-Identifying Protein-Protein Interaction Sites on a Genome-Wide Scale</a></p>
<p>Author: Haidong Wang, Eran Segal, Asa Ben-Hur, Daphne Koller, Douglas L. Brutlag</p><p>Abstract: Protein interactions typically arise from a physical interaction of one or more small sites on the surface of the two proteins. Identifying these sites is very important for drug and protein design. In this paper, we propose a computational method based on probabilistic relational model that attempts to address this task using high-throughput protein interaction data and a set of short sequence motifs. We learn the model using the EM algorithm, with a branch-and-bound algorithm as an approximate inference for the E-step. Our method searches for motifs whose presence in a pair of interacting proteins can explain their observed interaction. It also tries to determine which motif pairs have high afﬁnity, and can therefore lead to an interaction. We show that our method is more accurate than others at predicting new protein-protein interactions. More importantly, by examining solved structures of protein complexes, we ﬁnd that 2/3 of the predicted active motifs correspond to actual interaction sites. 1</p><p>6 0.3518858 <a title="128-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Methods_for_Estimating_the_Computational_Power_and_Generalization_Capability_of_Neural_Microcircuits.html">118 nips-2004-Methods for Estimating the Computational Power and Generalization Capability of Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Jongmin Kim, John Hopfield, Erik Winfree</p><p>Abstract: The structural similarity of neural networks and genetic regulatory networks to digital circuits, and hence to each other, was noted from the very beginning of their study [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components. 1</p><p>2 0.67913133 <a title="128-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Maximising_Sensitivity_in_a_Spiking_Network.html">112 nips-2004-Maximising Sensitivity in a Spiking Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Anthony J. Bell, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: We use unsupervised probabilistic machine learning ideas to try to explain the kinds of learning observed in real neurons, the goal being to connect abstract principles of self-organisation to known biophysical processes. For example, we would like to explain Spike TimingDependent Plasticity (see [5,6] and Figure 3A), in terms of information theory. Starting out, we explore the optimisation of a network sensitivity measure related to maximising the mutual information between input spike timings and output spike timings. Our derivations are analogous to those in ICA, except that the sensitivity of output timings to input timings is maximised, rather than the sensitivity of output ‘ﬁring rates’ to inputs. ICA and related approaches have been successful in explaining the learning of many properties of early visual receptive ﬁelds in rate coding models, and we are hoping for similar gains in understanding of spike coding in networks, and how this is supported, in principled probabilistic ways, by cellular biophysical processes. For now, in our initial simulations, we show that our derived rule can learn synaptic weights which can unmix, or demultiplex, mixed spike trains. That is, it can recover independent point processes embedded in distributed correlated input spike trains, using an adaptive single-layer feedforward spiking network. 1 Maximising Sensitivity. In this section, we will follow the structure of the ICA derivation [4] in developing the spiking theory. We cannot claim, as before, that this gives us an information maximisation algorithm, for reasons that we will delay addressing until Section 3. But for now, to ﬁrst develop our approach, we will explore an interim objective function called sensitivity which we deﬁne as the log Jacobian of how input spike timings affect output spike timings. 1.1 How to maximise the effect of one spike timing on another. Consider a spike in neuron j at time tl that has an effect on the timing of another spike in neuron i at time tk . The neurons are connected by a weight wij . We use i and j to index neurons, and k and l to index spikes, but sometimes for convenience we will use spike indices in place of neuron indices. For example, wkl , the weight between an input spike l and an output spike k, is naturally understood to be just the corresponding wij . dtk dtl threshold potential du u(t) R(t) resting potential tk output spikes tl input spikes Figure 1: Firing time tk is determined by the time of threshold crossing. A change of an input spike time dtl affects, via a change of the membrane potential du the time of the output spike by dtk . In the simplest version of the Spike Response Model [7], spike l has an effect on spike k that depends on the time-course of the evoked EPSP or IPSP, which we write as R kl (tk − tl ). In general, this Rkl models both synaptic and dendritic linear responses to an input spike, and thus models synapse type and location. For learning, we need only consider the value of this function when an output spike, k, occurs. In this model, depicted in Figure 1, a neuron adds up its spiking inputs until its membrane potential, ui (t), reaches threshold at time tk . This threshold we will often, again for convenience, write as uk ≡ ui (tk , {tl }), and it is given by a sum over spikes l: uk = wkl Rkl (tk − tl ) . (1) l To maximise timing sensitivity, we need to determine the effect of a small change in the input ﬁring time tl on the output ﬁring time tk . (A related problem is tackled in [2].) When tl is changed by a small amount dtl the membrane potential will change as a result. This change in the membrane potential leads to a change in the time of threshold crossing dt k . The contribution to the membrane potential, du, due to dtl is (∂uk /∂tl )dtl , and the change in du corresponding to a change dtk is (∂uk /∂tk )dtk . We can relate these two effects by noting that the total change of the membrane potential du has to vanish because u k is deﬁned as the potential at threshold. ie: du = ∂uk ∂uk dtk + dtl = 0 . ∂tk ∂tl (2) This is the total differential of the function uk = u(tk , {tl }), and is a special case of the implicit function theorem. Rearranging this: dtk ∂uk =− dtl ∂tl ∂uk ˙ = −wkl Rkl /uk . ˙ ∂tk (3) Now, to connect with the standard ICA derivation [4], recall the ‘rate’ (or sigmoidal) neuron, for which yi = gi (ui ) and ui = j wij xj . For this neuron, the output dependence on input is ∂yi /∂xj = wij gi while the learning gradient is: ∂yi ∂ 1 log − fi (ui )xj = ∂wij ∂xj wij (4) where the ‘score functions’, fi , are deﬁned in terms of a density estimate on the summed ∂ ∂ inputs: fi (ui ) = ∂ui log gi = ∂ui log p(ui ). ˆ The analogous learning gradient for the spiking case, from (3), is: ˙ j(a)Rka ∂ dtk 1 log − a . = ∂wij dtl wij uk ˙ (5) where j(a) = 1 if spike a came from neuron j, and 0 otherwise. Comparing the two cases in (4) and (5), we see that the input variable xj has become the temporal derivative of the sum of the EPSPs coming from synapse j, and the output variable (or score function) fi (ui ) has become u−1 , the inverse of the temporal derivative ˙k of the membrane potential at threshold. It is intriguing (A) to see this quantity appear as analogous to the score function in the ICA likelihood model, and, (B) to speculate that experiments could show that this‘ voltage slope at threshold’ is a hidden factor in STDP data, explaining some of the scatter in Figure 3A. In other words, an STDP datapoint should lie on a 2-surface in a 3D space of {∆w, ∆t, uk }. Incidentally, uk shows up in any ˙ ˙ learning rule optimising an objective function involving output spike timings. 1.2 How to maximise the effect of N spike timings on N other ones. Now we deal with the case of a ‘square’ single-layer feedforward mapping between spike timings. There can be several input and output neurons, but here we ignore which neurons are spiking, and just look at how the input timings affect the output timings. This is captured in a Jacobian matrix of all timing dependencies we call T. The entries of this matrix are Tkl ≡ ∂tk /∂tl . A multivariate version of the sensitivity measure introduced in the previous section is the log of the absolute determinant of the timing matrix, ie: log |T|. The full derivation for the gradient W log |T| is in the Appendix. Here, we again draw out the analogy between Square ICA [4] and this gradient, as follows. Square ICA with a network y = g(Wx) is: ∆W ∝ W log |J| = W−1 − f (u)xT (6) where the Jacobian J has entries ∂yi /∂xj and the score functions are now, fi (u) = ∂ − ∂ui log p(u) for the general likelihood case, with p(u) = i gi being the special case of ˆ ˆ ICA. We will now split the gradient in (6) according to the chain rule: W log |J| = [ J log |J|] ⊗ [ W J] j(l) − fk (u)xj wkl J−T ⊗ Jkl i(k) = (7) . (8) In this equation, i(k) = δik and j(l) = δjl . The righthand term is a 4-tensor with entries ∂Jkl /∂wij , and ⊗ is deﬁned as A ⊗ Bij = kl Akl Bklij . We write the gradient this way to preserve, in the second term, the independent structure of the 1 → 1 gradient term in (4), and to separate a difﬁcult derivation into two easy parts. The structure of (8) holds up when we move to the spiking case, giving: W log |T| = = [ T log |T|] ⊗ [ W T] T−T ⊗ Tkl i(k) j(l) − wkl (9) a ˙ j(a)Rka uk ˙ (10) where i(k) is now deﬁned as being 1 if spike k occured in neuron i, and 0 otherwise. j(l) and j(a) are analogously deﬁned. Because the T matrix is much bigger than the J matrix, and because it’s entries are more complex, here the similarity ends. When (10) is evaluated for a single weight inﬂuencing a single spike coupling (see the Appendix for the full derivation), it yields: ∆wkl ∝ ∂ log |T| Tkl = ∂wkl wkl T−1 lk −1 , (11) This is a non-local update involving a matrix inverse at each step. In the ICA case of (6), such an inverse was removed by the Natural Gradient transform (see [1]), but in the spike timing case, this has turned out not to be possible, because of the additional asymmetry ˙ introduced into the T matrix (as opposed to the J matrix) by the Rkl term in (3). 2 Results. Nonetheless, this learning rule can be simulated. It requires running the network for a while to generate spikes (and a corresponding T matrix), and then for each input/output spike coupling, the corresponding synapse is updated according to (11). When this is done, and the weights learn, it is clear that something has been sacriﬁced by ignoring the issue of which neurons are producing the spikes. Speciﬁcally, the network will often put all the output spikes on one output neuron, with the rates of the others falling to zero. It is happy to do this, if a large log |T| can thereby be achieved, because we have not included this ‘which neuron’ information in the objective. We will address these and other problems in Section 3, but now we report on our simulation results on demultiplexing. 2.1 Demultiplexing spike trains. An interesting possibility in the brain is that ‘patterns’ are embedded in spatially distributed spike timings that are input to neurons. Several patterns could be embedded in single input trains. This is called multiplexing. To extract and propagate these patterns, the neurons must demultiplex these inputs using its threshold nonlinearity. Demultiplexing is the ‘point process’ analog of the unmixing of independent inputs in ICA. We have been able to robustly achieve demultiplexing, as we now report. We simulated a feed-forward network with 3 integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and inputs from 3 presynaptic neurons. Learning followed (11) where we replace the inverse by the pseudoinverse computed on the spikes generated during 0.5 s. The pseudo-inverse is necessary because even though on average, the learning matches number of output spikes to number of input spikes, the matrix T is still not usually square and so its actual inverse cannot be taken. In addition, in these simulations, an additional term is introduced in the learning to make sure all the output neurons ﬁre with equal probability. This partially counters the ignoral of the ‘which neuron’ information, which we explained above. Assuming Poisson spike count ni for the ith output neuron with equal ﬁring rate ni it is easy to derive in an approximate ¯ term that will control the spike count, i (¯ i − ni ). The target ﬁring rates ni were set to n ¯ match the “source” spike train in this example. The network learns to demultiplex mixed spike trains, as shown in Figure 2. This demultiplexing is a robust property of learning using (11) with this new spike-controlling term. Finally, what about the spike-timing dependendence of the observed learning? Does it match experimental results? The comparison is made in Figure 3, and the answer is no. There is a timing-dependent transition between depression and potentiation in our result Spike Trains mixing mixed input trains 1 1 0.8 2 0.6 3 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 0.4 500 0.2 output 1 0 2 3 synaptic weights 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 original spike train 1 1 0.5 2 0 3 0 50 100 150 200 250 time in ms 300 350 400 450 500 −0.5 Figure 2: Unmixed spike trains.

The network unmixes the spike train to approximately recover the original (center left). In this example 19 spikes correspond to the original with 4 deletion and 2 insertions. The two panels at the right show the mixing (top) and synaptic weight matrix after training (bottom). in Figure 3B, but it is not a sharp transition like the experimental result in Figure 3A. In addition, it does not transition at zero (ie: when tk − tl = 0), but at a time offset by the rise time of the EPSPs. In earlier experiments, in which we tranformed the gradient in (11) by an approximate inverse Hessian, to get an approximate Natural Gradient method, a sharp transition did emerge in simulations. However, the approximate inverse Hessian was singular, and we had to de-emphasise this result. It does suggest, however, that if the Natural Gradient transform can be usefully done on some variant of this learning rule, it may well be what accounts for the sharp transition effect of STDP. 3 Discussion Although these derivations started out smoothly, the reader possibly shares the authors’ frustration at the approximations involved here. Why isn’t this simple, like ICA? Why don’t we just have a nice maximum spikelihood model, ie: a density estimation algorithm for multivariate point processes, as ICA was a model in continuous space? We are going to be explicit about the problems now, and will propose a direction where the solution may lie. The over-riding problem is: we are unable to claim that in maximising log |T|, we are maximising the mutual information between inputs and outputs because: 1. The Invertability Problem. Algorithms such as ICA which maximise log Jacobians can only be called Infomax algorithms if the network transformation is both deterministic and invertable. The Spike Response Model is deterministic, but it is not invertable in general. When not invertable, the key formula (considering here vectors of input and output timings, tin and tout )is transformed from simple to complex. ie: p(tout ) = p(tin ) becomes p(tout ) = |T| solns tin p(tin ) d tin |T| (12) Thus when not invertable, we need to know the Jacobians of all the inputs that could have caused an output (called here ‘solns’), something we simply don’t know. 2. The ‘Which Neuron’ Problem. Instead of maximising the mutual information I(tout , tin ), we should be maximising I(tiout , tiin ), where the vector ti is the timing (A) STDP (B) Gradient 100 ∆ w (a.u.) 150 100 ∆ w / w (%) 150 50 0 −50 −100 −100 50 0 −50 −50 0 ∆ t (ms) 50 100 −100 −20 0 20 40 60 ∆ t (ms) 80 100 Figure 3: Dependence of synaptic modiﬁcation on pre/post inter-spike interval.

Each point corresponds to an spike pair between approximately 100 input and 100 output spikes. vector, t, with the vector, i, of corresponding neuron indices, concatenated. Thus, ‘who spiked?’ should be included in the analysis as it is part of the information. 3. The Predictive Information Problem. In ICA, since there was no time involved, we did not have to worry about mutual informations over time between inputs and outputs. But in the spiking model, output spikes may well have (predictive) mutual information with future input spikes, as well as the usual (causal) mutual information with past input spikes. The former has been entirely missing from our analysis so far. These temporal and spatial infomation dependencies missing in our analysis so far, are thrown into a different light by a single empirical observation, which is that Spike TimingDependent Plasticity is not just a feedforward computation like the Spike Response Model. Speciﬁcally, there must be at least a statistical, if not a causal, relation between a real synapse’s plasticity and its neuron’s output spike timings, for Figure 3B to look like it does. It seems we have to confront the need for both a ‘memory’ (or reconstruction) model, such as the T we have thus far dealt with, in which output spikes talk about past inputs, and a ‘prediction’ model, in which they talk about future inputs. This is most easily understood from the point of view of Barber & Agakov’s variational Infomax algorithm [3]. They argue for optimising a lower bound on mutual information, which, for our neurons’, would be expressed using an inverse model p, as follows: ˆ I(tiin , tiout ) = H(tiin ) − log p(tiin |tiout ) ˆ p(tiin ,tiout ) ≤ I(tiin , tiout ) (13) In a feedforward model, H(tiin ) may be disregarded in taking gradients, leading us to the optimisation of a ‘memory-prediction’ model p(tiin |tiout ) related to something supposˆ edly happening in dendrites, somas and at synapses. In trying to guess what this might be, it would be nice if the math worked out. We need a square Jacobian matrix, T, so that |T| = p(tiin |tiout ) can be our memory/prediction model. Now let’s rename our feedforˆ → − ward timing Jacobian T (‘up the dendritic trees’), as T, and let’s fantasise that there is ← − some, as yet unspeciﬁed, feedback Jacobian T (‘down the dendritic trees’), which covers → − electrotonic inﬂuences as they spread from soma to synapse, and which T can be combined with by some operation ‘⊗’ to make things square. Imagine further, that doing this → ← − − yields a memory/prediction model on the inputs. Then the T we are looking for is T ⊗ T, → ← − − and the memory-prediction model is: p(tiin |tiout ) = T ⊗ T ˆ → − → − Ideally, the entries of T should be as before, ie: T kl = ∂tk /∂tl . What should the entries ← − ← − ← − of T be? Becoming just one step more concrete, suppose T had entries T lk = ∂cl /∂tk , where cl is some, as yet unspeciﬁed, value, or process, occuring at an input synapse when spike l comes in. What seems clear is that ⊗ should combine the correctly tensorised forms → − ← − → ← − − of T and T (giving them each 4 indices ijkl), so that T = T ⊗ T sums over the spikes k and l to give a I × J matrix, where I is the number of output neurons, and J the number of input neurons. Then our quantity, T, would represent all dependencies of input neuronal activity on output activity, summed over spikes. ← − Further, we imagine that T contains reverse (feedback) electrotonic transforms from soma ← − to synapse R lk that are somehow symmetrically related to the feedforward Spike Re→ − sponses from synapse to soma, which we now rename R kl . Thinking for a moment in terms of somatic k and synaptic l, voltages V , currents I and linear cable theory, the synapse to → − → − soma transform, R kl would be related to an impedance in Vk = Il Z kl , while the soma ← − ← − to synapse transform, R lk would be related to an admittance in Il = Vk Y lk [8]. The → − ← − symmetry in these equations is that Z kl is just the inverse conjugate of Y lk . Finally, then, what is cl ? And what is its relation to the calcium concentration, [Ca2+ ]l , at a synapse, when spike l comes in? These questions naturally follow from considering the experimental data, since it is known that the calcium level at synapses is the critical integrating factor in determining whether potentiation or depression occurs [5]. 4 Appendix: Gradient of log |T| for the full Spike Response Model. Here we give full details of the gradient for Gerstner’s Spike Response Model [7]. This is a general model for which Integrate-and-Fire is a special case. In this model the effect of a presynaptic spike at time tl on the membrane potential at time t is described by a post synaptic potential or spike response, which may also depend on the time that has passed since the last output spike tk−1 , hence the spike response is written as R(t − tk−1 , t − tl ). This response is weighted by the synaptic strength wl . Excitatory or inhibitory synapses are determined by the sign of wl . Refractoriness is incorporated by adding a hyper-polarizing contribution (spike-afterpotential) to the membrane potential in response to the last preceding spike η(t − tk−1 ). The membrane potential as a function of time is therefore given by u(t) = η(t − tk−1 ) + wl R(t − tk−1 , t − tl ) . (14) l We have ignored here potential contributions from external currents which can easily be included without modifying the following derivations. The output ﬁring times t k are deﬁned as the times for which u(t) reaches ﬁring threshold from below. We consider a dynamic threshold, ϑ(t − tk−1 ), which may depend on the time since that last spike tk−1 , together then output spike times are deﬁned implicitly by: t = tk : u(t) = ϑ(t − tk−1 ) and du(t) > 0. dt (15) For this more general model Tkl is given by Tkl = dtk =− dtl ∂u ∂ϑ − ∂tk ∂tk −1 ˙ ∂u wkl R(tk − tk−1 , tk − tl , ) = , ˙ ∂tl u(tk ) − ϑ(tk − tk−1 ) ˙ (16) ˙ ˙ where R(s, t), u(t), and ϑ(t) are derivatives with respect to t. The dependence of Tkl on ˙ tk−1 should be implicitly assumed. It has been omitted to simplify the notation. Now we compute the derivative of log |T| with respect to wkl . For any matrix T we have ∂ log |T|/∂Tab = [T−1 ]ba . Therefore: ∂ log |T| ∂Tab ∂ log |T| ∂Tab = [T−1 ]ba .

We prove a more reﬁned bound that leads to a nearly optimal algorithm for learning disjunctions, again, based on the maximum entropy principle. We describe a simpliﬁcation of the on-line maximum entropy method in which, after each iteration, the margin constraints are replaced with a single linear inequality.

<p>Author: Ofer Shai, Brendan J. Frey, Quaid D. Morris, Qun Pan, Christine Misquitta, Benjamin J. Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS.

An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

<p>Author: Sophie Deneve</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of spiking neurons as Bayesian integrators accumulating evidence over time about events in the external world or the body, and communicating to other neurons their certainties about these events. In this model, spikes signal the occurrence of new information, i.e. what cannot be predicted from the past activity. As a result, ﬁring statistics are close to Poisson, albeit providing a deterministic representation of probabilities. We proceed to develop a theory of Bayesian inference in spiking neural networks, recurrent interactions implementing a variant of belief propagation. Many perceptual and motor tasks performed by the central nervous system are probabilistic, and can be described in a Bayesian framework [4, 3]. A few important but hidden properties, such as direction of motion, or appropriate motor commands, are inferred from many noisy, local and ambiguous sensory cues. These evidences are combined with priors about the sensory world and body. Importantly, because most of these inferences should lead to quick and irreversible decisions in a perpetually changing world, noisy cues have to be integrated on-line, but in a way that takes into account unpredictable events, such as a sudden change in motion direction or the appearance of a new stimulus. This raises the question of how this temporal integration can be performed at the neural level. It has been proposed that single neurons in sensory cortices represent and compute the log probability that a sensory variable takes on a certain value (eg Is visual motion in the neuron’s preferred direction?) [9, 7]. Alternatively, to avoid normalization issues and provide an appropriate signal for decision making, neurons could represent the log probability ratio of a particular hypothesis (eg is motion more likely to be towards the right than towards the left) [7, 6]. Log probabilities are convenient here, since under some assumptions, independent noisy cues simply combine linearly. Moreover, there are physiological evidence for the neural representation of log probabilities and log probability ratios [9, 6, 7]. However, these models assume that neurons represent probabilities in their ﬁring rates. We argue that it is important to study how probabilistic information are encoded in spikes. Indeed, it seems spurious to marry the idea of an exquisite on-line integration of noisy cues with an underlying rate code that requires averaging on large populations of noisy neurons and long periods of time. In particular, most natural tasks require this integration to take place on the time scale of inter-spike intervals. Spikes are more efﬁciently signaling events ∗ Institute of Cognitive Science, 69645 Bron, France than analog quantities. In addition, a neural theory of inference with spikes will bring us closer to the physiological level and generate more easily testable predictions. Thus, we propose a new theory of neural processing in which spike trains provide a deterministic, online representation of a log-probability ratio. Spikes signals events, eg that the log-probability ratio has exceeded what could be predicted from previous spikes. This form of coding was loosely inspired by the idea of ”energy landscape” coding proposed by Hinton and Brown [2]. However, contrary to [2] and other theories using rate-based representation of probabilities, this model is self-consistent and does not require different models for encoding and decoding: As output spikes provide new, unpredictable, temporally independent evidence, they can be used directly as an input to other Bayesian neurons. Finally, we show that these neurons can be used as building blocks in a theory of approximate Bayesian inference in recurrent spiking networks. Connections between neurons implement an underlying Bayesian network, consisting of coupled hidden Markov models. Propagation of spikes is a form of belief propagation in this underlying graphical model. Our theory provides computational explanations of some general physiological properties of cortical neurons, such as spike frequency adaptation, Poisson statistics of spike trains, the existence of strong local inhibition in cortical columns, and the maintenance of a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the debate about temporal versus rate-based neural coding. 1 Spikes and log posterior odds 1.1 Synaptic integration seen as inference in a hidden Markov chain We propose that each neuron codes for an underlying ”hidden” binary variable, xt , whose state evolves over time. We assume that xt depends only on the state at the previous time step, xt−dt , and is conditionally independent of other past states. The state xt can switch 1 from 0 to 1 with a constant rate ron = dt limdt→0 P (xt = 1|xt−dt = 0), and from 1 to 0 with a constant rate roﬀ . For example, these transition rates could represent how often motion in a preferred direction appears the receptive ﬁeld and how long it is likely to stay there. The neuron infers the state of its hidden variable from N noisy synaptic inputs, considered to be observations of the hidden state. In this initial version of the model, we assume that these inputs are conditionally independent homogeneous Poisson processes, synapse i i emitting a spike between time t and t + dt (si = 1) with constant probability qon dt if t i xt = 1, and another constant probability qoﬀ dt if xt = 0. The synaptic spikes are assumed to be otherwise independent of previous synaptic spikes, previous states and spikes at other synapses. The resulting generative model is a hidden Markov chain (ﬁgure 1-A). However, rather than estimating the state of its hidden variable and communicating this estimate to other neurons (for example by emitting a spike when sensory evidence for xt = 1 goes above a threshold) the neuron reports and communicates its certainty that the current state is 1. This certainty takes the form of the log of the ratio of the probability that the hidden state is 1, and the probability that the state is 0, given all the synaptic inputs P (xt =1|s0→t ) received so far: Lt = log P (xt =0|s0→t ) . We use s0→t as a short hand notation for the N synaptic inputs received at present and in the past. We will refer to it as the log odds ratio. Thanks to the conditional independencies assumed in the generative model, we can compute this Log odds ratio iteratively. Taking the limit as dt goes to zero, we get the following differential equation: ˙ L = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + i wi δ(si − 1) − θ t B.

Each synaptic spike (si = 1) gives an impulse to the log t off odds ratio, which is positive if this synapse is more active when the hidden state if 1 (i.e it increases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1), and negative if this synapse is more active when xt = 0 (i.e it decreases the neuron’s conﬁdence that the state is 1). The bias, θ, is determined by how informative it is not to receive any spike, e.g. θ = i i i qon − qoﬀ . By convention, we will consider that the ”bias” is positive or zero (if not, we need simply to invert the status of the state x). 1.2 Generation of output spikes The spike train should convey a sparse representation of Lt , so that each spike reports new information about the state xt that is not redundant with that reported by other, preceding, spikes. This proposition is based on three arguments: First, spikes, being metabolically expensive, should be kept to a minimum. Second, spikes conveying redundant information would require a decoding of the entire spike train, whereas independent spike can be taken into account individually. And ﬁnally, we seek a self consistent model, with the spiking output having a similar semantics to its spiking input. To maximize the independence of the spikes (conditioned on xt ), we propose that the neuron ﬁres only when the difference between its log odds ratio Lt and a prediction Gt of this log odds ratio based on the output spikes emitted so far reaches a certain threshold. Indeed, supposing that downstream elements predicts Lt as best as they can, the neuron only needs to ﬁre when it expects that prediction to be too inaccurate (ﬁgure 1-B). In practice, this will happen when the neuron receives new evidence for xt = 1. Gt should thereby follow the same dynamics as Lt when spikes are not received. The equation for Gt and the output Ot (Ot = 1 when an output spike is ﬁred) are given by: ˙ G = Ot = ron 1 + e−L − roﬀ 1 + eL + go δ(Ot − 1) go 1. when Lt > Gt + , 0 otherwise, 2 (1) (2) Here go , a positive constant, is the only free parameter, the other parameters being constrained by the statistics of the synaptic input. 1.3 Results Figure 1-C plots a typical trial, showing the behavior of L, G and O before, during and after presentation of the stimulus. As random synaptic inputs are integrated, L ﬂuctuates and eventually exceeds G + 0.5, leading to an output spike. Immediately after a spike, G jumps to G + go , which prevents (except in very rare cases) a second spike from immediately following the ﬁrst. Thus, this ”jump” implements a relative refractory period. However, ron G decays as it tends to converge back to its stable level gstable = log roff . Thus L eventually exceeds G again, leading to a new spike. This threshold crossing happens more often during stimulation (xt = 1) as the net synaptic input alters to create a higher overall level of certainty, Lt . Mean Log odds ratio and output ﬁring rate ¯ The mean ﬁring rate Ot of the Bayesian neuron during presentation of its preferred stimulus (i.e. when xt switches from 0 to 1 and back to 0) is plotted in ﬁgure 1-D, together with the ¯ mean log posterior ratio Lt , both averaged over trials. Not surprisingly, the log-posterior ratio reﬂects the leaky integration of synaptic evidence, with an effective time constant that depends on the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ . If the state is very stable (ron = roﬀ ∼ 0), synaptic evidence is integrated over almost inﬁnite time periods, the mean log posterior ratio tending to either increase or decrease linearly with time. In the example in ﬁgure 1D, the state is less stable, so ”old” synaptic evidence are discounted and Lt saturates. ¯ In contrast, the mean output ﬁring rate Ot tracks the state of xt almost perfectly. This is because, as a form of predictive coding, the output spikes reﬂect the new synaptic i evidence, It = i δ(st − 1) − θ, rather than the log posterior ratio itself. In particular, the mean output ﬁring rate is a rectiﬁed linear function of the mean input, e. g. + ¯ ¯ wi q i −θ . O= 1I= go i on(oﬀ) Analogy with a leaky integrate and ﬁre neuron We can get an interesting insight into the computation performed by this neuron by linearizing L and G around their mean levels over trials. Here we reduce the analysis to prolonged, statistically stable periods when the state is constant (either ON or OFF). In this case, the ¯ ¯ mean level of certainty L and its output prediction G are also constant over time. We make the rough approximation that the post spike jump, go , and the input ﬂuctuations are small ¯ compared to the mean level of certainty L.

The membrane potential Vt integrates its input, Jt = It − ∆go , with a leak kL . The neuron ﬁres when its membrane potential reaches a constant threshold go . After ¯ each spikes, Vt is reset to 0. Interestingly, for appropriately chosen compression factor go , the mean input to the lin¯ ¯ earized neuron J = I − ∆go ≈ 0 1 . This means that the membrane potential is purely driven to its threshold by input ﬂuctuations, or a random walk in membrane potential. As a consequence, the neuron’s ﬁring will be memoryless, and close to a Poisson process. In particular, we found Fano factor close to 1 and quasi-exponential ISI distribution (ﬁgure 1E) on the entire range of parameters tested. Indeed, LIF neurons with balanced inputs have been proposed as a model to reproduce the statistics of real cortical neurons [8]. This balance is implemented in our model by the neuron’s effective self-inhibition, even when the synaptic input itself is not balanced. Decoding As we previously said, downstream elements could predict the log odds ratio Lt by computing Gt from the output spikes (Eq 1, ﬁg 1-B). Of course, this requires an estimate of the transition probabilities ron , roﬀ , that could be learned from the observed spike trains. However, we show next that explicit decoding is not necessary to perform bayesian inference in spiking networks. Intuitively, this is because the quantity that our model neurons receive and transmit, eg new information, is exactly what probabilistic inference algorithm propagate between connected statistical elements. 1 ¯ Even if go is not chosen optimally, the inﬂuence of the drift J is usually negligible compared to the large ﬂuctuations in membrane potential. 2 Bayesian inference in cortical networks The model neurons, having the same input and output semantics, can be used as building blocks to implement more complex generative models consisting of coupled Markov chains. Consider, for example, the example in ﬁgure 2-A. Here, a ”parent” variable x1 t (the presence of a tiger) can cause the state of n other ”children” variables ([xk ]k=2...n ), t of whom two are represented (the presence of stripes,x2 , and motion, x3 ). The ”chilt t dren” variables are Bayesian neurons identical to those described previously. The resulting bayesian network consist of n + 1 coupled hidden Markov chains. Inference in this architecture corresponds to computing the log posterior odds ratio for the tiger, x1 , and the log t posterior of observing stripes or motion, ([xk ]k=2...n ), given the synaptic inputs received t by the entire network so far, i.e. s2 , . . . , sk . 0→t 0→t Unfortunately, inference and learning in this network (and in general in coupled Markov chains) requires very expensive computations, and cannot be performed by simply propagating messages over time and among the variable nodes. In particular, the state of a child k variable xt depends on xk , sk , x1 and the state of all other children at the previous t t t−dt time step, [xj ]2</p><p>6 0.37327442 <a title="128-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-At_the_Edge_of_Chaos%3A_Real-time_Computations_and_Self-Organized_Criticality_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">26 nips-2004-At the Edge of Chaos: Real-time Computations and Self-Organized Criticality in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>

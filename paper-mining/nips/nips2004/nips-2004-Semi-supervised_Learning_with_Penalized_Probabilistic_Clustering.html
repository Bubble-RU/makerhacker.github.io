<p>Author: Le Lu, Gregory D. Hager, Laurent Younes</p><p>Abstract: Visual action recognition is an important problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a new method to probabilistically model and recognize actions of articulated objects, such as hand or body gestures, in image sequences. Our method consists of three levels of representation. At the low level, we ﬁrst extract a feature vector invariant to scale and in-plane rotation by using the Fourier transform of a circular spatial histogram. Then, spectral partitioning [20] is utilized to obtain an initial clustering; this clustering is then reﬁned using a temporal smoothness constraint. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based clustering and density estimation in the subspace of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are then applied to thousands of image feature vectors to obtain an intermediate level representation. Finally, at the high level we build a temporal multiresolution histogram model for each action by aggregating the clustering weights of sampled images belonging to that action. We discuss how this high level representation can be extended to achieve temporal scaling invariance and to include Bi-gram or Multi-gram transition information. Both image clustering and action recognition/segmentation results are given to show the validity of our three tiered representation.</p><p>3 0.17142519 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Maximum_Margin_Clustering.html">115 nips-2004-Maximum Margin Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Linli Xu, James Neufeld, Bryce Larson, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for clustering based on ﬁnding maximum margin hyperplanes through data. By reformulating the problem in terms of the implied equivalence relation matrix, we can pose the problem as a convex integer program. Although this still yields a difﬁcult computational problem, the hard-clustering constraints can be relaxed to a soft-clustering formulation which can be feasibly solved with a semidefinite program. Since our clustering technique only depends on the data through the kernel matrix, we can easily achieve nonlinear clusterings in the same manner as spectral clustering. Experimental results show that our maximum margin clustering technique often obtains more accurate results than conventional clustering methods. The real beneﬁt of our approach, however, is that it leads naturally to a semi-supervised training method for support vector machines. By maximizing the margin simultaneously on labeled and unlabeled training data, we achieve state of the art performance by using a single, integrated learning principle. 1</p><p>4 0.15978903 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Efficient_Out-of-Sample_Extension_of_Dominant-Set_Clusters.html">61 nips-2004-Efficient Out-of-Sample Extension of Dominant-Set Clusters</a></p>
<p>Author: Massimiliano Pavan, Marcello Pelillo</p><p>Abstract: Dominant sets are a new graph-theoretic concept that has proven to be relevant in pairwise data clustering problems, such as image segmentation. They generalize the notion of a maximal clique to edgeweighted graphs and have intriguing, non-trivial connections to continuous quadratic optimization and spectral-based grouping. We address the problem of grouping out-of-sample examples after the clustering process has taken place. This may serve either to drastically reduce the computational burden associated to the processing of very large data sets, or to efﬁciently deal with dynamic situations whereby data sets need to be updated continually. We show that the very notion of a dominant set offers a simple and efﬁcient way of doing this.

<p>Author: Scott J. Gaffney, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a ﬁxed-dimensional featurevector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.</p><p>6 0.14275722 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Spike_Sorting%3A_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Non-Stationary_Data.html">174 nips-2004-Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to building brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and learning. We show how a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can be used to infer probability distributions over brain- and body-states during planning and execution of actions. The DBN is learned directly from observed data and allows measured signals such as EEG and EMG to be interpreted in terms of internal states such as intent to move, preparatory activity, and movement execution. Unlike traditional classiﬁcation-based approaches to BCI, the proposed approach (1) allows continuous tracking and prediction of internal states over time, and (2) generates control signals based on an entire probability distribution over states rather than binary yes/no decisions. We present preliminary results of brain- and body-state estimation using simultaneous EEG and EMG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85194516 <a title="167-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Aharon Bar-hillel, Adam Spiro, Eran Stark</p><p>Abstract: Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron. It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework. At a ﬁrst search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame. At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model. Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The method was applied to several recordings. The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters. 1</p><p>4 0.77261931 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Common-Frame_Model_for_Object_Recognition.html">40 nips-2004-Common-Frame Model for Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moreels, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A generative probabilistic model for objects in images is presented. An object consists of a constellation of features. Feature appearance and pose are modeled probabilistically. Scene images are generated by drawing a set of objects from a given database, with random clutter sprinkled on the remaining image surface. Occlusion is allowed. We study the case where features from the same object share a common reference frame. Moreover, parameters for shape and appearance densities are shared across features. This is to be contrasted with previous work on probabilistic ‘constellation’ models where features depend on each other, and each feature and model have different pose and appearance statistics [1, 2]. These two differences allow us to build models containing hundreds of features, as well as to train each model from a single example. Our model may also be thought of as a probabilistic revisitation of Lowe’s model [3, 4]. We propose an efﬁcient entropy-minimization inference algorithm that constructs the best interpretation of a scene as a collection of objects and clutter. We test our ideas with experiments on two image databases. We compare with Lowe’s algorithm and demonstrate better performance, in particular in presence of large amounts of background clutter.</p><p>5 0.76965123 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>6 0.76857072 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Probabilistic_Model_for_Online_Document_Clustering_with_Application_to_Novelty_Detection.html">10 nips-2004-A Probabilistic Model for Online Document Clustering with Application to Novelty Detection</a></p>

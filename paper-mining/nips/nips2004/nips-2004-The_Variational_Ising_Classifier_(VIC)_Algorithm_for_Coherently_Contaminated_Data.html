<p>Author: Felix A. Wichmann, Arnulf B. Graf, Heinrich H. Bülthoff, Eero P. Simoncelli, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We study gender discrimination of human faces using a combination of psychophysical classiﬁcation and discrimination experiments together with methods from machine learning. We reduce the dimensionality of a set of face images using principal component analysis, and then train a set of linear classiﬁers on this reduced representation (linear support vector machines (SVMs), relevance vector machines (RVMs), Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), and prototype (prot) classiﬁers) using human classiﬁcation data. Because we combine a linear preprocessor with linear classiﬁers, the entire system acts as a linear classiﬁer, allowing us to visualise the decision-image corresponding to the normal vector of the separating hyperplanes (SH) of each classiﬁer. We predict that the female-tomaleness transition along the normal vector for classiﬁers closely mimicking human classiﬁcation (SVM and RVM [1]) should be faster than the transition along any other direction. A psychophysical discrimination experiment using the decision images as stimuli is consistent with this prediction. 1</p><p>3 0.10672539 <a title="191-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution (BRAND) is proposed for estimating time delays of acoustic signals in reverberant environments. Sparsity of the nonnegative ﬁlter coefﬁcients is enforced using an L1 -norm regularization. A probabilistic generative model is used to simultaneously estimate the regularization parameters and ﬁlter coefﬁcients from the signal data. Iterative update rules are derived under a Bayesian framework using the Expectation-Maximization procedure. The resulting time delay estimation algorithm is demonstrated on noisy acoustic data.</p><p>4 0.1027045 <a title="191-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>5 0.10217466 <a title="191-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Parallel_Support_Vector_Machines%3A_The_Cascade_SVM.html">144 nips-2004-Parallel Support Vector Machines: The Cascade SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans P. Graf, Eric Cosatto, Léon Bottou, Igor Dourdanovic, Vladimir Vapnik</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithm for support vector machines (SVM) that can be parallelized efficiently and scales to very large problems with hundreds of thousands of training vectors. Instead of analyzing the whole training set in one optimization step, the data are split into subsets and optimized separately with multiple SVMs. The partial results are combined and filtered again in a ‘Cascade’ of SVMs, until the global optimum is reached. The Cascade SVM can be spread over multiple processors with minimal communication overhead and requires far less memory, since the kernel matrices are much smaller than for a regular SVM. Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x – 10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor. Parallel implementations on a cluster of 16 processors were tested with over 1 million vectors (2-class problems), converging in a day or two, while a regular SVM never converged in over a week. 1</p><p>6 0.098956347 <a title="191-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Occlusion_Reasoning_for_Tracking_with_Nonparametric_Belief_Propagation.html">55 nips-2004-Distributed Occlusion Reasoning for Tracking with Nonparametric Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: We give a fast rejection scheme that is based on image segments and demonstrate it on the canonical example of face detection. However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classiﬁers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classiﬁers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classiﬁer. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable. 1</p><p>5 0.47694117 <a title="191-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Face_Detection_---_Efficient_and_Rank_Deficient.html">68 nips-2004-Face Detection --- Efficient and Rank Deficient</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for computing fast approximations to support vector decision functions in the ﬁeld of object detection. In the present approach we are building on an existing algorithm where the set of support vectors is replaced by a smaller, so-called reduced set of synthesized input space points. In contrast to the existing method that ﬁnds the reduced set via unconstrained optimization, we impose a structural constraint on the synthetic points such that the resulting approximations can be evaluated via separable ﬁlters. For applications that require scanning large images, this decreases the computational complexity by a signiﬁcant amount. Experimental results show that in face detection, rank deﬁcient approximations are 4 to 6 times faster than unconstrained reduced set systems. 1</p><p>6 0.47171909 <a title="191-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Joint_MRI_Bias_Removal_Using_Entropy_Minimization_Across_Images.html">89 nips-2004-Joint MRI Bias Removal Using Entropy Minimization Across Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianlin Cheng, Alessandro Vullo, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: The formation of disulphide bridges among cysteines is an important feature of protein structures. Here we develop new methods for the prediction of disulphide bond connectivity. We ﬁrst build a large curated data set of proteins containing disulphide bridges and then use 2-Dimensional Recursive Neural Networks to predict bonding probabilities between cysteine pairs. These probabilities in turn lead to a weighted graph matching problem that can be addressed efﬁciently. We show how the method consistently achieves better results than previous approaches on the same validation data. In addition, the method can easily cope with chains with arbitrary numbers of bonded cysteines. Therefore, it overcomes one of the major limitations of previous approaches restricting predictions to chains containing no more than 10 oxidized cysteines. The method can be applied both to situations where the bonded state of each cysteine is known or unknown, in which case bonded state can be predicted with 85% precision and 90% recall. The method also yields an estimate for the total number of disulphide bridges in each chain. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74626642 <a title="191-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-The_Variational_Ising_Classifier_%28VIC%29_Algorithm_for_Coherently_Contaminated_Data.html">191 nips-2004-The Variational Ising Classifier (VIC) Algorithm for Coherently Contaminated Data</a></p>

Flake</p><p>Abstract: In the context of binary classiﬁcation, we deﬁne disagreement as a measure of how often two independently-trained models differ in their classiﬁcation of unlabeled data. We explore the use of disagreement for error estimation and model selection. We call the procedure co-validation, since the two models effectively (in)validate one another by comparing results on unlabeled data, which we assume is relatively cheap and plentiful compared to labeled data. We show that per-instance disagreement is an unbiased estimate of the variance of error for that instance. We also show that disagreement provides a lower bound on the prediction (generalization) error, and a tight upper bound on the “variance of prediction error”, or the variance of the average error across instances, where variance is measured across training sets. We present experimental results on several data sets exploring co-validation for error estimation and model selection. The procedure is especially effective in active learning settings, where training sets are not drawn at random and cross validation overestimates error. 1</p><p>4 0.68592036 <a title="191-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-On_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">136 nips-2004-On Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Krishnapuram, David Williams, Ya Xue, Lawrence Carin, Mário Figueiredo, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: A graph-based prior is proposed for parametric semi-supervised classiﬁcation. The prior utilizes both labelled and unlabelled data; it also integrates features from multiple views of a given sample (e.g., multiple sensors), thus implementing a Bayesian form of co-training. An EM algorithm for training the classiﬁer automatically adjusts the tradeoff between the contributions of: (a) the labelled data; (b) the unlabelled data; and (c) the co-training information. Active label query selection is performed using a mutual information based criterion that explicitly uses the unlabelled data and the co-training information. Encouraging results are presented on public benchmarks and on measured data from single and multiple sensors. 1</p><p>5 0.59152931 <a title="191-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_by_Entropy_Minimization.html">164 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We consider the semi-supervised learning problem, where a decision rule is to be learned from labeled and unlabeled data. In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution beneﬁts from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are deﬁnitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspeciﬁed, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the “cluster assumption”. Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces. 1</p><p>6 0.56850958 <a title="191-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_via_Gaussian_Processes.html">166 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning via Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, good ranking is a highly desirable performance for a classiﬁer. The criterion commonly used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To report it properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value. This paper provides conﬁdence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard conﬁdence intervals given in the case of the error rate. They are compared with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. 1 Motivation In many machine learning applications, the ranking quality of a classiﬁer is critical. For example, the ordering of the list of relevant documents returned by a search engine or a document classiﬁcation system is essential. The criterion widely used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under an ROC curve (AUC). But, to measure and report the AUC properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value as it is customary for the error rate and other measures. It is also important to make the computation of the conﬁdence interval practical by relying only on a small and simple number of parameters. In the case of the error rate, such intervals are often derived from just the sample size N . We present an extensive theoretical analysis of the AUC and show that a similar conﬁdence interval can be derived for its value using only simple parameters such as the error rate k/N , the number of positive examples m, and the number of negative examples n = N − m. Thus, our results extend to AUC the computation of conﬁdence intervals from a small number of readily available parameters. Our analysis is distribution-independent in the sense that it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The use of the error rate helps determine tight conﬁdence intervals. This contrasts with existing approaches presented in the statistical literature [11, 5, 2] which are based either on weak distribution-independent assumptions resulting in too loose conﬁdence intervals, or strong distribution-dependent assumptions leading to tight but unsafe conﬁdence intervals. We show that our results are of practical use. We also compare them with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. Our results are also useful for testing the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference of the AUC values of two classiﬁers. The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the deﬁnition of the AUC, its connection with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic (Section 2), and brieﬂy review some essential aspects of the existing literature related to the computation of conﬁdence intervals for the AUC. Our computation of the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate requires establishing several combinatorial identities. Section 4 presents some existing identities and gives the proof of novel ones useful for the computation of the variance. Section 5 gives the reduced expressions for the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate. These can be efﬁciently computed and used to determine our conﬁdence intervals for the AUC (Section 6). Section 7 reports the result of the comparison of our method with previous approaches, including empirical results for several standard tasks. 2 Deﬁnition and Properties of the AUC The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were originally introduced in signal detection theory [6] in connection with the study of radio signals, and have been used since then in many other applications, in particular for medical decision-making. Over the last few years, they have found increased interest in the machine learning and data mining communities for model evaluation and selection [14, 13, 7, 12, 16, 3]. The ROC curve for a binary classiﬁcation problem plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate. The points of the curve are obtained by sweeping the classiﬁcation threshold from the most positive classiﬁcation value to the most negative. For a fully random classiﬁcation, the ROC curve is a straight line connecting the origin to (1, 1). Any improvement over random classiﬁcation results in an ROC curve at least partially above this straight line. The AUC is deﬁned as the area under the ROC curve. Consider a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples. Let C be a ﬁxed classiﬁer that outputs a strictly ordered list for these examples. Let x1 , . . . , xm be the output of C on the positive examples and y1 , . . . , yn its output on the negative examples and denote by 1X the indicator function of a set X. Then, the AUC, A, associated to C is given by: A= m i=1 n j=1 1xi >yj (1) mn which is the value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [10]. Thus, the AUC is closely related to the ranking quality of the classiﬁcation. It can be viewed as a measure based on pairwise comparisons between classiﬁcations of the two classes. It is an estimate of the probability Pxy that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. With a perfect ranking, all positive examples are ranked higher than the negative ones and A = 1. Any deviation from this ranking decreases the AUC, and the expected AUC value for a random ranking is 0.5. 3 Overview of Related Work This section brieﬂy describes some previous distribution-dependent approaches presented in the statistical literature to derive conﬁdence intervals for the AUC and compares them to our method. The starting point for these analyses is a formula giving the variance of the AUC, A, for a ﬁxed distribution of the scores Px of the positive examples and Py of the negative examples [10, 1]: 2 σA = A(1 − A) + (m − 1)(Pxxy − A2 ) + (n − 1)(Pxyy − A2 ) mn (2) where Pxxy is the probability that the classiﬁer ranks two randomly chosen positive examples higher than a negative one, and Pxyy the probability that it ranks two randomly chosen negative examples lower than a positive one. To compute the variance exactly using Equation 2, the distributions Px and Py must be known. Hanley and McNeil [10] argue in favor of exponential distributions, loosely claiming that this upper-bounds the variance of normal distributions with various means and ratios of A 2A2 variances. They show that for exponential distributions Pxxy = 2−A and Pxyy = 1+A . The resulting conﬁdence intervals are of course relatively tight, but their validity is questionable since they are based on a strong assumption about the distributions of the positive and negative scores that may not hold in many cases. An alternative considered by several authors to the exact computation of the variance is to determine instead the maximum of the variance over all possible continuous distributions with the same expected value of the AUC. For all such distributions, one can ﬁx m and n and compute the expected AUC and its variance. The maximum variance is denoted by 2 σmax and is given by [5, 2]: 2 σmax = A(1 − A) 1 ≤ min {m, n} 4 min {m, n} (3) Unfortunately, this often yields loose conﬁdence intervals of limited practical use. Our approach for computing the mean and variance of the AUC is distribution-independent and inspired by the machine learning literature where analyses typically center on the error rate. We require only that the error rate be measured and compute the mean and variance of the AUC over all distributions Px and Py that maintain the same error rate. Our approach is in line with that of [5, 2] but it crucially avoids considering the maximum of the variance. We show that it is possible to compute directly the mean and variance of the AUC assigning equal weight to all the possible distributions. Of course, one could argue that not all distributions Px and Py are equally probable, but since these distributions are highly problem-dependent, we ﬁnd it risky to make any general assumption on the distributions and thereby limit the validity of our results. Our approach is further justiﬁed empirically by the experiments reported in the last section. 4 Combinatorial Analysis The analysis of the statistical properties of the AUC given a ﬁxed error rate requires various combinatorial calculations. This section describes several of the combinatorial identities that are used in our computation of the conﬁdence intervals. For all q ≥ 0, let Xq (k, m, n) be deﬁned by: k M M Xq (k, m, n) = xq (4) x x x=0 where M = m − (k − x) + x, M = n + (k − x) − x, and x = k − x. In previous work, we derived the following two identities which we used to compute the expected value of the AUC [4]: k X0 (k, m, n) = x=0 n+m+1 x k X1 (k, m, n) = (k − x)(m − n) + k n + m + 1 2 x x=0 To simplify the expression of the variance of the AUC, we need to compute X2 (k, m, n). Proposition 1 Let k, m, n be non-negative integers such that k ≤ min{m, n}, then: k X2 (k, m, n) = P2 (k, m, n, x) x=0 m+n+1 x (5) where P2 is the following 4th-degree polynomial: P2 (k, m, n, x) = (k − x)/12(−2x3 + 2x2 (2m − n + 2k − 4) + x(−3m2 + 3nm + 3m − 5km − 2k 2 + 2 + k + nk + 6n) + (3(k − 1)m2 − 3nm(k − 1) + 6km + 5m + k 2 m + 8n + 8 − 9nk + 3k + k 2 + k 2 n)). Proof. 5 The proof of the proposition is left to a longer version of this paper. Expectation and Variance of the AUC This section presents the expression of the expectation and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate k/N assuming that all classiﬁcations or rankings with k errors are equiprobable. For a given classiﬁcation, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false positive examples. Since the number of errors is ﬁxed, there are x = k − x false negative examples. The expression Xq discussed in the previous section represents the q-th moment of x over all classiﬁcations with exactly k errors. In previous work, we gave the exact expression of the expectation of the AUC for a ﬁxed number of errors k: Proposition 2 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the expected value of the AUC, A, over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: E[A] = 1 − k (n − m)2 (m + n + 1) − m+n 4mn k − m+n k−1 m+n x=0 x k m+n+1 x=0 x . Note that the two sums in this expression cannot be further simpliﬁed since they are known not to admit a closed form [9]. We also gave the expression of the variance of the AUC in terms of the function F deﬁned for all Y by: F (Y ) = k M M x=0 x x k M M x=0 x x Y . (6) The following proposition reproduces that result: Proposition 3 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = F ((1 − k−x x n+ m )2 ) 2 2 2 F ( mx +n(k−x) +(m(m+1)x+n(n+1)(k−x))−2x(k−x)(m+n+1) ). 12m2 n2 − F ((1 − k−x x n+ m 2 ))2 + Because of the products of binomial terms, the computation of the variance using this expression is inefﬁcient even for relatively small values of m and n. This expression can however be reduced using the identities presented in the previous section which leads to signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient computations that we have been using in all our experiments. Corollary 1 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with ((m+n−2)Z4 −(2m−n+3k−10)Z3 ) k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = (m+n+1)(m+n)(m+n−1)T72m2 n2 + (m+n+1)(m+n)T (m2 −nm+3km−5m+2k2 −nk+12−9k)Z2 48m2 n2 (m+n+1)Q1 Z1 kQ0 + 144m2 n2 with: 2 n2 72m Pk−i m+n+1−i Zi = x=0 Pk ( x=0 x (m+n+1) x ) − 2 (m+n+1)2 (m−n)4 Z1 16m2 n2 − , T = 3((m − n)2 + m + n) + 2, and: Q0 = (m + n + 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn + 3m + 1)T − 12(3mn + m + n) − 8)k + (−3m2 + 7m + 10n + 3nm + 10)T − 4(3mn + m + n + 1) Q1 = T k3 + 3(m − 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn − 3m + 8)T − 6(6mn + m + n))k + (−3m2 + 7(m + n) + 3mn)T − 2(6mn + m + n) Proof. The expression of the variance given in Proposition 3 requires the computation of Xq (k, m, n), q = 0, 1, 2. Using the identities giving the expressions of X0 and X1 and Proposition 1, which provides the expression of X2 , σ 2 (A) can be reduced to the expression given by the corollary. 6 Theory and Analysis Our estimate of the conﬁdence interval for the AUC is based on a simple and natural assumption. The main idea for its computation is the following. Assume that a conﬁdence interval E = [e1 , e2 ] is given for the error rate of a classiﬁer C over a sample S, with the conﬁdence level 1 − . This interval may have have been derived from a binomial model of C, which is a standard assumption for determining a conﬁdence interval for the error rate, or from any other model used to compute that interval. For a given error rate e ∈ E, or equivalently for a given number of misclassiﬁcations, we can use the expectation and variance computed in the previous section and Chebyshev’s inequality to predict a conﬁdence interval Ae for the AUC at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Since our equiprobable model for the classiﬁcations is independent of the model used to compute the interval of conﬁdence for the error rate, we can use E and Ae , e ∈ E, to compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC at the level (1 − )(1 − ). Theorem 1 Let C be a binary classiﬁer and let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n. Let E = [e1 , e2 ] be a conﬁdence interval for the error rate of C over S at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ) that depends only on , , m, n, and the interval E. Proof. Let k1 = N e1 and k2 = N e2 be the number of errors associated to the error rates e1 and e2 , and let IK be the interval IK = [k1 , k2 ]. For a ﬁxed k ∈ IK , by Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, we can compute the exact value of the expectation E[Ak ] and variance σ 2 (Ak ) of the AUC Ak . Using Chebyshev’s inequality, for any k ∈ IK and any k > 0, σ(Ak ) P |Ak − E[Ak ]| ≥ √ k ≤ (7) k where E[Ak ] and σ(Ak ) are the expressions given in Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, which depend only on k, m, and n. Let α1 and α2 be deﬁned by: α1 = min k∈IK σ(Ak ) E[Ak ] − √ σ(Ak ) α2 = max E[Ak ] + √ k∈IK k (8) k α1 and α2 only depend on IK (i.e., on e1 and e2 ), and on k, m, and n. Let IA be the conﬁdence interval deﬁned by IA = [α1 , α2 ] and let k = for all k ∈ IK . Using the fact that the conﬁdence interval E is independent of our equiprobability model for ﬁxed-k AUC values and the Bayes’ rule: P(A ∈ IA ) = k∈R+ ≥ k∈IK P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (9) P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (10) ≥ (1 − ) k∈IK P (K = k) ≥ (1 − )(1 − ) (11) where we used the property of Eq. 7 and the deﬁnitions of the intervals IK and IA . Thus, IA constitutes a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ). In practice, the conﬁdence interval E is often determined as a result of the assumption that C follows a binomial law. This leads to the following theorem. .020 .035 Standard deviation Standard deviation .030 .015 .010 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .005 .025 .020 .015 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .010 .005 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 0.6 0.7 0.8 AUC (a) 0.9 1.0 AUC (b) Figure 1: Comparison of the standard deviations for three different methods with: (a) m = n = 500; (b) m = 400 and n = 200. The curves are obtained by computing the expected AUC and its standard deviations for different values of the error rate using the maximum-variance approach (Eq. 3), our distribution-independent method, and the distribution-dependent approach of Hanley [10]. Theorem 2 Let C be a binary classiﬁer, let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n, and let k0 be the number of misclassiﬁcations of C on S. Assume that C follows a binomial law, then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on , k0 , m, and n. Proof. Assume that C follows a binomial law with coefﬁcient p. Then, Chebyshev’s inequality yields: 1 p(1 − p) ≤ (12) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2 Nη 4N η 2 1 1 Thus, E = [ k0 − √ √ , k0 + √ √ ] forms a conﬁdence interval for the N 2 (1− 1− )N N 2 √ (1− 1− )N error rate of C at the conﬁdence level 1 − . By Theorem 1, we can√ compute for the √ AUC value a conﬁdence interval at the level (1 − (1 − 1 − ))(1 − (1 − 1 − )) = 1 − depending only on , m, n, and the interval E, i.e., k0 , N = m + n, and . For large N , we can use the normal approximation of the binomial law to determine a ﬁner interval E. Indeed, for large N , √ (13) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2Φ(2 N η) with Φ(u) = ∞ e−x2 /2 √ dx. u 2π Thus, E = [ k0 − N √ Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) k0 √ ,N 2 N √ conﬁdence interval for the error rate at the conﬁdence level √ + Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) √ ] 2 N is the 1− . For simplicity, in the proof of Theorem 2, k was chosen to be a constant ( k = ) but, in general, it can be another function of k leading to tighter conﬁdence intervals. The results presented in the next section were obtained with k = a0 exp((k − k0 )2 /2a2 ), where a0 1 and a1 are constants selected so that the inequality 11 be veriﬁed. 7 Experiments and Comparisons The analysis in the previous section provides a principled method for computing a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of a classier C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on k, n and m. As already discussed, other expressions found in the statistical literature lead to either too loose or unsafely narrow conﬁdence intervals based on questionable assumptions on the probability functions Px and Py [10, 15].

(2) with the values of A, Pxxy , and Pxyy derived from data. σdep is the distribution-dependent standard deviation of Hanley [10], which is based on assumptions that may not always hold. σmax is deﬁned by Eq. (3). All results were obtained on a randomly selected test set of size m + n. various error rates. For m = n = 500, our distribution-independent method consistently leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1 (a)). It also leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals for AUC values more than .75 for the uneven distribution m = 400 and n = 200 (Fig. 1 (b)). For lower AUC values, the distribution-dependent approach produces tighter intervals, but its underlying assumptions may not hold. A different comparison was made using several datasets available from the UC Irvine repository (Table 1). The table shows that our estimates of the standard deviations (σindep ) are in general close to or tighter than the distribution-dependent standard deviation σdep of Hanley [10]. This is despite we do not make any assumption about the distributions of positive and negative examples. In contrast, Hanley’s method is based on speciﬁc assumptions about these distributions. Plots of the actual ranking distribution demonstrate that these assumptions are often violated however. Thus, the relatively good performance of Hanley’s approach on several data sets can be viewed as fortuitous and is not general. Our distribution-independent method provides tight conﬁdence intervals, in some cases tighter than those derived from σA , in particular because it exploits the information provided by the error rate. Our analysis can also be used to determine if the AUC values produced by two classiﬁers are statistically signiﬁcant by checking if the AUC value of one falls within the conﬁdence interval of the other. 8 Conclusion We presented principled techniques for computing useful conﬁdence intervals for the AUC from simple parameters: the error rate, and the negative and positive sample sizes. We demonstrated the practicality of these conﬁdence intervals by comparing them to previous approaches in several tasks. We also derived the exact expression of the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed k, which can be of interest in other analyses related to the AUC. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is a general measure of the quality of a ranking that is an estimate of the probability that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. One could argue that accuracy at the top or the bottom of the ranking is of higher importance. This, however, contrarily to some belief, is already captured to a certain degree by the deﬁnition of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic which penalizes more errors at the top or the bottom of the ranking. It is however an interesting research problem to determine how to incorporate this bias in a stricter way in the form of a score-speciﬁc weight in the ranking measure, a weighted WilcoxonMann-Whitney statistic, or how to compute the corresponding expected value and standard deviation in a general way and design machine learning algorithms to optimize such a mea- sure. A preliminary analysis suggests, however, that the calculation of the expectation and the variance are likely to be extremely complex in that case. Finally, it could also be interesting but difﬁcult to adapt our results to the distribution-dependent case and compare them to those of [10].

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-conﬁdence is larger than that required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function with the same conﬁdence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. 1</p><p>4 0.12537023 <a title="156-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-On_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">136 nips-2004-On Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Krishnapuram, David Williams, Ya Xue, Lawrence Carin, Mário Figueiredo, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: A graph-based prior is proposed for parametric semi-supervised classiﬁcation. The prior utilizes both labelled and unlabelled data; it also integrates features from multiple views of a given sample (e.g., multiple sensors), thus implementing a Bayesian form of co-training. An EM algorithm for training the classiﬁer automatically adjusts the tradeoff between the contributions of: (a) the labelled data; (b) the unlabelled data; and (c) the co-training information. Active label query selection is performed using a mutual information based criterion that explicitly uses the unlabelled data and the co-training information. Encouraging results are presented on public benchmarks and on measured data from single and multiple sensors. 1</p><p>5 0.10154948 <a title="156-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Instance-Based_Relevance_Feedback_for_Image_Retrieval.html">85 nips-2004-Instance-Based Relevance Feedback for Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Giorgio Gia\-cin\-to, Fabio Roli</p><p>Abstract: High retrieval precision in content-based image retrieval can be attained by adopting relevance feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms require that the user judges the quality of the results of the query by marking all the retrieved images as being either relevant or not. Then, the search engine exploits this information to adapt the search to better meet user’s needs. At present, the vast majority of proposed relevance feedback mechanisms are formulated in terms of search model that has to be optimized. Such an optimization involves the modification of some search parameters so that the nearest neighbor of the query vector contains the largest number of relevant images. In this paper, a different approach to relevance feedback is proposed. After the user provides the first feedback, following retrievals are not based on knn search, but on the computation of a relevance score for each image of the database. This score is computed as a function of two distances, namely the distance from the nearest non-relevant image and the distance from the nearest relevant one. Images are then ranked according to this score and the top k images are displayed. Reported results on three image data sets show that the proposed mechanism outperforms other state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms. 1 In t rod u ct i on A large number of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems rely on the vector representation of images in a multidimensional feature space representing low-level image characteristics, e.g., color, texture, shape, etc. [1]. Content-based queries are often expressed by visual examples in order to retrieve from the database the images that are “similar” to the examples. This kind of retrieval is often referred to as K nearest-neighbor retrieval. It is easy to see that the effectiveness of content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) strongly depends on the choice of the set of visual features, on the choice of the “metric” used to model the user’s perception of image similarity, and on the choice of the image used to query the database [1]. Typically, if we allow different users to mark the images retrieved with a given query as relevant or non-relevant, different subsets of images will be marked as relevant. Accordingly, the need for mechanisms to adapt the CBIR system response based on some feedback from the user is widely recognized. It is interesting to note that while relevance feedback mechanisms have been first introduced in the information retrieval field [2], they are receiving more attention in the CBIR field (Huang). The vast majority of relevance feedback techniques proposed in the literature is based on modifying the values of the search parameters as to better represent the concept the user bears in mind. To this end, search parameters are computed as a function of the relevance values assigned by the user to all the images retrieved so far. As an example, relevance feedback is often formulated in terms of the modification of the query vector, and/or in terms of adaptive similarity metrics. [3]-[7]. Recently, pattern classification paradigms such as SVMs have been proposed [8]. Feedback is thus used to model the concept of relevant images and adjust the search consequently. Concept modeling may be difficult on account of the distribution of relevant images in the selected feature space. “Narrow domain” image databases allows extracting good features, so that images bearing similar concepts belong to compact clusters. On the other hand, “broad domain” databases, such as image collection used by graphic professionals, or those made up of images from the Internet, are more difficult to subdivide in cluster because of the high variability of concepts [1]. In these cases, it is worth extracting only low level, non-specialized features, and image retrieval is better formulated in terms of a search problem rather then concept modeling. The present paper aims at offering an original contribution in this direction. Rather then modeling the concept of “relevance” the user bears in mind, feedback is used to assign each image of the database a relevance score. Such a score depends only from two dissimilarities (distances) computed against the images already marked by the user: the dissimilarity from the set of relevant images, and the dissimilarity from the set of non-relevant images. Despite its computational simplicity, this mechanism allows outperforming state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms both on “narrow domain” databases, and on “broad domain” databases. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the idea behind the proposed mechanism and provides the basic assumptions. Section 3 details the proposed relevance feedback mechanism. Results on three image data sets are presented in Section 4, where performances of other relevance feedback mechanisms are compared. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 In st an ce- b ased rel evan ce est i m at i on The proposed mechanism has been inspired by classification techniques based on the “nearest case” [9]-[10]. Nearest-case theory provided the mechanism to compute the dissimilarity of each image from the sets of relevant and non–relevant images. The ratio between the nearest relevant image and the nearest non-relevant image has been used to compute the degree of relevance of each image of the database [11]. The present section illustrates the rationale behind the use of the nearest-case paradigm. Let us assume that each image of the database has been represented by a number of low-level features, and that a (dis)similarity measure has been defined so that the proximity between pairs of images represents some kind of “conceptual” similarity. In other words, the chosen feature space and similarity metric is meaningful at least for a restricted number of users. A search in image databases is usually performed by retrieving the k most similar images with respect to a given query. The dimension of k is usually small, to avoid displaying a large number of images at a time. Typical values for k are between 10 and 20. However, as the “relevant” images that the user wishes to retrieve may not fit perfectly with the similarity metric designed for the search engine, the user may be interested in exploring other regions of the feature space. To this end, the user marks the subset of “relevant” images out of the k retrieved. Usually, such relevance feedback is used to perform a new k-nn search by modifying some search parameters, i.e., the position of the query point, the similarity metric, and other tuning parameters [1]-[7]. Recent works proposed the use of support vector machine to learn the distribution of relevant images [8]. These techniques require some assumption about the general form of the distribution of relevant images in the feature space. As it is difficult to make any assumption about such a distribution for broad domain databases, we propose to exploit the information about the relevance of the images retrieved so far in a nearest-neighbor fashion. Nearest-neighbor techniques, as used in statistical pattern recognition, case-based reasoning, or instance-based learning, are effective in all applications where it is difficult to produce a high-level generalization of a “class” of objects [9]-[10],[12][13]. Relevance learning in content base image retrieval may well fit into this definition, as it is difficult to provide a general model that can be adapted to represent different concepts of similarity. In addition, the number of available cases may be too small to estimate the optimal set of parameters for such a general model. On the other hand, it can be more effective to use each “relevant” image as well as each “non-relevant” image, as “cases” or “instances” against which the images of the database should be compared. Consequently, we assume that an image is as much as relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest relevant image is small. Analogously, an image is as much as non-relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest non-relevant image is small. 3 Rel evan ce S core Com p u t ati on According to previous section, each image of the database can be thus characterized by a “degree of relevance” and a “degree of non-relevance” according to the dissimilarities from the nearest relevant image, and from the nearest non-relevant image, respectively. However, it should be noted that these degrees should be treated differently because only “relevant” images represent a “concept” in the user’s mind, while “non-relevant” images may represent a number of other concepts different from user’s interest. In other words, while it is meaningful to treat the degree of relevance as a degree of membership to the class of relevant images, the same does not apply to the degree of non-relevance. For this reason, we propose to use the “degree of non-relevance” to weight the “degree of relevance”. Let us denote with R the subset of indexes j ∈ {1,...,k} related to the set of relevant images retrieved so far and the original query (that is relevant by default), and with NR the subset of indexes j ∈ (1,...,k} related to the set of non-relevant images retrieved so far. For each image I of the database, according to the nearest neighbor rule, let us compute the dissimilarity from the nearest image in R and the dissimilarity from the nearest image in NR. Let us denote these dissimilarities as dR(I) and dNR(I), respectively. The value of dR(I) can be clearly used to measure the degree of relevance of image I, assuming that small values of dR(I) are related to very relevant images. On the other hand, the hypothesis that image I is relevant to the user’s query can be supported by a high value of dNR(I). Accordingly, we defined the relevance score ! dR ( I ) $ relevance ( I ) = # 1 + dN ( I ) &</p><p>6 0.10083131 <a title="156-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Euclidean_Embedding_of_Co-Occurrence_Data.html">62 nips-2004-Euclidean Embedding of Co-Occurrence Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Steve Gunn, Asa Ben-Hur, Gideon Dror</p><p>Abstract: The NIPS 2003 workshops included a feature selection competition organized by the authors. We provided participants with ﬁve datasets from diﬀerent application domains and called for classiﬁcation results using a minimal number of features. The competition took place over a period of 13 weeks and attracted 78 research groups. Participants were asked to make on-line submissions on the validation and test sets, with performance on the validation set being presented immediately to the participant and performance on the test set presented to the participants at the workshop. In total 1863 entries were made on the validation sets during the development period and 135 entries on all test sets for the ﬁnal competition. The winners used a combination of Bayesian neural networks with ARD priors and Dirichlet diﬀusion trees. Other top entries used a variety of methods for feature selection, which combined ﬁlters and/or wrapper or embedded methods using Random Forests, kernel methods, or neural networks as a classiﬁcation engine. The results of the benchmark (including the predictions made by the participants and the features they selected) and the scoring software are publicly available. The benchmark is available at www.nipsfsc.ecs.soton.ac.uk for post-challenge submissions to stimulate further research. 1</p><p>2 0.64616269 <a title="156-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-A_Large_Deviation_Bound_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">7 nips-2004-A Large Deviation Bound for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>

<p>Author: Omid Madani, David M. Pennock, Gary W. Flake</p><p>Abstract: In the context of binary classiﬁcation, we deﬁne disagreement as a measure of how often two independently-trained models differ in their classiﬁcation of unlabeled data. We explore the use of disagreement for error estimation and model selection. We call the procedure co-validation, since the two models effectively (in)validate one another by comparing results on unlabeled data, which we assume is relatively cheap and plentiful compared to labeled data. We show that per-instance disagreement is an unbiased estimate of the variance of error for that instance. We also show that disagreement provides a lower bound on the prediction (generalization) error, and a tight upper bound on the “variance of prediction error”, or the variance of the average error across instances, where variance is measured across training sets. We present experimental results on several data sets exploring co-validation for error estimation and model selection. The procedure is especially effective in active learning settings, where training sets are not drawn at random and cross validation overestimates error. 1</p><p>4 0.61270016 <a title="156-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">45 nips-2004-Confidence Intervals for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, good ranking is a highly desirable performance for a classiﬁer. The criterion commonly used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To report it properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value. This paper provides conﬁdence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard conﬁdence intervals given in the case of the error rate. They are compared with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. 1 Motivation In many machine learning applications, the ranking quality of a classiﬁer is critical. For example, the ordering of the list of relevant documents returned by a search engine or a document classiﬁcation system is essential. The criterion widely used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under an ROC curve (AUC). But, to measure and report the AUC properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value as it is customary for the error rate and other measures. It is also important to make the computation of the conﬁdence interval practical by relying only on a small and simple number of parameters. In the case of the error rate, such intervals are often derived from just the sample size N . We present an extensive theoretical analysis of the AUC and show that a similar conﬁdence interval can be derived for its value using only simple parameters such as the error rate k/N , the number of positive examples m, and the number of negative examples n = N − m. Thus, our results extend to AUC the computation of conﬁdence intervals from a small number of readily available parameters. Our analysis is distribution-independent in the sense that it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The use of the error rate helps determine tight conﬁdence intervals. This contrasts with existing approaches presented in the statistical literature [11, 5, 2] which are based either on weak distribution-independent assumptions resulting in too loose conﬁdence intervals, or strong distribution-dependent assumptions leading to tight but unsafe conﬁdence intervals. We show that our results are of practical use. We also compare them with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. Our results are also useful for testing the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference of the AUC values of two classiﬁers. The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the deﬁnition of the AUC, its connection with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic (Section 2), and brieﬂy review some essential aspects of the existing literature related to the computation of conﬁdence intervals for the AUC. Our computation of the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate requires establishing several combinatorial identities. Section 4 presents some existing identities and gives the proof of novel ones useful for the computation of the variance. Section 5 gives the reduced expressions for the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate. These can be efﬁciently computed and used to determine our conﬁdence intervals for the AUC (Section 6). Section 7 reports the result of the comparison of our method with previous approaches, including empirical results for several standard tasks. 2 Deﬁnition and Properties of the AUC The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were originally introduced in signal detection theory [6] in connection with the study of radio signals, and have been used since then in many other applications, in particular for medical decision-making. Over the last few years, they have found increased interest in the machine learning and data mining communities for model evaluation and selection [14, 13, 7, 12, 16, 3]. The ROC curve for a binary classiﬁcation problem plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate. The points of the curve are obtained by sweeping the classiﬁcation threshold from the most positive classiﬁcation value to the most negative. For a fully random classiﬁcation, the ROC curve is a straight line connecting the origin to (1, 1). Any improvement over random classiﬁcation results in an ROC curve at least partially above this straight line. The AUC is deﬁned as the area under the ROC curve. Consider a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples. Let C be a ﬁxed classiﬁer that outputs a strictly ordered list for these examples. Let x1 , . . . , xm be the output of C on the positive examples and y1 , . . . , yn its output on the negative examples and denote by 1X the indicator function of a set X. Then, the AUC, A, associated to C is given by: A= m i=1 n j=1 1xi >yj (1) mn which is the value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [10]. Thus, the AUC is closely related to the ranking quality of the classiﬁcation. It can be viewed as a measure based on pairwise comparisons between classiﬁcations of the two classes. It is an estimate of the probability Pxy that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. With a perfect ranking, all positive examples are ranked higher than the negative ones and A = 1. Any deviation from this ranking decreases the AUC, and the expected AUC value for a random ranking is 0.5. 3 Overview of Related Work This section brieﬂy describes some previous distribution-dependent approaches presented in the statistical literature to derive conﬁdence intervals for the AUC and compares them to our method. The starting point for these analyses is a formula giving the variance of the AUC, A, for a ﬁxed distribution of the scores Px of the positive examples and Py of the negative examples [10, 1]: 2 σA = A(1 − A) + (m − 1)(Pxxy − A2 ) + (n − 1)(Pxyy − A2 ) mn (2) where Pxxy is the probability that the classiﬁer ranks two randomly chosen positive examples higher than a negative one, and Pxyy the probability that it ranks two randomly chosen negative examples lower than a positive one. To compute the variance exactly using Equation 2, the distributions Px and Py must be known. Hanley and McNeil [10] argue in favor of exponential distributions, loosely claiming that this upper-bounds the variance of normal distributions with various means and ratios of A 2A2 variances. They show that for exponential distributions Pxxy = 2−A and Pxyy = 1+A . The resulting conﬁdence intervals are of course relatively tight, but their validity is questionable since they are based on a strong assumption about the distributions of the positive and negative scores that may not hold in many cases. An alternative considered by several authors to the exact computation of the variance is to determine instead the maximum of the variance over all possible continuous distributions with the same expected value of the AUC. For all such distributions, one can ﬁx m and n and compute the expected AUC and its variance. The maximum variance is denoted by 2 σmax and is given by [5, 2]: 2 σmax = A(1 − A) 1 ≤ min {m, n} 4 min {m, n} (3) Unfortunately, this often yields loose conﬁdence intervals of limited practical use. Our approach for computing the mean and variance of the AUC is distribution-independent and inspired by the machine learning literature where analyses typically center on the error rate. We require only that the error rate be measured and compute the mean and variance of the AUC over all distributions Px and Py that maintain the same error rate. Our approach is in line with that of [5, 2] but it crucially avoids considering the maximum of the variance. We show that it is possible to compute directly the mean and variance of the AUC assigning equal weight to all the possible distributions. Of course, one could argue that not all distributions Px and Py are equally probable, but since these distributions are highly problem-dependent, we ﬁnd it risky to make any general assumption on the distributions and thereby limit the validity of our results. Our approach is further justiﬁed empirically by the experiments reported in the last section. 4 Combinatorial Analysis The analysis of the statistical properties of the AUC given a ﬁxed error rate requires various combinatorial calculations. This section describes several of the combinatorial identities that are used in our computation of the conﬁdence intervals. For all q ≥ 0, let Xq (k, m, n) be deﬁned by: k M M Xq (k, m, n) = xq (4) x x x=0 where M = m − (k − x) + x, M = n + (k − x) − x, and x = k − x. In previous work, we derived the following two identities which we used to compute the expected value of the AUC [4]: k X0 (k, m, n) = x=0 n+m+1 x k X1 (k, m, n) = (k − x)(m − n) + k n + m + 1 2 x x=0 To simplify the expression of the variance of the AUC, we need to compute X2 (k, m, n). Proposition 1 Let k, m, n be non-negative integers such that k ≤ min{m, n}, then: k X2 (k, m, n) = P2 (k, m, n, x) x=0 m+n+1 x (5) where P2 is the following 4th-degree polynomial: P2 (k, m, n, x) = (k − x)/12(−2x3 + 2x2 (2m − n + 2k − 4) + x(−3m2 + 3nm + 3m − 5km − 2k 2 + 2 + k + nk + 6n) + (3(k − 1)m2 − 3nm(k − 1) + 6km + 5m + k 2 m + 8n + 8 − 9nk + 3k + k 2 + k 2 n)). Proof. 5 The proof of the proposition is left to a longer version of this paper. Expectation and Variance of the AUC This section presents the expression of the expectation and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate k/N assuming that all classiﬁcations or rankings with k errors are equiprobable. For a given classiﬁcation, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false positive examples. Since the number of errors is ﬁxed, there are x = k − x false negative examples. The expression Xq discussed in the previous section represents the q-th moment of x over all classiﬁcations with exactly k errors. In previous work, we gave the exact expression of the expectation of the AUC for a ﬁxed number of errors k: Proposition 2 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the expected value of the AUC, A, over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: E[A] = 1 − k (n − m)2 (m + n + 1) − m+n 4mn k − m+n k−1 m+n x=0 x k m+n+1 x=0 x . Note that the two sums in this expression cannot be further simpliﬁed since they are known not to admit a closed form [9]. We also gave the expression of the variance of the AUC in terms of the function F deﬁned for all Y by: F (Y ) = k M M x=0 x x k M M x=0 x x Y . (6) The following proposition reproduces that result: Proposition 3 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = F ((1 − k−x x n+ m )2 ) 2 2 2 F ( mx +n(k−x) +(m(m+1)x+n(n+1)(k−x))−2x(k−x)(m+n+1) ). 12m2 n2 − F ((1 − k−x x n+ m 2 ))2 + Because of the products of binomial terms, the computation of the variance using this expression is inefﬁcient even for relatively small values of m and n. This expression can however be reduced using the identities presented in the previous section which leads to signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient computations that we have been using in all our experiments. Corollary 1 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with ((m+n−2)Z4 −(2m−n+3k−10)Z3 ) k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = (m+n+1)(m+n)(m+n−1)T72m2 n2 + (m+n+1)(m+n)T (m2 −nm+3km−5m+2k2 −nk+12−9k)Z2 48m2 n2 (m+n+1)Q1 Z1 kQ0 + 144m2 n2 with: 2 n2 72m Pk−i m+n+1−i Zi = x=0 Pk ( x=0 x (m+n+1) x ) − 2 (m+n+1)2 (m−n)4 Z1 16m2 n2 − , T = 3((m − n)2 + m + n) + 2, and: Q0 = (m + n + 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn + 3m + 1)T − 12(3mn + m + n) − 8)k + (−3m2 + 7m + 10n + 3nm + 10)T − 4(3mn + m + n + 1) Q1 = T k3 + 3(m − 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn − 3m + 8)T − 6(6mn + m + n))k + (−3m2 + 7(m + n) + 3mn)T − 2(6mn + m + n) Proof. The expression of the variance given in Proposition 3 requires the computation of Xq (k, m, n), q = 0, 1, 2. Using the identities giving the expressions of X0 and X1 and Proposition 1, which provides the expression of X2 , σ 2 (A) can be reduced to the expression given by the corollary. 6 Theory and Analysis Our estimate of the conﬁdence interval for the AUC is based on a simple and natural assumption. The main idea for its computation is the following. Assume that a conﬁdence interval E = [e1 , e2 ] is given for the error rate of a classiﬁer C over a sample S, with the conﬁdence level 1 − . This interval may have have been derived from a binomial model of C, which is a standard assumption for determining a conﬁdence interval for the error rate, or from any other model used to compute that interval. For a given error rate e ∈ E, or equivalently for a given number of misclassiﬁcations, we can use the expectation and variance computed in the previous section and Chebyshev’s inequality to predict a conﬁdence interval Ae for the AUC at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Since our equiprobable model for the classiﬁcations is independent of the model used to compute the interval of conﬁdence for the error rate, we can use E and Ae , e ∈ E, to compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC at the level (1 − )(1 − ). Theorem 1 Let C be a binary classiﬁer and let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n. Let E = [e1 , e2 ] be a conﬁdence interval for the error rate of C over S at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ) that depends only on , , m, n, and the interval E. Proof. Let k1 = N e1 and k2 = N e2 be the number of errors associated to the error rates e1 and e2 , and let IK be the interval IK = [k1 , k2 ]. For a ﬁxed k ∈ IK , by Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, we can compute the exact value of the expectation E[Ak ] and variance σ 2 (Ak ) of the AUC Ak . Using Chebyshev’s inequality, for any k ∈ IK and any k > 0, σ(Ak ) P |Ak − E[Ak ]| ≥ √ k ≤ (7) k where E[Ak ] and σ(Ak ) are the expressions given in Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, which depend only on k, m, and n. Let α1 and α2 be deﬁned by: α1 = min k∈IK σ(Ak ) E[Ak ] − √ σ(Ak ) α2 = max E[Ak ] + √ k∈IK k (8) k α1 and α2 only depend on IK (i.e., on e1 and e2 ), and on k, m, and n. Let IA be the conﬁdence interval deﬁned by IA = [α1 , α2 ] and let k = for all k ∈ IK . Using the fact that the conﬁdence interval E is independent of our equiprobability model for ﬁxed-k AUC values and the Bayes’ rule: P(A ∈ IA ) = k∈R+ ≥ k∈IK P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (9) P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (10) ≥ (1 − ) k∈IK P (K = k) ≥ (1 − )(1 − ) (11) where we used the property of Eq. 7 and the deﬁnitions of the intervals IK and IA . Thus, IA constitutes a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ). In practice, the conﬁdence interval E is often determined as a result of the assumption that C follows a binomial law. This leads to the following theorem. .020 .035 Standard deviation Standard deviation .030 .015 .010 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .005 .025 .020 .015 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .010 .005 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 0.6 0.7 0.8 AUC (a) 0.9 1.0 AUC (b) Figure 1: Comparison of the standard deviations for three different methods with: (a) m = n = 500; (b) m = 400 and n = 200. The curves are obtained by computing the expected AUC and its standard deviations for different values of the error rate using the maximum-variance approach (Eq. 3), our distribution-independent method, and the distribution-dependent approach of Hanley [10]. Theorem 2 Let C be a binary classiﬁer, let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n, and let k0 be the number of misclassiﬁcations of C on S. Assume that C follows a binomial law, then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on , k0 , m, and n. Proof. Assume that C follows a binomial law with coefﬁcient p. Then, Chebyshev’s inequality yields: 1 p(1 − p) ≤ (12) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2 Nη 4N η 2 1 1 Thus, E = [ k0 − √ √ , k0 + √ √ ] forms a conﬁdence interval for the N 2 (1− 1− )N N 2 √ (1− 1− )N error rate of C at the conﬁdence level 1 − . By Theorem 1, we can√ compute for the √ AUC value a conﬁdence interval at the level (1 − (1 − 1 − ))(1 − (1 − 1 − )) = 1 − depending only on , m, n, and the interval E, i.e., k0 , N = m + n, and . For large N , we can use the normal approximation of the binomial law to determine a ﬁner interval E. Indeed, for large N , √ (13) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2Φ(2 N η) with Φ(u) = ∞ e−x2 /2 √ dx. u 2π Thus, E = [ k0 − N √ Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) k0 √ ,N 2 N √ conﬁdence interval for the error rate at the conﬁdence level √ + Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) √ ] 2 N is the 1− . For simplicity, in the proof of Theorem 2, k was chosen to be a constant ( k = ) but, in general, it can be another function of k leading to tighter conﬁdence intervals. The results presented in the next section were obtained with k = a0 exp((k − k0 )2 /2a2 ), where a0 1 and a1 are constants selected so that the inequality 11 be veriﬁed. 7 Experiments and Comparisons The analysis in the previous section provides a principled method for computing a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of a classier C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on k, n and m. As already discussed, other expressions found in the statistical literature lead to either too loose or unsafely narrow conﬁdence intervals based on questionable assumptions on the probability functions Px and Py [10, 15].

(2) with the values of A, Pxxy , and Pxyy derived from data. σdep is the distribution-dependent standard deviation of Hanley [10], which is based on assumptions that may not always hold. σmax is deﬁned by Eq. (3). All results were obtained on a randomly selected test set of size m + n. various error rates. For m = n = 500, our distribution-independent method consistently leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1 (a)). It also leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals for AUC values more than .75 for the uneven distribution m = 400 and n = 200 (Fig. 1 (b)). For lower AUC values, the distribution-dependent approach produces tighter intervals, but its underlying assumptions may not hold. A different comparison was made using several datasets available from the UC Irvine repository (Table 1). The table shows that our estimates of the standard deviations (σindep ) are in general close to or tighter than the distribution-dependent standard deviation σdep of Hanley [10]. This is despite we do not make any assumption about the distributions of positive and negative examples. In contrast, Hanley’s method is based on speciﬁc assumptions about these distributions. Plots of the actual ranking distribution demonstrate that these assumptions are often violated however. Thus, the relatively good performance of Hanley’s approach on several data sets can be viewed as fortuitous and is not general. Our distribution-independent method provides tight conﬁdence intervals, in some cases tighter than those derived from σA , in particular because it exploits the information provided by the error rate. Our analysis can also be used to determine if the AUC values produced by two classiﬁers are statistically signiﬁcant by checking if the AUC value of one falls within the conﬁdence interval of the other. 8 Conclusion We presented principled techniques for computing useful conﬁdence intervals for the AUC from simple parameters: the error rate, and the negative and positive sample sizes. We demonstrated the practicality of these conﬁdence intervals by comparing them to previous approaches in several tasks. We also derived the exact expression of the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed k, which can be of interest in other analyses related to the AUC. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is a general measure of the quality of a ranking that is an estimate of the probability that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. One could argue that accuracy at the top or the bottom of the ranking is of higher importance. This, however, contrarily to some belief, is already captured to a certain degree by the deﬁnition of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic which penalizes more errors at the top or the bottom of the ranking. It is however an interesting research problem to determine how to incorporate this bias in a stricter way in the form of a score-speciﬁc weight in the ranking measure, a weighted WilcoxonMann-Whitney statistic, or how to compute the corresponding expected value and standard deviation in a general way and design machine learning algorithms to optimize such a mea- sure. A preliminary analysis suggests, however, that the calculation of the expectation and the variance are likely to be extremely complex in that case. Finally, it could also be interesting but difﬁcult to adapt our results to the distribution-dependent case and compare them to those of [10].

The evaluation for such a ranking is generally given in terms of the number of violated order constraints between classes.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Steve Gunn, Asa Ben-Hur, Gideon Dror</p><p>Abstract: The NIPS 2003 workshops included a feature selection competition organized by the authors. We provided participants with ﬁve datasets from diﬀerent application domains and called for classiﬁcation results using a minimal number of features. The competition took place over a period of 13 weeks and attracted 78 research groups. Participants were asked to make on-line submissions on the validation and test sets, with performance on the validation set being presented immediately to the participant and performance on the test set presented to the participants at the workshop. In total 1863 entries were made on the validation sets during the development period and 135 entries on all test sets for the ﬁnal competition. The winners used a combination of Bayesian neural networks with ARD priors and Dirichlet diﬀusion trees. Other top entries used a variety of methods for feature selection, which combined ﬁlters and/or wrapper or embedded methods using Random Forests, kernel methods, or neural networks as a classiﬁcation engine. The results of the benchmark (including the predictions made by the participants and the features they selected) and the scoring software are publicly available. The benchmark is available at www.nipsfsc.ecs.soton.ac.uk for post-challenge submissions to stimulate further research. 1</p><p>2 0.58454609 <a title="156-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Analysis_of_a_greedy_active_learning_strategy.html">23 nips-2004-Analysis of a greedy active learning strategy</a></p>

<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for computing fast approximations to support vector decision functions in the ﬁeld of object detection. In the present approach we are building on an existing algorithm where the set of support vectors is replaced by a smaller, so-called reduced set of synthesized input space points. In contrast to the existing method that ﬁnds the reduced set via unconstrained optimization, we impose a structural constraint on the synthetic points such that the resulting approximations can be evaluated via separable ﬁlters. For applications that require scanning large images, this decreases the computational complexity by a signiﬁcant amount. Experimental results show that in face detection, rank deﬁcient approximations are 4 to 6 times faster than unconstrained reduced set systems. 1</p><p>4 0.57940531 <a title="156-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_via_Gaussian_Processes.html">166 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning via Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic approach to learning a Gaussian Process classiﬁer in the presence of unlabeled data. Our approach involves a “null category noise model” (NCNM) inspired by ordered categorical noise models. The noise model reﬂects an assumption that the data density is lower between the class-conditional densities. We illustrate our approach on a toy problem and present comparative results for the semi-supervised classiﬁcation of handwritten digits. 1</p><p>5 0.57850778 <a title="156-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-A_Method_for_Inferring_Label_Sampling_Mechanisms_in_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">9 nips-2004-A Method for Inferring Label Sampling Mechanisms in Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, Hui Zou, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the situation in semi-supervised learning, where the “label sampling” mechanism stochastically depends on the true response (as well as potentially on the features). We suggest a method of moments for estimating this stochastic dependence using the unlabeled data. This is potentially useful for two distinct purposes: a. As an input to a supervised learning procedure which can be used to “de-bias” its results using labeled data only and b. As a potentially interesting learning task in itself. We present several examples to illustrate the practical usefulness of our method.</p><p>6 0.57776701 <a title="156-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Information_Extraction.html">162 nips-2004-Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Information Extraction</a></p>

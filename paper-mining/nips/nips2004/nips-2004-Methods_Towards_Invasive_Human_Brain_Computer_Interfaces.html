<p>Author: N. J. Hill, Thomas N. Lal, Karin Bierig, Niels Birbaumer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the particular problems involved in communicating with “locked-in” paralysed patients, we aim to develop a braincomputer interface that uses auditory stimuli. We describe a paradigm that allows a user to make a binary decision by focusing attention on one of two concurrent auditory stimulus sequences. Using Support Vector Machine classiﬁcation and Recursive Channel Elimination on the independent components of averaged eventrelated potentials, we show that an untrained user’s EEG data can be classiﬁed with an encouragingly high level of accuracy. This suggests that it is possible for users to modulate EEG signals in a single trial by the conscious direction of attention, well enough to be useful in BCI. 1</p><p>3 0.247309 <a title="117-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks_for_Brain-Computer_Interfaces.html">56 nips-2004-Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to building brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and learning. We show how a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can be used to infer probability distributions over brain- and body-states during planning and execution of actions. The DBN is learned directly from observed data and allows measured signals such as EEG and EMG to be interpreted in terms of internal states such as intent to move, preparatory activity, and movement execution. Unlike traditional classiﬁcation-based approaches to BCI, the proposed approach (1) allows continuous tracking and prediction of internal states over time, and (2) generates control signals based on an entire probability distribution over states rather than binary yes/no decisions. We present preliminary results of brain- and body-state estimation using simultaneous EEG and EMG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task. 1</p><p>4 0.24026288 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Sparse_Coding_of_Natural_Images_Using_an_Overcomplete_Set_of_Limited_Capacity_Units.html">172 nips-2004-Sparse Coding of Natural Images Using an Overcomplete Set of Limited Capacity Units</a></p>
<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: It has been suggested that the primary goal of the sensory system is to represent input in such a way as to reduce the high degree of redundancy. Given a noisy neural representation, however, solely reducing redundancy is not desirable, since redundancy is the only clue to reduce the effects of noise. Here we propose a model that best balances redundancy reduction and redundant representation. Like previous models, our model accounts for the localized and oriented structure of simple cells, but it also predicts a different organization for the population. With noisy, limited-capacity units, the optimal representation becomes an overcomplete, multi-scale representation, which, compared to previous models, is in closer agreement with physiological data. These results offer a new perspective on the expansion of the number of neurons from retina to V1 and provide a theoretical model of incorporating useful redundancy into efﬁcient neural representations. 1</p><p>5 0.085236207 <a title="117-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Detecting_Significant_Multidimensional_Spatial_Clusters.html">51 nips-2004-Detecting Significant Multidimensional Spatial Clusters</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel B. Neill, Andrew W. Moore, Francisco Pereira, Tom M. Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Assume a uniform, multidimensional grid of bivariate data, where each cell of the grid has a count ci and a baseline bi . Our goal is to ﬁnd spatial regions (d-dimensional rectangles) where the ci are signiﬁcantly higher than expected given bi . We focus on two applications: detection of clusters of disease cases from epidemiological data (emergency department visits, over-the-counter drug sales), and discovery of regions of increased brain activity corresponding to given cognitive tasks (from fMRI data). Each of these problems can be solved using a spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff, 1997), where we compute the maximum of a likelihood ratio statistic over all spatial regions, and ﬁnd the signiﬁcance of this region by randomization. However, computing the scan statistic for all spatial regions is generally computationally infeasible, so we introduce a novel fast spatial scan algorithm, generalizing the 2D scan algorithm of (Neill and Moore, 2004) to arbitrary dimensions. Our new multidimensional multiresolution algorithm allows us to ﬁnd spatial clusters up to 1400x faster than the naive spatial scan, without any loss of accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.084445126 <a title="117-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Spike_Sorting%3A_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Non-Stationary_Data.html">174 nips-2004-Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data</a></p>

Using Support Vector Machine classiﬁcation and Recursive Channel Elimination on the independent components of averaged eventrelated potentials, we show that an untrained user’s EEG data can be classiﬁed with an encouragingly high level of accuracy. This suggests that it is possible for users to modulate EEG signals in a single trial by the conscious direction of attention, well enough to be useful in BCI. 1</p><p>3 0.4700287 <a title="117-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Saliency-Driven_Image_Acuity_Modulation_on_a_Reconfigurable_Array_of_Spiking_Silicon_Neurons.html">157 nips-2004-Saliency-Driven Image Acuity Modulation on a Reconfigurable Array of Spiking Silicon Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: R. J. Vogelstein, Udayan Mallik, Eugenio Culurciello, Gert Cauwenberghs, Ralph Etienne-Cummings</p><p>Abstract: We have constructed a system that uses an array of 9,600 spiking silicon neurons, a fast microcontroller, and digital memory, to implement a reconﬁgurable network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons. The system is designed for rapid prototyping of spiking neural networks that require high-throughput communication with external address-event hardware. Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to speciﬁc internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective ﬁeld mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by conﬁguring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience. 1</p><p>4 0.45288697 <a title="117-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-The_Convergence_of_Contrastive_Divergences.html">185 nips-2004-The Convergence of Contrastive Divergences</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: This paper analyses the Contrastive Divergence algorithm for learning statistical parameters. We relate the algorithm to the stochastic approximation literature. This enables us to specify conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution (with probability 1). This includes necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the solution to be unbiased.</p><p>5 0.40379459 <a title="117-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks_for_Brain-Computer_Interfaces.html">56 nips-2004-Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to building brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and learning. We show how a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can be used to infer probability distributions over brain- and body-states during planning and execution of actions. The DBN is learned directly from observed data and allows measured signals such as EEG and EMG to be interpreted in terms of internal states such as intent to move, preparatory activity, and movement execution. Unlike traditional classiﬁcation-based approaches to BCI, the proposed approach (1) allows continuous tracking and prediction of internal states over time, and (2) generates control signals based on an entire probability distribution over states rather than binary yes/no decisions. We present preliminary results of brain- and body-state estimation using simultaneous EEG and EMG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task. 1</p><p>6 0.40110692 <a title="117-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty.html">178 nips-2004-Support Vector Classification with Input Data Uncertainty</a></p>

</p><p>4 1  Introduction  Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in linear programming (LP) approaches to approximate dynamic programming (DP). [sent-5, score-0.453]
</p><p>5 These approaches oﬀer algorithms for computing weights to ﬁt a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions to a dynamic programming value function. [sent-6, score-0.328]
</p><p>6 A control policy that is “greedy” with respect to the resulting approximation is then used to make real-time decisions. [sent-7, score-0.274]
</p><p>7 Empirically, LP approaches appear to generate eﬀective control policies for highdimensional dynamic programs [1, 6, 11, 15, 16]. [sent-8, score-0.199]
</p><p>8 At the same time, the strength and clarity of theoretical results about such algorithms have overtaken counterparts available for alternatives such as approximate value iteration, approximate policy iteration, and temporal-diﬀerence methods. [sent-9, score-0.371]
</p><p>9 Here, the coeﬃcient of the O( ) term depends on the discount factor and the metric used for measuring distance, but not on the choice of basis functions. [sent-11, score-0.144]
</p><p>10 On the other hand, the strongest results available for approximate value iteration and approximate policy iteration only promise O( ) error under additional requirements on iterates generated in the course of executing  the algorithms [3, 13]. [sent-12, score-0.45]
</p><p>11 In fact, it has been shown that, even when = 0, approximate value iteration can generate a diverging sequence of approximations [2, 5, 10, 14]. [sent-13, score-0.108]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we propose a new LP for approximating optimal policies. [sent-14, score-0.117]
</p><p>13 We work with a formulation involving average cost optimization of a possibly inﬁnite-state MDP. [sent-15, score-0.08]
</p><p>14 The fact that we work with this more sophisticated formulation is itself a contribution to the literature on LP approaches to approximate DP, which have been studied for the most part in ﬁnite-state discounted-cost settings. [sent-16, score-0.153]
</p><p>15 But we view as our primary contributions the proposed algorithms and theoretical results, which strengthen in important ways previous results on LP approaches and unify certain ideas in the approximate DP literature. [sent-17, score-0.124]
</p><p>16 Results in [6] suggest that – in order for the LP approach presented there to scale gracefully to large problems – a certain linear combination of the basis functions must be a “Lyapunov function,” satisfying a certain strong Lyapunov condition. [sent-20, score-0.115]
</p><p>17 Further, the error bound is strengthened because it alleviates an undesirable dependence on the Lyapunov function that appears in [6] even when the Lyapunov condition is satisﬁed. [sent-22, score-0.108]
</p><p>18 Applying the LP studied in [6] requires manual selection of a set of parameters called state-relevance weights. [sent-25, score-0.059]
</p><p>19 The LP in the current paper does not explicitly make use of state-relevance weights, but rather, an analog which we call a restart distribution, and we propose an automated method for ﬁnding a desirable restart distribution. [sent-27, score-0.368]
</p><p>20 An alternative approach for approximate DP aims at minimizing “Bellman error” (this idea was ﬁrst suggested in [16]). [sent-30, score-0.126]
</p><p>21 There are no results indicating whether a global minimum will be reached or guaranteeing that a local minimum attained will exhibit desirable behavior. [sent-34, score-0.058]
</p><p>22 In this paper, we explain how the LP we propose can be thought of as a method for minimizing a version of Bellman error. [sent-35, score-0.107]
</p><p>23 Section 3 presents the LP approximation algorithm and an error bound. [sent-38, score-0.075]
</p><p>24 In Section 4, we propose a method for computing a desirable reset distribution. [sent-39, score-0.083]
</p><p>25 The LP approximation algorithm works with a perturbed version of the MDP. [sent-40, score-0.139]
</p><p>26 Errors introduced by this perturbation are studied in Section 5. [sent-41, score-0.131]
</p><p>27 A closing section discusses relations to our prior work on LP approaches to approximate DP [6, 8]. [sent-42, score-0.141]
</p><p>28 2  Problem Formulation and Perturbation Via Restart  Consider an MDP with a countable state space S and a ﬁnite set of actions A available at each state. [sent-43, score-0.141]
</p><p>29 Under a control policy u : S → A, the system dynamics are deﬁned by a transition probability matrix Pu ∈ |S|×|S| , where for policies u and u and states x and y, (Pu )xy = (Pu )xy if u(x) = u(x). [sent-44, score-0.317]
</p><p>30 We will assume  that, under each policy u, the system has a unique invariant distribution, given by t πu (x) = limt→∞ (Pu )yx , for all x, y ∈ S. [sent-45, score-0.198]
</p><p>31 A cost g(x, a) is associated with each state-action pair (x, a). [sent-46, score-0.056]
</p><p>32 For shorthand, given any policy u, we let gu (x) = g(x, u(x)). [sent-47, score-0.489]
</p><p>33 We consider the problem of computing a T policy that minimizes the average cost λu = πu gu . [sent-48, score-0.542]
</p><p>34 Let λ∗ = minu λu and deﬁne T ∗ u the diﬀerential value function h (x) = minu limT →∞ Ex [ t=0 (gu (xt ) − λ∗ )]. [sent-49, score-0.312]
</p><p>35 Here, the superscript u of the expectation operator denotes the control policy and the subscript x denotes conditioning on x0 = x. [sent-50, score-0.265]
</p><p>36 It is easy to show that there exists a policy u that simultaneously minimizes the expectation for every x. [sent-51, score-0.251]
</p><p>37 Further, a policy u∗ is optimal if and only if u∗ (x) ∈ arg minu (g(x, a) + y (Pu )xy h∗ (y)) for all x ∈ S. [sent-52, score-0.409]
</p><p>38 While in principle h∗ can be computed exactly by dynamic programming algorithms, this is often infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. [sent-53, score-0.216]
</p><p>39 We consider approximating K h∗ using a linear combination k=1 rk φk of ﬁxed basis functions φ1 , . [sent-54, score-0.139]
</p><p>40 In this paper, we propose and analyze an algorithm for computing weights K r ∈ K to approximate: h∗ ≈ k=1 φk (x)rk . [sent-58, score-0.055]
</p><p>41 The algorithm we will propose operates on a perturbed version of the MDP. [sent-60, score-0.127]
</p><p>42 The nature of the perturbation is inﬂuenced by two parameters: a restart probability (1 − α) ∈ [0, 1] and a restart distribution c over the state space. [sent-61, score-0.479]
</p><p>43 It evolves similarly with the original MDP, except that at each time, the state process restarts with probability 1 − α; in this event, the next state is sampled randomly according to c. [sent-63, score-0.13]
</p><p>44 Hence, the perturbed MDP has the same state space, action space, and cost function as the original one, but the transition matrix under each policy u are given by Pα,u = αPu + (1 − α)ecT . [sent-64, score-0.414]
</p><p>45 Let πα,u (x) = limt→∞ (Pα,u )yx , λα,u = πα,u gu , λ∗ = minu λα,u , and α ∗ let hα be the diﬀerential value function for the (α, c)-perturbed MDP, and let u∗ α be a policy satisfying u∗ (x) ∈ arg minu (g(x, a) + y (Pα,u )xy h∗ (y)) for all x ∈ S. [sent-66, score-0.85]
</p><p>46 α α Finally, we will make use of dynamic programming operators Tα,u h = gu + Pα,u h and Tα h = minu Tα,u h. [sent-67, score-0.637]
</p><p>47 We have deﬁned all these terms except for the slack function and penalty, which we will explain after deﬁning the LP. [sent-77, score-0.125]
</p><p>48 We assume that this is the case and denote an optimal solution by (˜, s1 , s2 ). [sent-81, score-0.061]
</p><p>49 Though the ﬁrst |S| constraints are nonlinear, each involves r ˜ ˜ a minimization over actions and therefore can be decomposed into |A| constraints. [sent-82, score-0.076]
</p><p>50 This results in a total of |S| × |A| + 1 constraints, which is unmanageable if the state space is large. [sent-83, score-0.065]
</p><p>51 Terms (s1 + λ∗ )1 and s2 ψ can α α be viewed as cost shaping. [sent-87, score-0.084]
</p><p>52 The LP can alternatively be viewed as an eﬃcient method for minimizing a form of Bellman error, as we now explain. [sent-89, score-0.052]
</p><p>53 Then, minimization of s1 corresponds to minimization of min(Tα Φr − Φr − λ∗ 1, 0) ∞ , which can be α viewed as a measure of (one-sided) Bellman error. [sent-91, score-0.118]
</p><p>54 Measuring error with respect to the maximum norm is problematic, however, when the state space is large. [sent-92, score-0.13]
</p><p>55 In the extreme case, when there is an inﬁnite number of states and an unbounded cost function, such errors are typically inﬁnite and therefore do not provide a meaningful objective for optimization. [sent-93, score-0.114]
</p><p>56 This shortcoming is addressed by the slack term s 2 ψ. [sent-94, score-0.13]
</p><p>57 This α corresponds to minimization of min(Tα Φr − Φr − λ∗ 1, 0) ∞,1/ψ , where the norm α is deﬁned by h ∞,1/ψ = maxx |h(x)|/ψ(x). [sent-96, score-0.074]
</p><p>58 This term can be viewed as a measure of Bellman error with respect to a weighted maximum norm, with weights 1/ψ(x). [sent-97, score-0.121]
</p><p>59 One important factor that distinguishes our LP from other approaches to Bellman error minimization [4, 12, 16] is a theoretical performance guarantee, which we now develop. [sent-98, score-0.111]
</p><p>60 For any r, let uα,r (x) ∈ arg minu (gu (x) + (Pα,u Φr)(x)). [sent-99, score-0.205]
</p><p>61 The following theorem establishes that the diﬀerence between the average cost λα,˜ associated with an optimal solution (˜, s1 , s2 ) to r ˜ ˜ r the LP and the optimal average cost λ∗ is proportional to the minimal erα ror that can be attained given the choice of basis functions. [sent-101, score-0.391]
</p><p>62 A proof of this theorem is provided in the appendix of a version of this paper available at http://www. [sent-102, score-0.102]
</p><p>63 If η ≥ (2 − α)πα,u∗ ψ then α  λα,˜ − λ∗ ≤ r α  (1 + β)η max(θ, 1) min h∗ − Φr α 1−α r∈ K  ∞,1/ψ ,  where β θ  = max Pα,u u  =  ∞,1/ψ  ≡ max u  Pα,u h ∞,1/ψ , h ∞,1/ψ  T πα,˜(Tα Φ˜ − Φ˜ + s1 1 + s2 ψ) r r ˜ ˜ r . [sent-108, score-0.086]
</p><p>64 T (T Φ˜ − Φ˜ + s 1 + s ψ) c r ˜1 ˜2 α r  The bound suggests that the slack function ψ should be chosen so that the basis functions can oﬀer a reasonably sized approximation error h∗ − Φr ∞,1/ψ . [sent-109, score-0.302]
</p><p>65 The theorem requires that T T the penalty η be at least (2 − α)πα,uα ∗ ψ. [sent-111, score-0.112]
</p><p>66 The term πα,u∗ ψ is the steady-state α  expectation of the slack function under an optimal policy. [sent-112, score-0.192]
</p><p>67 Note that β ≤ max Pα,u ψ u  ∞,1/ψ  = max u,x  (Pα,u ψ)(x) , ψ(x)  which is the maximal factor by which the expectation of ψ can increase over a single time period. [sent-113, score-0.09]
</p><p>68 When dealing with speciﬁc classes of problems it is often possible to select ψ so that the norm h∗ − Φr ∞,1/ψ as well as the terms maxu Pα,u ∞,1/ψ α T and πα,uα ∗ ψ scale gracefully with the number of states and/or state variables. [sent-114, score-0.225]
</p><p>69 , until the optimal solution is such that s 2 = 0. [sent-121, score-0.061]
</p><p>70 It ˜ is easy to show that the LP is unbounded for all η < 1, and that there is a ﬁnite η = inf{η|˜2 = 0} such that for each η ≥ η, the solution is identical and s2 = 0. [sent-122, score-0.058]
</p><p>71 s ˜ This search process delivers a policy that is at least as good as a policy generated T T by the LP for some η ∈ [(2 − α)πα,uα ψ, 2(2 − α)πα,uα ψ], and the upper bound of T Theorem 3. [sent-123, score-0.468]
</p><p>72 In Section r 5, we discuss how the reset probability 1 − α should be chosen in order to ensure that policies for the perturbed MDP oﬀer similar performance when applied to the original MDP. [sent-128, score-0.148]
</p><p>73 In this section, we explore a path-following algorithm for approximating such a ﬁxed point [9], with the aim of arriving at a value of θ that is close to one. [sent-133, score-0.094]
</p><p>74 Let r i denote the weight vector associated with an optimal solution to the LP (1) ˜ with perturbation parameters (αi , ci ). [sent-138, score-0.214]
</p><p>75 One might r hope that the change in ci is gradual, and therefore, ci ≈ παi ,˜i for each i. [sent-142, score-0.102]
</p><p>76 This experiment involves a problem with continuous state and action spaces. [sent-145, score-0.092]
</p><p>77 1 – applies to problems with countable state spaces and ﬁnite action spaces, there is no reason why the LP cannot be applied to broader classes of problems such as the one we now describe. [sent-147, score-0.137]
</p><p>78 Consider a scalar state process xt+1 = xt + at + wt , driven by scalar actions at and a sequence wt i. [sent-148, score-0.17]
</p><p>79 Consider a cost function g(x, a) = (x − 2)2 + a2 . [sent-152, score-0.056]
</p><p>80 We aim at approximating the diﬀerential value function using a single basis function φ(x) = x2 . [sent-153, score-0.112]
</p><p>81 We will use a slack function ψ(x) = 1 + x2 and penalty η = 5. [sent-155, score-0.143]
</p><p>82 The special structure of this  problem allows for exact solution of the LP (1) as well as the exact computation of the parameter θ, though we will not explain here how this is done. [sent-156, score-0.053]
</p><p>83 5  The Impact of Perturbation  Some simple algebra will show that for any policy u, ∞ t T α t c T Pu g u − π u g u . [sent-171, score-0.198]
</p><p>84 λα,u − λu = (1 − α) t=0 T  t Pu g u  T When the state space is ﬁnite |c − πu gu | decays at a geometric rate. [sent-172, score-0.33]
</p><p>85 This is also true in many practical contexts involving inﬁnite state spaces. [sent-173, score-0.065]
</p><p>86 One might ∞ t T think of mu = t=0 (cT Pu gu − πu gu ), as the mixing time of the policy u if the initial state is drawn according to the restart distribution c. [sent-174, score-1.265]
</p><p>87 This mixing time is t T ﬁnite if the diﬀerences cT Pu gu − πu gu converge geometrically. [sent-175, score-0.599]
</p><p>88 Further, we have |λα,u − λu | = mu (1 − α), and coming back to the LP, this implies that λuα,˜ − λu∗ ≤ λα,˜ − λα,u∗ + (1 − α)(muα,˜ + max(mu∗ , mu∗ )). [sent-176, score-0.247]
</p><p>89 1, this oﬀers a performance bound for the policy uα,˜ applied to the original MDP. [sent-178, score-0.27]
</p><p>90 This choice must strike a balance between two factors: the coeﬃcient of 1/(1 − α) in the bound of Theorem 3. [sent-182, score-0.105]
</p><p>91 Note that the term 1/(1 − α) multiplying the right-hand-side of the bound can then be thought of as a constant multiple of the mixing time of u∗ . [sent-186, score-0.17]
</p><p>92 An important open question is whether it is possible to design an approximate DP algorithm and establish for that algorithm an error bound that does not depend on the mixing time in this way. [sent-187, score-0.247]
</p><p>93 6  Relation to Prior Work  In closing, it is worth discussing how our new algorithm and results relate to our prior work on LP approaches to approximate DP [6, 8]. [sent-188, score-0.1]
</p><p>94 For any function V : S → + , let βV = α maxu Pu V ∞,1/V . [sent-191, score-0.067]
</p><p>95 α u 1−α 1 − βV Hence, the ﬁrst term – which appears in the bound of Theorem 6. [sent-206, score-0.101]
</p><p>96 1 – grows with the largest mixing time among all policies, whereas the second term – which appears in the bound of Theorem 3. [sent-207, score-0.17]
</p><p>97 1 – only depends on the mixing time of an optimal policy. [sent-208, score-0.101]
</p><p>98 As discussed in [6], appropriate choice of c – there referred to as the state-relevance weights – can be important for the error bound of Theorem 6. [sent-209, score-0.169]
</p><p>99 In [8], it is argued that some form of weighting of states in terms of a metric of relevance should continue to be important when considering average cost problems. [sent-211, score-0.085]
</p><p>100 An important contribution of this paper is the path-following algorithm proposed in Section 4, which aims at automating an eﬀective choice of c. [sent-215, score-0.065]

<p>Author: Pascal Poupart, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: Existing algorithms for discrete partially observable Markov decision processes can at best solve problems of a few thousand states due to two important sources of intractability: the curse of dimensionality and the policy space complexity. This paper describes a new algorithm (VDCBPI) that mitigates both sources of intractability by combining the Value Directed Compression (VDC) technique [13] with Bounded Policy Iteration (BPI) [14]. The scalability of VDCBPI is demonstrated on synthetic network management problems with up to 33 million states.</p><p>3 0.13598911 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>

Kakade, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider an MDP setting in which the reward function is allowed to change during each time step of play (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain ﬁxed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well can an agent do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efﬁcient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard. 1</p><p>4 0.1292827 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Coarticulation_in_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">39 nips-2004-Coarticulation in Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Khashayar Rohanimanesh, Robert Platt, Sridhar Mahadevan, Roderic Grupen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate an approach for simultaneously committing to multiple activities, each modeled as a temporally extended action in a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). For each activity we deﬁne a set of admissible solutions consisting of the redundant set of optimal policies, and those policies that ascend the optimal statevalue function associated with them. A plan is then generated by merging them in such a way that the solutions to the subordinate activities are realized in the set of admissible solutions satisfying the superior activities. We present our theoretical results and empirically evaluate our approach in a simulated domain. 1</p><p>5 0.12684874 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-The_Cerebellum_Chip%3A_an_Analog_VLSI_Implementation_of_a_Cerebellar_Model_of_Classical_Conditioning.html">184 nips-2004-The Cerebellum Chip: an Analog VLSI Implementation of a Cerebellar Model of Classical Conditioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm based on linear programming that approximates the diﬀerential value function of an average-cost Markov decision process via a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions. The algorithm carries out a form of cost shaping and minimizes a version of Bellman error. We establish an error bound that scales gracefully with the number of states without imposing the (strong) Lyapunov condition required by its counterpart in [6]. We propose a path-following method that automates selection of important algorithm parameters which represent counterparts to the “state-relevance weights” studied in [6]. 1</p><p>2 0.77799803 <a title="1-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Planning_for_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Sparse_Stochasticity.html">147 nips-2004-Planning for Markov Decision Processes with Sparse Stochasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Maxim Likhachev, Sebastian Thrun, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Planning algorithms designed for deterministic worlds, such as A* search, usually run much faster than algorithms designed for worlds with uncertain action outcomes, such as value iteration. Real-world planning problems often exhibit uncertainty, which forces us to use the slower algorithms to solve them. Many real-world planning problems exhibit sparse uncertainty: there are long sequences of deterministic actions which accomplish tasks like moving sensor platforms into place, interspersed with a small number of sensing actions which have uncertain outcomes. In this paper we describe a new planning algorithm, called MCP (short for MDP Compression Planning), which combines A* search with value iteration for solving Stochastic Shortest Path problem in MDPs with sparse stochasticity. We present experiments which show that MCP can run substantially faster than competing planners in domains with sparse uncertainty; these experiments are based on a simulation of a ground robot cooperating with a helicopter to ﬁll in a partial map and move to a goal location. In deterministic planning problems, optimal paths are acyclic: no state is visited more than once. Because of this property, algorithms like A* search can guarantee that they visit each state in the state space no more than once. By visiting the states in an appropriate order, it is possible to ensure that we know the exact value of all of a state’s possible successors before we visit that state; so, the ﬁrst time we visit a state we can compute its correct value. By contrast, if actions have uncertain outcomes, optimal paths may contain cycles: some states will be visited two or more times with positive probability. Because of these cycles, there is no way to order states so that we determine the values of a state’s successors before we visit the state itself. Instead, the only way to compute state values is to solve a set of simultaneous equations. In problems with sparse stochasticity, only a small fraction of all states have uncertain outcomes. It is these few states that cause all of the cycles: while a deterministic state s may participate in a cycle, the only way it can do so is if one of its successors has an action with a stochastic outcome (and only if this stochastic action can lead to a predecessor of s). In such problems, we would like to build a smaller MDP which contains only states which are related to stochastic actions. We will call such an MDP a compressed MDP, and we will call its states distinguished states. We could then run fast algorithms like A* search to plan paths between distinguished states, and reserve slower algorithms like value iteration for deciding how to deal with stochastic outcomes. (a) Segbot (d) Planning map (b) Robotic helicopter (e) Execution simulation (c) 3D Map Figure 1: Robot-Helicopter Coordination There are two problems with such a strategy. First, there can be a large number of states which are related to stochastic actions, and so it may be impractical to enumerate all of them and make them all distinguished states; we would prefer instead to distinguish only states which are likely to be encountered while executing some policy which we are considering. Second, there can be a large number of ways to get from one distinguished state to another: edges in the compressed MDP correspond to sequences of actions in the original MDP. If we knew the values of all of the distinguished states exactly, then we could use A* search to generate optimal paths between them, but since we do not we cannot. In this paper, we will describe an algorithm which incrementally builds a compressed MDP using a sequence of deterministic searches. It adds states and edges to the compressed MDP only by encountering them along trajectories; so, it never adds irrelevant states or edges to the compressed MDP. Trajectories are generated by deterministic search, and so undistinguished states are treated only with fast algorithms. Bellman errors in the values for distinguished states show us where to try additional trajectories, and help us build the relevant parts of the compressed MDP as quickly as possible. 1 Robot-Helicopter Coordination Problem The motivation for our research was the problem of coordinating a ground robot and a helicopter. The ground robot needs to plan a path from its current location to a goal, but has only partial knowledge of the surrounding terrain. The helicopter can aid the ground robot by ﬂying to and sensing places in the map. Figure 1(a) shows our ground robot, a converted Segway with a SICK laser rangeﬁnder. Figure 1(b) shows the helicopter, also with a SICK. Figure 1(c) shows a 3D map of the environment in which the robot operates. The 3D map is post-processed to produce a discretized 2D environment (Figure 1(d)). Several places in the map are unknown, either because the robot has not visited them or because their status may have changed (e.g, a car may occupy a driveway). Such places are shown in Figure 1(d) as white squares. The elevation of each white square is proportional to the probability that there is an obstacle there; we assume independence between unknown squares. The robot must take the unknown locations into account when planning for its route. It may plan a path through these locations, but it risks having to turn back if its way is blocked. Alternately, the robot can ask the helicopter to ﬂy to any of these places and sense them. We assign a cost to running the robot, and a somewhat higher cost to running the helicopter. The planning task is to minimize the expected overall cost of running the robot and the helicopter while getting the robot to its destination and the helicopter back to its home base. Figure 1(e) shows a snapshot of the robot and helicopter executing a policy. Designing a good policy for the robot and helicopter is a POMDP planning problem; unfortunately POMDPs are in general difﬁcult to solve (PSPACE-complete [7]). In the POMDP representation, a state is the position of the robot, the current location of the helicopter (a point on a line segment from one of the unknown places to another unknown place or the home base), and the true status of each unknown location. The positions of the robot and the helicopter are observable, so that the only hidden variables are whether each unknown place is occupied. The number of states is (# of robot locations)×(# of helicopter locations)×2# of unknown places . So, the number of states is exponential in the number of unknown places and therefore quickly becomes very large. We approach the problem by planning in the belief state space, that is, the space of probability distributions over world states. This problem is a continuous-state MDP; in this belief MDP, our state consists of the ground robot’s location, the helicopter’s location, and a probability of occupancy for each unknown location. We will discretize the continuous probability variables by breaking the interval [0, 1] into several chunks; so, the number of belief states is exponential in the number of unknown places, and classical algorithms such as value iteration are infeasible even on small problems. If sensors are perfect, this domain is acyclic: after we sense a square we know its true state forever after. On the other hand, imperfect sensors can lead to cycles: new sensor data can contradict older sensor data and lead to increased uncertainty. With or without sensor noise, our belief state MDP differs from general MDPs because its stochastic transitions are sparse: large portions of the policy (while the robot and helicopter are traveling between unknown locations) are deterministic. The algorithm we propose in this paper takes advantage of this property of the problem, as we explain in the next section. 2 The Algorithm Our algorithm can be broken into two levels. At a high level, it constructs a compressed MDP, denoted M c , which contains only the start, the goal, and some states which are outcomes of stochastic actions. At a lower level, it repeatedly runs deterministic searches to ﬁnd new information to put into M c . This information includes newly-discovered stochastic actions and their outcomes; better deterministic paths from one place to another; and more accurate value estimates similar to Bellman backups. The deterministic searches can use an admissible heuristic h to focus their effort, so we can often avoid putting many irrelevant actions into M c . Because M c will often be much smaller than M , we can afford to run stochastic planning algorithms like value iteration on it. On the other hand, the information we get by planning in M c will improve the heuristic values that we use in our deterministic searches; so, the deterministic searches will tend to visit only relevant portions of the state space. 2.1 Constructing and Solving a Compressed MDP Each action in the compressed MDP represents several consecutive actions in M : if we see a sequence of states and actions s1 , a1 , s2 , a2 , . . . , sk , ak where a1 through ak−1 are deterministic but ak is stochastic, then we can represent it in M c with a single action a, available at s1 , whose outcome distribution is P (s | sk , ak ) and whose cost is k−1 c(si , ai , si+1 ) + c(sk , ak , s ) c(s1 , a, s ) = i=1 (See Figure 2(a) for an example of such a compressed action.) In addition, if we see a sequence of deterministic actions ending in sgoal , say s1 , a1 , s2 , a2 , . . . , sk , ak , sk+1 = sgoal , k we can deﬁne a compressed action which goes from s1 to sgoal at cost i=1 c(si , ai , si+1 ). We can label each compressed action that starts at s with (s, s , a) (where a = null if s = sgoal ). Among all compressed actions starting at s and ending at (s , a) there is (at least) one with lowest expected cost; we will call such an action an optimal compression of (s, s , a). Write Astoch for the set of all pairs (s, a) such that action a when taken from state s has more than one possible outcome, and include as well (sgoal , null). Write Sstoch for the states which are possible outcomes of the actions in Astoch , and include sstart as well. If we include in our compressed MDP an optimal compression of (s, s , a) for every s ∈ Sstoch and every (s , a) ∈ Astoch , the result is what we call the full compressed MDP; an example is in Figure 2(b). If we solve the full compressed MDP, the value of each state will be the same as the value of the corresponding state in M . However, we do not need to do that much work: (a) action compression (b) full MDP compression (c) incremental MDP compression Figure 2: MDP compression Main() 01 initialize M c with sstart and sgoal and set their v-values to 0; 02 while (∃s ∈ M c s.t. RHS(s) − v(s) > δ and s belongs to the current greedy policy) 03 select spivot to be any such state s; 04 [v; vlim ] = Search(spivot ); 05 v(spivot ) = v; 06 set the cost c(spivot , a, sgoal ) of the limit action a from spivot to vlim ; ¯ ¯ 07 optionally run some algorithm satisfying req. A for a bounded amount of time to improve the value function in M c ; Figure 3: MCP main loop many states and actions in the full compressed MDP are irrelevant since they do not appear in the optimal policy from sstart to sgoal . So, the goal of the MCP algorithm will be to construct only the relevant part of the compressed MDP by building M c incrementally. Figure 2(c) shows the incremental construction of a compressed MDP which contains all of the stochastic states and actions along an optimal policy in M . The pseudocode for MCP is given in Figure 3. It begins by initializing M c to contain only sstart and sgoal , and it sets v(sstart ) = v(sgoal ) = 0. It maintains the invariant that 0 ≤ v(s) ≤ v ∗ (s) for all s. On each iteration, MCP looks at the Bellman error of each of the states in M c . The Bellman error is v(s) − RHS(s), where RHS(s) = min RHS(s, a) a∈A(s) RHS(s, a) = Es ∈succ(s,a) (c(s, a, s ) + v(s )) By convention the min of an empty set is ∞, so an s which does not have any compressed actions yet is considered to have inﬁnite RHS. MCP selects a state with negative Bellman error, spivot , and starts a search at that state. (We note that there exist many possible ways to select spivot ; for example, we can choose the state with the largest negative Bellman error, or the largest error when weighted by state visitation probabilities in the best policy in M c .) The goal of this search is to ﬁnd a new compressed action a such that its RHS-value can provide a new lower bound on v ∗ (spivot ). This action can either decrease the current RHS(spivot ) (if a seems to be a better action in terms of the current v-values of action outcomes) or prove that the current RHS(spivot ) is valid. Since v(s ) ≤ v ∗ (s ), one way to guarantee that RHS(spivot , a) ≤ v ∗ (spivot ) is to compute an optimal compression of (spivot , s, a) for all s, a, then choose the one with the smallest RHS. A more sophisticated strategy is to use an A∗ search with appropriate safeguards to make sure we never overestimate the value of a stochastic action. MCP, however, uses a modiﬁed A∗ search which we will describe in the next section. As the search ﬁnds new compressed actions, it adds them and their outcomes to M c . It is allowed to initialize newly-added states to any admissible values. When the search returns, MCP sets v(spivot ) to the returned value. This value is at least as large as RHS(spivot ). Consequently, Bellman error for spivot becomes non-negative. In addition to the compressed action and the updated value, the search algorithm returns a “limit value” vlim (spivot ). These limit values allow MCP to run a standard MDP planning algorithm on M c to improve its v(s) estimates. MCP can use any planning algorithm which guarantees that, for any s, it will not lower v(s) and will not increase v(s) beyond the smaller of vlim (s) and RHS(s) (Requirement A). For example, we could insert a fake “limit action” into M c which goes directly from spivot to sgoal at cost vlim (spivot ) (as we do on line 06 in Figure 3), then run value iteration for a ﬁxed amount of time, selecting for each backup a state with negative Bellman error. After updating M c from the result of the search and any optional planning, MCP begins again by looking for another state with a negative Bellman error. It repeats this process until there are no negative Bellman errors larger than δ. For small enough δ, this property guarantees that we will be able to ﬁnd a good policy (see section 2.3). 2.2 Searching the MDP Efﬁciently The top level algorithm (Figure 3) repeatedly invokes a search method for ﬁnding trajectories from spivot to sgoal . In order for the overall algorithm to work correctly, there are several properties that the search must satisfy. First, the estimate v that search returns for the expected cost of spivot should always be admissible. That is, 0 ≤ v ≤ v ∗ (spivot ) (Property 1). Second, the estimate v should be no less than the one-step lookahead value of spivot in M c . That is, v ≥ RHS(spivot ) (Property 2). This property ensures that search either increases the value of spivot or ﬁnds additional (or improved) compressed actions. The third and ﬁnal property is for the vlim value, and it is only important if MCP uses its optional planning step (line 07). The property is that v ≤ vlim ≤ v ∗ (spivot ) (Property 3). Here v ∗ (spivot ) denotes the minimum expected cost of starting at spivot , picking a compressed action not in M c , and acting optimally from then on. (Note that v ∗ can be larger than v ∗ if the optimal compressed action is already part of M c .) Property 3 uses v ∗ rather than v ∗ since the latter is not known while it is possible to compute a lower bound on the former efﬁciently (see below). One could adapt A* search to satisfy at least Properties 1 and 2 by assuming that we can control the outcome of stochastic actions. However, this sort of search is highly optimistic and can bias the search towards improbable trajectories. Also, it can only use heuristics which are even more optimistic than it is: that is, h must be admissible with respect to the optimistic assumption of controlled outcomes. We therefore present a version of A*, called MCP-search (Figure 4), that is more efﬁcient for our purposes. MCP-search ﬁnds the correct expected value for the ﬁrst stochastic action it encounters on any given trajectory, and is therefore far less optimistic. And, MCP-search only requires heuristic values to be admissible with respect to v ∗ values, h(s) ≤ v ∗ (s). Finally, MCP-search speeds up repetitive searches by improving heuristic values based on previous searches. A* maintains a priority queue, OPEN, of states which it plans to expand. The OPEN queue is sorted by f (s) = g(s)+h(s), so that A* always expands next a state which appears to be on the shortest path from start to goal. During each expansion a state s is removed from OPEN and all the g-values of s’s successors are updated; if g(s ) is decreased for some state s , A* inserts s into OPEN. A* terminates as soon as the goal state is expanded. We use the variant of A* with pathmax [5] to use efﬁciently heuristics that do not satisfy the triangle inequality. MCP is similar to A∗ , but the OPEN list can also contain state-action pairs {s, a} where a is a stochastic action (line 31). Plain states are represented in OPEN as {s, null}. Just ImproveHeuristic(s) 01 if s ∈ M c then h(s) = max(h(s), v(s)); 02 improve heuristic h(s) further if possible using f best and g(s) from previous iterations; procedure fvalue({s, a}) 03 if s = null return ∞; 04 else if a = null return g(s) + h(s); 05 else return g(s) + max(h(s), Es ∈Succ(s,a) {c(s, a, s ) + h(s )}); CheckInitialize(s) 06 if s was accessed last in some previous search iteration 07 ImproveHeuristic(s); 08 if s was not yet initialized in the current search iteration 09 g(s) = ∞; InsertUpdateCompAction(spivot , s, a) 10 reconstruct the path from spivot to s; 11 insert compressed action (spivot , s, a) into A(spivot ) (or update the cost if a cheaper path was found) 12 for each outcome u of a that was not in M c previously 13 set v(u) to h(u) or any other value less than or equal to v ∗ (u); 14 set the cost c(u, a, sgoal ) of the limit action a from u to v(u); ¯ ¯ procedure Search(spivot ) 15 CheckInitialize(sgoal ), CheckInitialize(spivot ); 16 g(spivot ) = 0; 17 OPEN = {{spivot , null}}; 18 {sbest , abest } = {null, null}, f best = ∞; 19 while(g(sgoal ) > min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a})) AND f best + θ > min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a}))) 20 remove {s, a} with the smallest fvalue({s, a}) from OPEN breaking ties towards the pairs with a = null; 21 if a = null //expand state s 22 for each s ∈ Succ(s) 23 CheckInitialize(s ); 24 for each deterministic a ∈ A(s) 25 s = Succ(s, a ); 26 h(s ) = max(h(s ), h(s) − c(s, a , s )); 27 if g(s ) > g(s) + c(s, a , s ) 28 g(s ) = g(s) + c(s, a , s ); 29 insert/update {s , null} into OPEN with fvalue({s , null}); 30 for each stochastic a ∈ A(s) 31 insert/update {s, a } into OPEN with fvalue({s, a }); 32 else //encode stochastic action a from state s as a compressed action from spivot 33 InsertUpdateCompAction(spivot , s, a); 34 if f best > fvalue({s, a}) then {sbest , abest } = {s, a}, f best = fvalue({s, a}); 35 if (g(sgoal ) ≤ min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a})) AND OPEN = ∅) 36 reconstruct the path from spivot to sgoal ; 37 update/insert into A(spivot ) a deterministic action a leading to sgoal ; 38 if f best ≥ g(sgoal ) then {sbest , abest } = {sgoal , null}, f best = g(sgoal ); 39 return [f best; min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a}))]; Figure 4: MCP-search Algorithm like A*, MCP-search expands elements in the order of increasing f -values, but it breaks ties towards elements encoding plain states (line 20). The f -value of {s, a} is deﬁned as g(s) + max[h(s), Es ∈Succ(s,a) (c(s, a, s ) + h(s ))] (line 05). This f -value is a lower bound on the cost of a policy that goes from sstart to sgoal by ﬁrst executing a series of deterministic actions until action a is executed from state s. This bound is as tight as possible given our heuristic values. State expansion (lines 21-31) is very similar to A∗ . When the search removes from OPEN a state-action pair {s, a} with a = null, it adds a compressed action to M c (line 33). It also adds a compressed action if there is an optimal deterministic path to sgoal (line 37). f best tracks the minimum f -value of all the compressed actions found. As a result, f best ≤ v ∗ (spivot ) and is used as a new estimate for v(spivot ). The limit value vlim (spivot ) is obtained by continuing the search until the minimum f -value of elements in OPEN approaches f best + θ for some θ ≥ 0 (line 19). This minimum f -value then provides a lower bound on v ∗ (spivot ). To speed up repetitive searches, MCP-search improves the heuristic of every state that it encounters for the ﬁrst time in the current search iteration (lines 01 and 02). Line 01 uses the fact that v(s) from M c is a lower bound on v ∗ (s). Line 02 uses the fact that f best − g(s) is a lower bound on v ∗ (s) at the end of each previous call to Search; for more details see [4]. 2.3 Theoretical Properties of the Algorithm We now present several theorems about our algorithm. The proofs of these and other theorems can be found in [4]. The ﬁrst theorem states the main properties of MCP-search. Theorem 1 The search function terminates and the following holds for the values it returns: (a) if sbest = null then v ∗ (spivot ) ≥ f best ≥ E{c(spivot , abest , s ) + v(s )} (b) if sbest = null then v ∗ (spivot ) = f best = ∞ (c) f best ≤ min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a})) ≤ v ∗ (spivot ). If neither sgoal nor any state-action pairs were expanded, then sbest = null and (b) says that there is no policy from spivot that has a ﬁnite expected cost. Using the above theorem it is easy to show that MCP-search satisﬁes Properties 1, 2 and 3, considering that f best is returned as variable v and min{s,a}∈OPEN (fvalue({s, a})) is returned as variable vlim in the main loop of the MCP algorithm (Figure 3). Property 1 follows directly from (a) and (b) and the fact that costs are strictly positive and v-values are non-negative. Property 2 also follows trivially from (a) and (b). Property 3 follows from (c). Given these properties c the next theorem states the correctness of the outer MCP algorithm (in the theorem πgreedy denotes a greedy policy that always chooses an action that looks best based on its cost and the v-values of its immediate successors). Theorem 2 Given a deterministic search algorithm which satisﬁes Properties 1–3, the c MCP algorithm will terminate. Upon termination, for every state s ∈ M c ∩ πgreedy we ∗ have RHS(s) − δ ≤ v(s) ≤ v (s). Given the above theorem one can show that for 0 ≤ δ < cmin (where cmin is the c smallest expected action cost in our MDP) the expected cost of executing πgreedy from cmin ∗ sstart is at most cmin −δ v (sstart ). Picking δ ≥ cmin is not guaranteed to result in a proper policy, even though Theorem 2 continues to hold. 3 Experimental Study We have evaluated the MCP algorithm on the robot-helicopter coordination problem described in section 1. To obtain an admissible heuristic, we ﬁrst compute a value function for every possible conﬁguration of obstacles. Then we weight the value functions by the probabilities of their obstacle conﬁgurations, sum them, and add the cost of moving the helicopter back to its base if it is not already there. This procedure results in optimistic cost estimates because it pretends that the robot will ﬁnd out the obstacle locations immediately instead of having to wait to observe them. The results of our experiments are shown in Figure 5. We have compared MCP against three algorithms: RTDP [1], LAO* [2] and value iteration on reachable states (VI). RTDP can cope with large size MDPs by focussing its planning efforts along simulated execution trajectories. LAO* uses heuristics to prune away irrelevant states, then repeatedly performs dynamic programming on the states in its current partial policy. We have implemented LAO* so that it reduces to AO* [6] when environments are acyclic (e.g., the robot-helicopter problem with perfect sensing). VI was only able to run on the problems with perfect sensing since the number of reachable states was too large for the others. The results support the claim that MCP can solve large problems with sparse stochasticity. For the problem with perfect sensing, on average MCP was able to plan 9.5 times faster than LAO*, 7.5 times faster than RTDP, and 8.5 times faster than VI. On average for these problems, MCP computed values for 58633 states while M c grew to 396 states, and MCP encountered 3740 stochastic transitions (to give a sense of the degree of stochasticity). The main cost of MCP was in its deterministic search subroutine; this fact suggests that we might beneﬁt from anytime search techniques such as ARA* [3]. The results for the problems with imperfect sensing show that, as the number and density of uncertain outcomes increases, the advantage of MCP decreases. For these problems MCP was able to solve environments 10.2 times faster than LAO* but only 2.2 times faster than RTDP. On average MCP computed values for 127,442 states, while the size of M c was 3,713 states, and 24,052 stochastic transitions were encountered. Figure 5: Experimental results.

Our experimental results suggest that MCP is advantageous for problems with sparse stochasticity. In particular, MCP has allowed us to scale to larger environments than were otherwise possible for the robot-helicopter coordination problem.

<p>Author: Constanze Hofstoetter, Manuel Gil, Kynan Eng, Giacomo Indiveri, Matti Mintz, Jörg Kramer, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: We present a biophysically constrained cerebellar model of classical conditioning, implemented using a neuromorphic analog VLSI (aVLSI) chip. Like its biological counterpart, our cerebellar model is able to control adaptive behavior by predicting the precise timing of events. Here we describe the functionality of the chip and present its learning performance, as evaluated in simulated conditioning experiments at the circuit level and in behavioral experiments using a mobile robot. We show that this aVLSI model supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed conditioned responses under real-world conditions with ultra-low power consumption. I n tro d u cti o n 1 The association of two correlated stimuli, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) which predicts a meaningful unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to the acquisition of an adaptive conditioned response (CR), is one of the most essential forms of learning. Pavlov introduced the classical conditioning paradigm in the early 20th century to study associative learning (Pavlov 1927). In classical conditioning training an animal is repeatedly exposed to a CS followed by a US after a certain inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The animal learns to elicit a CR matched to the ISI, reflecting its knowledge about an association between the CS, US, and their temporal relationship. Our earlier software implementation of a * Jörg Kramer designed the cerebellum chip that was first tested at the 2002 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop. Tragically, he died soon afterwards while hiking on Telescope Peak on 24 July, 2002. biophysically constrained model of the cerebellar circuit underlying classical conditioning (Verschure and Mintz 2001; Hofstötter et al. 2002) provided an explanation of this phenomenon by assuming a negative feedback loop between the cerebellar cortex, deep nucleus and inferior olive. It could acquire and extinguish correctly timed CRs over a range of ISIs in simulated classical conditioning experiments, as well as in associative obstacle avoidance tasks using a mobile robot. In this paper we present the analog VLSI (aVLSI) implementation of this cerebellum model – the cerebellum chip – and the results of chip-level and behavioral robot experiments. 2 T h e mo d el ci r cu i t a n d a VL S I i mp l eme n ta ti o n Figure 1: Anatomy of the cerebellar model circuit (left) and the block diagram of the corresponding chip (right). The model (Figure 1) is based on the identified cerebellar pathways of CS, US and CR (Kim and Thompson 1997) and includes four key hypotheses which were implemented in the earlier software model (Hofstötter et al. 2002): 1. CS related parallel fiber (pf) and US related climbing fiber (cf) signals converge at Purkinje cells (PU) in the cerebellum (Steinmetz et al. 1989). The direction of the synaptic changes at the pf-PU-synapse depends on the temporal coincidence of pf and cf activity. Long-term depression (LTD) is induced by pf activity followed by cf activity within a certain time interval, while pf activity alone induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (Hansel et al. 2001). 2. A prolonged second messenger response to pf stimulation in the dendrites of PU constitutes an eligibility trace from the CS pathway (Sutton and Barto 1990) that bridges the ISI (Fiala et al. 1996). 3. A microcircuit (Ito 1984) comprising PU, deep nucleus (DN) and inferior olive (IO) forms a negative feedback loop. Shunting inhibition of IO by DN blocks the reinforcement pathway (Thompson et al. 1998), thus controlling the induction of LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse. 4. DN activity triggers behavioral CRs (McCormick and Thompson 1984). The inhibitory PU controls DN activity by a mechanism called rebound excitation (Hesslow 1994): When DN cells are disinhibited from PU input, their membrane potential slowly repolarises and spikes are emitted if a certain threshold is reached. Thereby, the correct timing of CRs results from the adaptation of a pause in PU spiking following the CS. In summary, in the model the expression of a CR is triggered by DN rebound excitation upon release from PU inhibition. The precise timing of a CR is dependent on the duration of an acquired pause in PU spiking following a CS. The PU response is regulated by LTD and LTP at the pf-PU-synapse under the control of a negative feedback loop comprising DN, PU and IO. We implemented an analog VLSI version of the cerebellar model using a standard 1.6µm CMOS technology, and occupying an area of approximately 0.25 mm2. A block diagram of the hardware model is shown in Figure 1. The CS block receives the conditioned stimulus and generates two signals: an analog long-lasting, slowly decaying trace (cs_out) and an equally long binary pulse (cs_wind). Similarly, the US block receives an unconditioned stimulus and generates a fast pulse (us_out). The two pulses cs_wind and us_out are sent to the LT-ISI block that is responsible for perfoming LTP and LTD, upregulating or downregulating the synaptic weight signal w. This signal determines the gain by which the cs_out trace is multiplied in the MU block. The output of the multiplier MU is sent on to the PU block, together with the us_out signal. It is a linear integrate-and-fire neuron (the axon-hillock circuit) connected to a constant current source that produces regular spontaneous activity. The current source is gated by the digital cf_wind signal, such that the spontaneous activity is shut off for the duration of the cs_out trace. The chip allowed one of three learning rules to be connected. Experiments showed that an ISI-dependent learning rule with short ISIs resulting in the strongest LTD was the most useful (Kramer and Hofstötter 2002). Two elements were added to adapt the model circuit for real-world robot experiments. Firstly, to prevent the expression of a CR after a US had already been triggered, an inhibitory connection from IO to CRpathway was added. Secondly, the transduction delay (TD) from the aVLSI circuit to any effectors (e.g. motor controls of a robot) had to be taken into account, which was done by adding a delay from DN to IO of 500ms. The chip’s power consumption is conservatively estimated at around 100 W (excluding off-chip interfacing), based on measurements from similar integrateand-fire neuron circuits (Indiveri 2003). This figure is an order of magnitude lower than what could be achieved using conventional microcontrollers (typically 1-10 mW), and could be improved further by optimising the circuit design. 3 S i mu l a ted co n d i ti o n i n g ex p eri men ts The aim of the “in vitro” simulated conditioning experiments was to understand the learning performance of the chip. To obtain a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the learning system for both the simulated conditioning experiments and the robot experiments, the measure of effective CRs was used. In acquisition experiments CS-US pairs are presented with a fixed ISI. Whenever a CR occurs that precedes the US, the US signal is not propagated to PU due to the inhibitory connection from DN to IO. Thus in the context of acquisition experiments a CR is defined as effective if it prevents the occurrence of a US spike at PU. In contrast, in robot experiments an effective CR is defined at the behavioral level, including only CRs that prevent the US from occurring. Figure 2: Learning related response changes in the cerebellar aVLSI chip. The most relevant neural responses to a CS-US pair (ISI of 3s, ITI of 12s) are presented for a trial before (naive) significant learning occurred and when a correctly timed CR is expressed (trained). US-related pf and CS/CR-related cf signals are indicated by vertical lines passing through the subplots. A CS-related pf-signal evokes a prolonged response in the pf-PU-synapse, the CS-trace (Trace subplot). While an active CS-trace is present, an inhibitory element (I) is active which inactivates an element representing the spontaneous activity of PU (Hofstötter et al. 2002). (A) The US-related cf input occurs while there is an active CS-trace (Trace subplot), in this case following the CS with an ISI of 3s. LTD predominates over LTP under these conditions (Weight subplot). Because the PU membrane potential (PU) remains above spiking threshold, PU is active and supplies constant inhibition to DN (DN) while in the CS-mode. Thus, DN cannot repolarize and remains inactive so that no CR is triggered. (B) Later in the experiment, the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight) has been reduced due to previous LTD. As a result, following a CS-related pf input, the PU potential (PU subplot) falls below the spiking threshold, which leads to a pause in PU spiking. The DN membrane potential repolarises, so that rebound spikes are emitted (DN subplot). This rebound excitation triggers a CR. DN inhibition of IO prevents US related cfactivity. Thus, although a US signal is still presented to the circuit, the reinforcing US pathway is blocked. These conditions induce only LTP, raising the synaptic weight of the pf-PU-synapse (Weight subplot). The results we obtained were broadly consistent with those reported in the biological literature (Ito 1984; Kim and Thompson 1997). The correct operation of the circuit can be seen in the cell traces illustrating the properties of the aVLSI circuit components before significant learning (Figure 2 A), and after a CR is expressed (Figure 2B). Long-term acquisition experiments (25 blocks of 10 trials each over 50 minutes) showed that chip functions remained stable over a long time period. In each trial the CS was followed by a US with a fixed ISI of 3s; the inter trial interval (ITI) was 12s. The number of effective CRs shows an initial fast learning phase followed by a stable phase with higher percentages of effective CRs (Figure 3B). In the stable phase the percentage of effective CRs per block fluctuates around 80-90%. There are fluctuations of up to 500ms in the CR latency caused by the interaction of LTD and LTP in the stable phase, but the average CR latency remains fairly constant. Figure 4 shows the average of five acquisition experiments (5 blocks of 10 trials per experiment) for ISIs of 2.5s, 3s and 3.5s. The curves are similar in shape to the ones in the long-term experiment. The CR latency quickly adjusts to match the ISI and remains stable thereafter (Figure 4A). The effect of the ISI-dependent learning rule can be seen in two ways: firstly, the shorter the ISI, the faster the stable phase is reached, denoting faster learning. Secondly, the shorter the ISI, the better the performance in terms of percentage of effective CRs (Figure 4B). The parameters of the chip were tuned to optimally encode short ISIs in the range of 1.75s to 4.5s. Separate experiments showed that the chip could also adapt rapidly to changes in the ISI within this range after initial learning. (Error bar = 1 std. dev.)

Experiments were performed using a Khepera microrobot (K-team, Lausanne, Switzerland, Figure 5A) in a circular arena with striped walls (Figure 5C). The robot was equipped with 6 proximal infra-red (IR) sensors (Figure 5B). Activation of these sensors (US) due to a collision triggered a turn of ~110° in the opposite direction (UR). A line camera (64 pixels x 256 gray-levels) constituted the distal sensor, with detection of a certain spatial frequency (~0.14 periods/degree) signalling the CS. Visual CSs and collision USs were conveyed to CSpathway and USpathway on the chip. The activation of CRpathway triggered a motor CR: a 1s long regression followed by a turn of ~180°. Communication between the chip and the robot was performed using Matlab on a PC. The control program could be downloaded to the robot's processor, allowing the robot to act fully autonomously. In each experiment, the robot was placed in the circular arena exploring its environment with a constant speed of ~4 cm/s. A spatial frequency CS was detected at some distance when the robot approached the wall, followed by a collision with the wall, stimulating the IR sensors and thus triggering a US. Consequently the CS was correlated with the US, predicting it. The ISIs of these stimuli were variable, due to noise in sensor sampling, and variations in the angle at which the robot approached the wall. Figure 5: (A) Khepera microrobot with aVLSI chip mounted on top. (B) Only the forward sensors were used during the experiments. (C) The environment: a 60cm diameter circular arena surrounded by a 15cm high wall. A pattern of vertical, equally sized black and white bars was placed on the wall. Associative learning mediated by the cerebellum chip significantly altered the robot's behavior in the obstacle avoidance task (Figure 6) over the course of each experiment. In the initial learning phase, the behavior was UR driven: the robot drove forwards until it collided with the wall, only then performing a turn (Figure 6A1). In the trained phase, the robot usually turned just before it collided with the wall (Figure 6A2), reducing the number of collisions. The positions of the robot when a CS, US or CR event occurred in these two phases are shown in Figure 6B1 and B2. The CRs were not expressed immediately after the CSs, but rather with a CR latency adjusted to just prevent collisions (USs). Not all USs were avoided in the trained phase due to some excessively short ISIs (Figure 7) and normal extinction processes over many unreinforced trials. After the learning phase the percentage of effective CRs fluctuated between 70% and 100% (Figure 7). Figure 6: Learning performance of the robot. (Top row) Trajectories of the robot.

Our aVLSI cerebellum chip supports the acquisition and extinction of adaptively timed responses under noisy, real world conditions. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cerebellar circuit embedded in a synaptic feedback loop in the learning of adaptive behavior, and pave the way for the creation of artefacts with embedded ultra low-power learning capabilities. 6 Ref eren ces Fiala, J.

<p>Author: Marcelo A. Montemurro, Stefano Panzeri</p><p>Abstract: A typical neuron in visual cortex receives most inputs from other cortical neurons with a roughly similar stimulus preference. Does this arrangement of inputs allow efﬁcient readout of sensory information by the target cortical neuron? We address this issue by using simple modelling of neuronal population activity and information theoretic tools. We ﬁnd that efﬁcient synaptic information transmission requires that the tuning curve of the afferent neurons is approximately as wide as the spread of stimulus preferences of the afferent neurons reaching the target neuron. By meta analysis of neurophysiological data we found that this is the case for cortico-cortical inputs to neurons in visual cortex. We suggest that the organization of V1 cortico-cortical synaptic inputs allows optimal information transmission. 1</p><p>2 0.92477053 <a title="1-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Object_Classification_from_a_Single_Example_Utilizing_Class_Relevance_Metrics.html">134 nips-2004-Object Classification from a Single Example Utilizing Class Relevance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Fink</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for learning an object classiﬁer from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overﬁtting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classiﬁer could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, deﬁne a nearest neighbor classiﬁer where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83958483 <a title="1-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-A_Cost-Shaping_LP_for_Bellman_Error_Minimization_with_Performance_Guarantees.html">1 nips-2004-A Cost-Shaping LP for Bellman Error Minimization with Performance Guarantees</a></p>

The algorithm carries out a form of cost shaping and minimizes a version of Bellman error. We establish an error bound that scales gracefully with the number of states without imposing the (strong) Lyapunov condition required by its counterpart in [6]. We propose a path-following method that automates selection of important algorithm parameters which represent counterparts to the “state-relevance weights” studied in [6]. 1</p><p>4 0.70575845 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Spike-timing_Dependent_Plasticity_and_Mutual_Information_Maximization_for_a_Spiking_Neuron_Model.html">173 nips-2004-Spike-timing Dependent Plasticity and Mutual Information Maximization for a Spiking Neuron Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Laura W. Renninger, James M. Coughlan, Preeti Verghese, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

Prediction error of three models: random (R), saliency (S) and information maximization (I) for three observers (pv, lm, kr). The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

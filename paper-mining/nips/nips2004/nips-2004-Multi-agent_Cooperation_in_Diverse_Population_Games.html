<p>Author: David C. Parkes, Dimah Yanovsky, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: Online mechanism design (OMD) addresses the problem of sequential decision making in a stochastic environment with multiple self-interested agents. The goal in OMD is to make value-maximizing decisions despite this self-interest. In previous work we presented a Markov decision process (MDP)-based approach to OMD in large-scale problem domains. In practice the underlying MDP needed to solve OMD is too large and hence the mechanism must consider approximations. This raises the possibility that agents may be able to exploit the approximation for selﬁsh gain. We adopt sparse-sampling-based MDP algorithms to implement efﬁcient policies, and retain truth-revelation as an approximate BayesianNash equilibrium. Our approach is empirically illustrated in the context of the dynamic allocation of WiFi connectivity to users in a coffeehouse. 1</p><p>3 0.28521541 <a title="123-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-New_Criteria_and_a_New_Algorithm_for_Learning_in_Multi-Agent_Systems.html">129 nips-2004-New Criteria and a New Algorithm for Learning in Multi-Agent Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Powers, Yoav Shoham</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new set of criteria for learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, one that is more stringent and (we argue) better justiﬁed than previous proposed criteria. Our criteria, which apply most straightforwardly in repeated games with average rewards, consist of three requirements: (a) against a speciﬁed class of opponents (this class is a parameter of the criterion) the algorithm yield a payoff that approaches the payoff of the best response, (b) against other opponents the algorithm’s payoff at least approach (and possibly exceed) the security level payoff (or maximin value), and (c) subject to these requirements, the algorithm achieve a close to optimal payoff in self-play. We furthermore require that these average payoffs be achieved quickly. We then present a novel algorithm, and show that it meets these new criteria for a particular parameter class, the class of stationary opponents. Finally, we show that the algorithm is effective not only in theory, but also empirically. Using a recently introduced comprehensive game theoretic test suite, we show that the algorithm almost universally outperforms previous learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.24050136 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Coarticulation_in_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">39 nips-2004-Coarticulation in Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Khashayar Rohanimanesh, Robert Platt, Sridhar Mahadevan, Roderic Grupen</p><p>Abstract: We investigate an approach for simultaneously committing to multiple activities, each modeled as a temporally extended action in a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). For each activity we deﬁne a set of admissible solutions consisting of the redundant set of optimal policies, and those policies that ascend the optimal statevalue function associated with them. A plan is then generated by merging them in such a way that the solutions to the subordinate activities are realized in the set of admissible solutions satisfying the superior activities. We present our theoretical results and empirically evaluate our approach in a simulated domain. 1</p><p>5 0.20149943 <a title="123-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Shani, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Agents learning to act in a partially observable domain may need to overcome the problem of perceptual aliasing Ă˘&euro;&ldquo; i.e., different states that appear similar but require different responses. This problem is exacerbated when the agentĂ˘&euro;&trade;s sensors are noisy, i.e., sensors may produce different observations in the same state. We show that many well-known reinforcement learning methods designed to deal with perceptual aliasing, such as Utile SufÄ?Ĺš x Memory, Ä?Ĺš nite size history windows, eligibility traces, and memory bits, do not handle noisy sensors well. We suggest a new algorithm, Noisy Utile SufÄ?Ĺš x Memory (NUSM), based on USM, that uses a weighted classiÄ?Ĺš cation of observed trajectories. We compare NUSM to the above methods and show it to be more robust to noise.</p><p>6 0.49708477 <a title="123-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Intrinsically_Motivated_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2004-Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniela D. Farias, Nimrod Megiddo</p><p>Abstract: A reactive environment is one that responds to the actions of an agent rather than evolving obliviously. In reactive environments, experts algorithms must balance exploration and exploitation of experts more carefully than in oblivious ones. In addition, a more subtle deﬁnition of a learnable value of an expert is required. A general exploration-exploitation experts method is presented along with a proper deﬁnition of value. The method is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best available expert. Several variants are analyzed from the viewpoint of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, including explore-then-exploit, polynomially vanishing exploration, constant-frequency exploration, and constant-size exploration phases. Complexity and performance bounds are proven. 1</p><p>3 0.56075764 <a title="123-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>

We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm to perform blind, one-microphone speech separation. Our algorithm separates mixtures of speech without modeling individual speakers. Instead, we formulate the problem of speech separation as a problem in segmenting the spectrogram of the signal into two or more disjoint sets. We build feature sets for our segmenter using classical cues from speech psychophysics. We then combine these features into parameterized afﬁnity matrices. We also take advantage of the fact that we can generate training examples for segmentation by artiﬁcially superposing separately-recorded signals. Thus the parameters of the afﬁnity matrices can be tuned using recent work on learning spectral clustering [1]. This yields an adaptive, speech-speciﬁc segmentation algorithm that can successfully separate one-microphone speech mixtures. 1</p><p>3 0.41883627 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Real-Time_Pitch_Determination_of_One_or_More_Voices_by_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization.html">152 nips-2004-Real-Time Pitch Determination of One or More Voices by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Sha, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: An auditory “scene”, composed of overlapping acoustic sources, can be viewed as a complex object whose constituent parts are the individual sources. Pitch is known to be an important cue for auditory scene analysis. In this paper, with the goal of building agents that operate in human environments, we describe a real-time system to identify the presence of one or more voices and compute their pitch. The signal processing in the front end is based on instantaneous frequency estimation, a method for tracking the partials of voiced speech, while the pattern-matching in the back end is based on nonnegative matrix factorization, an unsupervised algorithm for learning the parts of complex objects. While supporting a framework to analyze complicated auditory scenes, our system maintains real-time operability and state-of-the-art performance in clean speech.</p><p>4 0.31674972 <a title="5-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Nonlinear_Blind_Source_Separation_by_Integrating_Independent_Component_Analysis_and_Slow_Feature_Analysis.html">132 nips-2004-Nonlinear Blind Source Separation by Integrating Independent Component Analysis and Slow Feature Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Tobias Blaschke, Laurenz Wiskott</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the equivalence of linear blind source separation and linear independent component analysis it is not possible to recover the original source signal from some unknown nonlinear transformations of the sources using only the independence assumption. Integrating the objectives of statistical independence and temporal slowness removes this indeterminacy leading to a new method for nonlinear blind source separation. The principle of temporal slowness is adopted from slow feature analysis, an unsupervised method to extract slowly varying features from a given observed vectorial signal. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on nonlinearly mixed speech data. 1</p><p>5 0.15749779 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution (BRAND) is proposed for estimating time delays of acoustic signals in reverberant environments. Sparsity of the nonnegative ﬁlter coefﬁcients is enforced using an L1 -norm regularization. A probabilistic generative model is used to simultaneously estimate the regularization parameters and ﬁlter coefﬁcients from the signal data. Iterative update rules are derived under a Bayesian framework using the Expectation-Maximization procedure. The resulting time delay estimation algorithm is demonstrated on noisy acoustic data.</p><p>6 0.15212168 <a title="5-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Modeling_Nonlinear_Dependencies_in_Natural_Images_using_Mixture_of_Laplacian_Distribution.html">121 nips-2004-Modeling Nonlinear Dependencies in Natural Images using Mixture of Laplacian Distribution</a></p>

<p>Author: Tanzeem Choudhury, Sumit Basu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we quantitatively investigate the ways in which a given person influences the joint turn-taking behavior in a conversation. After collecting an auditory database of social interactions among a group of twenty-three people via wearable sensors (66 hours of data each over two weeks), we apply speech and conversation detection methods to the auditory streams. These methods automatically locate the conversations, determine their participants, and mark which participant was speaking when. We then model the joint turn-taking behavior as a Mixed-Memory Markov Model [1] that combines the statistics of the individual subjects' self-transitions and the partners ' cross-transitions. The mixture parameters in this model describe how much each person 's individual behavior contributes to the joint turn-taking behavior of the pair. By estimating these parameters, we thus estimate how much influence each participant has in determining the joint turntaking behavior. We show how this measure correlates significantly with betweenness centrality [2], an independent measure of an individual's importance in a social network. This result suggests that our estimate of conversational influence is predictive of social influence. 1</p><p>6 0.49581352 <a title="5-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jing Wang, Zhenyue Zhang, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there have been several advances in the machine learning and pattern recognition communities for developing manifold learning algorithms to construct nonlinear low-dimensional manifolds from sample data points embedded in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we develop algorithms that address two key issues in manifold learning: 1) the adaptive selection of the neighborhood sizes; and 2) better ﬁtting the local geometric structure to account for the variations in the curvature of the manifold and its interplay with the sampling density of the data set. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our methods on some synthetic data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.8423152 <a title="5-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Blind_One-microphone_Speech_Separation%3A_A_Spectral_Learning_Approach.html">31 nips-2004-Blind One-microphone Speech Separation: A Spectral Learning Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Amnon Shashua, Tamir Hazan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a general family of algebraic positive deﬁnite similarity functions over spaces of matrices with varying column rank. The columns can represent local regions in an image (whereby images have varying number of local parts), images of an image sequence, motion trajectories in a multibody motion, and so forth. The family of set kernels we derive is based on a group invariant tensor product lifting with parameters that can be naturally tuned to provide a cook-book of sorts covering the possible ”wish lists” from similarity measures over sets of varying cardinality. We highlight the strengths of our approach by demonstrating the set kernels for visual recognition of pedestrians using local parts representations. 1</p><p>5 0.83477151 <a title="5-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Surface_Reconstruction_using_Learned_Shape_Models.html">179 nips-2004-Surface Reconstruction using Learned Shape Models</a></p>

While humans can effortlessly retrieve 3D shape information, this inverse problem has turned out to be difﬁcult to perform automatically. We introduce a framework based on level set surface reconstruction and shape models for achieving this goal. Through this merging, we obtain an efﬁcient and robust method for reconstructing surfaces of an object category of interest. The shape model includes surface cues such as point, curve and silhouette features. Based on ideas from Active Shape Models, we show how both the geometry and the appearance of these features can be modelled consistently in a multi-view context. The complete surface is obtained by evolving a level set driven by a PDE, which tries to ﬁt the surface to the inferred 3D features. In addition, an a priori 3D surface model is used to regularize the solution, in particular, where surface features are sparse. Experiments are demonstrated on a database of real face images.</p><p>6 0.82708949 <a title="5-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Non-Local_Manifold_Tangent_Learning.html">131 nips-2004-Non-Local Manifold Tangent Learning</a></p>

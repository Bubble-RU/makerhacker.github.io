<p>Author: Philip M. Long, Xinyu Wu</p><p>Abstract: We establish a mistake bound for an ensemble method for classiﬁcation based on maximizing the entropy of voting weights subject to margin constraints. The bound is the same as a general bound proved for the Weighted Majority Algorithm, and similar to bounds for other variants of Winnow. We prove a more reﬁned bound that leads to a nearly optimal algorithm for learning disjunctions, again, based on the maximum entropy principle. We describe a simpliﬁcation of the on-line maximum entropy method in which, after each iteration, the margin constraints are replaced with a single linear inequality. The simpliﬁed algorithm, which takes a similar form to Winnow, achieves the same mistake bounds. 1</p><p>3 0.096879087 <a title="4-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Inference%2C_Attention%2C_and_Decision_in_a_Bayesian_Neural_Architecture.html">84 nips-2004-Inference, Attention, and Decision in a Bayesian Neural Architecture</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela J. Yu, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: We study the synthesis of neural coding, selective attention and perceptual decision making. A hierarchical neural architecture is proposed, which implements Bayesian integration of noisy sensory input and topdown attentional priors, leading to sound perceptual discrimination. The model offers an explicit explanation for the experimentally observed modulation that prior information in one stimulus feature (location) can have on an independent feature (orientation). The network’s intermediate levels of representation instantiate known physiological properties of visual cortical neurons. The model also illustrates a possible reconciliation of cortical and neuromodulatory representations of uncertainty. 1</p><p>4 0.096605934 <a title="4-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Online_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Algorithms.html">138 nips-2004-Online Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a competitive analysis of Bayesian learning algorithms in the online learning setting and show that many simple Bayesian algorithms (such as Gaussian linear regression and Bayesian logistic regression) perform favorably when compared, in retrospect, to the single best model in the model class. The analysis does not assume that the Bayesian algorithms’ modeling assumptions are “correct,” and our bounds hold even if the data is adversarially chosen. For Gaussian linear regression (using logloss), our error bounds are comparable to the best bounds in the online learning literature, and we also provide a lower bound showing that Gaussian linear regression is optimal in a certain worst case sense. We also give bounds for some widely used maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation algorithms, including regularized logistic regression. 1</p><p>5 0.093218148 <a title="4-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Object_Classification_from_a_Single_Example_Utilizing_Class_Relevance_Metrics.html">134 nips-2004-Object Classification from a Single Example Utilizing Class Relevance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Fink</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for learning an object classiﬁer from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overﬁtting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classiﬁer could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, deﬁne a nearest neighbor classiﬁer where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>6 0.091411658 <a title="4-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Wojtek Kowalczyk, Nikos A. Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a gossip-based distributed algorithm for Gaussian mixture learning, Newscast EM. The algorithm operates on network topologies where each node observes a local quantity and can communicate with other nodes in an arbitrary point-to-point fashion. The main difference between Newscast EM and the standard EM algorithm is that the M-step in our case is implemented in a decentralized manner: (random) pairs of nodes repeatedly exchange their local parameter estimates and combine them by (weighted) averaging. We provide theoretical evidence and demonstrate experimentally that, under this protocol, nodes converge exponentially fast to the correct estimates in each M-step of the EM algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.25015688 <a title="4-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-The_Power_of_Selective_Memory%3A_Self-Bounded_Learning_of_Prediction_Suffix_Trees.html">189 nips-2004-The Power of Selective Memory: Self-Bounded Learning of Prediction Suffix Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Prediction sufﬁx trees (PST) provide a popular and effective tool for tasks such as compression, classiﬁcation, and language modeling. In this paper we take a decision theoretic view of PSTs for the task of sequence prediction. Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a loss bound for it. The depth of the PST generated by this algorithm scales linearly with the length of the input. We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm which automatically grows a bounded-depth PST. We also prove an analogous mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm. The result is an efﬁcient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any ﬁxed PST determined in hindsight. 1</p><p>6 0.24686621 <a title="4-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Bayesian_Regularization_and_Nonnegative_Deconvolution_for_Time_Delay_Estimation.html">27 nips-2004-Bayesian Regularization and Nonnegative Deconvolution for Time Delay Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: There is growing evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies that the brain utilizes Bayesian principles for inference and decision making. An important open question is how Bayesian inference for arbitrary graphical models can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons. In this paper, we show that recurrent networks of noisy integrate-and-ﬁre neurons can perform approximate Bayesian inference for dynamic and hierarchical graphical models. The membrane potential dynamics of neurons is used to implement belief propagation in the log domain. The spiking probability of a neuron is shown to approximate the posterior probability of the preferred state encoded by the neuron, given past inputs. We illustrate the model using two examples: (1) a motion detection network in which the spiking probability of a direction-selective neuron becomes proportional to the posterior probability of motion in a preferred direction, and (2) a two-level hierarchical network that produces attentional effects similar to those observed in visual cortical areas V2 and V4. The hierarchical model offers a new Bayesian interpretation of attentional modulation in V2 and V4. 1</p><p>2 0.70821059 <a title="4-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-The_Rescorla-Wagner_Algorithm_and_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Causal_Parameters.html">190 nips-2004-The Rescorla-Wagner Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Causal Parameters</a></p>

We prove that the parameters of two popular causal models, ∆P and P C, can be learnt by the same generalized linear Rescorla-Wagner (GLRW) algorithm provided genericity conditions apply. We characterize the ﬁxed points of these GLRW algorithms and calculate the ﬂuctuations about them, assuming that the input is a set of i.i.d. samples from a ﬁxed (unknown) distribution. We describe how to determine convergence conditions and calculate convergence rates for the GLRW algorithms under these conditions.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.66576976 <a title="4-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-A_Generalized_Bradley-Terry_Model%3A_From_Group_Competition_to_Individual_Skill.html">4 nips-2004-A Generalized Bradley-Terry Model: From Group Competition to Individual Skill</a></p>

<p>Author: Suvrit Sra, Joel Tropp, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Various problems in machine learning, databases, and statistics involve pairwise distances among a set of objects. It is often desirable for these distances to satisfy the properties of a metric, especially the triangle inequality. Applications where metric data is useful include clustering, classiﬁcation, metric-based indexing, and approximation algorithms for various graph problems. This paper presents the Metric Nearness Problem: Given a dissimilarity matrix, ﬁnd the “nearest” matrix of distances that satisfy the triangle inequalities. For p nearness measures, this paper develops efﬁcient triangle ﬁxing algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the inherent structure of the problem. Empirically, the algorithms have time and storage costs that are linear in the number of triangle constraints. The methods can also be easily parallelized for additional speed. 1</p><p>5 0.57812184 <a title="4-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Clustering_of_a_Mixture_Model.html">77 nips-2004-Hierarchical Clustering of a Mixture Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Sam T.

The method minimizes a new, easily computed distance measure between two Gaussian mixtures that can be motivated from a suitable stochastic model and the iterations of the algorithm use only the model parameters, avoiding the need for explicit resampling of datapoints. We demonstrate the method by performing hierarchical clustering of scenery images and handwritten digits. 1</p><p>6 0.53283989 <a title="4-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Maximising_Sensitivity_in_a_Spiking_Network.html">112 nips-2004-Maximising Sensitivity in a Spiking Network</a></p>

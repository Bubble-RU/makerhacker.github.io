</p><p>7 We apply both new algorithms, called the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost, to learn a kernel matrix from distance measurements. [sent-17, score-0.352]
</p><p>8 More speciﬁcally, when learning a similarity or a distance function among objects, the parameters are deﬁned as a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix that serves as a kernel (e. [sent-20, score-0.501]
</p><p>9 Learning is typically formulated as a parameter updating procedure to optimize a loss function. [sent-23, score-0.148]
</p><p>10 The gradient descent update [6] is one of the most commonly used algorithms, but it is not appropriate when the parameters form a positive deﬁnite matrix, because the updated parameter is not necessarily positive deﬁnite. [sent-24, score-0.421]
</p><p>11 In this paper, we introduce the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient update which works as follows: First, the matrix logarithm of the current parameter matrix is computed. [sent-28, score-0.333]
</p><p>12 Finally, the parameter matrix is updated to the exponential of the modiﬁed log-matrix. [sent-30, score-0.183]
</p><p>13 Our update preserves symmetry and positive deﬁniteness because the matrix exponential maps any symmetric matrix to a positive deﬁnite matrix. [sent-31, score-0.668]
</p><p>14 A learning problem is essentially deﬁned by a loss function, and a divergence that measures the discrepancy between parameters. [sent-33, score-0.266]
</p><p>15 More precisely, the updates are motivated by minimizing the sum of the loss function and the Bregman divergence, where the loss function is multiplied by a positive learning rate. [sent-34, score-0.404]
</p><p>16 For example, the gradient descent is derived from the squared Euclidean distance, and the exponentiated gradient from the Kullback-Leibler divergence. [sent-36, score-0.334]
</p><p>17 We use the von Neumann divergence (also called quantum relative entropy) for measuring the discrepancy between two positive deﬁnite matrices [8]. [sent-37, score-0.522]
</p><p>18 We derive a new Matrix Exponentiated Gradient update from this divergence (which is a Bregman divergence for positive deﬁnite matrices). [sent-38, score-0.42]
</p><p>19 Finally we prove relative loss bounds using the von Neumann divergence as a measure of progress. [sent-39, score-0.407]
</p><p>20 Also the following related key problem has received a lot of attention recently [14, 11, 13]: Find a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix that satisﬁes a number of symmetric linear inequality constraints. [sent-40, score-0.57]
</p><p>21 When choosing F(W) = tr(W log W − W), then f (W) = log W and the corresponding Bregman divergence becomes the von Neumann divergence [8]: ∆F (W, W) = tr(W log W − W log W − W + W). [sent-45, score-0.567]
</p><p>22 In this case, the positive symmetric deﬁnite matrices are related to density matrices commonly used in Statistical Physics and the divergence simpliﬁes to ∆F (W, W) = tr(W log W − W log W). [sent-47, score-0.66]
</p><p>23 If W = i λi v i v i is our notation for the eigenvalue decomposition, then we can rewrite the normalized divergence as ˜ ˜ λi ln λi +  ∆F (W, W) = i  ˜ λi ln λj (˜ i v j )2 . [sent-48, score-0.14]
</p><p>24 v i,j  So this divergence quantiﬁes the difference in the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors. [sent-49, score-0.16]
</p><p>25 3 On-line Learning In this section, we present a natural extension of the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) update [6] to an update for symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices. [sent-50, score-0.467]
</p><p>26 At the t-th trial, the algorithm receives a symmetric instance matrix Xt ∈ Rd×d . [sent-51, score-0.274]
</p><p>27 It then produces a prediction yt = tr(Wt Xt ) based on the algorithm’s current symmetric positive ˆ deﬁnite parameter matrix Wt . [sent-52, score-0.581]
</p><p>28 Finally it incurs for instance1 a quadratic loss (ˆt − yt )2 , y 1 For the sake of simplicity, we use the simple quadratic loss: Lt (W) = (tr(Xt W) − yt )2 . [sent-53, score-0.515]
</p><p>29 For the general update, the gradient Lt (Wt ) is exponentiated in the update (4) and this gradient must be symmetric. [sent-54, score-0.416]
</p><p>30 In the update we aim to solve the following problem: Wt+1 = argminW ∆F (W, Wt ) + η(tr(WXt ) − yt )2 , (2) where the convex function F deﬁnes the Bregman divergence. [sent-57, score-0.338]
</p><p>31 Setting the derivative with respect to W to zero, we have f (Wt+1 ) − f (Wt ) + η [(tr(Wt+1 Xt ) − yt )2 ] = 0. [sent-58, score-0.198]
</p><p>32 Then, we have the following update: Wt+1 = f −1 (f (Wt ) − 2η(ˆt − yt )Xt ). [sent-61, score-0.198]
</p><p>33 y  In our case, F(W) = tr(W log W − W) and thus f (W) = log W and f −1 (W) = exp W. [sent-62, score-0.204]
</p><p>34 We also augment (2) with the constraint tr(W) = 1, leading to the following Matrix Exponential Gradient (MEG) Update: 1 Wt+1 = y (4) exp(log Wt − 2η(ˆt − yt )Xt ), Zt where the normalization factor Zt is tr[exp(log Wt − 2η(ˆt − yt )Xt )]. [sent-63, score-0.428]
</p><p>35 Note that in the y above update, the exponent log Wt − 2η(ˆt − yt )Xt is an arbitrary symmetric matrix and y the matrix exponential converts this matrix back into a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. [sent-64, score-1.04]
</p><p>36 A numerically stable version of the MEG update is given in Section 3. [sent-65, score-0.152]
</p><p>37 1 Relative Loss Bounds We now begin with the deﬁnitions needed for the relative loss bounds. [sent-68, score-0.162]
</p><p>38 , (XT , yT ) denote a sequence of examples, where the instance matrices Xt ∈ Rd×d are symmetric and the labels yt ∈ R. [sent-72, score-0.455]
</p><p>39 For any symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite maT trix U with tr(U) = 1, deﬁne its total loss as LU (S) = t=1 (tr(UXt ) − yt )2 . [sent-73, score-0.572]
</p><p>40 The total T loss of the on-line algorithm is LMEG (S) = t=1 (tr(Wt Xt ) − yt )2 . [sent-74, score-0.317]
</p><p>41 We prove a bound on the relative loss LMEG (S) − LU (S) that holds for any U. [sent-75, score-0.194]
</p><p>42 The proof generalizes a similar bound for the Exponentiated Gradient update (Lemmas 5. [sent-76, score-0.17]
</p><p>43 The relative loss bound is derived in two steps: Lemma 3. [sent-79, score-0.194]
</p><p>44 1 bounds the relative loss for an individual trial and Lemma 3. [sent-80, score-0.205]
</p><p>45 Let Xt be any symmetric matrix whose smallest and largest eigenvalues satisfy λmax − λmin ≤ r. [sent-84, score-0.317]
</p><p>46 Assume Wt+1 is produced from Wt by the MEG update and let U be any symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite matrix. [sent-85, score-0.361]
</p><p>47 , tr[exp(A + B)] ≥ tr[exp(A) exp(B)] for symmetric matrices A and B. [sent-88, score-0.257]
</p><p>48 We also needed to prove the following generalization of Jensen’s inequality to matrices: exp(ρ1 A + ρ2 (I − A)) ≤ exp(ρ1 )A + exp(ρ2 )(I − A) for ﬁnite ρ1 , ρ2 ∈ R and any symmetric matrix A with 0 < A ≤ I. [sent-89, score-0.315]
</p><p>49 2 Let W1 and U be arbitrary symmetric positive deﬁnite initial and comparison matrices, respectively. [sent-92, score-0.255]
</p><p>50 Assuming LU (S) ≤ max and ∆(U, W1 ) ≤ dmax , the bound (6) is tightest when c = √ 2 r 2dmax / max . [sent-97, score-0.162]
</p><p>51 2 Numerically stable MEG update The MEG update is numerically unstable when the eigenvalues of Wt are around zero. [sent-100, score-0.301]
</p><p>52 However we can “unwrap” Wt+1 as follows: t  Wt+1 =  1 exp(ct I + log W1 − 2η (ˆs − ys )Xs ), y ˜t Z s=1  (7)  ˜ where the constant Zt normalizes the trace of Wt+1 to one. [sent-101, score-0.144]
</p><p>53 Note that the update is independent of the choice of ct ∈ R. [sent-103, score-0.204]
</p><p>54 We incrementally maintain an eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix in the exponent (O(n3 ) per iteration): t T Vt Λt Vt = ct I + log W1 − 2η  s=1  (ˆs − ys )Xs ), y  where the constant ct is chosen so that the maximum eigenvalue of the above is zero. [sent-104, score-0.459]
</p><p>55 , n,  (8)  where the symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix W1 of trace one is the initial parameter matrix, and C1 , . [sent-109, score-0.433]
</p><p>56 Prior knowledge about W is encoded in the constraints, and the matrix closest to W1 is chosen among the matrices satisfying all constraints. [sent-113, score-0.181]
</p><p>57 Tsuda and Noble [13] employed this approach for learning a kernel matrix among graph nodes, and this method can be potentially applied to learn a kernel matrix in other settings (e. [sent-114, score-0.35]
</p><p>58 The problem (8) is a projection of W1 to the intersection of convex regions deﬁned by the constraints. [sent-117, score-0.16]
</p><p>59 It is well known that the Bregman projection into the intersection of convex regions can be solved by sequential projections to each region [1]. [sent-118, score-0.217]
</p><p>60 We generalize the latter algorithm and its analysis to symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices and call the new algorithm DeﬁniteBoost. [sent-121, score-0.337]
</p><p>61 2 Note that if η is large then the on-line update (2) becomes a Bregman projection subject to a single equality constraint tr(WXt ) = yt . [sent-123, score-0.426]
</p><p>62 Approximate Projection  Exact Projection  Before presenting the algorithm, let us derive the dual problem of (8) by means of Lagrange multipliers γ,    n  γ ∗ = argminγ log tr exp(log W1 −  j=1  γj Cj ) ,  γj ≥ 0. [sent-129, score-0.16]
</p><p>63 Note that we can use the same numerically stable update as in the previous section. [sent-141, score-0.152]
</p><p>64 However, one can use the following approximate solution: αt =  λmax t  1 log − λmin t  1 + rt /λmax t 1 + rt /λmin t  ,  (13)  when the eigenvalues of Ct lie in the interval [λmin , λmax ] and rt = tr(Wt Ct ). [sent-144, score-0.549]
</p><p>65 Since the t t most unsatisﬁed constraint is chosen, rt ≥ 0 and thus αt ≥ 0. [sent-145, score-0.172]
</p><p>66 Although the projection is done only approximately,3 the convergence of the dual objective (9) can be shown using the following upper bound. [sent-146, score-0.264]
</p><p>67 3 The approximate Bregman projection (with αt as in (13) can also be motivated as an online algorithm based on an entropic loss and learning rate one (following Section 3 and [4]). [sent-147, score-0.261]
</p><p>68 1 The dual objective (9) is bounded as    n  tr exp log W1 −  where ρ(rt ) =  1−  j=1  γj Cj  ≤  λmax t λmax −λmin t t  rt  T  ρ(rt )  rt 1 − min λt  λmax t  (14)  t=1 −λmin t λmax −λmin t t  . [sent-149, score-0.84]
</p><p>69 The dual objective is monotonically decreasing, because ρ(rt ) ≤ 1. [sent-150, score-0.132]
</p><p>70 Also, since rt corresponds to the maximum value among all constraint violations {rj }n , we have ρ(rt ) = 1 j=1 only if rt = 0. [sent-151, score-0.312]
</p><p>71 Thus the dual objective continues to decrease until all constraints are satisﬁed. [sent-152, score-0.132]
</p><p>72 For the j-th hypothesis hj (x), let max / min us deﬁne Cj = diag(y1 hj (x1 ), . [sent-159, score-0.196]
</p><p>73 Setting W1 = I/d, the dual objective (14) is rewritten as   d n 1 exp −yi γj hj (xi ) , d i=1 j=1  which is equivalent to the exponential loss function used in AdaBoost. [sent-164, score-0.446]
</p><p>74 Since Cj and W1 are diagonal, the matrix Wt stays diagonal after the update. [sent-165, score-0.133]
</p><p>75 If wti = [Wt ]ii , the updating formula (12) becomes the AdaBoost update: wt+1,i = wti exp(−αt yi ht (xi ))/Zt (αt ). [sent-166, score-0.18]
</p><p>76 The 1+r approximate solution of αt (13) is described as αt = 1 log 1−rt , where rt is the weighted 2 t d i=1  training error of the t-th hypothesis, i. [sent-167, score-0.226]
</p><p>77 5 Experiments on Learning Kernels In this section, our technique is applied to learning a kernel matrix from a set of distance measurements. [sent-170, score-0.246]
</p><p>78 When K is a d × d kernel matrix among d objects, then the Kij characterizes the similarity between objects i and j. [sent-172, score-0.203]
</p><p>79 In the feature space, Kij corresponds to the inner product between object i and j, and thus the Euclidean distance can be computed from the entries of the kernel matrix [10]. [sent-173, score-0.246]
</p><p>80 In some cases, the kernel matrix is not given explicitly, but only a set of distance measurements is available. [sent-174, score-0.246]
</p><p>81 Our task is to obtain a positive deﬁnite kernel matrix which ﬁts well to the given distance data. [sent-181, score-0.326]
</p><p>82 On-line kernel learning In the ﬁrst experiment, we consider the on-line learning scenario in which only one distance example is shown to the learner at each time step. [sent-182, score-0.147]
</p><p>83 The distance example at time t is described as {at , bt , yt }, which indicates that the squared Euclidean distance between objects at and bt is yt . [sent-183, score-0.696]
</p><p>84 Let us deﬁne a time-developing sequence of kernel matrices as {Wt }T , and the corresponding points in the feature space as {xti }d (i. [sent-184, score-0.158]
</p><p>85 Then, the total loss incurred by this sequence is T t=1  xtat − xtbt  2  − yt  2  T  = t=1  (tr(Wt Xt ) − yt )2 ,  1. [sent-187, score-0.515]
</p><p>86 where Xt is a symmetric matrix whose (at , at ) and (bt , bt ) elements are 0. [sent-215, score-0.339]
</p><p>87 We consider a controlled experiment in which the distance examples are created from a known target kernel matrix. [sent-218, score-0.187]
</p><p>88 We used a 52 × 52 kernel matrix among gyrB proteins of bacteria (d = 52). [sent-219, score-0.257]
</p><p>89 When the comparison matrix U is set to the target matrix, LU (S) = 0 and max = 0, because all the distance examples are derived from the target matrix. [sent-223, score-0.299]
</p><p>90 Therefore we choose learning rate η = 2, which minimizes the relative loss bound of Lemma 3. [sent-224, score-0.194]
</p><p>91 The total loss of the kernel matrix sequence obtained by the matrix exponential update is shown in Figure 2 (left). [sent-226, score-0.528]
</p><p>92 In the plot, we have also shown the relative loss bound. [sent-227, score-0.162]
</p><p>93 To evaluate the learned kernel matrix, the prediction accuracy of bacteria species by the nearest neighbor classiﬁer is calculated (Figure 2, right), where the 52 proteins are randomly divided into 50% training and 50% testing data. [sent-229, score-0.245]
</p><p>94 Kernel learning by Bregman projection Next, let us consider a batch learning scenario where we have a set of qualitative distance evaluations (i. [sent-233, score-0.186]
</p><p>95 As in the previous section, distance examples are generated from the target kernel matrix between gyrB proteins. [sent-245, score-0.286]
</p><p>96 Figure 3 (left) shows the convergence of the dual objective function as proven in Theorem 4. [sent-248, score-0.174]
</p><p>97 As opposed to the previous experiment, the error rate is higher than that of the target kernel matrix, because substantial amount of information is lost by the conversion to inequality constraints. [sent-252, score-0.157]
</p><p>98 6 Conclusion We motivated and analyzed a new update for symmetric positive matrices using the von Neumann divergence. [sent-264, score-0.556]
</p><p>99 We showed that the standard bounds for on-line learning and Boosting generalize to the case when the parameters are a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix (of trace one) instead of a probability vector. [sent-265, score-0.447]

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael Collins, Ben Taskar, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of structured classiﬁcation, where the task is to predict a label y from an input x, and y has meaningful internal structure. Our framework includes supervised training of Markov random ﬁelds and weighted context-free grammars as special cases. We describe an algorithm that solves the large-margin optimization problem deﬁned in [12], using an exponential-family (Gibbs distribution) representation of structured objects. The algorithm is efﬁcient—even in cases where the number of labels y is exponential in size—provided that certain expectations under Gibbs distributions can be calculated efﬁciently. The method for structured labels relies on a more general result, speciﬁcally the application of exponentiated gradient updates [7, 8] to quadratic programs. 1</p><p>3 0.26448882 <a title="110-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-The_Power_of_Selective_Memory%3A_Self-Bounded_Learning_of_Prediction_Suffix_Trees.html">189 nips-2004-The Power of Selective Memory: Self-Bounded Learning of Prediction Suffix Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: On-line learning with a simple square loss and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to symmetric linear constraints. The updates generalize the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive deﬁnite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the analysis of each algorithm generalizes to the non-diagonal case. We apply both new algorithms, called the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost, to learn a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>2 0.74026382 <a title="110-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-The_Power_of_Selective_Memory%3A_Self-Bounded_Learning_of_Prediction_Suffix_Trees.html">189 nips-2004-The Power of Selective Memory: Self-Bounded Learning of Prediction Suffix Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Aurell, Uri Gordon, Scott Kirkpatrick</p><p>Abstract: Survey propagation is a powerful technique from statistical physics that has been applied to solve the 3-SAT problem both in principle and in practice. We give, using only probability arguments, a common derivation of survey propagation, belief propagation and several interesting hybrid methods. We then present numerical experiments which use WSAT (a widely used random-walk based SAT solver) to quantify the complexity of the 3-SAT formulae as a function of their parameters, both as randomly generated and after simpli£cation, guided by survey propagation. Some properties of WSAT which have not previously been reported make it an ideal tool for this purpose – its mean cost is proportional to the number of variables in the formula (at a £xed ratio of clauses to variables) in the easy-SAT regime and slightly beyond, and its behavior in the hardSAT regime appears to re¤ect the underlying structure of the solution space that has been predicted by replica symmetry-breaking arguments. An analysis of the tradeoffs between the various methods of search for satisfying assignments shows WSAT to be far more powerful than has been appreciated, and suggests some interesting new directions for practical algorithm development. 1</p><p>2 0.88462198 <a title="110-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Tracking_of_Pose%2C_Expression%2C_and_Texture_using_Conditionally_Gaussian_Filters.html">91 nips-2004-Joint Tracking of Pose, Expression, and Texture using Conditionally Gaussian Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: On-line learning with a simple square loss and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to symmetric linear constraints. The updates generalize the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive deﬁnite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the analysis of each algorithm generalizes to the non-diagonal case. We apply both new algorithms, called the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost, to learn a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>4 0.85383415 <a title="110-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_via_Gaussian_Processes.html">166 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning via Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Prediction sufﬁx trees (PST) provide a popular and effective tool for tasks such as compression, classiﬁcation, and language modeling. In this paper we take a decision theoretic view of PSTs for the task of sequence prediction. Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a loss bound for it. The depth of the PST generated by this algorithm scales linearly with the length of the input. We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm which automatically grows a bounded-depth PST. We also prove an analogous mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm. The result is an efﬁcient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any ﬁxed PST determined in hindsight. 1</p><p>6 0.76140875 <a title="110-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty.html">178 nips-2004-Support Vector Classification with Input Data Uncertainty</a></p>

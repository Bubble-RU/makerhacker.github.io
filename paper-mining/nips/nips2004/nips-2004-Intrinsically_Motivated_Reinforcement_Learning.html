Kakade, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider an MDP setting in which the reward function is allowed to change during each time step of play (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain ﬁxed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well can an agent do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efﬁcient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard. 1</p><p>3 0.27092856 <a title="88-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Discriminant_Saliency_for_Visual_Recognition_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">53 nips-2004-Discriminant Saliency for Visual Recognition from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dashan Gao, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: Saliency mechanisms play an important role when visual recognition must be performed in cluttered scenes. We propose a computational deﬁnition of saliency that deviates from existing models by equating saliency to discrimination. In particular, the salient attributes of a given visual class are deﬁned as the features that enable best discrimination between that class and all other classes of recognition interest. It is shown that this deﬁnition leads to saliency algorithms of low complexity, that are scalable to large recognition problems, and is compatible with existing models of early biological vision. Experimental results demonstrating success in the context of challenging recognition problems are also presented. 1</p><p>4 0.26904386 <a title="88-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_first-order_Markov_models_for_control.html">102 nips-2004-Learning first-order Markov models for control</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: First-order Markov models have been successfully applied to many problems, for example in modeling sequential data using Markov chains, and modeling control problems using the Markov decision processes (MDP) formalism. If a ﬁrst-order Markov model’s parameters are estimated from data, the standard maximum likelihood estimator considers only the ﬁrst-order (single-step) transitions. But for many problems, the ﬁrstorder conditional independence assumptions are not satisﬁed, and as a result the higher order transition probabilities may be poorly approximated. Motivated by the problem of learning an MDP’s parameters for control, we propose an algorithm for learning a ﬁrst-order Markov model that explicitly takes into account higher order interactions during training. Our algorithm uses an optimization criterion different from maximum likelihood, and allows us to learn models that capture longer range effects, but without giving up the beneﬁts of using ﬁrst-order Markov models. Our experimental results also show the new algorithm outperforming conventional maximum likelihood estimation in a number of control problems where the MDP’s parameters are estimated from data. 1</p><p>5 0.20018153 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Multi-agent_Cooperation_in_Diverse_Population_Games.html">123 nips-2004-Multi-agent Cooperation in Diverse Population Games</a></p>

The agents adapt to the environment by reinforcement learning of the preferences of the policies they hold. Diversity of preferences of policies is introduced by adding random biases to the initial cumulative payoffs of their policies. We explain and provide evidence that agent cooperation becomes increasingly important when diversity increases. Analyses of these mechanisms yield excellent agreement with simulations over nine decades of data. 1</p><p>6 0.19901474 <a title="88-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Approximately_Efficient_Online_Mechanism_Design.html">24 nips-2004-Approximately Efficient Online Mechanism Design</a></p>

<p>Author: Laura W. Renninger, James M. Coughlan, Preeti Verghese, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

<p>Author: Nuttapong Chentanez, Andrew G. Barto, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists call behavior intrinsically motivated when it is engaged in for its own sake rather than as a step toward solving a speciﬁc problem of clear practical value. But what we learn during intrinsically motivated behavior is essential for our development as competent autonomous entities able to efﬁciently solve a wide range of practical problems as they arise. In this paper we present initial results from a computational study of intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning aimed at allowing artiﬁcial agents to construct and extend hierarchies of reusable skills that are needed for competent autonomy. 1</p><p>2 0.66668177 <a title="88-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Relational_Embedding.html">125 nips-2004-Multiple Relational Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a way of using multiple different types of similarity relationship to learn a low-dimensional embedding of a dataset. Our method chooses different, possibly overlapping representations of similarity by individually reweighting the dimensions of a common underlying latent space. When applied to a single similarity relation that is based on Euclidean distances between the input data points, the method reduces to simple dimensionality reduction. If additional information is available about the dataset or about subsets of it, we can use this information to clean up or otherwise improve the embedding. We demonstrate the potential usefulness of this form of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction on some simple examples. 1</p><p>3 0.59763068 <a title="88-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-On_the_Adaptive_Properties_of_Decision_Trees.html">137 nips-2004-On the Adaptive Properties of Decision Trees</a></p>

In this paper we examine a decision tree based on dyadic splits that adapts to each of these conditions to achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence. The proposed classiﬁer is the ﬁrst known to achieve these optimal rates while being practical and implementable. 1</p><p>4 0.58363718 <a title="88-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Probabilistic_Curve_Clustering_and_Alignment.html">90 nips-2004-Joint Probabilistic Curve Clustering and Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott J. Gaffney, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a ﬁxed-dimensional featurevector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.</p><p>5 0.58249485 <a title="88-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Alignment_of_Continuous_Time_Series.html">124 nips-2004-Multiple Alignment of Continuous Time Series</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Andrew Emili</p><p>Abstract: Multiple realizations of continuous-valued time series from a stochastic process often contain systematic variations in rate and amplitude. To leverage the information contained in such noisy replicate sets, we need to align them in an appropriate way (for example, to allow the data to be properly combined by adaptive averaging). We present the Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data. 1 A Proﬁle Model for Continuous Data When observing multiple time series generated by a noisy, stochastic process, large systematic sources of variability are often present. For example, within a set of nominally replicate time series, the time axes can be variously shifted, compressed and expanded, in complex, non-linear ways. Additionally, in some circumstances, the scale of the measured data can vary systematically from one replicate to the next, and even within a given replicate. We propose a Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) for simultaneously analyzing a set of such time series. In this model, each time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single latent trace. The latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series. Output time series are generated from this model by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as in an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a particular location in the latent trace, and the emitted value from the state depends on the value of the latent trace at that position. To account for changes in the amplitude of the signals across and within replicates, the latent time states are augmented by a set of scale states, which control how the emission signal will be scaled relative to the value of the latent trace. During training, the latent trace is learned, as well as the transition probabilities controlling the Markovian evolution of the scale and time states and the overall noise level of the observed data. After training, the latent trace learned by the model represents a higher resolution ’fusion’ of the experimental replicates. Figure 1 illustrate the model in action.

The 1 2 N temporal sampling rate within each xk need not be uniform, nor must it be the same across the different xk . Constraints on the variability of the sampling rate are discussed at the end of this section. For notational convenience, we henceforth assume N k = N for all k, but this is not a requirement of the model. The CPM is set up as follows: We assume that there is a latent trace, z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ), a canonical representation of the set of noisy input replicate time series. Any given observed time series in the set is modeled as a non-uniformly subsampled version of the latent trace to which local scale transformations have been applied. Ideally, M would be inﬁnite, or at least very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent trace is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made effectively to speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. The subsampling and local scaling used during the generation of each observed time series are determined by a sequence of hidden state variables. Let the state sequence for observation k be π k . Each state in the state sequence maps to a time state/scale state pair: k πi → {τik , φk }. Time states belong to the integer set (1..M ); scale states belong to an i ordered set (φ1 ..φQ ). (In our experiments we have used Q=7, evenly spaced scales in k logarithmic space). States, πi , and observation values, xk , are related by the emission i k probability distribution: Aπi (xk |z) ≡ p(xk |πi , z, σ, uk ) ≡ N (xk ; zτik φk uk , σ), where σ k i i i i is the noise level of the observed data, N (a; b, c) denotes a Gaussian probability density for a with mean b and standard deviation c. The uk are real-valued scale parameters, one per observed time series, that correct for any overall scale difference between time series k and the latent trace. To fully specify our model we also need to deﬁne the state transition probabilities. We deﬁne the transitions between time states and between scale states separately, so that k Tπi−1 ,πi ≡ p(πi |πi−1 ) = p(φi |φi−1 )pk (τi |τi−1 ). The constraint that time must move forward, cannot stand still, and that it can jump ahead no more than Jτ time states is enforced. (In our experiments we used Jτ = 3.) As well, we only allow scale state transitions between neighbouring scale states so that the local scale cannot jump arbitrarily. These constraints keep the number of legal transitions to a tractable computational size and work well in practice. Each observed time series has its own time transition probability distribution to account for experiment-speciﬁc patterns. Both the time and scale transition probability distributions are given by multinomials:  dk , if a − b = 1  1  k  d2 , if a − b = 2   k . p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = . .  k d , if a − b = J  τ  Jτ  0, otherwise p(φi = a|φi−1  s0 , if D(a, b) = 0   s1 , if D(a, b) = 1 = b) =  s1 , if D(a, b) = −1  0, otherwise where D(a, b) = 1 means that a is one scale state larger than b, and D(a, b) = −1 means that a is one scale state smaller than b, and D(a, b) = 0 means that a = b. The distributions Jτ are constrained by: i=1 dk = 1 and 2s1 + s0 = 1. i Jτ determines the maximum allowable instantaneous speedup of one portion of a time series relative to another portion, within the same series or across different series. However, the length of time for which any series can move so rapidly is constrained by the length of the latent trace; thus the maximum overall ratio in speeds achievable by the model between any two entire time series is given by min(Jτ , M ). N After training, one may examine either the latent trace or the alignment of each observable time series to the latent trace. Such alignments can be achieved by several methods, including use of the Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the highest likelihood path through the hidden states [1], or sampling from the posterior over hidden state sequences. We found Viterbi alignments to work well in the experiments below; samples from the posterior looked quite similar. 3 Training with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm As with HMMs, training with the EM algorithm (often referred to as Baum-Welch in the context of HMMs [1]), is a natural choice. In our model the E-Step is computed exactly using the Forward-Backward algorithm [1], which provides the posterior probability over k states for each time point of every observed time series, γs (i) ≡ p(πi = s|x) and also the pairwise state posteriors, ξs,t (i) ≡ p(πi−1 = s, πi = t|xk ). The algorithm is modiﬁed only in that the emission probabilities depend on the latent trace as described in Section 2. The M-Step consists of a series of analytical updates to the various parameters as detailed below. Given the latent trace (and the emission and state transition probabilities), the complete log likelihood of K observed time series, xk , is given by Lp ≡ L + P. L is the likelihood term arising in a (conditional) HMM model, and can be obtained from the Forward-Backward algorithm. It is composed of the emission and state transition terms. P is the log prior (or penalty term), regularizing various aspects of the model parameters as explained below. These two terms are: K N N L≡ log Aπi (xk |z) + i log p(π1 ) + τ −1 K (zj+1 − zj )2 + P ≡ −λ (1) i=2 i=1 k=1 k log Tπi−1 ,πi j=1 k log D(dk |{ηv }) + log D(sv |{ηv }), v (2) k=1 where p(π1 ) are priors over the initial states. The ﬁrst term in Equation 2 is a smoothing k penalty on the latent trace, with λ controlling the amount of smoothing. ηv and ηv are Dirichlet hyperprior parameters for the time and scale state transition probability distributions respectively. These ensure that all non-zero transition probabilities remain non-zero. k For the time state transitions, v ∈ {1, Jτ } and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for k the parameters d1 , d2 . . . dJτ . For the scale state transitions, v ∈ {0, 1} and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for the parameters s0 and s1 . Letting S be the total number of possible states, that is, the number of elements in the cross-product of possible time states and possible scale states, the expected complete log likelihood is: K S K p k k γs (1) log T0,s</p><p>6 0.5785594 <a title="88-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Hyper-Features_for_Visual_Identification.html">99 nips-2004-Learning Hyper-Features for Visual Identification</a></p>

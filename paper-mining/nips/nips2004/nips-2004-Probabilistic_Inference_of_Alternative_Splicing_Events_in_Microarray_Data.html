Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS.

An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

The AS model presented assumes a single weight matrix for all data cases. This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

<p>Author: Jongmin Kim, John Hopfield, Erik Winfree</p><p>Abstract: The structural similarity of neural networks and genetic regulatory networks to digital circuits, and hence to each other, was noted from the very beginning of their study [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components. 1</p><p>3 0.057049848 <a title="149-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Discrete_profile_alignment_via_constrained_information_bottleneck.html">52 nips-2004-Discrete profile alignment via constrained information bottleneck</a></p>
<p>Author: Sean O'rourke, Gal Chechik, Robin Friedman, Eleazar Eskin</p><p>Abstract: Amino acid proﬁles, which capture position-speciﬁc mutation probabilities, are a richer encoding of biological sequences than the individual sequences themselves. However, proﬁle comparisons are much more computationally expensive than discrete symbol comparisons, making proﬁles impractical for many large datasets. Furthermore, because they are such a rich representation, proﬁles can be diﬃcult to visualize. To overcome these problems, we propose a discretization for proﬁles using an expanded alphabet representing not just individual amino acids, but common proﬁles. By using an extension of information bottleneck (IB) incorporating constraints and priors on the class distributions, we ﬁnd an informationally optimal alphabet. This discretization yields a concise, informative textual representation for proﬁle sequences. Also alignments between these sequences, while nearly as accurate as the full proﬁleproﬁle alignments, can be computed almost as quickly as those between individual or consensus sequences. A full pairwise alignment of SwissProt would take years using proﬁles, but less than 3 days using a discrete IB encoding, illustrating how discrete encoding can expand the range of sequence problems to which proﬁle information can be applied. 1</p><p>4 0.052757047 <a title="149-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Identifying_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Sites_on_a_Genome-Wide_Scale.html">80 nips-2004-Identifying Protein-Protein Interaction Sites on a Genome-Wide Scale</a></p>
<p>Author: Haidong Wang, Eran Segal, Asa Ben-Hur, Daphne Koller, Douglas L. Brutlag</p><p>Abstract: Protein interactions typically arise from a physical interaction of one or more small sites on the surface of the two proteins. Identifying these sites is very important for drug and protein design. In this paper, we propose a computational method based on probabilistic relational model that attempts to address this task using high-throughput protein interaction data and a set of short sequence motifs. We learn the model using the EM algorithm, with a branch-and-bound algorithm as an approximate inference for the E-step. Our method searches for motifs whose presence in a pair of interacting proteins can explain their observed interaction. It also tries to determine which motif pairs have high afﬁnity, and can therefore lead to an interaction. We show that our method is more accurate than others at predicting new protein-protein interactions. More importantly, by examining solved structures of protein complexes, we ﬁnd that 2/3 of the predicted active motifs correspond to actual interaction sites. 1</p><p>5 0.047353674 <a title="149-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Supervised_Graph_Inference.html">177 nips-2004-Supervised Graph Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Ofer Shai, Brendan J. Frey, Quaid D. Morris, Qun Pan, Christine Misquitta, Benjamin J. Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS.

An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

The AS model presented assumes a single weight matrix for all data cases. This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

<p>Author: Jongmin Kim, John Hopfield, Erik Winfree</p><p>Abstract: The structural similarity of neural networks and genetic regulatory networks to digital circuits, and hence to each other, was noted from the very beginning of their study [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components. 1</p><p>3 0.48860931 <a title="149-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Markov_Networks_for_Detecting_Overalpping_Elements_in_Sequence_Data.html">108 nips-2004-Markov Networks for Detecting Overalpping Elements in Sequence Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Craven, Joseph Bockhorst</p><p>Abstract: Many sequential prediction tasks involve locating instances of patterns in sequences. Generative probabilistic language models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), have been successfully applied to many of these tasks. A limitation of these models however, is that they cannot naturally handle cases in which pattern instances overlap in arbitrary ways. We present an alternative approach, based on conditional Markov networks, that can naturally represent arbitrarily overlapping elements. We show how to eﬃciently train and perform inference with these models. Experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on HMMs. 1</p><p>4 0.46907094 <a title="149-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Identifying_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Sites_on_a_Genome-Wide_Scale.html">80 nips-2004-Identifying Protein-Protein Interaction Sites on a Genome-Wide Scale</a></p>
<p>Author: Haidong Wang, Eran Segal, Asa Ben-Hur, Daphne Koller, Douglas L. Brutlag</p><p>Abstract: Protein interactions typically arise from a physical interaction of one or more small sites on the surface of the two proteins. Identifying these sites is very important for drug and protein design. In this paper, we propose a computational method based on probabilistic relational model that attempts to address this task using high-throughput protein interaction data and a set of short sequence motifs. We learn the model using the EM algorithm, with a branch-and-bound algorithm as an approximate inference for the E-step. Our method searches for motifs whose presence in a pair of interacting proteins can explain their observed interaction. It also tries to determine which motif pairs have high afﬁnity, and can therefore lead to an interaction. We show that our method is more accurate than others at predicting new protein-protein interactions. More importantly, by examining solved structures of protein complexes, we ﬁnd that 2/3 of the predicted active motifs correspond to actual interaction sites. 1</p><p>5 0.46885803 <a title="149-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Making_Latin_Manuscripts_Searchable_using_gHMM%27s.html">107 nips-2004-Making Latin Manuscripts Searchable using gHMM's</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, Yee W. Teh, Roger Bock, Michael Maire, Grace Vesom, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method that can make a scanned, handwritten mediaeval latin manuscript accessible to full text search. A generalized HMM is ﬁtted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data. 1. Intoduction There are many large corpora of handwritten scanned documents, and their number is growing rapidly. Collections range from the complete works of Mark Twain to thousands of pages of zoological notes spanning two centuries. Large scale analyses of such corpora is currently very difﬁcult, because handwriting recognition works poorly. Recently, Rath and Manmatha have demonstrated that one can use small bodies of aligned material as supervised data to train a word spotting mechanism [7]. The result can make scanned handwritten documents searchable. Current techniques assume a closed vocabulary — one can search only for words in the training set — and search for instances of whole words. This approach is particularly unattractive for an inﬂected language, because individual words can take so many forms that one is unlikely to see all in the training set. Furthermore, one would like the method used to require very little aligned training data, so that it is possible to process documents written by different scribes with little overhead. Mediaeval Latin manuscripts are a natural ﬁrst corpus for studying this problem, because there are many scanned manuscripts and because the handwriting is relatively regular. We expect the primary user need to be search over a large body of documents — to allow comparisons between documents — rather than transcription of a particular document (which is usually relatively easy to do by hand). Desirable features for a system are: First, that it use little or no aligned training data (an ideal, which we believe may be attainable, is an unsupervised learning system). Second, that one can search the document for an arbitrary string (rather than, say, only complete words that appear in the training data). This would allow a user to determine whether a document contains curious or distinctive spellings, for example (ﬁgure 7). We show that, using a statistical model based on a generalized HMM, we can search a medieval manuscript with considerable accuracy, using only one instance each of each letter in the manuscript to train the method (22 instances in total; Latin has no j, k, w, or z). Furthermore, our method allows fairly accurate transcription of the manuscript. We train our system on 22 glyphs taken from a a 12th century latin manuscript of Terence’s Comedies (obtained from a repository of over 80 scanned medieval works maintained by Oxford University [1]). We evaluate searches using a considerable portion of this manuscript aligned by hand; we then show that fair search results are available on a different manuscript (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]) without change of letter templates. 1.1. Previous Work Handwriting recognition is a traditional problem, too well studied to review in detail here (see [6]). Typically, online handwriting recognition (where strokes can be recorded) works better than ofﬂine handwriting recognition. Handwritten digits can now be recognized with high accuracy [2, 5]. Handwritten amounts can be read with fair accuracy, which is signiﬁcantly improved if one segments the amount into digits at the same time as one recognizes it [4, 5]. Recently several authors have proposed new techniques for search and translation in this unrestricted setting. Manmatha et al [7] introduce the technique of “word spotting,” which segments text into word images, rectiﬁes the word images, and then uses an aligned training set to learn correspondences between rectiﬁed word images and strings. The method is not suitable for a heavily inﬂected language, because words take so many forms. In an inﬂected language, the natural unit to match to is a subset of a word, rather than a whole word, implying that one should segment the text into blocks — which may be smaller than words — while recognizing. Vinciarelli et al [8] introduce a method for line by line recognition based around an HMM and quite similar to techniques used in the speech recognition community. Their method uses a window that slides along the text to obtain features; this has the difﬁculty that the same window is in some places too small (and so uninformative) and in others too big (and so spans more than one letter, and is confusing). Their method requires a substantial body of aligned training data, which makes it impractical for our applications. Close in spirit to our work is the approach to machine translation of Koehn and Knight [3]. They demonstrate that the statistics of unaligned corpora may provide as powerful constraints for training models as aligned bitexts. 2. The Model Our models for both search and transcription are based on the generalized HMM and differ only in their choice of transition model. In an HMM, each hidden node ct emits a single evidence node xt . In a generalized HMM, we allow each ct to emit a series of x’s whose length is itself a random variable. In our model, the hidden nodes correspond to letters and each xt is a single column of pixels. Allowing letters to emit sets of columns lets us accomodate letter templates of variable width. In particular, this means that we can unify segmenting ink into letters and recognizing blocks of ink; ﬁgure 3 shows an example of how useful this is. 2.1. Generating a line of text Our hidden state consists of a character label c, width w and vertical position y. The statespace of c contains the characters ‘a’-‘z’, a space ‘ ’, and a special end state Ω. Let T c be the template associated with character c, Tch , Tcw be respectively the height and width of that template, and m be the height of the image.

Note: (a) the richness of page layout; (b) the clear spacing of the lines; (c) the relatively regular handwriting. Figure 2: Left, the 22 instances, one per letter, used to train our emission model.

Let i and j be indexed from the top left of that bounding box. – draw pixel (i, j) ∼ N (Tcij , σcij ) for each pixel in b – draw all pixels above and below b from background gaussian N (µ0 , σ0 ) (See 2.2 for greater detail on pixel emission model) • move to column w + 1 and repeat until we enter the end state Ω. Inference on a gHMM is a relatively straighforward business of dynamic programming. We have used unigram, bigram and trigram models, with each transition model ﬁtted using an electronic version of Caesar’s Gallic Wars, obtained from http://www.thelatinlibrary.com. We do not believe that the choice of author should signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁtted transition model — which is at the level of characters — but have not experimented with this point. The important matter is the emission model. 2.2. The Emission Model Our emission model is as follows: Given the character c and width w, we generate a template of the required length. Each pixel in this template becomes the mean of a gaussian which generates the corresponding pixel in the image. This template has a separate mean image for each pixel channel. The channels are assumed independent given the means. We train the model by cutting out by hand a single instance of each letter from our corpus (ﬁgure 2). This forms the central portion of the template. Pixels above and below this Model Perfect transcription unigram bigram trigram matching chars 21019 14603 15572 15788 substitutions 0 5487 4597 4410 insertions 0 534 541 507 deletions 0 773 718 695 Table 1: Edit distance between our transcribed Terence and the editor’s version. Note the trigram model produces signiﬁcantly fewer letter errors than the unigram model, but that the error rate is still a substantial 25%. central box are generated from a single gaussian used to model background pixels (basically white pixels). We add a third variable yt to our hidden state indicating the vertical position of the central box. However, since we are uninterested in actually recovering this variable, during inference we sum it out of the model. The width of a character is constrained to be close to the width (tw ) of our hand cut example by setting p(w|c) = 0 for w < tw − k and w > tw + k. Here k is a small, user deﬁned integer. Within this range, p(w|c) is distributed uniformly, larger templates are created by appending pixels from the background model to the template and smaller ones by simply removing the right k-most columns of the hand cut example. For features, we generate ﬁve image representations, shown in ﬁgure 2. The ﬁrst is a grayscale version of the original color image. The second and third are generated by convolving the grayscale image with a vertical derivative of gaussian ﬁlter, separating the positive and negative components of this response, and smoothing each of these gradient images separately. The fourth and ﬁfth are generated similarly but with a horizontal derivative of gaussian ﬁlter. We have experimented with different weightings of these 5 channels. In practice we use the gray scale channel and the horizontal gradient channels. We emphasize the horizontal pieces since these seem the more discriminative. 2.3. Transcription For transcription, we model letters as coming from an n-gram language model, with no dependencies between words. Thus, the probability of a letter depends on the k letters before it, where k = n unless this would cross a word boundary in which case the history terminates at this boundary. We chose not to model word to word transition probabilities since, unlike in English, word order in Latin is highly arbitrary. This transition model is ﬁt from a corpus of ascii encoded latin. We have experimented with unigram (i.e. uniform transition probabilities), bigram and trigram letter models. We can perform transcription by ﬁtting the maximum likelihood path through any given line. Some results of this technique are shown in ﬁgure 3. 2.4. Search For search, we rank lines by the probability that they contain our search word. We set up a ﬁnite state machine like that in ﬁgure 4. In this ﬁgure, ‘bg’ represents our background model for that portion of the line not generated by our search word. We can use any of the n-gram letter models described for transcription as the transition model for ‘bg’. The probability that the line contains the search word is the probability that this FSM takes path 1. We use this FSM as the transition model for our gHMM, and output the posterior probability of the two arrows leading into the end state. 1 and 2 are user deﬁned weights, but in practice the algorithm does not appear to be particular sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The results presented here use the unigram model.

Results Figure 1 shows a page from our collection. This is a scanned 12th century manuscript of Terence’s Comedies, obtained from the collection at [1]. In preprocessing, we extract individual lines of text by rotating the image to various degrees and projecting the sum of the pixel values onto the y-axis. We choose the orientation whose projection vector has the lowest entropy, and then segment lines by cutting at minima of this projection. Transcription is not our primary task, but methods that produce good transcriptions are going to support good searches. The gHMM can produce a surprisingly good transcription, given how little training data is used to train the emission model. We aligned an editors version of Terence with 25 pages from the manuscript by hand, and computed the edit distance between the transcribed text and the aligned text; as table 1 indicates, approximately 75% of letters are read correctly. Search results are strong. We show results for two documents. The ﬁrst set of results refers to the edition of Terence’s Comedies, from which we took the 22 letter instances. In particular, for any given search term, our process ranks the complete set of lines. We used a hand alignment of the manuscript to determine which lines contained each term; ﬁgure 5 shows an overview of searches performed using every word that appears in the 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Figure 5: Our search ranks 587 manuscript lines, with higher ranking lines more likely to contain the relevant term. This ﬁgure shows complete search results for each term that appears more than three times in the 587 lines. Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. All 587 lines are represented. More common terms are represented by lower rows. More detailed results appear in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6; this summary ﬁgure suggests almost all searches are highly successful. document more than three times, in particular, showing which of the ranked set of lines actually contained the search term. For almost every search, the term appears mainly in the lines with higher rank. Figure 6 contains more detailed information for a smaller set of words. We do not score the position of a word in a line (for practical reasons). Figure 7 demonstrates (a) that our search respects the ink of the document and (b) that for the Terence document, word positions are accurately estimated. The spelling of mediaeval documents is typically cleaned up by editors; in our manuscript, the scribe reliably spells “michi” for the standard “mihi”. A search on “michi” produces many instances; a search on “mihi” produces none, because the ink doesn’t have any. Notice this phenomenon also in the bottom right line of ﬁgure 7, the scribe writes “habet, ut consumat nunc cum nichil obsint doli” and the editor gives “habet, ut consumat nunc quom nil obsint doli.” Figure 8 shows that searches on short strings produce many words containing that string as one would wish. 4. Discussion We have shown that it is possible to make at least some handwritten mediaeval manuscripts accessible to full text search, without requiring an aligned text or much supervisory data. Our documents have very regular letters, and letter frequencies — which can be obtained from transcribed Latin — appear to provide so powerful a cue that relatively little detailed information about letter shapes is required. Linking letter segmentation and recognition has thoroughly beneﬁcial effects. This suggests that the pool of manuscripts that can be made accessible in this way is large. In particular, we have used our method, trained on 22 instances of letters from one document, to search another document. Figure 9 shows the results from two searches of our second document (MS. Auct. D. 2. 16, Latin Gospels with beast-headed evangelist portraits made at Landvennec, Brittany, late 9th or early 10th century, from [1]). No information from this document was used in training at all; but letter 1tu arbitror pater etiam nisi factum primum siet vero illi inter hic michi ibi qui tu ibi michi 0.9 0.8 0.7 qui hic 0.6 inter 0.5 illi 0.4 siet 0.3 vero 0.2 nisi 0.1 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 6: On the left, search results for selected words (indicated on the leftmost column). Each row represents the ranked search results for a term, and a black mark appears if the search term is actually in the line; a successful search will therefore appear as a row which is wholly dark to the left, and then wholly light. Note only the top 300 results are represented, and that lines containing the search term are almost always at or close to the top of the search results (black marks to the left). On the right, we plot precision against recall for a set of different words by taking the top 10, 20, ... lines returned from the search, and checking them against the aligned manuscript. Note that, once all cases have been found, if the size of the pool is increased the precision will fall with 100% recall; many words work well, with most of the ﬁrst 20 or so lines returned containing the search term. shapes are sufﬁciently well shared that the search is still useful. All this suggests that one might be able to use EM to link three processes: one that clusters to determine letter shapes; one that segments letters; and one that imposes a language model. Such a system might be able to make handwritten Latin searchable with no training data. References [1] Early Manuscripts at Oxford University.

<p>Author: Rob Powers, Yoav Shoham</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new set of criteria for learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, one that is more stringent and (we argue) better justiﬁed than previous proposed criteria. Our criteria, which apply most straightforwardly in repeated games with average rewards, consist of three requirements: (a) against a speciﬁed class of opponents (this class is a parameter of the criterion) the algorithm yield a payoff that approaches the payoff of the best response, (b) against other opponents the algorithm’s payoff at least approach (and possibly exceed) the security level payoff (or maximin value), and (c) subject to these requirements, the algorithm achieve a close to optimal payoff in self-play. We furthermore require that these average payoffs be achieved quickly. We then present a novel algorithm, and show that it meets these new criteria for a particular parameter class, the class of stationary opponents. Finally, we show that the algorithm is effective not only in theory, but also empirically. Using a recently introduced comprehensive game theoretic test suite, we show that the algorithm almost universally outperforms previous learning algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.67330515 <a title="149-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Optimal_Information_Decoding_from_Neuronal_Populations_with_Specific_Stimulus_Selectivity.html">140 nips-2004-Optimal Information Decoding from Neuronal Populations with Specific Stimulus Selectivity</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcelo A. Montemurro, Stefano Panzeri</p><p>Abstract: A typical neuron in visual cortex receives most inputs from other cortical neurons with a roughly similar stimulus preference. Does this arrangement of inputs allow efﬁcient readout of sensory information by the target cortical neuron? We address this issue by using simple modelling of neuronal population activity and information theoretic tools. We ﬁnd that efﬁcient synaptic information transmission requires that the tuning curve of the afferent neurons is approximately as wide as the spread of stimulus preferences of the afferent neurons reaching the target neuron. By meta analysis of neurophysiological data we found that this is the case for cortico-cortical inputs to neurons in visual cortex. We suggest that the organization of V1 cortico-cortical synaptic inputs allows optimal information transmission. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.66361594 <a title="149-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Alternative_Splicing_Events_in_Microarray_Data.html">149 nips-2004-Probabilistic Inference of Alternative Splicing Events in Microarray Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Shai, Brendan J. Frey, Quaid D. Morris, Qun Pan, Christine Misquitta, Benjamin J. Blencowe</p><p>Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues. 1 Biological diversity through alternative splicing Current estimates place the number of genes in the human genome at approximately 30,000, which is a surprisingly small number when one considers that the genome of yeast, a singlecelled organism, has 6,000 genes. The number of genes alone cannot account for the complexity and cell specialization exhibited by higher eukaryotes (i.e. mammals, plants, etc.). Some of that added complexity can be achieved through the use of alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can be used to code for a multitude of products. Genes are segments of the double stranded DNA that contain the information required by the cell for protein synthesis. That information is coded using an alphabet of 4 (A, C, G, and T), corresponding to the four nucleotides that make up the DNA. In what is known as the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA is transcribed to RNA, which in turn is translated into proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus of the cell and carries the genomic information to the ribosome. In eukaryotes, genes are generally comprised of both exons, which contain the information needed by the cell to synthesize proteins, and introns, sometimes referred to as spacer DNA, which are spliced out of the pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. An estimated 35%-75% of human genes [1] can be C1 (a) C1 A C1 C2 C1 A 3’ C2 (b) C2 C1 A 3’ C1 A 5’ C2 A 5’ C2 C1 C1 C2 C1 (c) A2 A1 C1 A1 C1 A2 C1 C2 C2 C1 (d) C2 C2 A C2 C2 C2 C1 C2 Figure 1: Four types of AS.

An intron may be included in the mature mRNA strand. spliced to yield different combinations of exons (called isoforms), a phenomenon referred to as alternative splicing (AS). There are four major types of AS as shown in Figure 1. Many multi-exon genes may undergo more than one alternative splicing event, resulting in many possible isoforms from a single gene. [2] In addition to adding to the genetic repertoire of an organism by enabling a single gene to code for more than one protein, AS has been shown to be critical for gene regulation, contributing to tissue speciﬁcity, and facilitating evolutionary processes. Despite the evident importance of AS, its regulation and impact on speciﬁc genes remains poorly understood. The work presented here is concerned with the inference of single cassette exon AS levels (Figure 1a) based on data obtained from RNA expression arrays, also known as microarrays. 1.1 An exon microarray data set that probes alternative splicing events Although it is possible to directly analyze the proteins synthesized by a cell, it is easier, and often more informative, to instead measure the abundance of mRNA present. Traditionally, gene expression (abundance of mRNA) has been studied using low throughput techniques (such as RT-PCR or Northern blots), limited to studying a few sequences at a time and making large scale analysis nearly impossible. In the early 1990s, microarray technology emerged as a method capable of measuring the expression of thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously. Sequences of interest are deposited on a substrate the size of a small microscope slide, to form probes. The mRNA is extracted from the cell and reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is labelled with red and green ﬂuorescent dye molecules (cy3 and cy5 respectively). When the sample of tagged DNA is washed over the slide, complementary strands of DNA from the sample hybridize to the probes on the array forming A-T and C-G pairings. The slide is then scanned and the ﬂuorescent intensity is measured at each probe. It is generally assumed that the intensity measure at the probe is linearly related to the abundance of mRNA in the cell over a wide dynamic range. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in microarray technologies in recent years, microarray data still presents some difﬁculties in analysis. Low measurements tend to have extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) [7] and probes often bind to sequences that are very similar, but not identical, to the one for which they were designed (a process referred to as cross- C1 A C1 A C1:A C1 C2 C2 3 Body probes A:C2 A C2 2 Inclusion junction probes C1:C2 C1 C2 1 Exclusion junction probe Figure 2: Each alternative splicing event is studied using six probes. Probes were chosen to measure the expression levels of each of the three exons involved in the event. Additionally, 3 probes are used that target the junctions that are formed by each of the two isoforms. The inclusion isoform would express the junctions formed by C1 and A, and A and C2 , while the exclusion isoform would express the junction formed by C1 and C2 hybridization). Additionally, probes exhibit somewhat varying hybridization efﬁciency, and sequences exhibit varying labelling efﬁciency. To design our data sets, we mined public sequence databases and identiﬁed exons that were strong candidates for exhibiting AS (the details of that analysis are provided elsewhere [4, 3]). Of the candidates, 3,126 potential AS events in 2,647 unique mouse genes were selected for the design of Agilent Custom Oligonucleotide microarray. The arrays were hybridized with unampliﬁed mRNA samples extracted from 10 wild-type mouse tissues (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis). Each AS event has six target probes on the arrays, chosen from regions of the C1 exon, C2 exon, A exon, C1 :A splice junction, A:C2 splice junction, and C1 :C2 splice junction, as shown in Figure 2. 2 Unsupervised discovery of alternative splicing With the exception of the probe measuring the alternative exon, A (Figure 2), all probes measure sequences that occur in both isoforms. For example, while the sequence of the probe measuring the junction A:C1 is designed to measure the inclusion isoform, half of it corresponds to a sequence that is found in the exclusion isoform. We can therefore safely assume that the measured intensity at each probe is a result of a certain amount of both isoforms binding to the probe. Due to the generally assumed linear relationship between the abundance of mRNA hybridized at a probe and the ﬂuorescent intensity measured, we model the measured intensity as a weighted sum of the overall abundance of the two isoforms. A stronger assumption is that of a single, consistent hybridization proﬁle for both isoforms across all probes and all slides. Ideally, one would prefer to estimate an individual hybridization proﬁle for each AS event studied across all slides. However, in our current setup, the number of tissues is small (10), resulting in two difﬁculties. First, the number of parameters is very large when compared to the number of data point using this model, and second, a portion of the events do not exhibit tissue speciﬁc alternative splicing within our small set of tissues. While the ﬁrst hurdle could be accounted for using Baysian parameter estimation, the second cannot. 2.1 GenASAP - a generative model for alternative splicing array platform Using the setup described above, the expression vector x, containing the six microarray measurements as real numbers, can be decomposed as a linear combination of the abundance of the two splice isoforms, represented by the real vector s, with some added noise: x = Λs + noise, where Λ is a 6 × 2 weight matrix containing the hybridization proﬁles for s1 ^ xC ^ xC 1 2 s2 ^ xC :A ^ xA ^ xA:C 2 ^ xC1:C2 2 xC1:C2 1 r xC xC 2 xA xC :A xA:C oC1 oC2 oA oC :A oA:C 1 1 1 2 oC :C 1 2 Σn 2 Figure 3: Graphical model for alternative splicing. Each measurement in the observed expression proﬁle, x, is generated by either using a scale factor, r, on a linear combination of the isoforms, s, or drawing randomly from an outlier model. For a detailed description of the model, see text. the two isoforms across the six probes. Note that we may not have a negative amount of a given isoform, nor can the presence of an isoform deduct from the measured expression, and so both s and Λ are constrained to be positive. Expression levels measured by microarrays have previously been modelled as having expression-dependent noise [7]. To address this, we rewrite the above formulation as x = r(Λs + ε), (1) where r is a scale factor and ε is a zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a diagonal covariance matrix, Ψ, denoted as p(ε) = N (ε; 0, Ψ). The prior distribution for the abundance of the splice isoforms is given by a truncated normal distribution, denoted as p(s) ∝ N (s, 0, I)[s ≥ 0], where [·] is an indicator function such that [s ≥ 0] = 1 if ∀i, si ≥ 0, and [s ≥ 0] = 0 otherwise. Lastly, there is a need to account for aberrant observations (e.g. due to faulty probes, ﬂakes of dust, etc.) with an outlier model. The complete GenASAP model (shown in Figure 3) accounts for the observations as the outcome of either applying equation (1) or an outlier model. To avoid degenerate cases and ensure meaningful and interpretable results, the number of faulty probes considered for each AS event may not exceed two, as indicated by the ﬁlled-in square constraint node in Figure 3. The distribution of x conditional on the latent variables, s, r, and o, is: N (xi ; rΛi s, r2 Ψi )[oi =0] N (xi ; Ei , Vi )[oi =1] , p(x|s, r, o) = (2) i where oi ∈ {0, 1} is a bernoulli random variable indicating if the measurement at probe xi is the result of the AS model or the outlier model parameterized by p(oi = 1) = γi . The parameters of the outlier model, E and V, are not optimized and are set to the mean and variance of the data. 2.2 Variational learning in the GenASAP model To infer the posterior distribution over the splice isoform abundances while at the same time learning the model parameters we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). EM maximizes the log likelihood of the data by iteratively estimating the posterior distribution of the model given the data in the expectation (E) step, and maximizing the log likelihood with respect to the parameters, while keeping the posterior ﬁxed, in the maximization (M) step. Variational EM is used when, as in the case of GenASAP, the exact posterior is intractable. Variational EM minimizes the free energy of the model, deﬁned as the KL-divergence between the joint distribution of the latent and observed variables and the approximation to the posterior under the model parameters [5, 6]. We approximate the true posterior using the Q distribution given by T Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) = (t) Q(r(t) )Q(o(t) |r(t) ) t=1 (t) Q(si |oi , r(t) ) i −1 T =Z (t) (3) d d ρ(t) ω (t) N (s(t) ; µ(t) , Σ(t) )[s(t) ≥ 0], ro ro t=1 where Z is a normalization constant, the superscript d indicates that Σ is constrained to be diagonal, and there are T iid AS events. For computational efﬁciency, r is selected from a ﬁnite set, r ∈ {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC } with uniform probability. The variational free energy is given by Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) . P ({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }, {x(t) }) s r o (4) Variational EM minimizes the free energy by iteratively updating the Q distribution’s vari(t)d (t)d ational parameters (ρ(t) , ω (t) , µro , and Σro ) in the E-step, and the model parameters (Λ, Ψ, {r1 , r2 , . . . , rC }, and γ) in the M-step. The resulting updates are too long to be shown in the context of this paper and are discussed in detail elsewhere [3]. A few particular points regarding the E-step are worth covering in detail here. Q({s(t) }, {o(t) }, {r(t) }) log F(Q, P ) = If the prior on s was a full normal distribution, there would be no need for a variational approach, and exact EM is possible. For a truncated normal distribution, however, the mixing proportions, Q(r)Q(o|r) cannot be calculated analytically except for the case where s is scalar, necessitating the diagonality constraint. Note that if Σ was allowed to be a full covariance matrix, equation (3) would be the true posterior, and we could ﬁnd the sufﬁcient statistics of Q(s(t) |o(t) , r(t) ): −1 µ(t) = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ)−1 ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 x(t) r(t) ro −1 Σ(t) ro = (I + ΛT (I − O(t) )T Ψ−1 (I − O(t) )Λ) (5) (6) where O is a diagonal matrix with elements Oi,i = oi . Furthermore, it can be easily shown that the optimal settings for µd and Σd approximating a normal distribution with full covariance Σ and mean µ is µd optimal = µ −1 Σd optimal = diag(Σ (7) −1 ) (8) In the truncated case, equation (8) is still true. Equation (7) does not hold, though, and µd optimal cannot be found analytically. In our experiments, we found that using equation (7) still decreases the free energy every E-step, and it is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than using, for example, a gradient decent method to compute the optimal µd .

(c) Two probes are marked as outliers, and the model is still successful in predicting the AS levels. 3 Making biological predictions about alternative splicing The results presented in this paper were obtained using two stages of learning. In the ﬁrst step, the weight matrix, Λ, is learned on a subset of the data that is selected for quality. Two selection criteria were used: (a) sequencing data was used to select those cases for which, with high conﬁdence, no other AS event is present (Figure 1) and (b) probe sets were selected for high expression, as determined by a set of negative controls. The second selection criterion is motivated by the common assumption that low intensity measurements are of lesser quality (see Section 1.1). In the second step, Λ is kept ﬁxed, and we introduce the additional constraint that the noise is isotropic (Ψ = ψI) and learn on the entire data set. The constraint on the noise is introduced to prevent the model from using only a subset of the six probes for making the ﬁnal set of predictions. We show a typical learned set of weights in Figure 4. The weights ﬁt well with our intuition of what they should be to capture the presence of the two isoforms. Moreover, the learned weights account for the speciﬁc trends in the data. Examples of model prediction based on the microarray data are shown in Figure 5. Due to the nature of the microarray data, we do not expect all the inferred abundances to be equally good, and we devised a scoring criterion that ranks each AS event based on its ﬁt to the model. Intuitively, given two input vectors that are equivalent up to a scale factor, with inferred MAP estimations that are equal up to the same scale factor, we would like their scores to be identical. The scoring criterion used, therefore is k (xk − rΛk s)2 /(xk + Rank 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 15000 20000 30000 Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.75 0.65 False positive rate 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.2 0.25 0.29 0.32 0.42 Table 1: Model performance evaluated at various ranks. Using 180 RT-PCR measurements, we are able to predict the model’s performance at various ranks. Two evaluation criteria are used: Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the model’s predictions and the RT-PCR measurements and false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. rΛk s)2 , where the MAP estimations for r and s are used. This scoring criterion can be viewed as proportional to the sum of noise to signal ratios, as estimated using the two values given by the observation and the model’s best prediction of that observation. Since it is the relative amount of the isoforms that is of most interest, we need to use the inferred distribution of the isoform abundances to obtain an estimate for the relative levels of AS. It is not immediately clear how this should be done. We do, however, have RTPCR measurements for 180 AS events to guide us (see ﬁgure 6 for details). Using the top 50 ranked RT-PCR measurement, we ﬁt three parameters, {a1 , a2 , a3 }, such that the s2 proportion of excluded isoform present, p, is given by p = a1 s1 +a2 s2 + a3 , where s1 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the inclusion isoform, s2 is the MAP estimation of the abundance of the exclusion isoform, and the RT-PCR measurement are used for target p. The parameters are ﬁtted using gradient descent on a least squared error (LSE) evaluation criterion. We used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the AS model predictions. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is used to evaluate the overall ability of the model to correctly estimate trends in the data. PCC is invariant to afﬁne transformation and so is independent of the transformation parameters a1 and a3 discussed above, while the parameter a2 was found to effect PCC very little. The PCC stays above 0.75 for the top two thirds ranked predictions. The second evaluation criterion used is the false positive rate, where a prediction is considered to be false positive if it is more than 15% away from the RT-PCR measurement. This allows us to say, for example, that if a prediction is within the top 10000, we are 75% conﬁdent that it is within 15% of the actual levels of AS. 4 Summary We designed a novel AS model for the inference of the relative abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms from six measurements. Unsupervised learning in the model is performed using a structured variational EM algorithm, which correctly captures the underlying structure of the data, as suggested by its biological nature. The AS model, though presented here for a cassette exon AS events, can be used to learn any type of AS, and with a simple adjustment, multiple types. The predictions obtained from the AS model are currently being used to verify various claims about the role of AS in evolution and functional genomics, and to help identify sequences that affect the regulation of AS. % Exclusion isoform RT−PCR measurement Vs.

The AS model presented assumes a single weight matrix for all data cases. This is an oversimpliﬁed view of the data, and current work is being carried out in identifying probe speciﬁc expression proﬁles. However, due to the low dimensionality of the problem (10 tissues, six probes per event), care must be taken to avoid overﬁtting and to ensure meaningful interpretations.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>5 0.43630463 <a title="149-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Computation_in_Spiking_Populations.html">148 nips-2004-Probabilistic Computation in Spiking Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Rama Natarajan, Peter Dayan, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: As animals interact with their environments, they must constantly update estimates about their states. Bayesian models combine prior probabilities, a dynamical model and sensory evidence to update estimates optimally. These models are consistent with the results of many diverse psychophysical studies. However, little is known about the neural representation and manipulation of such Bayesian information, particularly in populations of spiking neurons. We consider this issue, suggesting a model based on standard neural architecture and activations. We illustrate the approach on a simple random walk example, and apply it to a sensorimotor integration task that provides a particularly compelling example of dynamic probabilistic computation. Bayesian models have been used to explain a gamut of experimental results in tasks which require estimates to be derived from multiple sensory cues. These include a wide range of psychophysical studies of perception;13 motor action;7 and decision-making.3, 5 Central to Bayesian inference is that computations are sensitive to uncertainties about afferent and efferent quantities, arising from ignorance, noise, or inherent ambiguity (e.g., the aperture problem), and that these uncertainties change over time as information accumulates and dissipates. Understanding how neurons represent and manipulate uncertain quantities is therefore key to understanding the neural instantiation of these Bayesian inferences. Most previous work on representing probabilistic inference in neural populations has focused on the representation of static information.1, 12, 15 These encompass various strategies for encoding and decoding uncertain quantities, but do not readily generalize to real-world dynamic information processing tasks, particularly the most interesting cases with stimuli changing over the same timescale as spiking itself.11 Notable exceptions are the recent, seminal, but, as we argue, representationally restricted, models proposed by Gold and Shadlen,5 Rao,10 and Deneve.4 In this paper, we ﬁrst show how probabilistic information varying over time can be represented in a spiking population code. Second, we present a method for producing spiking codes that facilitate further processing of the probabilistic information. Finally, we show the utility of this method by applying it to a temporal sensorimotor integration task. 1 TRAJECTORY ENCODING AND DECODING We assume that population spikes R(t) arise stochastically in relation to the trajectory X(t) of an underlying (but hidden) variable. We use RT and XT for the whole trajectory and spike trains respectively from time 0 to T . The spikes RT constitute the observations and are assumed to be probabilistically related to the signal by a tuning function f (X, θ i ): P (R(i, T )|X(T )) ∝ f (X, θi ) (1) for the spike train of the ith neuron, with parameters θi . Therefore, via standard Bayesian inference, RT determines a distribution over the hidden variable at time T , P (X(T )|RT ). We ﬁrst consider a version of the dynamics and input coding that permits an analytical examination of the impact of spikes. Let X(t) follow a stationary Gaussian process such that the joint distribution P (X(t1 ), X(t2 ), . . . , X(tm )) is Gaussian for any ﬁnite collection of times, with a covariance matrix which depends on time differences: Ctt = c(|t − t |). Function c(|∆t|) controls the smoothness of the resulting random walks. Then, P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) X(T ) dX(T )P (RT |X(T ))P (X(T )|X(T )) (2) where P (X(T )|X(T )) is the distribution over the whole trajectory X(T ) conditional on the value of X(T ) at its end point. If RT are a set of conditionally independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we have P (RT |X(T )) ∝ iτ f (X(tiτ ), θi ) exp − i τ dτ f (X(τ ), θi ) , (3) where tiτ ∀τ are the spike times τ of neuron i in RT . Let χ = [X(tiτ )] be the vector of stimulus positions at the times at which we observed a spike and Θ = [θ(tiτ )] be the vector of spike positions. If the tuning functions are Gaussian f (X, θi ) ∝ exp(−(X − θi )2 /2σ 2 ) and sufﬁciently dense that i τ dτ f (X, θi ) is independent of X (a standard assumption in population coding), then P (RT |X(T )) ∝ exp(− χ − Θ 2 /2σ 2 ) and in Equation 2, we can marginalize out X(T ) except at the spike times tiτ : P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) −1 χ dχ exp −[χ, X(T )]T C 2 [χ, X(T )] − χ−Θ 2σ 2 2 (4) and C is the block covariance matrix between X(tiτ ), x(T ) at the spike times [ttτ ] and the ﬁnal time T . This Gaussian integral has P (X(T )|RT ) ∼ N (µ(T ), ν(T )), with µ(T ) = CT t (Ctt + Iσ 2 )−1 Θ = kΘ ν(T ) = CT T − kCtT (5) CT T is the T, T th element of the covariance matrix and CT t is similarly a row vector. The dependence in µ on past spike times is speciﬁed chieﬂy by the inverse covariance matrix, and acts as an effective kernel (k). This kernel is not stationary, since it depends on factors such as the local density of spiking in the spike train RT . For example, consider where X(t) evolves according to a diffusion process with drift: dX = −αXdt + σ dN (t) (6) where α prevents it from wandering too far, N (t) is white Gaussian noise with mean zero and σ 2 variance. Figure 1A shows sample kernels for this process. Inspection of Figure 1A reveals some important traits. First, the monotonically decreasing kernel magnitude as the time span between the spike and the current time T grows matches the intuition that recent spikes play a more signiﬁcant role in determining the posterior over X(T ). Second, the kernel is nearly exponential, with a time constant that depends on the time constant of the covariance function and the density of the spikes; two settings of these parameters produced the two groupings of kernels in the ﬁgure. Finally, the fully adaptive kernel k can be locally well approximated by a metronomic kernel k  (shown in red in Figure 1A) that assumes regular spiking. This takes advantage of the general fact, indicated by the grouping of kernels, that the kernel depends weakly on the actual spike pattern, but strongly on the average rate. The merits of the metronomic kernel are that it is stationary and only depends on a single mean rate rather than the full spike train RT .

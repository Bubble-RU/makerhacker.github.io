<p>Author: Peng Xu, Frederick Jelinek</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of Random Forests (RFs) in the structured language model (SLM), which uses rich syntactic information in predicting the next word based on words already seen. The goal in this work is to construct RFs by randomly growing Decision Trees (DTs) using syntactic information and investigate the performance of the SLM modeled by the RFs in automatic speech recognition. RFs, which were originally developed as classiﬁers, are a combination of decision tree classiﬁers. Each tree is grown based on random training data sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest, and a random selection of possible questions at each node of the decision tree. Our approach extends the original idea of RFs to deal with the data sparseness problem encountered in language modeling. RFs have been studied in the context of n-gram language modeling and have been shown to generalize well to unseen data. We show in this paper that RFs using syntactic information can also achieve better performance in both perplexity (PPL) and word error rate (WER) in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, compared to a baseline that uses Kneser-Ney smoothing. 1</p><p>3 0.14921182 <a title="36-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Nearly_Tight_Bounds_for_the_Continuum-Armed_Bandit_Problem.html">126 nips-2004-Nearly Tight Bounds for the Continuum-Armed Bandit Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert D. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: In the multi-armed bandit problem, an online algorithm must choose from a set of strategies in a sequence of n trials so as to minimize the total cost of the chosen strategies. While nearly tight upper and lower bounds are known in the case when the strategy set is ﬁnite, much less is known when there is an inﬁnite strategy set. Here we consider the case when the set of strategies is a subset of Rd , and the cost functions are continuous. In the d = 1 case, we improve on the best-known upper and lower bounds, closing the gap to a sublogarithmic factor. We also consider the case where d > 1 and the cost functions are convex, adapting a recent online convex optimization algorithm of Zinkevich to the sparser feedback model of the multi-armed bandit problem. 1</p><p>4 0.13890512 <a title="36-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Preferences_for_Multiclass_Problems.html">100 nips-2004-Learning Preferences for Multiclass Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting multiclass problems can be cast in the general framework of label ranking deﬁned on a given set of classes. The evaluation for such a ranking is generally given in terms of the number of violated order constraints between classes. In this paper, we propose the Preference Learning Model as a unifying framework to model and solve a large class of multiclass problems in a large margin perspective. In addition, an original kernel-based method is proposed and evaluated on a ranking dataset with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>5 0.1278134 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Efficient_Out-of-Sample_Extension_of_Dominant-Set_Clusters.html">61 nips-2004-Efficient Out-of-Sample Extension of Dominant-Set Clusters</a></p>
<p>Author: Massimiliano Pavan, Marcello Pelillo</p><p>Abstract: Dominant sets are a new graph-theoretic concept that has proven to be relevant in pairwise data clustering problems, such as image segmentation. They generalize the notion of a maximal clique to edgeweighted graphs and have intriguing, non-trivial connections to continuous quadratic optimization and spectral-based grouping. We address the problem of grouping out-of-sample examples after the clustering process has taken place. This may serve either to drastically reduce the computational burden associated to the processing of very large data sets, or to efﬁciently deal with dynamic situations whereby data sets need to be updated continually. We show that the very notion of a dominant set offers a simple and efﬁcient way of doing this. Numerical experiments on various grouping problems show the effectiveness of the approach. 1</p><p>6 0.092680275 <a title="36-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Unsupervised_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Nonlinear_Models.html">198 nips-2004-Unsupervised Variational Bayesian Learning of Nonlinear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Dori Peleg, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: A novel linear feature selection algorithm is presented based on the global minimization of a data-dependent generalization error bound. Feature selection and scaling algorithms often lead to non-convex optimization problems, which in many previous approaches were addressed through gradient descent procedures that can only guarantee convergence to a local minimum. We propose an alternative approach, whereby the global solution of the non-convex optimization problem is derived via an equivalent optimization problem. Moreover, the convex optimization task is reduced to a conic quadratic programming problem for which efﬁcient solvers are available. Highly competitive numerical results on both artiﬁcial and real-world data sets are reported. 1</p><p>3 0.60852391 <a title="36-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Maximum-Margin_Matrix_Factorization.html">113 nips-2004-Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization</a></p>

To that extent we propose a regularization framework for functions deﬁned over nodes of a directed graph that forces the classiﬁcation function to change slowly on densely linked subgraphs. A powerful, yet computationally simple classiﬁcation algorithm is derived within the proposed framework. The experimental evaluation on real-world Web classiﬁcation problems demonstrates encouraging results that validate our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.60608119 <a title="36-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Gaussian_Process_Kernels_via_Hierarchical_Bayes.html">98 nips-2004-Learning Gaussian Process Kernels via Hierarchical Bayes</a></p>

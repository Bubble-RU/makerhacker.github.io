<p>Author: Nuttapong Chentanez, Andrew G. Barto, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists call behavior intrinsically motivated when it is engaged in for its own sake rather than as a step toward solving a speciﬁc problem of clear practical value. But what we learn during intrinsically motivated behavior is essential for our development as competent autonomous entities able to efﬁciently solve a wide range of practical problems as they arise. In this paper we present initial results from a computational study of intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning aimed at allowing artiﬁcial agents to construct and extend hierarchies of reusable skills that are needed for competent autonomy. 1</p><p>3 0.14564031 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Experts_in_a_Markov_Decision_Process.html">64 nips-2004-Experts in a Markov Decision Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Sham M. Kakade, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider an MDP setting in which the reward function is allowed to change during each time step of play (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain ﬁxed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well can an agent do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efﬁcient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard. 1</p><p>4 0.13776006 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Brain_Inspired_Reinforcement_Learning.html">33 nips-2004-Brain Inspired Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Giorgio Gia\-cin\-to, Fabio Roli</p><p>Abstract: High retrieval precision in content-based image retrieval can be attained by adopting relevance feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms require that the user judges the quality of the results of the query by marking all the retrieved images as being either relevant or not. Then, the search engine exploits this information to adapt the search to better meet user’s needs. At present, the vast majority of proposed relevance feedback mechanisms are formulated in terms of search model that has to be optimized. Such an optimization involves the modification of some search parameters so that the nearest neighbor of the query vector contains the largest number of relevant images. In this paper, a different approach to relevance feedback is proposed. After the user provides the first feedback, following retrievals are not based on knn search, but on the computation of a relevance score for each image of the database. This score is computed as a function of two distances, namely the distance from the nearest non-relevant image and the distance from the nearest relevant one. Images are then ranked according to this score and the top k images are displayed. Reported results on three image data sets show that the proposed mechanism outperforms other state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms. 1 In t rod u ct i on A large number of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems rely on the vector representation of images in a multidimensional feature space representing low-level image characteristics, e.g., color, texture, shape, etc. [1]. Content-based queries are often expressed by visual examples in order to retrieve from the database the images that are “similar” to the examples. This kind of retrieval is often referred to as K nearest-neighbor retrieval. It is easy to see that the effectiveness of content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) strongly depends on the choice of the set of visual features, on the choice of the “metric” used to model the user’s perception of image similarity, and on the choice of the image used to query the database [1]. Typically, if we allow different users to mark the images retrieved with a given query as relevant or non-relevant, different subsets of images will be marked as relevant. Accordingly, the need for mechanisms to adapt the CBIR system response based on some feedback from the user is widely recognized. It is interesting to note that while relevance feedback mechanisms have been first introduced in the information retrieval field [2], they are receiving more attention in the CBIR field (Huang). The vast majority of relevance feedback techniques proposed in the literature is based on modifying the values of the search parameters as to better represent the concept the user bears in mind. To this end, search parameters are computed as a function of the relevance values assigned by the user to all the images retrieved so far. As an example, relevance feedback is often formulated in terms of the modification of the query vector, and/or in terms of adaptive similarity metrics. [3]-[7]. Recently, pattern classification paradigms such as SVMs have been proposed [8]. Feedback is thus used to model the concept of relevant images and adjust the search consequently. Concept modeling may be difficult on account of the distribution of relevant images in the selected feature space. “Narrow domain” image databases allows extracting good features, so that images bearing similar concepts belong to compact clusters. On the other hand, “broad domain” databases, such as image collection used by graphic professionals, or those made up of images from the Internet, are more difficult to subdivide in cluster because of the high variability of concepts [1]. In these cases, it is worth extracting only low level, non-specialized features, and image retrieval is better formulated in terms of a search problem rather then concept modeling. The present paper aims at offering an original contribution in this direction. Rather then modeling the concept of “relevance” the user bears in mind, feedback is used to assign each image of the database a relevance score. Such a score depends only from two dissimilarities (distances) computed against the images already marked by the user: the dissimilarity from the set of relevant images, and the dissimilarity from the set of non-relevant images. Despite its computational simplicity, this mechanism allows outperforming state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms both on “narrow domain” databases, and on “broad domain” databases. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the idea behind the proposed mechanism and provides the basic assumptions. Section 3 details the proposed relevance feedback mechanism. Results on three image data sets are presented in Section 4, where performances of other relevance feedback mechanisms are compared. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 In st an ce- b ased rel evan ce est i m at i on The proposed mechanism has been inspired by classification techniques based on the “nearest case” [9]-[10]. Nearest-case theory provided the mechanism to compute the dissimilarity of each image from the sets of relevant and non–relevant images. The ratio between the nearest relevant image and the nearest non-relevant image has been used to compute the degree of relevance of each image of the database [11]. The present section illustrates the rationale behind the use of the nearest-case paradigm. Let us assume that each image of the database has been represented by a number of low-level features, and that a (dis)similarity measure has been defined so that the proximity between pairs of images represents some kind of “conceptual” similarity. In other words, the chosen feature space and similarity metric is meaningful at least for a restricted number of users. A search in image databases is usually performed by retrieving the k most similar images with respect to a given query. The dimension of k is usually small, to avoid displaying a large number of images at a time. Typical values for k are between 10 and 20. However, as the “relevant” images that the user wishes to retrieve may not fit perfectly with the similarity metric designed for the search engine, the user may be interested in exploring other regions of the feature space. To this end, the user marks the subset of “relevant” images out of the k retrieved. Usually, such relevance feedback is used to perform a new k-nn search by modifying some search parameters, i.e., the position of the query point, the similarity metric, and other tuning parameters [1]-[7]. Recent works proposed the use of support vector machine to learn the distribution of relevant images [8]. These techniques require some assumption about the general form of the distribution of relevant images in the feature space. As it is difficult to make any assumption about such a distribution for broad domain databases, we propose to exploit the information about the relevance of the images retrieved so far in a nearest-neighbor fashion. Nearest-neighbor techniques, as used in statistical pattern recognition, case-based reasoning, or instance-based learning, are effective in all applications where it is difficult to produce a high-level generalization of a “class” of objects [9]-[10],[12][13]. Relevance learning in content base image retrieval may well fit into this definition, as it is difficult to provide a general model that can be adapted to represent different concepts of similarity. In addition, the number of available cases may be too small to estimate the optimal set of parameters for such a general model. On the other hand, it can be more effective to use each “relevant” image as well as each “non-relevant” image, as “cases” or “instances” against which the images of the database should be compared. Consequently, we assume that an image is as much as relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest relevant image is small. Analogously, an image is as much as non-relevant as much as its dissimilarity from the nearest non-relevant image is small. 3 Rel evan ce S core Com p u t ati on According to previous section, each image of the database can be thus characterized by a “degree of relevance” and a “degree of non-relevance” according to the dissimilarities from the nearest relevant image, and from the nearest non-relevant image, respectively. However, it should be noted that these degrees should be treated differently because only “relevant” images represent a “concept” in the user’s mind, while “non-relevant” images may represent a number of other concepts different from user’s interest. In other words, while it is meaningful to treat the degree of relevance as a degree of membership to the class of relevant images, the same does not apply to the degree of non-relevance. For this reason, we propose to use the “degree of non-relevance” to weight the “degree of relevance”. Let us denote with R the subset of indexes j ∈ {1,...,k} related to the set of relevant images retrieved so far and the original query (that is relevant by default), and with NR the subset of indexes j ∈ (1,...,k} related to the set of non-relevant images retrieved so far. For each image I of the database, according to the nearest neighbor rule, let us compute the dissimilarity from the nearest image in R and the dissimilarity from the nearest image in NR. Let us denote these dissimilarities as dR(I) and dNR(I), respectively. The value of dR(I) can be clearly used to measure the degree of relevance of image I, assuming that small values of dR(I) are related to very relevant images. On the other hand, the hypothesis that image I is relevant to the user’s query can be supported by a high value of dNR(I). Accordingly, we defined the relevance score ! dR ( I ) $ relevance ( I ) = # 1 + dN ( I ) &</p><p>6 0.1330467 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Temporal_Kernel-Based_Model_for_Tracking_Hand_Movements_from_Neural_Activities.html">12 nips-2004-A Temporal Kernel-Based Model for Tracking Hand Movements from Neural Activities</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Shani, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Agents learning to act in a partially observable domain may need to overcome the problem of perceptual aliasing Ă˘&euro;&ldquo; i.e., different states that appear similar but require different responses. This problem is exacerbated when the agentĂ˘&euro;&trade;s sensors are noisy, i.e., sensors may produce different observations in the same state. We show that many well-known reinforcement learning methods designed to deal with perceptual aliasing, such as Utile SufÄ?Ĺš x Memory, Ä?Ĺš nite size history windows, eligibility traces, and memory bits, do not handle noisy sensors well. We suggest a new algorithm, Noisy Utile SufÄ?Ĺš x Memory (NUSM), based on USM, that uses a weighted classiÄ?Ĺš cation of observed trajectories. We compare NUSM to the above methods and show it to be more robust to noise.</p><p>3 0.5599432 <a title="155-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Brain_Inspired_Reinforcement_Learning.html">33 nips-2004-Brain Inspired Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Koby Crammer, Rony Paz, Eilon Vaadia, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We devise and experiment with a dynamical kernel-based system for tracking hand movements from neural activity. The state of the system corresponds to the hand location, velocity, and acceleration, while the system’s input are the instantaneous spike rates. The system’s state dynamics is deﬁned as a combination of a linear mapping from the previous estimated state and a kernel-based mapping tailored for modeling neural activities. In contrast to generative models, the activity-to-state mapping is learned using discriminative methods by minimizing a noise-robust loss function. We use this approach to predict hand trajectories on the basis of neural activity in motor cortex of behaving monkeys and ﬁnd that the proposed approach is more accurate than both a static approach based on support vector regression and the Kalman ﬁlter. 1</p><p>5 0.50680351 <a title="155-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Similarity_and_Discrimination_in_Classical_Conditioning%3A_A_Latent_Variable_Account.html">170 nips-2004-Similarity and Discrimination in Classical Conditioning: A Latent Variable Account</a></p>

Conﬁgural learning experiments probe how animals discriminate and generalize between patterns of simultaneously presented stimuli (such as tones and lights) that are differentially predictive of reinforcement. Previous models of these issues have been successful more on a phenomenological than an explanatory level: they reproduce experimental ﬁndings but, lacking formal foundations, provide scant basis for understanding why animals behave as they do. We present a theory that clariﬁes seemingly arbitrary aspects of previous models while also capturing a broader set of data. Key patterns of data, e.g. concerning animals’ readiness to distinguish patterns with varying degrees of overlap, are shown to follow from statistical inference.</p><p>6 0.50356781 <a title="155-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Theories_of_Access_Consciousness.html">193 nips-2004-Theories of Access Consciousness</a></p>

<p>Author: Fredrik Bissmarck, Hiroyuki Nakahara, Kenji Doya, Okihide Hikosaka</p><p>Abstract: Motor control depends on sensory feedback in multiple modalities with different latencies. In this paper we consider within the framework of reinforcement learning how different sensory modalities can be combined and selected for real-time, optimal movement control. We propose an actor-critic architecture with multiple modules, whose output are combined using a softmax function. We tested our architecture in a simulation of a sequential reaching task. Reaching was initially guided by visual feedback with a long latency. Our learning scheme allowed the agent to utilize the somatosensory feedback with shorter latency when the hand is near the experienced trajectory. In simulations with different latencies for visual and somatosensory feedback, we found that the agent depended more on feedback with shorter latency. 1</p><p>2 0.60238844 <a title="155-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Dimension.html">114 nips-2004-Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension</a></p>
<p>Author: Elizaveta Levina, Peter J. Bickel</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating intrinsic dimension of a dataset derived by applying the principle of maximum likelihood to the distances between close neighbors. We derive the estimator by a Poisson process approximation, assess its bias and variance theoretically and by simulations, and apply it to a number of simulated and real datasets. We also show it has the best overall performance compared with two other intrinsic dimension estimators. 1</p><p>3 0.55917674 <a title="155-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Nonparametric_Transforms_of_Graph_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">133 nips-2004-Nonparametric Transforms of Graph Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojin Zhu, Jaz Kandola, Zoubin Ghahramani, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm based on convex optimization for constructing kernels for semi-supervised learning. The kernel matrices are derived from the spectral decomposition of graph Laplacians, and combine labeled and unlabeled data in a systematic fashion. Unlike previous work using diffusion kernels and Gaussian random ﬁeld kernels, a nonparametric kernel approach is presented that incorporates order constraints during optimization. This results in ﬂexible kernels and avoids the need to choose among different parametric forms. Our approach relies on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and is computationally feasible for large datasets. We evaluate the kernels on real datasets using support vector machines, with encouraging results. 1</p><p>4 0.54481125 <a title="155-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Inference%2C_Attention%2C_and_Decision_in_a_Bayesian_Neural_Architecture.html">84 nips-2004-Inference, Attention, and Decision in a Bayesian Neural Architecture</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela J. Yu, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: We study the synthesis of neural coding, selective attention and perceptual decision making. A hierarchical neural architecture is proposed, which implements Bayesian integration of noisy sensory input and topdown attentional priors, leading to sound perceptual discrimination. The model offers an explicit explanation for the experimentally observed modulation that prior information in one stimulus feature (location) can have on an independent feature (orientation). The network’s intermediate levels of representation instantiate known physiological properties of visual cortical neurons. The model also illustrates a possible reconciliation of cortical and neuromodulatory representations of uncertainty. 1</p><p>5 0.54426986 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-The_Correlated_Correspondence_Algorithm_for_Unsupervised_Registration_of_Nonrigid_Surfaces.html">186 nips-2004-The Correlated Correspondence Algorithm for Unsupervised Registration of Nonrigid Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Dragomir Anguelov, Praveen Srinivasan, Hoi-cheung Pang, Daphne Koller, Sebastian Thrun, James Davis</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised algorithm for registering 3D surface scans of an object undergoing signiﬁcant deformations. Our algorithm does not need markers, nor does it assume prior knowledge about object shape, the dynamics of its deformation, or scan alignment. The algorithm registers two meshes by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over all point-topoint correspondences between them. This model enforces preservation of local mesh geometry, as well as more global constraints that capture the preservation of geodesic distance between corresponding point pairs. The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically ﬁll in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different conﬁguration. We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of signiﬁcant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. Finally, we show that the output of the algorithm can be used for compelling computer graphics tasks such as interpolation between two scans of a non-rigid object and automatic recovery of articulated object models. 1</p><p>6 0.54001725 <a title="155-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Brain_Inspired_Reinforcement_Learning.html">33 nips-2004-Brain Inspired Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

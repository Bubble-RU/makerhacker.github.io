Coughlan, Preeti Verghese, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

Prediction error of three models: random (R), saliency (S) and information maximization (I) for three observers (pv, lm, kr). The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

<p>Author: Dashan Gao, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: Saliency mechanisms play an important role when visual recognition must be performed in cluttered scenes. We propose a computational deﬁnition of saliency that deviates from existing models by equating saliency to discrimination. In particular, the salient attributes of a given visual class are deﬁned as the features that enable best discrimination between that class and all other classes of recognition interest. It is shown that this deﬁnition leads to saliency algorithms of low complexity, that are scalable to large recognition problems, and is compatible with existing models of early biological vision. Experimental results demonstrating success in the context of challenging recognition problems are also presented. 1</p><p>3 0.13795146 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Intrinsically_Motivated_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2004-Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Fink</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for learning an object classiﬁer from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overﬁtting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classiﬁer could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, deﬁne a nearest neighbor classiﬁer where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>6 0.066302367 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Distributed_Occlusion_Reasoning_for_Tracking_with_Nonparametric_Belief_Propagation.html">55 nips-2004-Distributed Occlusion Reasoning for Tracking with Nonparametric Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Laura W. Renninger, James M. Coughlan, Preeti Verghese, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

<p>Author: Dashan Gao, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: Saliency mechanisms play an important role when visual recognition must be performed in cluttered scenes. We propose a computational deﬁnition of saliency that deviates from existing models by equating saliency to discrimination. In particular, the salient attributes of a given visual class are deﬁned as the features that enable best discrimination between that class and all other classes of recognition interest. It is shown that this deﬁnition leads to saliency algorithms of low complexity, that are scalable to large recognition problems, and is compatible with existing models of early biological vision. Experimental results demonstrating success in the context of challenging recognition problems are also presented. 1</p><p>3 0.4624773 <a title="21-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Intrinsically_Motivated_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2004-Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Nuttapong Chentanez, Andrew G. Barto, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists call behavior intrinsically motivated when it is engaged in for its own sake rather than as a step toward solving a speciﬁc problem of clear practical value. But what we learn during intrinsically motivated behavior is essential for our development as competent autonomous entities able to efﬁciently solve a wide range of practical problems as they arise. In this paper we present initial results from a computational study of intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning aimed at allowing artiﬁcial agents to construct and extend hierarchies of reusable skills that are needed for competent autonomy. 1</p><p>4 0.32931834 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Theories_of_Access_Consciousness.html">193 nips-2004-Theories of Access Consciousness</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael D. Colagrosso, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Theories of access consciousness address how it is that some mental states but not others are available for evaluation, choice behavior, and verbal report. Farah, O’Reilly, and Vecera (1994) argue that quality of representation is critical; Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeux (2003) argue that the ability to communicate representations is critical. We present a probabilistic information transmission or PIT model that suggests both of these conditions are essential for access consciousness. Having successfully modeled data from the repetition priming literature in the past, we use the PIT model to account for data from two experiments on subliminal priming, showing that the model produces priming even in the absence of accessibility and reportability of internal states. The model provides a mechanistic basis for understanding the dissociation of priming and awareness. Philosophy has made many attempts to identify distinct aspects of consciousness. Perhaps the most famous effort is Block’s (1995) delineation of phenomenal and access consciousness. Phenomenal consciousness has to do with “what it is like” to experience chocolate or a pin prick. Access consciousness refers to internal states whose content is “(1) inferentially promiscuous, i.e., poised to be used as a premise in reasoning, (2) poised for control of action, and (3) poised for rational control of speech.” (p. 230) The scientiﬁc study of consciousness has exploded in the past six years, and an important catalyst for this explosion has been the decision to focus on the problem of access consciousness: how is it that some mental states but not others become available for evaluation, choice behavior, verbal report, and storage in working memory. Another reason for the recent explosion of consciousness research is the availability of functional imaging techniques to explore differences in brain activation between conscious and unconscious states, as well as the development of clever psychological experiments that show that a stimulus that is not consciously perceived can nonetheless inﬂuence cognition, which we describe shortly. 1 Subliminal Priming The phenomena we address utilize an experimental paradigm known as repetition priming. Priming refers to an improvement in efﬁciency in processing a stimulus item as a result of previous exposure to the item. Efﬁciency is deﬁned in terms of shorter response times, lower error rates, or both. A typical long-term perceptual priming experiment consists of a study phase during which participants are asked to read aloud a list of words, and a test phase during which participants must name or categorize a series of words, presented one at a time. Reaction time is lower and/or accuracy is higher for test words that were also on the study list. Repetition priming occurs without strategic effort on the part of participants, and therefore appears to be a low level mechanism of learning, which likely serves as the mechanism underlying the reﬁnement of cognitive skills with practice. In traditional studies, priming is supraliminal—the prime is consciously perceived. In the studies we model here, primes are subliminal. Subliminal priming addresses fundamental issues concerning conscious access: How is it that a word or image that cannot be identiﬁed, detected, or even discriminated in forced choice can nonetheless inﬂuence the processing of a subsequent stimulus word? Answering this question in a computational framework would be a signiﬁcant advance toward understanding the nature of access consciousness. 2 Models of Conscious and Unconscious Processing In contrast to the wealth of experimental data, and the large number of speculative and philosophical papers on consciousness, concrete computational models are rare. The domain of consciousness is particularly ripe for theoretical perspectives, because it is a signiﬁcant contribution to simply provide an existence proof of a mechanism that can explain speciﬁc experimental data. Ordinarily, a theorist faces skepticism when presenting a model; it often seems that hundreds of alternative, equally plausible accounts must exist. However, when addressing data deemed central to issues of consciousness, simply providing a concrete handle on the phenomena serves to demystify consciousness and bring it into the realm of scientiﬁc understanding. We are familiar with only three computational models that address speciﬁc experimental data in the domain of consciousness. We summarize these models, and then present a novel model and describe its relationship to the previous efforts. Farah, O’Reilly, and Vecera (1994) were the ﬁrst to model speciﬁc phenomena pertaining to consciousness in a computational framework. The phenomena involve prosopagnosia, a deﬁcit of overt face recognition following brain damage. Nonetheless, prosopagnosia patients exhibit residual covert recognition by a variety of tests. For example, when patients are asked to categorize names as famous or nonfamous, their response times are faster to a famous name when the name is primed by a picture of a semantically related face (e.g., the name “Bill Clinton” when preceded by a photograph of Hillary), despite the fact that they could not identify the related face. Farah et al. model face recognition in a neural network, and show that when the network is damaged, it loses the ability to perform tasks requiring high ﬁdelity representations (e.g., identiﬁcation) but not tasks requiring only coarse information (e.g., semantic priming). They argue that conscious perception is associated with a certain minimal quality of representation. Dehaene and Naccache (2001) outline a framework based on Baars’ (1989) notion of conscious states as residing in a global workspace. They describe the workspace as a “distributed neural system...with long-distance connectivity that can potentially interconnect multiple specialized brain areas in a coordinated, though variable manner.” (p. 13) Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeaux (2003) implement this framework in a complicated architecture of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and show that the model can qualitatively account for the attentional blink phenomenon. The attentional blink is observed in experiments where participants are shown a rapid series of stimuli, which includes two targets (T1 and T2). If T2 appears shortly after T1, the ability to report T2 drops, as if attention is distracted. Dehane et al. explain this phenomenon as follows. When T1 is presented, its activation propagates to frontal cortical areas (the global workspace). Feedback connections lead to a resonance between frontal and posterior areas, which strengthen T1 but block T2 from entering the workspace. If the T1-T2 lag is sufﬁciently great, habituation of T1 sufﬁciently weakens the representation such that T2 can enter the workspace and suppress T1. In this account, conscious access is achieved via resonance between posterior and frontal areas. Although the Farah et al. and Dehaene et al. models might not seem to have much in common, they both make claims concerning what is required to achieve functional connectivity between perceptual and response systems. Farah et al. focus on aspects of the representation; Dehaene et al. focus on a pathway through which representations can be communicated. These two aspects are not incompatible, and in fact, a third model incorporates both. Mathis and Mozer (1996) describe an architecture with processing modules for perceptual and response processes, implemented as attractor neural nets. They argue that in order for a representation in some perceptual module to be assured of inﬂuencing a response module, (a) it must have certain characteristics–temporal persistence and well-formedness– which is quite similar to Farah et al.’s notion of quality, and (b) the two modules must be interconnected—which is the purpose of Dehaene et al.’s global workspace. The model has two limitations that restrict its value as a contemporary account of conscious access. First, it addressed classical subliminal priming data, but more reliable data has recently been reported. Second, like the other two models, Mathis and Mozer used a complex neural network architecture with arbitrary assumptions built in, and the sensitivity of the model’s behavior to these assumptions is far from clear. In this paper, we present a model that embodies the same assumptions as Mathis and Mozer, but overcomes its two limitations, and explains subliminal-priming data that has yet to be interpreted via a computational model. 3 The Probabilistic Information Transmission (PIT) Framework Our model is based on the probabilistic information transmission or PIT framework of Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2002, 2003). The framework characterizes the transmission of information from perceptual to response systems, and how the time course of information transmission changes with experience (i.e., priming). Mozer et al. used this framework to account for a variety of facilitation effects from supraliminal repetition priming. The framework describes cognition in terms of a collection of information-processing pathways, and supposes that any act of cognition involves coordination among multiple pathways. For example, to model a letter-naming task where a letter printed in upper or lower case is presented visually and the letter must be named, the framework would assume a perceptual pathway that maps the visual input to an identity representation, and a response pathway that maps a identity representation to a naming response. The framework is formalized as a probabilistic model: the pathway input and output are random variables and microinference in a pathway is carried out by Bayesian belief revision. The framework captures the time course of information processing for a single experimental trial. To elaborate, consider a pathway whose input at time t is a discrete random variable, denoted X(t), which can assume values x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , xnx corresponding to alternative input states. Similarly, the output of the pathway at time t is a discrete random variable, denoted Y (t), which can assume values y1 , y2 , y3 , . . . , yny . For example, in the letter-naming task, the input to the perceptual pathway would be one of nx = 52 visual patterns corresponding to the upper- and lower-case letters of the alphabet, and the output is one of ny = 26 letter identities. To present a particular input alternative, say xi , to the model for T time steps, we specify X(t) = xi for t = 1 . . . T , and allow the model to compute P(Y (t) | X(1) . . . X(t)). A pathway is modeled as a dynamic Bayes network; the minimal version of the model used in the present simulations is simply a hidden Markov model, where the X(t) are observations and the Y (t) are inferred state (see Figure 1a). In typical usage, an HMM is presented with a sequence of distinct inputs, whereas we maintain the same input for many successive time steps; and an HMM transitions through a sequence of distinct hidden states, whereas we attempt to converge with increasing conﬁdence on a single state. Figure 1b illustrates the time course of inference in a single pathway with 52 input and 26 output alternatives and two-to-one associations. The solid line in the Figure shows, as a function of time t, P(Y (t) = yi | X(1) = x2i . . . X(t) = x2i ), i.e., the probability that input i (say, the visual pattern of an upper case O) will produce its target output (the letter identity). Evidence for the target output accumulates gradually over time, yielding a speed-accuracy curve that relates the number of iterations to the accuracy of identiﬁcation. Y0 Y1 X1 Y2 X2 P(Output) 1 Y3 X3 (a) (b) 0.8 0.6 O 0.4 0.2 0 Q Time Figure 1: (a) basic pathway architecture—a hidden Markov model; (b) time course of inference in a pathway when the letter O is presented, causing activation of both O and the visually similar Q. The exact shape of the speed-accuracy curve—the pathway dynamics—are determined by three probability distributions, which embody the knowledge and past experience of the model. First, P(Y (0)) is the prior distribution over outputs in the absence of any information about the input. Second, P(Y (t) | Y (t − 1)) characterizes how the pathway output evolves over time. We assume the transition probability matrix serves as a memory with diffusion, i.e., P(Y (t) = yi |Y (t − 1) = yj ) = (1 − β)δij + βP(Y (0) = yi ), where β is the diffusion constant and δij is the Kronecker delta. Third, P(X(t) | Y (t)) characterizes the strength of association between inputs and outputs. The greater the association strength, the more rapidly that information about X will be communicated to Y . We parameterize this distribution as P(X(t) = xi |Y (t) = yj ) ∼ 1 + k γik αkj , where αij indicates the frequency of experience with the association between states xi and yj , and γik speciﬁes the similarity between states xi and xk . (Although the representation of states is localist, the γ terms allow us to design in the similarity structure inherent in a distributed representation.) These association strengths are highly constrained by the task structure and the similarity structure and familiarity of the inputs. Fundamental to the framework is the assumption that with each experience, a pathway becomes more efﬁcient at processing an input. Efﬁciency is reﬂected by a shift in the speedaccuracy curve to the left. In Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2002, 2003), we propose two distinct mechanisms to model phenomena of supraliminal priming. First, the association frequencies, αij , are increased following a trial in which xi leads to activation of yj , resulting in more efﬁcient transmission of information, corresponding to an increased slope of the solid line in Figure 1b. The increase is Hebbian, based on the maximum activation achieved by xi and yj : ∆αij = η maxt P(X(t) = xi )P(Y (t) = yj ), where η is a step size. Second, the priors, which serve as a model of the environment, are increased to indicate a greater likelihood of the same output occurring again in the future. In modeling data from supraliminal priming, we found that the increases to association frequencies are long lasting, but the increases to the priors decay over the course of a few minutes or a few trials. As a result, the prior updating does not play into the simulation we report here; we refer the reader to Mozer, Colagrosso, and Huber (2003) for details. 4 Access Consciousness and PIT We have described the operation of a single pathway, but to model any cognitive task, we require a series of pathways in cascade. For a simple choice task, we use a percpetual pathway cascaded to a response pathway. The interconnection between the pathways is achieved by copying the output of the perceptual pathway, Y p (t), to the input of the response pathway, X r (t), at each time t. This multiple-pathway architecture allows us to characterize the notion of access consciousness. Considering the output of the perceptual pathway, access is achieved when: (1) the output representation is sufﬁcient to trigger the correct behavior in the response pathway, and (2) the perceptual and response pathways are functionally interconnected. In more general terms, access for a perceptual pathway output requires that these two condi- tions be met not just for a speciﬁc response pathway, but for arbitrary response pathways (e.g., pathways for naming, choice, evaluation, working memory, etc.). In Mozer and Colagrosso (in preparation) we characterize the sufﬁciency requirements of condition 1; they involve a representation of low entropy that stays active for long enough that the representation can propagate to the next pathway. As we will show, a brieﬂy presented stimulus fails to achieve a representation that supports choice and naming responses. Nonetheless, the stimulus evokes activity in the perceptual pathway. Because perceptual priming depends on the magnitude of the activation in the perceptual pathway, not on the activation being communicated to response pathways, the framework is consistent with the notion of priming occurring in the absence of awareness. 4.1 Simulation of Bar and Biederman (1998) Bar and Biederman (1998) presented a sequence of masked line drawings of objects and asked participants to name the objects, even if they had to guess. If the guess was incorrect, participants were required to choose the object name from a set of four alternatives. Unbeknownst to the participant, some of the drawings in the series were repeated, and Bar and Biederman were interested in whether participants would beneﬁt from the ﬁrst presentation even if it could not be identiﬁed. The repeated objects could be the same or a different exemplar of the object, and it could appear in either the same or a different display position. Participants were able to name 13.5% of drawings on presentation 1, but accuracy jumped to 34.5% on presentation 2. Accuracy did improve, though not as much, if the same shape was presented in a different position, but not if a different drawing of the same object was presented, suggesting a locus of priming early in the visual stream. The improvement in accuracy is not due to practice in general, because accuracy rose only 4.0% for novel control objects over the course of the experiment. The priming is ﬁrmly subliminal, because participants were not only unable to name objects on the ﬁrst presentation, but their fouralternative forced choice (4AFC) performance was not much above chance (28.5%). To model these phenomena, we created a response pathway with ﬁfty states representing names of objects that are used in the experiment, e.g., chair and lamp. We also created a perceptual pathway with states representing visual patterns that correspond to the names in the response pathway. Following the experimental design, every object identity was instantiated in two distinct shapes, and every shape could be in one of nine different visualﬁeld positions, leading to 900 distinct states in the perceptual pathway to model the possible visual stimuli. The following parameters were ﬁt to the data. If two perceptual states, xi and xk are the same shape in different positions, they are assigned a similarity coefﬁcient γik = 0.95; all other similarity coefﬁcients are zero. The association frequency, α, for valid associations in the perceptual pathway was 22, and the response pathway 18. Other parameters were β p = .05, β r = .01, and η = 1.0. The PIT model achieves a good ﬁt to the human experimental data (Figure 2). Speciﬁcally, priming is greatest for the same shape in the same position, some priming occurs for the same shape in a different position, and no substantial priming occurs for the different shape. Figure 3a shows the time course of activation of a stimulus representation in the perceptual pathway when the stimulus is presented for 50 iterations, on both the ﬁrst and third presentations. The third presentation was chosen instead of the second to make the effect of priming clearer. Even though a shape cannot be named on the ﬁrst presentation, partial information about the shape may nonetheless be available for report. The 4AFC test of Bar and Biederman provides a more sensitive measure of residual stimulus information. In past work, we modeled forced-choice tasks using a response pathway with only the alternatives under consideration. However, in this experiment, forced-choice performance must be estimated conditional on incorrect naming. In PIT framework, we achieve this using naming and 40 40 First Block Second Block 30 25 20 15 10 5 First Block 35 Percent Correct Naming Percent Correct Naming 35 Second Block 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0 Control Objects Prime SHAPE: Same Objects POSITION: Same Same Different Different Different Second Same Different Control Control Objects Prime SHAPE: Same Objects POSITION: Same Same Different Different Different Second Same Different Control Figure 2: (left panel) Data from Bar and Biederman (1998) (right panel) Simulation of PIT.

Grey bars: accuracy for control objects at the beginning and the end of the experiment. forced-choice output pathways having output distributions N (t) and F (t), which are linked via the perceptual state, Y p (t). F (t) must be reestimated with the evidence that N (t) is not the target state. This inference problem is intractable. We therefore used a shortcut in which a single response pathway is used, augmented with a simple three-node belief net (Figure 3b) to capture the dependence between naming and forced choice. The belief net has a response pathway node Y r (t) connected to F (t) and N (t), with conditional distribution P (N (t) = ni |Y r (t) = yj ) = θδij + (1 − θ)/|Y r |, and an analogous distribution for P (F (t) = fi |Y r (t) = yj ). The free parameter θ determines how veridically naming and forced-choice actions reﬂect response-pathway output. Over a range of θ, θ < 1, the model obtains forced-choice performance near chance on the ﬁrst presentation when the naming response is incorrect. For example, with θ = 0.72, the model produces a forced-choice accuracy on presentation 1 of 26.1%. (Interestingly, the model also produces below chance performance on presentation 2 if the object is not named correctly—23.5%—which is also found in the human data—20.0%.) Thus, by the stringent criterion of 4AFC, the model shows no access consciousness, and therefore illustrates a dissociation between priming and access consciousness. In our simulation, we followed the procedure of Bar and Biederman by including distractor alternatives with visual and semantic similarity to the target. These distractors are critical: with unrelated distractors, the model’s 4AFC performance is signiﬁcantly above chance, illustrating that a perceptual representation can be adequate to support some responses but not others, as Farah et al. (1994) also argued. 4.2 Simulation of Abrams and Greenwald (2000) During an initial phase of the experiment, participants categorized 24 clearly visible target words as pleasant (e.g., HUMOR) or unpleasant (e.g., SMUT). They became quite familiar with the task by categorizing each word a total of eight times. In a second phase, participants were asked to classify the same targets and were given a response deadline to induce errors. The targets were preceded by masked primes that could not be identiﬁed. Of interest is the effective valence (or EV) of the target for different prime types, deﬁned as the error rate difference between unpleasant and pleasant targets. A positive (negative) EV indicates that responses are biased toward a pleasant (unpleasant) interpretation by the prime. As one would expect, pleasant primes resulted in a positive EV, unpleasant primes in a negative EV. Of critical interest is the ﬁnding that a nonword prime formed by recombining two pleasant targets (e.g., HULIP from HUMOR and TULIP) or unpleasant targets (e.g., BIUT from BILE and SMUT ) also served to bias the targets. More surprising, a positive EV resulted from unpleasant prime words formed by recombining two pleasant targets (TUMOR from TULIP and HUMOR ), indicating that subliminal priming arises from word fragments, not words as unitary entities, and providing further evidence for an early locus of subliminal priming. Note that the results depend critically on the ﬁrst phase of the experiment, which gave participants extensive practice on a relatively small set of words that were then used as and recombined to form primes.

HULIP-type primes are almost as strong as target repetitions, and TUMOR-type primes have a positive valence, contrary to the meaning of the word. no signiﬁcant EV effect when used as primes. In this simulation, we used a three pathway model: a perceptual pathway that maps visual patterns to orthography with 200 input states corresponding both to words, nonwords, and nonword recombinations of words; a semantic pathway that maps to 100 distinct lexical/semantic states; and a judgement pathway that maps to two responses, pleasant and unpleasant. In the perceptual pathway, similarity structure was based on letter overlap, so that HULIP was similar to both TULIP and HUMOR, with γ = 0.837. No similarity was assumed in the semantic state representation; consistent with the previous simulation, β p = .05, β s = .01, β j = .01, and η = .01. At the outset of the simulation, α frequencies for correct associations were 15, 19, and 25 in the perceptual, semantic, and judgement pathways. The initial phase of the experiment was simulated by repeated supraliminal presentation of words, which increased the association frequencies in all three pathways through the ∆αij learning rule. Long-term supraliminal priming is essential in establishing the association strengths, as we’ll explain. Short-term subliminal priming also plays a key role in the experiment. During the second phase of the experiment, residual activity from the prime—primarily in the judgement pathway—biases the response to the target. Residual activation of the prime is present even if the representation of the prime does not reach sufﬁcient strength that it could be named or otherwise reported. The outcome of the simulation is consistent with the human data (Figure 4). When a HULIP -type prime is presented, HUMOR and TULIP become active in the semantic pathway because of their visual similarity to HULIP. Partial activation of these two practiced words pushes the judgement pathway toward a pleasant response, resulting in a positive EV. When a TUMOR-type prime is presented, three different words become active in the semantic pathway: HUMOR, TULIP, and TUMOR itself. Although TUMOR is more active, it was not one of the words studied during the initial phase of the experiment, and as a result, it has a relatively weak association to the unpleasant judgement, in contrast to the other two words which have strong associations to the pleasant judgement. Orphan primes have little effect because they were not studied during the initial phase of the experiment, and consequently their association to pleasant and unpleasant judgements is also weak. In summary, activation of the prime along a critical, well-practiced pathway may not be sufﬁcient to support an overt naming response, yet it may be sufﬁcient to bias the processing of the immediately following target. 5 Discussion An important contribution of this work has been to demonstrate that speciﬁc experimental results relating to access consciousness and subliminal priming can be interpreted in a concrete computational framework. By necessity, the PIT framework, which we previously used to model supraliminal priming data, predicts the existence of subliminal priming, because the mechanisms giving rise to priming depend on degree of activation of a representation, whereas the processes giving rise to access consciousness also depend on the temporal persistence of a representation. Another contribution of this work has been to argue that two previous computational models each tell only part of the story. Farah et al. argue that quality of representation is critical; Dehaene et al. argue that pathways to communicate representations is critical. The PIT framework argues that both of these features are necessary for access consciousness. Although the PIT framework is not completely developed, it nonetheless makes a clear prediction: that subliminal priming is can never be stronger than supraliminal priming, because the maximal activation of subliminal primes is never greater than that of supraliminal primes. One might argue that many theoretical frameworks might predict the same, but no other computational model is sufﬁciently well developed—in terms of addressing both priming and access consciousness—to make this prediction. In its current stage of development, a weakness of the PIT framework is that it is silent as to how perceptual and response pathways become ﬂexibly interconnected based on task demands. However, the PIT framework is not alone in failing to address this critical issue: The Dehaene et al. model suggests that once a representation enters the global workspace, all response modules can access it, but the model does not specify how the appropriate perceptual module wins the competition to enter the global workspace, or how the appropriate response module is activated. Clearly, ﬂexible cognitive control structures that perform these functions are intricately related to mechanisms of consciousness.

In this paper we consider within the framework of reinforcement learning how different sensory modalities can be combined and selected for real-time, optimal movement control. We propose an actor-critic architecture with multiple modules, whose output are combined using a softmax function. We tested our architecture in a simulation of a sequential reaching task. Reaching was initially guided by visual feedback with a long latency. Our learning scheme allowed the agent to utilize the somatosensory feedback with shorter latency when the hand is near the experienced trajectory. In simulations with different latencies for visual and somatosensory feedback, we found that the agent depended more on feedback with shorter latency. 1</p><p>6 0.27340275 <a title="21-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-An_Auditory_Paradigm_for_Brain-Computer_Interfaces.html">20 nips-2004-An Auditory Paradigm for Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Laura W. Renninger, James M. Coughlan, Preeti Verghese, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements. 1 In trod u ction Since the earliest recordings [1, 2], vision researchers have sought to understand the non-random yet idiosyncratic behavior of volitional eye movements. To do so, we must not only unravel the bottom-up visual processing involved in selecting a fixation location, but we must also disentangle the effects of top-down cognitive factors such as task and prior knowledge. Our ability to predict volitional eye movements provides a clear measure of our understanding of biological vision. One approach to predicting fixation locations is to propose that the eyes move to points that are “salient”. Salient regions can be found by looking for centersurround contrast in visual channels such as color, contrast and orientation, among others [3, 4]. Saliency has been shown to correlate with human fixation locations when observers “look around” an image [5, 6] but it is not clear if saliency alone can explain why some locations are chosen over others and in what order. Task as well as scene or object knowledge will play a role in constraining the fixation locations chosen [7]. Observations such as this led to the scanpath theory, which proposed that eye movement sequences are tightly linked to both the encoding and retrieval of specific object memories [8]. 1.1 Our Approach We propose that during natural, active vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in an image in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about what we are looking at. This approach is intuitive and may be biologically plausible, as outlined by Lee & Yu [9]. The most informative point will depend on both the observer’s current knowledge of the stimulus and the task. The quality of the information gathered with each fixation will depend greatly on human visual resolution limits. This is the reason we must move our eyes in the first place, yet it is often ignored. A sequence of eye movements may then be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. 2 Human eye movements We investigated how observers examine a novel shape when they must rely heavily on bottom-up stimulus information. Because eye movements will be affected by the task of the observer, we constructed a learn-discriminate paradigm. Observers are asked to carefully study a shape and then discriminate it from a highly similar one. 2.1 Stimuli and Design We use novel silhouettes to reduce the influence of object familiarity on the pattern of eye movements and to facilitate our computations of information in the model. Each silhouette subtends 12.5º to ensure that its entire shape cannot be characterized with a single fixation. During the learning phase, subjects first fixated a marker and then pressed a button to cue the appearance of the shape which appeared 10º to the left or right of fixation. Subjects maintained fixation for 300ms, allowing for a peripheral preview of the object. When the fixation marker disappeared, subjects were allowed to study the object for 1.2 seconds while their eye movements were recorded. During the discrimination phase, subjects were asked to select the shape they had just studied from a highly similar shape pair (Figure 1). Performance was near 75% correct, indicating that the task was challenging yet feasible. Subjects saw 140 shapes and given auditory feedback. release fixation, view object freely (1200ms) maintain fixation (300ms) Which shape is a match? fixate, initiate trial Figure 1. Temporal layout of a trial during the learning phase (left). Discrimination of learned shape from a highly similar one (right). 2.2 Apparatus Right eye position was measured with an SRI Dual Purkinje Image eye tracker while subjects viewed the stimulus binocularly. Head position was fixed with a bitebar. A 25 dot grid that covered the extent of the presentation field was used for calibration. The points were measured one at a time with each dot being displayed for 500ms. The stimuli were presented using the Psychtoolbox software [10]. 3 Model We wish to create a model that builds a representation of a shape silhouette given imperfect visual information, and which updates its representation as new visual information is acquired. The model will be defined statistically so as to explicitly encode uncertainty about the current knowledge of the shape silhouette. We will use this model to generate a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that will decrease the model’s uncertainty as much as possible. Similar approaches have been described in an ideal observer model for reading [11], an information maximization algorithm for tracking contours in cluttered images [12] and predicting fixation locations during object learning [13]. 3.1 Representing information The information in silhouettes clearly resides at its contour, which we represent with a collection of points and associated tangent orientations. These points and their associated orientations are called edgelets, denoted e1, e2, ... eN, where N is the total number of edgelets along the boundary. Each edgelet ei is defined as a triple ei=(xi, yi, zi) where (xi, yi) is the 2D location of the edgelet and zi is the orientation of the tangent to the boundary contour at that point. zi can assume any of Q possible values 1, 2, …, Q, representing a discretization of Q possible orientations ranging from 0 to π , and we have chosen Q=8 in our experiments. The goal of the model is to infer the most likely orientation values given the visual information provided by one or more fixations. 3.2 Updating knowledge The visual information is based on indirect measurements of the true edgelet values e1, e2, ... eN. Although our model assumes complete knowledge of the number N and locations (xi, yi) of the edgelets, it does not have direct access to the orientations zi.1 Orientation information is instead derived from measurements that summarize the local frequency of occurrence of edgelet orientations, averaged locally over a coarse scale (corresponding to the spatial scale at which resolution is limited by the human visual system). These coarse measurements provide indirect information about individual edgelet orientations, which may not uniquely determine the orientations. We will use a simple statistical model to estimate the distribution of individual orientation values conditioned on this information. Our measurements are defined to model the resolution limitations of the human visual system, with highest resolution at the fovea and lower resolution in the 1 Although the visual system does not have precise knowledge of location coordinates, the model is greatly simplified by assuming this knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that location uncertainty will be highly correlated with orientation uncertainty, so that the inclusion of location should not greatly affect the model's decisions of where to fixate next. periphery. Distance to the fovea is r measured as eccentricity E, the visual angle between any point and the fovea. If x = ( x, y ) is the location of a point in an image r and f = ( f x , f y ) is the fixation (i.e. foveal) location in the image then the r r eccentricity is E = x − f , measured in units of visual degrees. The effective resolution of orientation discrimination falls with increasing eccentricity as r (E ) = FPH ( E + E 2 ) where r(E) is an effective radius over which the visual system spatially pools information and FPH =0.1 and E2=0.8 [14]. Our model represents pooled information as a histogram of edge orientations within the effective radius. For each edgelet ei we define the histogram of all edgelet r orientations ej within radius ri = r(E) of ei , where E is the eccentricity of xi = ( xi , yi ) r r r relative to the current fixation f , i.e. E = xi − f . To define the histogram more precisely we will introduce the neighborhood set Ni of all indices j corresponding to r r edgelets within radius ri of ei : N i = all j s.t. xi − x j ≤ ri , with number of { } neighborhood edgelets |Ni|. The (normalized) histogram centered at edgelet ei is then defined as hiz = 1 Ni ∑δ j∈N i z,z j , which is the proportion of edgelet orientations that assume value z in the (eccentricity-dependent) neighborhood of edgelet ei.2 Figure 2. Relation between eccentricity E and radius r(E) of the neighborhood (disk) which defines the local orientation histogram (hiz ). Left and right panels show two fixations for the same object. Up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case of a single fixation. To designate a sequence of multiple fixations we will index them byrk=1, 2, …, K (for K total fixations). The k th fixation location is denoted by f ( k ) = ( f xk , f yk ) . The quantities ri , Ni and hiz depend on fixation location and so to make this dependence (k explicit we will augment them with superscripts as ri(k ) , N i(k ) , and hiz ) . 2 δ x, y is the Kronecker delta function, defined to equal 1 if x = y and 0 if x ≠ y . Now we describe the statistical model of edgelet orientations given information obtained from multiple fixations. Ideally we would like to model the exact distribution of orientations conditioned on the histogram data: (1) ( 2) (K ) ( , where {hizk ) } represents all histogram P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz }, {hiz },K, {hiz }) r components z at every edgelet ei for fixation f (k ) . This exact distribution is intractable, so we will use a simple approximation. We assume the distribution factors over individual edgelets: N ( ( ( P(zi , z 2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK ) }) = ∏ g i(zi ) i =1 where gi(zi) is the marginal distribution of orientation zi. Determining these marginal distributions is still difficult even with the factorization assumption, so we K will make an additional approximation: g (z ) = 1 ∏ hiz( k ) , where Zi is a suitable i i Z i k =1 (k ) normalization factor. This approximation corresponds to treating hiz as a likelihood function over z, with independent likelihoods for each fixation k. While the approximation has some undesirable properties (such as making the marginal distribution gi(zi) more peaked if the same fixation is made repeatedly), it provides a simple mechanism for combining histogram evidence from multiple, distinct fixations. 3.3 Selecting the next fixation r ( K +1) Given the past K fixations, the next fixation f is chosen to minimize the model r ( K +1) entropy of the edgelet orientations. In other words, f is chosen to minimize r ( K +1) ( ( ( H( f ) = entropy[ P(zi , z2 , ... z N | {hiz1) }, {hiz2 ) },K, {hizK +1) })] , where the entropy of a distribution P(x) is defined as − ∑ P( x) log P ( x) . In practice, we minimize the x r entropy by evaluating it across a set of candidate locations f ( K +1) which forms a regularly sampled grid across the image.3 We note that this selection rule makes decisions that depend, in general, on the full history of previous K fixations. 4 Results Figure 3 shows an example of one observer’s eye movements superimposed over the shape (top row), the prediction from a saliency model (middle row) [3] and the prediction from the information maximization model (bottom row). The information maximization model updates its prediction after each fixation. An ideal sequence of fixations can be generated by both models. The saliency model selects fixations in order of decreasing salience. The information maximization model selects the maximally informative point after incorporating information from the previous fixations. To provide an additional benchmark, we also implemented a 3 This rule evaluates the entropy resulting from every possible next fixation before making a decision. Although this rule is suitable for our modeling purposes, it would be inefficient to implement in a biological or machine vision system. A practical decision rule would use current knowledge to estimate the expected (rather than actual) entropy. Figure 3. Example eye movement pattern, superimposed over the stimulus (top row), saliency map (middle row) and information maximization map (bottom row). model that selects fixations at random. One way to quantify the performance is to map a subject’s fixations onto the closest model predicted fixation locations, ignoring the sequence in which they were made. In this analysis, both the saliency and information maximization models are significantly better than random at predicting candidate locations (p < 0.05; t-test) for three observers (Figure 4, left). The information maximization model performs slightly but significantly better than the saliency model for two observers (lm, kr). If we match fixation locations while retaining the sequence, errors become quite large, indicating that the models cannot account for the observed behavior (Figure 4, right).

Prediction error of three models: random (R), saliency (S) and information maximization (I) for three observers (pv, lm, kr). The left panel shows the error in predicting fixation locations, ignoring sequence. The right panel shows the error when sequence is retained before mapping. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. The information maximization model incorporates resolution limitations, but there are further biological constraints that must be considered if we are to build a model that can fully explain human eye movement patterns. First, saccade amplitudes are typically around 2-4º and rarely exceed 15º [15]. When we move our eyes, the image of the visual world is smeared across the retina and our perception of it is actively suppressed [16]. Shorter saccade lengths may be a mechanism to reduce this cost. This biological constraint would cause a fixation to fall short of the prediction if it is distant from the current fixation (Figure 5). Figure 5. Cost of moving the eyes. Successive fixations may fall short of the maximally salient or informative point if it is very distant from the current fixation. Second, the biological system may increase its sampling efficiency by planning a series of saccades concurrently [17, 18]. Several fixations may therefore be made before sampled information begins to influence target selection. The information maximization model currently updates after each fixation. This would create a discrepancy in the prediction of the eye movement sequence (Figure 6). Figure 6. Three fixations are made to a location that is initially highly informative according to the information maximization model. By the fourth fixation, the subject finally moves to the next most informative point. 5 D i s c u s s i on Our model and the saliency model are using the same image information to determine fixation locations, thus it is not surprising that they are roughly similar in their performance of predicting human fixation locations. The main difference is how we decide to “shift attention” or program the sequence of eye movements to these locations. The saliency model uses a winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanism to shift among the salient regions. We take a completely different approach by saying that observers adopt a strategy of sequential information maximization. In effect, the history of where we have been matters because our model is continually collecting information from the stimulus. We have an implicit “inhibition-of-return” because there is little to be gained by revisiting a point. Second, we attempt to take biological resolution limits into account when determining the quality of information gained with each fixation. By including additional biological constraints such as the cost of making large saccades and the natural time course of information update, we may be able to improve our prediction of eye movement sequences. We have shown that the programming of eye movements can be understood within a framework of sequential information maximization. This framework is portable to any image or task. A remaining challenge is to understand how different tasks constrain the representation of information and to what degree observers are able to utilize the information.

<p>Author: Aharon Bar-hillel, Adam Spiro, Eran Stark</p><p>Abstract: Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron. It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework. At a ﬁrst search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame. At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model. Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The method was applied to several recordings. The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters. 1</p><p>4 0.56109893 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Hyper-Features_for_Visual_Identification.html">99 nips-2004-Learning Hyper-Features for Visual Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Andras D. Ferencz, Erik G. Learned-miller, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of identifying speciﬁc instances of a class (cars) from a set of images all belonging to that class. Although we cannot build a model for any particular instance (as we may be provided with only one “training” example of it), we can use information extracted from observing other members of the class. We pose this task as a learning problem, in which the learner is given image pairs, labeled as matching or not, and must discover which image features are most consistent for matching instances and discriminative for mismatches. We explore a patch based representation, where we model the distributions of similarity measurements deﬁned on the patches. Finally, we describe an algorithm that selects the most salient patches based on a mutual information criterion. This algorithm performs identiﬁcation well for our challenging dataset of car images, after matching only a few, well chosen patches. 1</p><p>5 0.55987561 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Joint_Probabilistic_Curve_Clustering_and_Alignment.html">90 nips-2004-Joint Probabilistic Curve Clustering and Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott J. Gaffney, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a ﬁxed-dimensional featurevector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.</p><p>6 0.55907142 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Three_Tiered_Approach_for_Articulated_Object_Action_Modeling_and_Recognition.html">13 nips-2004-A Three Tiered Approach for Articulated Object Action Modeling and Recognition</a></p>

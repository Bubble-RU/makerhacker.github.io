<p>Author: Jieping Ye, Ravi Janardan, Qi Li</p><p>Abstract: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimension reduction. It has been used widely in many applications involving high-dimensional data, such as face recognition and image retrieval. An intrinsic limitation of classical LDA is the so-called singularity problem, that is, it fails when all scatter matrices are singular. A well-known approach to deal with the singularity problem is to apply an intermediate dimension reduction stage using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before LDA. The algorithm, called PCA+LDA, is used widely in face recognition. However, PCA+LDA has high costs in time and space, due to the need for an eigen-decomposition involving the scatter matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel LDA algorithm, namely 2DLDA, which stands for 2-Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis. 2DLDA overcomes the singularity problem implicitly, while achieving efﬁciency. The key difference between 2DLDA and classical LDA lies in the model for data representation. Classical LDA works with vectorized representations of data, while the 2DLDA algorithm works with data in matrix representation. To further reduce the dimension by 2DLDA, the combination of 2DLDA and classical LDA, namely 2DLDA+LDA, is studied, where LDA is preceded by 2DLDA. The proposed algorithms are applied on face recognition and compared with PCA+LDA. Experiments show that 2DLDA and 2DLDA+LDA achieve competitive recognition accuracy, while being much more efﬁcient. 1</p><p>3 0.13597745 <a title="127-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Object_Classification_from_a_Single_Example_Utilizing_Class_Relevance_Metrics.html">134 nips-2004-Object Classification from a Single Example Utilizing Class Relevance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Fink</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for learning an object classiﬁer from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overﬁtting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classiﬁer could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, deﬁne a nearest neighbor classiﬁer where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classiﬁcation might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classiﬁcation task. 1</p><p>4 0.12393607 <a title="127-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Relational_Embedding.html">125 nips-2004-Multiple Relational Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Roland Memisevic, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a way of using multiple different types of similarity relationship to learn a low-dimensional embedding of a dataset. Our method chooses different, possibly overlapping representations of similarity by individually reweighting the dimensions of a common underlying latent space. When applied to a single similarity relation that is based on Euclidean distances between the input data points, the method reduces to simple dimensionality reduction. If additional information is available about the dataset or about subsets of it, we can use this information to clean up or otherwise improve the embedding. We demonstrate the potential usefulness of this form of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction on some simple examples. 1</p><p>5 0.10012188 <a title="127-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Outlier_Detection_with_One-class_Kernel_Fisher_Discriminants.html">142 nips-2004-Outlier Detection with One-class Kernel Fisher Discriminants</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Roth</p><p>Abstract: The problem of detecting “atypical objects” or “outliers” is one of the classical topics in (robust) statistics. Recently, it has been proposed to address this problem by means of one-class SVM classiﬁers. The main conceptual shortcoming of most one-class approaches, however, is that in a strict sense they are unable to detect outliers, since the expected fraction of outliers has to be speciﬁed in advance. The method presented in this paper overcomes this problem by relating kernelized one-class classiﬁcation to Gaussian density estimation in the induced feature space. Having established this relation, it is possible to identify “atypical objects” by quantifying their deviations from the Gaussian model. For RBF kernels it is shown that the Gaussian model is “rich enough” in the sense that it asymptotically provides an unbiased estimator for the true density. In order to overcome the inherent model selection problem, a cross-validated likelihood criterion for selecting all free model parameters is applied. 1</p><p>6 0.099591419 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Triangle_Fixing_Algorithms_for_the_Metric_Nearness_Problem.html">196 nips-2004-Triangle Fixing Algorithms for the Metric Nearness Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Suvrit Sra, Joel Tropp, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Various problems in machine learning, databases, and statistics involve pairwise distances among a set of objects. It is often desirable for these distances to satisfy the properties of a metric, especially the triangle inequality. Applications where metric data is useful include clustering, classiﬁcation, metric-based indexing, and approximation algorithms for various graph problems. This paper presents the Metric Nearness Problem: Given a dissimilarity matrix, ﬁnd the “nearest” matrix of distances that satisfy the triangle inequalities. For p nearness measures, this paper develops efﬁcient triangle ﬁxing algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the inherent structure of the problem. Empirically, the algorithms have time and storage costs that are linear in the number of triangle constraints. The methods can also be easily parallelized for additional speed. 1</p><p>4 0.61591166 <a title="127-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Efficient_Kernel_Discriminant_Analysis_via_QR_Decomposition.html">59 nips-2004-Efficient Kernel Discriminant Analysis via QR Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Xiong, Jieping Ye, Qi Li, Ravi Janardan, Vladimir Cherkassky</p><p>Abstract: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known method for feature extraction and dimension reduction. It has been used widely in many applications such as face recognition. Recently, a novel LDA algorithm based on QR Decomposition, namely LDA/QR, has been proposed, which is competitive in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy with other LDA algorithms, but it has much lower costs in time and space. However, LDA/QR is based on linear projection, which may not be suitable for data with nonlinear structure. This paper ﬁrst proposes an algorithm called KDA/QR, which extends the LDA/QR algorithm to deal with nonlinear data by using the kernel operator. Then an efﬁcient approximation of KDA/QR called AKDA/QR is proposed. Experiments on face image data show that the classiﬁcation accuracy of both KDA/QR and AKDA/QR are competitive with Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA), a general kernel discriminant analysis algorithm, while AKDA/QR has much lower time and space costs. 1</p><p>5 0.59447801 <a title="127-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Multiple_Relational_Embedding.html">125 nips-2004-Multiple Relational Embedding</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Rama Natarajan, Peter Dayan, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: As animals interact with their environments, they must constantly update estimates about their states. Bayesian models combine prior probabilities, a dynamical model and sensory evidence to update estimates optimally. These models are consistent with the results of many diverse psychophysical studies. However, little is known about the neural representation and manipulation of such Bayesian information, particularly in populations of spiking neurons. We consider this issue, suggesting a model based on standard neural architecture and activations. We illustrate the approach on a simple random walk example, and apply it to a sensorimotor integration task that provides a particularly compelling example of dynamic probabilistic computation. Bayesian models have been used to explain a gamut of experimental results in tasks which require estimates to be derived from multiple sensory cues. These include a wide range of psychophysical studies of perception;13 motor action;7 and decision-making.3, 5 Central to Bayesian inference is that computations are sensitive to uncertainties about afferent and efferent quantities, arising from ignorance, noise, or inherent ambiguity (e.g., the aperture problem), and that these uncertainties change over time as information accumulates and dissipates. Understanding how neurons represent and manipulate uncertain quantities is therefore key to understanding the neural instantiation of these Bayesian inferences. Most previous work on representing probabilistic inference in neural populations has focused on the representation of static information.1, 12, 15 These encompass various strategies for encoding and decoding uncertain quantities, but do not readily generalize to real-world dynamic information processing tasks, particularly the most interesting cases with stimuli changing over the same timescale as spiking itself.11 Notable exceptions are the recent, seminal, but, as we argue, representationally restricted, models proposed by Gold and Shadlen,5 Rao,10 and Deneve.4 In this paper, we ﬁrst show how probabilistic information varying over time can be represented in a spiking population code. Second, we present a method for producing spiking codes that facilitate further processing of the probabilistic information. Finally, we show the utility of this method by applying it to a temporal sensorimotor integration task. 1 TRAJECTORY ENCODING AND DECODING We assume that population spikes R(t) arise stochastically in relation to the trajectory X(t) of an underlying (but hidden) variable. We use RT and XT for the whole trajectory and spike trains respectively from time 0 to T . The spikes RT constitute the observations and are assumed to be probabilistically related to the signal by a tuning function f (X, θ i ): P (R(i, T )|X(T )) ∝ f (X, θi ) (1) for the spike train of the ith neuron, with parameters θi . Therefore, via standard Bayesian inference, RT determines a distribution over the hidden variable at time T , P (X(T )|RT ). We ﬁrst consider a version of the dynamics and input coding that permits an analytical examination of the impact of spikes. Let X(t) follow a stationary Gaussian process such that the joint distribution P (X(t1 ), X(t2 ), . . . , X(tm )) is Gaussian for any ﬁnite collection of times, with a covariance matrix which depends on time differences: Ctt = c(|t − t |). Function c(|∆t|) controls the smoothness of the resulting random walks. Then, P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) X(T ) dX(T )P (RT |X(T ))P (X(T )|X(T )) (2) where P (X(T )|X(T )) is the distribution over the whole trajectory X(T ) conditional on the value of X(T ) at its end point. If RT are a set of conditionally independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we have P (RT |X(T )) ∝ iτ f (X(tiτ ), θi ) exp − i τ dτ f (X(τ ), θi ) , (3) where tiτ ∀τ are the spike times τ of neuron i in RT . Let χ = [X(tiτ )] be the vector of stimulus positions at the times at which we observed a spike and Θ = [θ(tiτ )] be the vector of spike positions. If the tuning functions are Gaussian f (X, θi ) ∝ exp(−(X − θi )2 /2σ 2 ) and sufﬁciently dense that i τ dτ f (X, θi ) is independent of X (a standard assumption in population coding), then P (RT |X(T )) ∝ exp(− χ − Θ 2 /2σ 2 ) and in Equation 2, we can marginalize out X(T ) except at the spike times tiτ : P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) −1 χ dχ exp −[χ, X(T )]T C 2 [χ, X(T )] − χ−Θ 2σ 2 2 (4) and C is the block covariance matrix between X(tiτ ), x(T ) at the spike times [ttτ ] and the ﬁnal time T . This Gaussian integral has P (X(T )|RT ) ∼ N (µ(T ), ν(T )), with µ(T ) = CT t (Ctt + Iσ 2 )−1 Θ = kΘ ν(T ) = CT T − kCtT (5) CT T is the T, T th element of the covariance matrix and CT t is similarly a row vector. The dependence in µ on past spike times is speciﬁed chieﬂy by the inverse covariance matrix, and acts as an effective kernel (k). This kernel is not stationary, since it depends on factors such as the local density of spiking in the spike train RT . For example, consider where X(t) evolves according to a diffusion process with drift: dX = −αXdt + σ dN (t) (6) where α prevents it from wandering too far, N (t) is white Gaussian noise with mean zero and σ 2 variance. Figure 1A shows sample kernels for this process. Inspection of Figure 1A reveals some important traits. First, the monotonically decreasing kernel magnitude as the time span between the spike and the current time T grows matches the intuition that recent spikes play a more signiﬁcant role in determining the posterior over X(T ). Second, the kernel is nearly exponential, with a time constant that depends on the time constant of the covariance function and the density of the spikes; two settings of these parameters produced the two groupings of kernels in the ﬁgure. Finally, the fully adaptive kernel k can be locally well approximated by a metronomic kernel k  (shown in red in Figure 1A) that assumes regular spiking. This takes advantage of the general fact, indicated by the grouping of kernels, that the kernel depends weakly on the actual spike pattern, but strongly on the average rate. The merits of the metronomic kernel are that it is stationary and only depends on a single mean rate rather than the full spike train RT .

<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: We abstract out the core search problem of active learning schemes, to better understand the extent to which adaptive labeling can improve sample complexity. We give various upper and lower bounds on the number of labels which need to be queried, and we prove that a popular greedy active learning rule is approximately as good as any other strategy for minimizing this number of labels. 1</p><p>4 0.71733463 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Spike_Sorting%3A_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Non-Stationary_Data.html">174 nips-2004-Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Aharon Bar-hillel, Adam Spiro, Eran Stark</p><p>Abstract: Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron. It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework. At a ﬁrst search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame. At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model. Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The method was applied to several recordings. The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.71676135 <a title="127-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Penalized_Probabilistic_Clustering.html">167 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning with Penalized Probabilistic Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>6 0.716717 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Distributed_Representations_for_Statistical_Language_Modeling.html">78 nips-2004-Hierarchical Distributed Representations for Statistical Language Modeling</a></p>

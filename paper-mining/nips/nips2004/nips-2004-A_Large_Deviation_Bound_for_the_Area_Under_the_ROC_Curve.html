</p><p>3 A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. [sent-8, score-1.072]
</p><p>4 1  Introduction  In many learning problems, the goal is not simply to classify objects into one of a ﬁxed number of classes; instead, a ranking of objects is desired. [sent-9, score-0.554]
</p><p>5 This is the case, for example, in information retrieval problems, where one is interested in retrieving documents from some database that are ‘relevant’ to a given query or topic. [sent-10, score-0.094]
</p><p>6 In such problems, one wants to return to the user a list of documents that contains relevant documents at the top and irrelevant documents at the bottom; in other words, one wants a ranking of the documents such that relevant documents are ranked higher than irrelevant documents. [sent-11, score-1.056]
</p><p>7 The problem of ranking has been studied from a learning perspective under a variety of settings [2, 8, 4, 7]. [sent-12, score-0.498]
</p><p>8 Here we consider the setting in which objects come from two categories, positive and negative; the learner is given examples of objects labeled as positive or negative, and the goal is to learn a ranking in which positive objects are ranked higher than negative ones. [sent-13, score-0.814]
</p><p>9 This captures, for example, the information retrieval problem described above; in this case, the training examples consist of documents labeled as relevant (positive) or irrelevant (negative). [sent-14, score-0.163]
</p><p>10 This form of ranking problem corresponds to the ‘bipartite feedback’ case of [7]; for this reason, we refer to it as the bipartite ranking problem. [sent-15, score-1.078]
</p><p>11 Formally, the setting of the bipartite ranking problem is similar to that of the binary classiﬁcation problem. [sent-16, score-0.58]
</p><p>12 In both problems, there is an instance space X and a set of two class labels Y = {−1, +1}. [sent-17, score-0.065]
</p><p>13 One is given a ﬁnite sequence of labeled training examples S = ((x1 , y1 ), . [sent-18, score-0.112]
</p><p>14 However, the form of the function to be learned in the two problems  is different. [sent-22, score-0.041]
</p><p>15 In classiﬁcation, one seeks a binary-valued function h : X →Y that predicts the class of a new instance in X . [sent-23, score-0.052]
</p><p>16 On the other hand, in ranking, one seeks a real-valued function f : X → R that induces a ranking over X ; an instance that is assigned a higher value by f is ranked higher than one that is assigned a lower value by f . [sent-24, score-0.643]
</p><p>17 The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has recently gained some attention as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking [3]. [sent-25, score-0.63]
</p><p>18 Given a ranking function f : X →R and a ﬁnite data sequence T = ((x1 , y1 ), . [sent-26, score-0.591]
</p><p>19 The AUC of f with respect to T is thus simply the fraction of positivenegative pairs in T that are ranked correctly by f , assuming that ties are broken uniformly at random. [sent-30, score-0.112]
</p><p>20 1 The AUC is an empirical quantity that evaluates a ranking function with respect to a particular data sequence. [sent-31, score-0.578]
</p><p>21 What does the empirical AUC tell us about the expected performance of a ranking function on future examples? [sent-32, score-0.618]
</p><p>22 The question has two parts, both of which are important for machine learning practice. [sent-34, score-0.023]
</p><p>23 First, what can be said about the expected performance of a ranking function based on its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence? [sent-35, score-0.704]
</p><p>24 Second, what can be said about the expected performance of a learned ranking function based on its empirical AUC on the training sequence from which it is learned? [sent-36, score-0.792]
</p><p>25 We address the ﬁrst question in this paper; the second question is addressed in [1]. [sent-37, score-0.046]
</p><p>26 We start by deﬁning the expected ranking accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function) in Section 2. [sent-38, score-1.285]
</p><p>27 Section 3 contains our large deviation result, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. [sent-39, score-1.092]
</p><p>28 Our conceptual approach in deriving the large deviation result for the AUC is similar to that of [9], in which large deviation properties of the average precision were considered. [sent-40, score-0.389]
</p><p>29 Section 4 compares our bound to a corresponding large deviation bound for the classiﬁcation error rate. [sent-41, score-0.499]
</p><p>30 A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes; this is described in Section 5. [sent-42, score-1.072]
</p><p>31 We shall ﬁnd it convenient to decompose a data sequence T = ((x1 , y1 ), . [sent-46, score-0.113]
</p><p>32 Several of our results will involve the conditional distribution DTX |TY =y for some label sequence y = (y1 , . [sent-56, score-0.168]
</p><p>33 2 As a ﬁnal note of 1 In [3], a slightly simpler form of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is used, which does not account for ties. [sent-63, score-0.023]
</p><p>34 2 Note that, since the AUC of a ranking function f with respect to a data sequence T ∈ (X × Y)N is independent of the ordering of examples in the sequence, our results involving the conditional distribution DTX |TY =y for some label sequence y = (y1 , . [sent-64, score-0.784]
</p><p>35 , yN ) ∈ Y N depend only on the number m of positive labels in y and the number n of negative labels in y. [sent-67, score-0.159]
</p><p>36 convention, we use T ∈ (X × Y)N to denote a general data sequence (e. [sent-72, score-0.093]
</p><p>37 , an independent test sequence), and S ∈ (X × Y)M to denote a training sequence. [sent-74, score-0.084]
</p><p>38 Deﬁne the expected ranking accuracy (or simply ranking accuracy) of f , denoted by A(f ), as follows: 1 A(f ) = EX∼D+1 ,X ∼D−1 I{f (X)>f (X )} + I{f (X)=f (X )} . [sent-77, score-1.134]
</p><p>39 2 The ranking accuracy A(f ) deﬁned above is simply the probability that an instance drawn randomly according to D+1 will be ranked higher by f than an instance drawn randomly according to D−1 , assuming that ties are broken uniformly at random. [sent-78, score-0.75]
</p><p>40 The following simple lemma shows that the empirical AUC of a ranking function f is an unbiased estimator of the expected ranking accuracy of f : Lemma 1. [sent-79, score-1.211]
</p><p>41 Let f : X →R be a ranking function on X , and let y = (y1 , . [sent-80, score-0.534]
</p><p>42 Let m be the number of positive labels in y, and n the number of negative labels in y. [sent-86, score-0.159]
</p><p>43 (1)) and linearity of expectation, we have ˆ ETX |TY =y A(f ; T ) =  1 mn  =  1 mn  {i:yi =+1} {j:yj =−1}  1 EXi ∼D+1 ,Xj ∼D−1 I{f (Xi )>f (Xj )} + I{f (Xi )=f (Xj )} 2 A(f )  {i:yi =+1} {j:yj =−1}  = A(f ) . [sent-88, score-0.146]
</p><p>44 3  Large Deviation Bound  We are interested in bounding the probability that the empirical AUC of a ranking function f with respect to a (random) test sequence T will have a large deviation from its expected ranking accuracy. [sent-89, score-1.434]
</p><p>45 Our main tool in deriving such a large deviation bound will be the following powerful concentration inequality of McDiarmid [10], which bounds the deviation of any function of a sample for which a single change in the sample has limited effect: Theorem 1 (McDiarmid, 1989). [sent-91, score-0.686]
</p><p>46 , XN be independent random variables with Xk taking values in a set Ak for each k. [sent-95, score-0.025]
</p><p>47 , XN are independent bounded random variables with Xk ∈ [ak , bk ] N with probability one and φ(X1 , . [sent-116, score-0.051]
</p><p>48 , XN ) = k=1 Xk , McDiarmid’s inequality (with ck = bk − ak ) reduces to Hoeffding’s inequality. [sent-119, score-0.167]
</p><p>49 Next we deﬁne the following quantity which appears in several of our results:  Deﬁnition 2 (Positive skew). [sent-120, score-0.024]
</p><p>50 , yN ) ∈ Y N be a ﬁnite label sequence of length N ∈ N. [sent-124, score-0.192]
</p><p>51 Deﬁne the positive skew of y, denoted by ρ(y), as follows: ρ(y)  =  1 N  1. [sent-125, score-0.144]
</p><p>52 Let f : X →R be a ﬁxed ranking function on X and let y = (y1 , . [sent-129, score-0.534]
</p><p>53 , yN ) ∈ Y N be any label sequence of length N ∈ N. [sent-132, score-0.192]
</p><p>54 Let m be the number of positive labels in y, and n the number of negative labels in y. [sent-135, score-0.159]
</p><p>55 , XN ) ∈ X N as a random vector; given the label sequence y, the random variables X1 , . [sent-139, score-0.168]
</p><p>56 Then, for each k such that yk = +1, we have the following for all xi , xk ∈ X : φ(x1 , . [sent-150, score-0.241]
</p><p>57 , xN ) =  1 mn  1 I{f (xk )>f (xj )} + I{f (xk )=f (xj )} 2  {j:yj =−1}  −  1 I{f (xk )>f (xj )} + I{f (xk )=f (xj )} 2 ≤ =  1 n mn 1 . [sent-159, score-0.146]
</p><p>58 m  Similarly, for each k such that yk = −1, one can show for all xi , xk ∈ X : φ(x1 , . [sent-160, score-0.241]
</p><p>59 n  Thus, taking ck = 1/m for k such that yk = +1 and ck = 1/n for k such that yk = −1, and applying McDiarmid’s theorem, we get for any > 0, ˆ ˆ A(f ; T ) − ETX |TY =y A(f ; T )  PTX |TY =y  ≤ 2e−2  ≥  2  1 1 /(m( m )2 +n( n )2 )  Now, from Lemma 1, ˆ ETX |TY =y A(f ; T )  = A(f ) . [sent-170, score-0.196]
</p><p>60 Also, we have 1 m( m )2  1 = 1 + n( n )2  1 m  1 +  1 n  =  mn = ρ(y)(1 − ρ(y))N . [sent-171, score-0.073]
</p><p>61 (2)  We note that the result of Theorem 2 can be strengthened so that the conditioning is only on the numbers m and n of positive and negative labels, and not on the speciﬁc label vector y. [sent-175, score-0.174]
</p><p>62 3 From Theorem 2, we can derive a conﬁdence interval interpretation of the bound that gives, for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, a conﬁdence interval based on the empirical AUC of a ranking function (on a random test sequence) which is likely to contain the true ranking accuracy with probability at least 1 − δ. [sent-176, score-1.373]
</p><p>63 Let f : X →R be a ﬁxed ranking function on X and let y = (y1 , . [sent-178, score-0.534]
</p><p>64 , yN ) ∈ Y N be any label sequence of length N ∈ N. [sent-181, score-0.192]
</p><p>65 Then for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, ln 2 δ 2ρ(y)(1 − ρ(y))N  ˆ A(f ; T ) − A(f ) ≥  PTX |TY =y  ≤ δ. [sent-182, score-0.074]
</p><p>66 2  = δ and solv-  Theorem 2 also allows us to obtain an expression for a test sample size that is sufﬁcient to obtain, for 0 < , δ ≤ 1, an -accurate estimate of the ranking accuracy with δ-conﬁdence: Corollary 2. [sent-185, score-0.746]
</p><p>67 Let f : X →R be a ﬁxed ranking function on X and let 0 < , δ ≤ 1. [sent-186, score-0.534]
</p><p>68 , yN ) ∈ Y N be any label sequence of length N ∈ N. [sent-190, score-0.192]
</p><p>69 2  ≤ δ and solv-  Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of the above expression for the sufﬁcient test sample size on the the accuracy parameter and positive skew ρ(y) for different values of δ. [sent-194, score-0.353]
</p><p>70 The conﬁdence interval of Corollary 1 can in fact be generalized to remove the conditioning on the label vector completely: Theorem 3. [sent-195, score-0.128]
</p><p>71 Let f : X →R be a ﬁxed ranking function on X and let N ∈ N. [sent-196, score-0.534]
</p><p>72 Then for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, PT ∼DN  ˆ A(f ; T ) − A(f ) ≥  ln 2 δ 2ρ(TY )(1 − ρ(TY ))N  ≤ δ. [sent-197, score-0.074]
</p><p>73 For T ∈ (X × Y)N and 0 < δ ≤ 1, deﬁne the proposition Φ(T, δ) ≡  ˆ A(f ; T ) − A(f ) ≥  ln 2 δ 2ρ(TY )(1 − ρ(TY ))N  Then for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, we have PT {Φ(T, δ)} = ET IΦ(T,δ) = ETY  ETX |TY =y IΦ(T,δ)  = ETY  PTX |TY =y {Φ(T, δ)}  ≤ ETY {δ} = δ. [sent-199, score-0.074]
</p><p>74 Figure 1: The test sample size N (based on Corollary 2) sufﬁcient to obtain an -accurate estimate of the ranking accuracy with δ-conﬁdence, for various values of the positive skew ρ ≡ ρ(y) for some label sequence y, for (left) δ = 0. [sent-202, score-1.038]
</p><p>75 Note that the above ‘trick’ works only once we have gone to a conﬁdence interval; an attempt to generalize the bound of Theorem 2 in a similar way gives an expression in which the ﬁnal expectation is not easy to evaluate. [sent-205, score-0.169]
</p><p>76 Interestingly, the above proof does not even require a factorized distribution DTY since it is built on a result for any ﬁxed label sequence y. [sent-206, score-0.168]
</p><p>77 4  Comparison with Large Deviation Bound for Error Rate  Our use of McDiarmid’s inequality in deriving the large deviation bound for the AUC of a ranking function is analogous to the use of Hoeffding’s inequality in deriving a large deviation bound for the error rate of a classiﬁcation function. [sent-208, score-1.429]
</p><p>78 The need for the more general inequality of McDiarmid in our derivations arises from the fact that the empirical AUC, unlike the empirical error rate, cannot be expressed as a sum of independent random variables. [sent-212, score-0.246]
</p><p>79 Given a classiﬁcation function h : X →Y, let L(h) denote the expected error rate of h: L(h) = EXY ∼D I{h(X)=Y } . [sent-213, score-0.187]
</p><p>80 Similarly, given a classiﬁcation function h : X →Y and a ﬁnite data sequence T = ˆ ((x1 , y1 ), . [sent-214, score-0.093]
</p><p>81 , (xN , yN )) ∈ (X × Y)N , let L(h; T ) denote the empirical error rate of h with respect to T : N 1 ˆ L(h; T ) = I{h(xi )=yi } . [sent-217, score-0.179]
</p><p>82 N i=1 Then the large deviation bound obtained via Hoeffding’s inequality for the classiﬁcation error rate states that for a ﬁxed classiﬁcation function h : X →Y and for any N ∈ N, > 0, 2 ˆ PT ∼DN L(h; T ) − L(h) ≥ ≤ 2e−2N . [sent-218, score-0.448]
</p><p>83 (3) to the bound of Theorem 2, we see that the AUC bound differs from the error rate bound by a factor of ρ(y)(1 − ρ(y)) in the exponent. [sent-220, score-0.554]
</p><p>84 For ρ(y) = 1/2, this means a sample size larger by a factor of 4; as the positive skew ρ(y) departs from 1/2, the factor grows larger (see Figure 2). [sent-222, score-0.259]
</p><p>85 Figure 2: The test sample size bound for the AUC, for positive skew ρ ≡ ρ(y) for some label sequence y, is larger than the corresponding test sample size bound for the classiﬁcation error rate by a factor of 1/(ρ(1 − ρ)). [sent-223, score-0.947]
</p><p>86 5  Bound for Learned Ranking Functions Chosen from Finite Classes  The large deviation result of Theorem 2 bounds the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. [sent-224, score-0.921]
</p><p>87 Let F be a ﬁnite class of real-valued functions on X and let fS ∈ F denote the ranking function chosen by a learning algorithm based on the training sequence S. [sent-227, score-0.646]
</p><p>88 , yM ) ∈ Y M be any label sequence of length M ∈ N. [sent-231, score-0.192]
</p><p>89 For any > 0, we have PSX |SY =y  ˆ A(fS ; S) − A(fS ) ≥  ˆ ≤ PSX |SY =y max A(f ; S) − A(f ) ≥ f ∈F  ≤  PSX |SY =y  ˆ A(f ; S) − A(f ) ≥  (by the union bound)  f ∈F  ≤ 2|F|e−2ρ(y)(1−ρ(y))M  2  (by Theorem 2) . [sent-234, score-0.05]
</p><p>90 As before, we can derive from Theorem 4 expressions for conﬁdence intervals and sufﬁcient training sample size. [sent-235, score-0.069]
</p><p>91 Under the assumptions of Theorem 4, for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, PSX |SY =y  ˆ A(fS ; S) − A(fS ) ≥  ln |F| + ln 2 δ 2ρ(y)(1 − ρ(y))M  ≤ δ. [sent-237, score-0.148]
</p><p>92 Under the assumptions of Theorem 4, for any 0 < , δ ≤ 1, if 1 2 ln |F| + ln , M ≥ 2ρ(y)(1 − ρ(y)) 2 δ  then PSX |SY =y  ˆ A(fS ; S) − A(fS ) ≥  ≤ δ. [sent-239, score-0.148]
</p><p>93 Let F be a ﬁnite class of real-valued functions on X and let fS ∈ F denote the ranking function chosen by a learning algorithm based on the training sequence S. [sent-241, score-0.646]
</p><p>94 Then for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, PS∼DM  6  ˆ A(fS ; S) − A(fS ) ≥  ln |F| + ln 2 δ 2ρ(SY )(1 − ρ(SY ))M  ≤ δ. [sent-243, score-0.148]
</p><p>95 Conclusion  We have derived a distribution-free large deviation bound for the area under the ROC curve (AUC), a quantity used as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. [sent-244, score-0.967]
</p><p>96 Our result parallels the classical large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate obtained via Hoeffding’s inequality. [sent-245, score-0.251]
</p><p>97 Since the AUC cannot be expressed as a sum of independent random variables, a more powerful inequality of McDiarmid was required. [sent-246, score-0.097]
</p><p>98 A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. [sent-248, score-1.072]
</p><p>99 A possible route for deriving an alternative large deviation bound for the AUC could be via the theory of U-statistics; the AUC can be expressed as a two-sample U-statistic, and therefore it may be possible to apply specialized results from U-statistic theory (see, for example, [5]) to the AUC.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-conﬁdence is larger than that required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function with the same conﬁdence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. 1</p><p>2 0.48843664 <a title="7-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2004-Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">45 nips-2004-Confidence Intervals for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, good ranking is a highly desirable performance for a classiﬁer. The criterion commonly used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To report it properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value. This paper provides conﬁdence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard conﬁdence intervals given in the case of the error rate. They are compared with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. 1 Motivation In many machine learning applications, the ranking quality of a classiﬁer is critical. For example, the ordering of the list of relevant documents returned by a search engine or a document classiﬁcation system is essential. The criterion widely used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under an ROC curve (AUC). But, to measure and report the AUC properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value as it is customary for the error rate and other measures. It is also important to make the computation of the conﬁdence interval practical by relying only on a small and simple number of parameters. In the case of the error rate, such intervals are often derived from just the sample size N . We present an extensive theoretical analysis of the AUC and show that a similar conﬁdence interval can be derived for its value using only simple parameters such as the error rate k/N , the number of positive examples m, and the number of negative examples n = N − m. Thus, our results extend to AUC the computation of conﬁdence intervals from a small number of readily available parameters. Our analysis is distribution-independent in the sense that it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The use of the error rate helps determine tight conﬁdence intervals. This contrasts with existing approaches presented in the statistical literature [11, 5, 2] which are based either on weak distribution-independent assumptions resulting in too loose conﬁdence intervals, or strong distribution-dependent assumptions leading to tight but unsafe conﬁdence intervals. We show that our results are of practical use. We also compare them with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. Our results are also useful for testing the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference of the AUC values of two classiﬁers. The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the deﬁnition of the AUC, its connection with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic (Section 2), and brieﬂy review some essential aspects of the existing literature related to the computation of conﬁdence intervals for the AUC. Our computation of the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate requires establishing several combinatorial identities. Section 4 presents some existing identities and gives the proof of novel ones useful for the computation of the variance. Section 5 gives the reduced expressions for the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate. These can be efﬁciently computed and used to determine our conﬁdence intervals for the AUC (Section 6). Section 7 reports the result of the comparison of our method with previous approaches, including empirical results for several standard tasks. 2 Deﬁnition and Properties of the AUC The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were originally introduced in signal detection theory [6] in connection with the study of radio signals, and have been used since then in many other applications, in particular for medical decision-making. Over the last few years, they have found increased interest in the machine learning and data mining communities for model evaluation and selection [14, 13, 7, 12, 16, 3]. The ROC curve for a binary classiﬁcation problem plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate. The points of the curve are obtained by sweeping the classiﬁcation threshold from the most positive classiﬁcation value to the most negative. For a fully random classiﬁcation, the ROC curve is a straight line connecting the origin to (1, 1). Any improvement over random classiﬁcation results in an ROC curve at least partially above this straight line. The AUC is deﬁned as the area under the ROC curve. Consider a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples. Let C be a ﬁxed classiﬁer that outputs a strictly ordered list for these examples. Let x1 , . . . , xm be the output of C on the positive examples and y1 , . . . , yn its output on the negative examples and denote by 1X the indicator function of a set X. Then, the AUC, A, associated to C is given by: A= m i=1 n j=1 1xi >yj (1) mn which is the value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [10]. Thus, the AUC is closely related to the ranking quality of the classiﬁcation. It can be viewed as a measure based on pairwise comparisons between classiﬁcations of the two classes. It is an estimate of the probability Pxy that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. With a perfect ranking, all positive examples are ranked higher than the negative ones and A = 1. Any deviation from this ranking decreases the AUC, and the expected AUC value for a random ranking is 0.5. 3 Overview of Related Work This section brieﬂy describes some previous distribution-dependent approaches presented in the statistical literature to derive conﬁdence intervals for the AUC and compares them to our method. The starting point for these analyses is a formula giving the variance of the AUC, A, for a ﬁxed distribution of the scores Px of the positive examples and Py of the negative examples [10, 1]: 2 σA = A(1 − A) + (m − 1)(Pxxy − A2 ) + (n − 1)(Pxyy − A2 ) mn (2) where Pxxy is the probability that the classiﬁer ranks two randomly chosen positive examples higher than a negative one, and Pxyy the probability that it ranks two randomly chosen negative examples lower than a positive one. To compute the variance exactly using Equation 2, the distributions Px and Py must be known. Hanley and McNeil [10] argue in favor of exponential distributions, loosely claiming that this upper-bounds the variance of normal distributions with various means and ratios of A 2A2 variances. They show that for exponential distributions Pxxy = 2−A and Pxyy = 1+A . The resulting conﬁdence intervals are of course relatively tight, but their validity is questionable since they are based on a strong assumption about the distributions of the positive and negative scores that may not hold in many cases. An alternative considered by several authors to the exact computation of the variance is to determine instead the maximum of the variance over all possible continuous distributions with the same expected value of the AUC. For all such distributions, one can ﬁx m and n and compute the expected AUC and its variance. The maximum variance is denoted by 2 σmax and is given by [5, 2]: 2 σmax = A(1 − A) 1 ≤ min {m, n} 4 min {m, n} (3) Unfortunately, this often yields loose conﬁdence intervals of limited practical use. Our approach for computing the mean and variance of the AUC is distribution-independent and inspired by the machine learning literature where analyses typically center on the error rate. We require only that the error rate be measured and compute the mean and variance of the AUC over all distributions Px and Py that maintain the same error rate. Our approach is in line with that of [5, 2] but it crucially avoids considering the maximum of the variance. We show that it is possible to compute directly the mean and variance of the AUC assigning equal weight to all the possible distributions. Of course, one could argue that not all distributions Px and Py are equally probable, but since these distributions are highly problem-dependent, we ﬁnd it risky to make any general assumption on the distributions and thereby limit the validity of our results. Our approach is further justiﬁed empirically by the experiments reported in the last section. 4 Combinatorial Analysis The analysis of the statistical properties of the AUC given a ﬁxed error rate requires various combinatorial calculations. This section describes several of the combinatorial identities that are used in our computation of the conﬁdence intervals. For all q ≥ 0, let Xq (k, m, n) be deﬁned by: k M M Xq (k, m, n) = xq (4) x x x=0 where M = m − (k − x) + x, M = n + (k − x) − x, and x = k − x. In previous work, we derived the following two identities which we used to compute the expected value of the AUC [4]: k X0 (k, m, n) = x=0 n+m+1 x k X1 (k, m, n) = (k − x)(m − n) + k n + m + 1 2 x x=0 To simplify the expression of the variance of the AUC, we need to compute X2 (k, m, n). Proposition 1 Let k, m, n be non-negative integers such that k ≤ min{m, n}, then: k X2 (k, m, n) = P2 (k, m, n, x) x=0 m+n+1 x (5) where P2 is the following 4th-degree polynomial: P2 (k, m, n, x) = (k − x)/12(−2x3 + 2x2 (2m − n + 2k − 4) + x(−3m2 + 3nm + 3m − 5km − 2k 2 + 2 + k + nk + 6n) + (3(k − 1)m2 − 3nm(k − 1) + 6km + 5m + k 2 m + 8n + 8 − 9nk + 3k + k 2 + k 2 n)). Proof. 5 The proof of the proposition is left to a longer version of this paper. Expectation and Variance of the AUC This section presents the expression of the expectation and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate k/N assuming that all classiﬁcations or rankings with k errors are equiprobable. For a given classiﬁcation, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false positive examples. Since the number of errors is ﬁxed, there are x = k − x false negative examples. The expression Xq discussed in the previous section represents the q-th moment of x over all classiﬁcations with exactly k errors. In previous work, we gave the exact expression of the expectation of the AUC for a ﬁxed number of errors k: Proposition 2 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the expected value of the AUC, A, over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: E[A] = 1 − k (n − m)2 (m + n + 1) − m+n 4mn k − m+n k−1 m+n x=0 x k m+n+1 x=0 x . Note that the two sums in this expression cannot be further simpliﬁed since they are known not to admit a closed form [9]. We also gave the expression of the variance of the AUC in terms of the function F deﬁned for all Y by: F (Y ) = k M M x=0 x x k M M x=0 x x Y . (6) The following proposition reproduces that result: Proposition 3 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = F ((1 − k−x x n+ m )2 ) 2 2 2 F ( mx +n(k−x) +(m(m+1)x+n(n+1)(k−x))−2x(k−x)(m+n+1) ). 12m2 n2 − F ((1 − k−x x n+ m 2 ))2 + Because of the products of binomial terms, the computation of the variance using this expression is inefﬁcient even for relatively small values of m and n. This expression can however be reduced using the identities presented in the previous section which leads to signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient computations that we have been using in all our experiments. Corollary 1 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with ((m+n−2)Z4 −(2m−n+3k−10)Z3 ) k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = (m+n+1)(m+n)(m+n−1)T72m2 n2 + (m+n+1)(m+n)T (m2 −nm+3km−5m+2k2 −nk+12−9k)Z2 48m2 n2 (m+n+1)Q1 Z1 kQ0 + 144m2 n2 with: 2 n2 72m Pk−i m+n+1−i Zi = x=0 Pk ( x=0 x (m+n+1) x ) − 2 (m+n+1)2 (m−n)4 Z1 16m2 n2 − , T = 3((m − n)2 + m + n) + 2, and: Q0 = (m + n + 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn + 3m + 1)T − 12(3mn + m + n) − 8)k + (−3m2 + 7m + 10n + 3nm + 10)T − 4(3mn + m + n + 1) Q1 = T k3 + 3(m − 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn − 3m + 8)T − 6(6mn + m + n))k + (−3m2 + 7(m + n) + 3mn)T − 2(6mn + m + n) Proof. The expression of the variance given in Proposition 3 requires the computation of Xq (k, m, n), q = 0, 1, 2. Using the identities giving the expressions of X0 and X1 and Proposition 1, which provides the expression of X2 , σ 2 (A) can be reduced to the expression given by the corollary. 6 Theory and Analysis Our estimate of the conﬁdence interval for the AUC is based on a simple and natural assumption. The main idea for its computation is the following. Assume that a conﬁdence interval E = [e1 , e2 ] is given for the error rate of a classiﬁer C over a sample S, with the conﬁdence level 1 − . This interval may have have been derived from a binomial model of C, which is a standard assumption for determining a conﬁdence interval for the error rate, or from any other model used to compute that interval. For a given error rate e ∈ E, or equivalently for a given number of misclassiﬁcations, we can use the expectation and variance computed in the previous section and Chebyshev’s inequality to predict a conﬁdence interval Ae for the AUC at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Since our equiprobable model for the classiﬁcations is independent of the model used to compute the interval of conﬁdence for the error rate, we can use E and Ae , e ∈ E, to compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC at the level (1 − )(1 − ). Theorem 1 Let C be a binary classiﬁer and let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n. Let E = [e1 , e2 ] be a conﬁdence interval for the error rate of C over S at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ) that depends only on , , m, n, and the interval E. Proof. Let k1 = N e1 and k2 = N e2 be the number of errors associated to the error rates e1 and e2 , and let IK be the interval IK = [k1 , k2 ]. For a ﬁxed k ∈ IK , by Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, we can compute the exact value of the expectation E[Ak ] and variance σ 2 (Ak ) of the AUC Ak . Using Chebyshev’s inequality, for any k ∈ IK and any k > 0, σ(Ak ) P |Ak − E[Ak ]| ≥ √ k ≤ (7) k where E[Ak ] and σ(Ak ) are the expressions given in Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, which depend only on k, m, and n. Let α1 and α2 be deﬁned by: α1 = min k∈IK σ(Ak ) E[Ak ] − √ σ(Ak ) α2 = max E[Ak ] + √ k∈IK k (8) k α1 and α2 only depend on IK (i.e., on e1 and e2 ), and on k, m, and n. Let IA be the conﬁdence interval deﬁned by IA = [α1 , α2 ] and let k = for all k ∈ IK . Using the fact that the conﬁdence interval E is independent of our equiprobability model for ﬁxed-k AUC values and the Bayes’ rule: P(A ∈ IA ) = k∈R+ ≥ k∈IK P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (9) P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (10) ≥ (1 − ) k∈IK P (K = k) ≥ (1 − )(1 − ) (11) where we used the property of Eq. 7 and the deﬁnitions of the intervals IK and IA . Thus, IA constitutes a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ). In practice, the conﬁdence interval E is often determined as a result of the assumption that C follows a binomial law. This leads to the following theorem. .020 .035 Standard deviation Standard deviation .030 .015 .010 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .005 .025 .020 .015 Max Distribution−dependent Distribution−independent .010 .005 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 0.6 0.7 0.8 AUC (a) 0.9 1.0 AUC (b) Figure 1: Comparison of the standard deviations for three different methods with: (a) m = n = 500; (b) m = 400 and n = 200. The curves are obtained by computing the expected AUC and its standard deviations for different values of the error rate using the maximum-variance approach (Eq. 3), our distribution-independent method, and the distribution-dependent approach of Hanley [10]. Theorem 2 Let C be a binary classiﬁer, let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n, and let k0 be the number of misclassiﬁcations of C on S. Assume that C follows a binomial law, then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on , k0 , m, and n. Proof. Assume that C follows a binomial law with coefﬁcient p. Then, Chebyshev’s inequality yields: 1 p(1 − p) ≤ (12) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2 Nη 4N η 2 1 1 Thus, E = [ k0 − √ √ , k0 + √ √ ] forms a conﬁdence interval for the N 2 (1− 1− )N N 2 √ (1− 1− )N error rate of C at the conﬁdence level 1 − . By Theorem 1, we can√ compute for the √ AUC value a conﬁdence interval at the level (1 − (1 − 1 − ))(1 − (1 − 1 − )) = 1 − depending only on , m, n, and the interval E, i.e., k0 , N = m + n, and . For large N , we can use the normal approximation of the binomial law to determine a ﬁner interval E. Indeed, for large N , √ (13) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2Φ(2 N η) with Φ(u) = ∞ e−x2 /2 √ dx. u 2π Thus, E = [ k0 − N √ Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) k0 √ ,N 2 N √ conﬁdence interval for the error rate at the conﬁdence level √ + Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) √ ] 2 N is the 1− . For simplicity, in the proof of Theorem 2, k was chosen to be a constant ( k = ) but, in general, it can be another function of k leading to tighter conﬁdence intervals. The results presented in the next section were obtained with k = a0 exp((k − k0 )2 /2a2 ), where a0 1 and a1 are constants selected so that the inequality 11 be veriﬁed. 7 Experiments and Comparisons The analysis in the previous section provides a principled method for computing a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of a classier C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on k, n and m. As already discussed, other expressions found in the statistical literature lead to either too loose or unsafely narrow conﬁdence intervals based on questionable assumptions on the probability functions Px and Py [10, 15].

(2) with the values of A, Pxxy , and Pxyy derived from data. σdep is the distribution-dependent standard deviation of Hanley [10], which is based on assumptions that may not always hold. σmax is deﬁned by Eq. (3). All results were obtained on a randomly selected test set of size m + n. various error rates. For m = n = 500, our distribution-independent method consistently leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1 (a)). It also leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals for AUC values more than .75 for the uneven distribution m = 400 and n = 200 (Fig. 1 (b)). For lower AUC values, the distribution-dependent approach produces tighter intervals, but its underlying assumptions may not hold. A different comparison was made using several datasets available from the UC Irvine repository (Table 1). The table shows that our estimates of the standard deviations (σindep ) are in general close to or tighter than the distribution-dependent standard deviation σdep of Hanley [10]. This is despite we do not make any assumption about the distributions of positive and negative examples. In contrast, Hanley’s method is based on speciﬁc assumptions about these distributions. Plots of the actual ranking distribution demonstrate that these assumptions are often violated however. Thus, the relatively good performance of Hanley’s approach on several data sets can be viewed as fortuitous and is not general. Our distribution-independent method provides tight conﬁdence intervals, in some cases tighter than those derived from σA , in particular because it exploits the information provided by the error rate. Our analysis can also be used to determine if the AUC values produced by two classiﬁers are statistically signiﬁcant by checking if the AUC value of one falls within the conﬁdence interval of the other. 8 Conclusion We presented principled techniques for computing useful conﬁdence intervals for the AUC from simple parameters: the error rate, and the negative and positive sample sizes. We demonstrated the practicality of these conﬁdence intervals by comparing them to previous approaches in several tasks. We also derived the exact expression of the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed k, which can be of interest in other analyses related to the AUC. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is a general measure of the quality of a ranking that is an estimate of the probability that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. One could argue that accuracy at the top or the bottom of the ranking is of higher importance. This, however, contrarily to some belief, is already captured to a certain degree by the deﬁnition of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic which penalizes more errors at the top or the bottom of the ranking. It is however an interesting research problem to determine how to incorporate this bias in a stricter way in the form of a score-speciﬁc weight in the ranking measure, a weighted WilcoxonMann-Whitney statistic, or how to compute the corresponding expected value and standard deviation in a general way and design machine learning algorithms to optimize such a mea- sure. A preliminary analysis suggests, however, that the calculation of the expectation and the variance are likely to be extremely complex in that case. Finally, it could also be interesting but difﬁcult to adapt our results to the distribution-dependent case and compare them to those of [10].

<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting multiclass problems can be cast in the general framework of label ranking deﬁned on a given set of classes. The evaluation for such a ranking is generally given in terms of the number of violated order constraints between classes. In this paper, we propose the Preference Learning Model as a unifying framework to model and solve a large class of multiclass problems in a large margin perspective. In addition, an original kernel-based method is proposed and evaluated on a ranking dataset with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>4 0.13701141 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Result_Analysis_of_the_NIPS_2003_Feature_Selection_Challenge.html">156 nips-2004-Result Analysis of the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge</a></p>
<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Steve Gunn, Asa Ben-Hur, Gideon Dror</p><p>Abstract: The NIPS 2003 workshops included a feature selection competition organized by the authors. We provided participants with ﬁve datasets from diﬀerent application domains and called for classiﬁcation results using a minimal number of features. The competition took place over a period of 13 weeks and attracted 78 research groups. Participants were asked to make on-line submissions on the validation and test sets, with performance on the validation set being presented immediately to the participant and performance on the test set presented to the participants at the workshop. In total 1863 entries were made on the validation sets during the development period and 135 entries on all test sets for the ﬁnal competition. The winners used a combination of Bayesian neural networks with ARD priors and Dirichlet diﬀusion trees. Other top entries used a variety of methods for feature selection, which combined ﬁlters and/or wrapper or embedded methods using Random Forests, kernel methods, or neural networks as a classiﬁcation engine. The results of the benchmark (including the predictions made by the participants and the features they selected) and the scoring software are publicly available. The benchmark is available at www.nipsfsc.ecs.soton.ac.uk for post-challenge submissions to stimulate further research. 1</p><p>5 0.1167357 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_on_Directed_Graphs.html">165 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning on Directed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Thomas Hofmann, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graph in which some of the nodes are labeled, we investigate the question of how to exploit the link structure of the graph to infer the labels of the remaining unlabeled nodes. To that extent we propose a regularization framework for functions deﬁned over nodes of a directed graph that forces the classiﬁcation function to change slowly on densely linked subgraphs. A powerful, yet computationally simple classiﬁcation algorithm is derived within the proposed framework. The experimental evaluation on real-world Web classiﬁcation problems demonstrates encouraging results that validate our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.10919054 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Trait_Selection_for_Assessing_Beef_Meat_Quality_Using_Non-linear_SVM.html">195 nips-2004-Trait Selection for Assessing Beef Meat Quality Using Non-linear SVM</a></p>

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-conﬁdence is larger than that required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function with the same conﬁdence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. 1</p><p>2 0.92874497 <a title="7-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">45 nips-2004-Confidence Intervals for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, good ranking is a highly desirable performance for a classiﬁer. The criterion commonly used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To report it properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value. This paper provides conﬁdence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard conﬁdence intervals given in the case of the error rate. They are compared with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. 1 Motivation In many machine learning applications, the ranking quality of a classiﬁer is critical. For example, the ordering of the list of relevant documents returned by a search engine or a document classiﬁcation system is essential. The criterion widely used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm is the area under an ROC curve (AUC). But, to measure and report the AUC properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of conﬁdence for its value as it is customary for the error rate and other measures. It is also important to make the computation of the conﬁdence interval practical by relying only on a small and simple number of parameters. In the case of the error rate, such intervals are often derived from just the sample size N . We present an extensive theoretical analysis of the AUC and show that a similar conﬁdence interval can be derived for its value using only simple parameters such as the error rate k/N , the number of positive examples m, and the number of negative examples n = N − m. Thus, our results extend to AUC the computation of conﬁdence intervals from a small number of readily available parameters. Our analysis is distribution-independent in the sense that it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The use of the error rate helps determine tight conﬁdence intervals. This contrasts with existing approaches presented in the statistical literature [11, 5, 2] which are based either on weak distribution-independent assumptions resulting in too loose conﬁdence intervals, or strong distribution-dependent assumptions leading to tight but unsafe conﬁdence intervals. We show that our results are of practical use. We also compare them with previous approaches in several standard classiﬁcation tasks demonstrating the beneﬁts of our analysis. Our results are also useful for testing the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference of the AUC values of two classiﬁers. The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the deﬁnition of the AUC, its connection with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic (Section 2), and brieﬂy review some essential aspects of the existing literature related to the computation of conﬁdence intervals for the AUC. Our computation of the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate requires establishing several combinatorial identities. Section 4 presents some existing identities and gives the proof of novel ones useful for the computation of the variance. Section 5 gives the reduced expressions for the expected value and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate. These can be efﬁciently computed and used to determine our conﬁdence intervals for the AUC (Section 6). Section 7 reports the result of the comparison of our method with previous approaches, including empirical results for several standard tasks. 2 Deﬁnition and Properties of the AUC The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were originally introduced in signal detection theory [6] in connection with the study of radio signals, and have been used since then in many other applications, in particular for medical decision-making. Over the last few years, they have found increased interest in the machine learning and data mining communities for model evaluation and selection [14, 13, 7, 12, 16, 3]. The ROC curve for a binary classiﬁcation problem plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate. The points of the curve are obtained by sweeping the classiﬁcation threshold from the most positive classiﬁcation value to the most negative. For a fully random classiﬁcation, the ROC curve is a straight line connecting the origin to (1, 1). Any improvement over random classiﬁcation results in an ROC curve at least partially above this straight line. The AUC is deﬁned as the area under the ROC curve. Consider a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples. Let C be a ﬁxed classiﬁer that outputs a strictly ordered list for these examples. Let x1 , . . . , xm be the output of C on the positive examples and y1 , . . . , yn its output on the negative examples and denote by 1X the indicator function of a set X. Then, the AUC, A, associated to C is given by: A= m i=1 n j=1 1xi >yj (1) mn which is the value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [10]. Thus, the AUC is closely related to the ranking quality of the classiﬁcation. It can be viewed as a measure based on pairwise comparisons between classiﬁcations of the two classes. It is an estimate of the probability Pxy that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. With a perfect ranking, all positive examples are ranked higher than the negative ones and A = 1. Any deviation from this ranking decreases the AUC, and the expected AUC value for a random ranking is 0.5. 3 Overview of Related Work This section brieﬂy describes some previous distribution-dependent approaches presented in the statistical literature to derive conﬁdence intervals for the AUC and compares them to our method. The starting point for these analyses is a formula giving the variance of the AUC, A, for a ﬁxed distribution of the scores Px of the positive examples and Py of the negative examples [10, 1]: 2 σA = A(1 − A) + (m − 1)(Pxxy − A2 ) + (n − 1)(Pxyy − A2 ) mn (2) where Pxxy is the probability that the classiﬁer ranks two randomly chosen positive examples higher than a negative one, and Pxyy the probability that it ranks two randomly chosen negative examples lower than a positive one. To compute the variance exactly using Equation 2, the distributions Px and Py must be known. Hanley and McNeil [10] argue in favor of exponential distributions, loosely claiming that this upper-bounds the variance of normal distributions with various means and ratios of A 2A2 variances. They show that for exponential distributions Pxxy = 2−A and Pxyy = 1+A . The resulting conﬁdence intervals are of course relatively tight, but their validity is questionable since they are based on a strong assumption about the distributions of the positive and negative scores that may not hold in many cases. An alternative considered by several authors to the exact computation of the variance is to determine instead the maximum of the variance over all possible continuous distributions with the same expected value of the AUC. For all such distributions, one can ﬁx m and n and compute the expected AUC and its variance. The maximum variance is denoted by 2 σmax and is given by [5, 2]: 2 σmax = A(1 − A) 1 ≤ min {m, n} 4 min {m, n} (3) Unfortunately, this often yields loose conﬁdence intervals of limited practical use. Our approach for computing the mean and variance of the AUC is distribution-independent and inspired by the machine learning literature where analyses typically center on the error rate. We require only that the error rate be measured and compute the mean and variance of the AUC over all distributions Px and Py that maintain the same error rate. Our approach is in line with that of [5, 2] but it crucially avoids considering the maximum of the variance. We show that it is possible to compute directly the mean and variance of the AUC assigning equal weight to all the possible distributions. Of course, one could argue that not all distributions Px and Py are equally probable, but since these distributions are highly problem-dependent, we ﬁnd it risky to make any general assumption on the distributions and thereby limit the validity of our results. Our approach is further justiﬁed empirically by the experiments reported in the last section. 4 Combinatorial Analysis The analysis of the statistical properties of the AUC given a ﬁxed error rate requires various combinatorial calculations. This section describes several of the combinatorial identities that are used in our computation of the conﬁdence intervals. For all q ≥ 0, let Xq (k, m, n) be deﬁned by: k M M Xq (k, m, n) = xq (4) x x x=0 where M = m − (k − x) + x, M = n + (k − x) − x, and x = k − x. In previous work, we derived the following two identities which we used to compute the expected value of the AUC [4]: k X0 (k, m, n) = x=0 n+m+1 x k X1 (k, m, n) = (k − x)(m − n) + k n + m + 1 2 x x=0 To simplify the expression of the variance of the AUC, we need to compute X2 (k, m, n). Proposition 1 Let k, m, n be non-negative integers such that k ≤ min{m, n}, then: k X2 (k, m, n) = P2 (k, m, n, x) x=0 m+n+1 x (5) where P2 is the following 4th-degree polynomial: P2 (k, m, n, x) = (k − x)/12(−2x3 + 2x2 (2m − n + 2k − 4) + x(−3m2 + 3nm + 3m − 5km − 2k 2 + 2 + k + nk + 6n) + (3(k − 1)m2 − 3nm(k − 1) + 6km + 5m + k 2 m + 8n + 8 − 9nk + 3k + k 2 + k 2 n)). Proof. 5 The proof of the proposition is left to a longer version of this paper. Expectation and Variance of the AUC This section presents the expression of the expectation and variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate k/N assuming that all classiﬁcations or rankings with k errors are equiprobable. For a given classiﬁcation, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false positive examples. Since the number of errors is ﬁxed, there are x = k − x false negative examples. The expression Xq discussed in the previous section represents the q-th moment of x over all classiﬁcations with exactly k errors. In previous work, we gave the exact expression of the expectation of the AUC for a ﬁxed number of errors k: Proposition 2 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the expected value of the AUC, A, over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: E[A] = 1 − k (n − m)2 (m + n + 1) − m+n 4mn k − m+n k−1 m+n x=0 x k m+n+1 x=0 x . Note that the two sums in this expression cannot be further simpliﬁed since they are known not to admit a closed form [9]. We also gave the expression of the variance of the AUC in terms of the function F deﬁned for all Y by: F (Y ) = k M M x=0 x x k M M x=0 x x Y . (6) The following proposition reproduces that result: Proposition 3 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = F ((1 − k−x x n+ m )2 ) 2 2 2 F ( mx +n(k−x) +(m(m+1)x+n(n+1)(k−x))−2x(k−x)(m+n+1) ). 12m2 n2 − F ((1 − k−x x n+ m 2 ))2 + Because of the products of binomial terms, the computation of the variance using this expression is inefﬁcient even for relatively small values of m and n. This expression can however be reduced using the identities presented in the previous section which leads to signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient computations that we have been using in all our experiments. Corollary 1 ([4]) Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the variance of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with ((m+n−2)Z4 −(2m−n+3k−10)Z3 ) k errors is given by: σ 2 (A) = (m+n+1)(m+n)(m+n−1)T72m2 n2 + (m+n+1)(m+n)T (m2 −nm+3km−5m+2k2 −nk+12−9k)Z2 48m2 n2 (m+n+1)Q1 Z1 kQ0 + 144m2 n2 with: 2 n2 72m Pk−i m+n+1−i Zi = x=0 Pk ( x=0 x (m+n+1) x ) − 2 (m+n+1)2 (m−n)4 Z1 16m2 n2 − , T = 3((m − n)2 + m + n) + 2, and: Q0 = (m + n + 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn + 3m + 1)T − 12(3mn + m + n) − 8)k + (−3m2 + 7m + 10n + 3nm + 10)T − 4(3mn + m + n + 1) Q1 = T k3 + 3(m − 1)T k2 + ((−3n2 + 3mn − 3m + 8)T − 6(6mn + m + n))k + (−3m2 + 7(m + n) + 3mn)T − 2(6mn + m + n) Proof. The expression of the variance given in Proposition 3 requires the computation of Xq (k, m, n), q = 0, 1, 2. Using the identities giving the expressions of X0 and X1 and Proposition 1, which provides the expression of X2 , σ 2 (A) can be reduced to the expression given by the corollary. 6 Theory and Analysis Our estimate of the conﬁdence interval for the AUC is based on a simple and natural assumption. The main idea for its computation is the following. Assume that a conﬁdence interval E = [e1 , e2 ] is given for the error rate of a classiﬁer C over a sample S, with the conﬁdence level 1 − . This interval may have have been derived from a binomial model of C, which is a standard assumption for determining a conﬁdence interval for the error rate, or from any other model used to compute that interval. For a given error rate e ∈ E, or equivalently for a given number of misclassiﬁcations, we can use the expectation and variance computed in the previous section and Chebyshev’s inequality to predict a conﬁdence interval Ae for the AUC at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Since our equiprobable model for the classiﬁcations is independent of the model used to compute the interval of conﬁdence for the error rate, we can use E and Ae , e ∈ E, to compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC at the level (1 − )(1 − ). Theorem 1 Let C be a binary classiﬁer and let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n. Let E = [e1 , e2 ] be a conﬁdence interval for the error rate of C over S at the conﬁdence level 1 − . Then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ) that depends only on , , m, n, and the interval E. Proof. Let k1 = N e1 and k2 = N e2 be the number of errors associated to the error rates e1 and e2 , and let IK be the interval IK = [k1 , k2 ]. For a ﬁxed k ∈ IK , by Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, we can compute the exact value of the expectation E[Ak ] and variance σ 2 (Ak ) of the AUC Ak . Using Chebyshev’s inequality, for any k ∈ IK and any k > 0, σ(Ak ) P |Ak − E[Ak ]| ≥ √ k ≤ (7) k where E[Ak ] and σ(Ak ) are the expressions given in Propositions 2 and Corollary 1, which depend only on k, m, and n. Let α1 and α2 be deﬁned by: α1 = min k∈IK σ(Ak ) E[Ak ] − √ σ(Ak ) α2 = max E[Ak ] + √ k∈IK k (8) k α1 and α2 only depend on IK (i.e., on e1 and e2 ), and on k, m, and n. Let IA be the conﬁdence interval deﬁned by IA = [α1 , α2 ] and let k = for all k ∈ IK . Using the fact that the conﬁdence interval E is independent of our equiprobability model for ﬁxed-k AUC values and the Bayes’ rule: P(A ∈ IA ) = k∈R+ ≥ k∈IK P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (9) P (A ∈ IA | K = k)P (K = k) (10) ≥ (1 − ) k∈IK P (K = k) ≥ (1 − )(1 − ) (11) where we used the property of Eq. 7 and the deﬁnitions of the intervals IK and IA . Thus, IA constitutes a conﬁdence interval for the AUC value of C at the conﬁdence level (1 − )(1 − ). In practice, the conﬁdence interval E is often determined as a result of the assumption that C follows a binomial law.

Theorem 2 Let C be a binary classiﬁer, let S be a data sample of size N with m positive examples and n negative examples, N = m + n, and let k0 be the number of misclassiﬁcations of C on S. Assume that C follows a binomial law, then, for any , 0 ≤ ≤ 1, we can compute a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of the classiﬁer C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on , k0 , m, and n. Proof. Assume that C follows a binomial law with coefﬁcient p. Then, Chebyshev’s inequality yields: 1 p(1 − p) ≤ (12) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2 Nη 4N η 2 1 1 Thus, E = [ k0 − √ √ , k0 + √ √ ] forms a conﬁdence interval for the N 2 (1− 1− )N N 2 √ (1− 1− )N error rate of C at the conﬁdence level 1 − . By Theorem 1, we can√ compute for the √ AUC value a conﬁdence interval at the level (1 − (1 − 1 − ))(1 − (1 − 1 − )) = 1 − depending only on , m, n, and the interval E, i.e., k0 , N = m + n, and . For large N , we can use the normal approximation of the binomial law to determine a ﬁner interval E. Indeed, for large N , √ (13) P(|C − E[C]| ≥ η) ≤ 2Φ(2 N η) with Φ(u) = ∞ e−x2 /2 √ dx. u 2π Thus, E = [ k0 − N √ Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) k0 √ ,N 2 N √ conﬁdence interval for the error rate at the conﬁdence level √ + Φ−1 ( 1− 21− ) √ ] 2 N is the 1− . For simplicity, in the proof of Theorem 2, k was chosen to be a constant ( k = ) but, in general, it can be another function of k leading to tighter conﬁdence intervals. The results presented in the next section were obtained with k = a0 exp((k − k0 )2 /2a2 ), where a0 1 and a1 are constants selected so that the inequality 11 be veriﬁed. 7 Experiments and Comparisons The analysis in the previous section provides a principled method for computing a conﬁdence interval of the AUC value of a classier C at the conﬁdence level 1 − that depends only on k, n and m. As already discussed, other expressions found in the statistical literature lead to either too loose or unsafely narrow conﬁdence intervals based on questionable assumptions on the probability functions Px and Py [10, 15].

(2) with the values of A, Pxxy , and Pxyy derived from data. σdep is the distribution-dependent standard deviation of Hanley [10], which is based on assumptions that may not always hold. σmax is deﬁned by Eq. (3). All results were obtained on a randomly selected test set of size m + n. various error rates. For m = n = 500, our distribution-independent method consistently leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1 (a)). It also leads to tighter conﬁdence intervals for AUC values more than .75 for the uneven distribution m = 400 and n = 200 (Fig. 1 (b)). For lower AUC values, the distribution-dependent approach produces tighter intervals, but its underlying assumptions may not hold. A different comparison was made using several datasets available from the UC Irvine repository (Table 1). The table shows that our estimates of the standard deviations (σindep ) are in general close to or tighter than the distribution-dependent standard deviation σdep of Hanley [10]. This is despite we do not make any assumption about the distributions of positive and negative examples. In contrast, Hanley’s method is based on speciﬁc assumptions about these distributions. Plots of the actual ranking distribution demonstrate that these assumptions are often violated however. Thus, the relatively good performance of Hanley’s approach on several data sets can be viewed as fortuitous and is not general. Our distribution-independent method provides tight conﬁdence intervals, in some cases tighter than those derived from σA , in particular because it exploits the information provided by the error rate. Our analysis can also be used to determine if the AUC values produced by two classiﬁers are statistically signiﬁcant by checking if the AUC value of one falls within the conﬁdence interval of the other. 8 Conclusion We presented principled techniques for computing useful conﬁdence intervals for the AUC from simple parameters: the error rate, and the negative and positive sample sizes. We demonstrated the practicality of these conﬁdence intervals by comparing them to previous approaches in several tasks. We also derived the exact expression of the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed k, which can be of interest in other analyses related to the AUC. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is a general measure of the quality of a ranking that is an estimate of the probability that the classiﬁer ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a negative example. One could argue that accuracy at the top or the bottom of the ranking is of higher importance. This, however, contrarily to some belief, is already captured to a certain degree by the deﬁnition of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic which penalizes more errors at the top or the bottom of the ranking. It is however an interesting research problem to determine how to incorporate this bias in a stricter way in the form of a score-speciﬁc weight in the ranking measure, a weighted WilcoxonMann-Whitney statistic, or how to compute the corresponding expected value and standard deviation in a general way and design machine learning algorithms to optimize such a mea- sure. A preliminary analysis suggests, however, that the calculation of the expectation and the variance are likely to be extremely complex in that case. Finally, it could also be interesting but difﬁcult to adapt our results to the distribution-dependent case and compare them to those of [10].

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Steve Gunn, Asa Ben-Hur, Gideon Dror</p><p>Abstract: The NIPS 2003 workshops included a feature selection competition organized by the authors. We provided participants with ﬁve datasets from diﬀerent application domains and called for classiﬁcation results using a minimal number of features. The competition took place over a period of 13 weeks and attracted 78 research groups. Participants were asked to make on-line submissions on the validation and test sets, with performance on the validation set being presented immediately to the participant and performance on the test set presented to the participants at the workshop. In total 1863 entries were made on the validation sets during the development period and 135 entries on all test sets for the ﬁnal competition. The winners used a combination of Bayesian neural networks with ARD priors and Dirichlet diﬀusion trees. Other top entries used a variety of methods for feature selection, which combined ﬁlters and/or wrapper or embedded methods using Random Forests, kernel methods, or neural networks as a classiﬁcation engine. The results of the benchmark (including the predictions made by the participants and the features they selected) and the scoring software are publicly available. The benchmark is available at www.nipsfsc.ecs.soton.ac.uk for post-challenge submissions to stimulate further research. 1</p><p>4 0.44764099 <a title="7-lsi-4" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Preferences_for_Multiclass_Problems.html">100 nips-2004-Learning Preferences for Multiclass Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting multiclass problems can be cast in the general framework of label ranking deﬁned on a given set of classes. The evaluation for such a ranking is generally given in terms of the number of violated order constraints between classes. In this paper, we propose the Preference Learning Model as a unifying framework to model and solve a large class of multiclass problems in a large margin perspective. In addition, an original kernel-based method is proposed and evaluated on a ranking dataset with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>5 0.43349877 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_on_Directed_Graphs.html">165 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning on Directed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Thomas Hofmann, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graph in which some of the nodes are labeled, we investigate the question of how to exploit the link structure of the graph to infer the labels of the remaining unlabeled nodes. To that extent we propose a regularization framework for functions deﬁned over nodes of a directed graph that forces the classiﬁcation function to change slowly on densely linked subgraphs. A powerful, yet computationally simple classiﬁcation algorithm is derived within the proposed framework. The experimental evaluation on real-world Web classiﬁcation problems demonstrates encouraging results that validate our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.38285232 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Trait_Selection_for_Assessing_Beef_Meat_Quality_Using_Non-linear_SVM.html">195 nips-2004-Trait Selection for Assessing Beef Meat Quality Using Non-linear SVM</a></p>

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classiﬁcation error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-conﬁdence is larger than that required to obtain an -accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function with the same conﬁdence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from ﬁnite function classes. 1</p><p>2 0.81495738 <a title="7-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Analysis_of_a_greedy_active_learning_strategy.html">23 nips-2004-Analysis of a greedy active learning strategy</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael Collins, Ben Taskar, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of structured classiﬁcation, where the task is to predict a label y from an input x, and y has meaningful internal structure. Our framework includes supervised training of Markov random ﬁelds and weighted context-free grammars as special cases. We describe an algorithm that solves the large-margin optimization problem deﬁned in [12], using an exponential-family (Gibbs distribution) representation of structured objects. The algorithm is efﬁcient—even in cases where the number of labels y is exponential in size—provided that certain expectations under Gibbs distributions can be calculated efﬁciently. The method for structured labels relies on a more general result, speciﬁcally the application of exponentiated gradient updates [7, 8] to quadratic programs. 1</p><p>4 0.66691458 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-The_Power_of_Selective_Memory%3A_Self-Bounded_Learning_of_Prediction_Suffix_Trees.html">189 nips-2004-The Power of Selective Memory: Self-Bounded Learning of Prediction Suffix Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Prediction sufﬁx trees (PST) provide a popular and effective tool for tasks such as compression, classiﬁcation, and language modeling. In this paper we take a decision theoretic view of PSTs for the task of sequence prediction. Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a loss bound for it. The depth of the PST generated by this algorithm scales linearly with the length of the input. We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm which automatically grows a bounded-depth PST. We also prove an analogous mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm. The result is an efﬁcient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any ﬁxed PST determined in hindsight. 1</p><p>5 0.6653018 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Selective_Sampling_for_Linear-Threshold_Algorithms.html">206 nips-2004-Worst-Case Analysis of Selective Sampling for Linear-Threshold Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We provide a worst-case analysis of selective sampling algorithms for learning linear threshold functions. The algorithms considered in this paper are Perceptron-like algorithms, i.e., algorithms which can be efﬁciently run in any reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our algorithms exploit a simple margin-based randomized rule to decide whether to query the current label. We obtain selective sampling algorithms achieving on average the same bounds as those proven for their deterministic counterparts, but using much fewer labels. We complement our theoretical ﬁndings with an empirical comparison on two text categorization tasks. The outcome of these experiments is largely predicted by our theoretical results: Our selective sampling algorithms tend to perform as good as the algorithms receiving the true label after each classiﬁcation, while observing in practice substantially fewer labels. 1</p><p>6 0.65237635 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Assignment_of_Multiplicative_Mixtures_in_Natural_Images.html">25 nips-2004-Assignment of Multiplicative Mixtures in Natural Images</a></p>

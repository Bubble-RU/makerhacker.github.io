</p><p>5 The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically ﬁll in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different conﬁguration. [sent-7, score-0.513]
</p><p>6 We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of signiﬁcant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. [sent-8, score-0.425]

</p><p>8 The main difﬁculty in the 3D registration problem is determining the correspondences of points on one surface to points on the other. [sent-13, score-0.893]
</p><p>9 Local regions on the surface are rarely distinctive enough to determine the correct correspondence, whether because of noise in the scans, or because of symmetries in the object shape. [sent-14, score-0.387]
</p><p>10 Determining the correspondence for all object points results in a combinatorially large search problem. [sent-16, score-0.451]
</p><p>11 B) Illustration of the link deformation process C) The CC algorithm which uses only deformation potentials can violate mesh geometry. [sent-23, score-0.982]
</p><p>12 registration make the problem tractable by assuming signiﬁcant prior knowledge about the objects being registered. [sent-25, score-0.439]
</p><p>13 Some rely on the presence of markers on the object [1, 20], while others assume prior knowledge about the object dynamics [16], or about the space of nonrigid deformations [15, 5]. [sent-26, score-0.654]
</p><p>14 However, this approximation is only good in the case when the object deformation is small; otherwise, it results in poor local maxima as nearby points in one scan are allowed to map to far-away points in the other. [sent-28, score-0.777]
</p><p>15 Our algorithm deﬁnes a joint probabilistic model over all correspondences, which explicitly model the correlations between them — speciﬁcally, that nearby points in one mesh should map to nearby points in the other. [sent-29, score-0.756]
</p><p>16 We deﬁne a probabilistic model over the set of correspondences, that encodes these geodesic distance constraints as well as penalties for link twisting and stretching, and high-level local surface features [14]. [sent-31, score-0.529]
</p><p>17 The result is a registration that respects the surface geometry. [sent-33, score-0.585]
</p><p>18 Moreover, unlike many methods, our algorithm can be used to register a partial scan to a complete model, greatly increasing its applicability. [sent-35, score-0.387]
</p><p>19 We apply our approach to three datasets containing 3D scans of a wooden puppet, a human arm and entire human bodies in different conﬁgurations. [sent-36, score-0.37]
</p><p>20 We demonstrate good registration results for scan pairs exhibiting articulated motion, non-rigid deformations, or both. [sent-37, score-0.812]
</p><p>21 In our ﬁrst application, we show how a partial scan of an object can be registered onto a fully speciﬁed model in a different conﬁguration. [sent-39, score-0.504]
</p><p>22 The resulting registration allows us to use the model to “complete” the partial scan in a way that preserves the local surface geometry. [sent-40, score-0.898]
</p><p>23 In our ﬁnal application, we use a set of registered scans of the same object in different positions to recover a decomposition of the object into approximately rigid parts, and recover an articulated skeleton linking the parts. [sent-42, score-0.806]
</p><p>24 These results demonstrate the value of a high-quality solution to the registration problem to a range of graphics tasks. [sent-44, score-0.453]
</p><p>25 2  Previous Work  Surface registration is a fundamental building block in computer graphics. [sent-45, score-0.403]
</p><p>26 The classical solution for registering rigid surfaces is the Iterative Closest Point algorithm (ICP) [4, 6, 17]. [sent-46, score-0.299]
</p><p>27 The links between adjacent points on the surface can be thought of as springs, which are allowed to deform at a cost. [sent-49, score-0.35]
</p><p>28 The step estimating the correspondences assumes that a good estimate of the nonrigid transformation Θ is available. [sent-51, score-0.368]
</p><p>29 Under this assumption, the assignments to the correspondence variables become decorrelated: each point in the second scan is associated with the nearest point (in the Euclidean distance sense) in the deformed template scan. [sent-52, score-0.51]
</p><p>30 By assigning points in the second scan to points on the deformed model independently, nearby points in the scan can get associated to remote points in the model if the estimate of Θ is poor (Fig. [sent-54, score-0.738]
</p><p>31 In the 3D case, this framework is used for detection of articulated object models in images [13, 22, 19]. [sent-58, score-0.361]
</p><p>32 The algorithms assume the decomposition of the object into a relatively small number of parts is known, and that a detector for each object part is available. [sent-59, score-0.389]
</p><p>33 The model mesh X = (V X , E X ) is a complete model of the object, in a particular pose. [sent-63, score-0.483]
</p><p>34 , xN ) denotes the mesh points, while E X is the set of links between adjacent points on the mesh surface. [sent-67, score-1.066]
</p><p>35 The data mesh Z = (V Z , E Z ) is either a complete model or a partial view of the object in a different conﬁguration. [sent-68, score-0.742]
</p><p>36 Each data mesh point z k is associated with a correspondence variable ck , specifying the corresponding model mesh point. [sent-69, score-1.237]
</p><p>37 The task of registration is one of estimating the set of all correspondences C and a non-rigid transformation Θ which aligns the corresponding points. [sent-70, score-0.624]
</p><p>38 1  Probabilistic Model  We formulate the registration problem as one of ﬁnding an embedding of the data mesh Z into the model mesh X, which is encoded as an assignment to all correspondence variables C = (c1 , . [sent-72, score-1.534]
</p><p>39 For each pair of adjacent data mesh points zk , zl , we want to deﬁne a probabilistic potential ψ(ck , cl ) that constrains this pair of correspondences to reasonable and consistent. [sent-81, score-0.959]
</p><p>40 Performing probabilistic inference to ﬁnd the most likely joint assignment to the entire set of correspondence variables C should yield a good and consistent registration. [sent-83, score-0.297]
</p><p>41 We want our model to encode a preference for embeddings of mesh Z into mesh X, which minimize the amount of deformation Θ induced by the embedding. [sent-85, score-1.141]
</p><p>42 In order to quantify the amount of deformation Θ, applied to the model, we  will follow the ideas of H¨ hnel et al. [sent-86, score-0.242]
</p><p>43 To evaluate the deformation penalty, we parameterize each link in the model in terms of its length and its direction relative to its endpoints (see Fig. [sent-93, score-0.275]
</p><p>44 In order to quantify the deformation induced by an embedding C, we need to include a potential ψd (ck , cl ) for each link eZ ∈ E Z . [sent-100, score-0.373]
</p><p>45 Every probability ψd (ck = i, cl = j) k,l corresponds to the deformation penalty incurred by deforming model link e i,j to generate link eZ and is deﬁned in (1). [sent-101, score-0.494]
</p><p>46 We do not restrict ourselves to the set of links in E X , since k,l the original mesh tessellation is sparse and local. [sent-102, score-0.505]
</p><p>47 For each possible value of the correspondence variable ck = i we select a small set of candidate rotations, consistent with local geometry. [sent-108, score-0.38]
</p><p>48 We do this by aligning local patches around the points xi and zk using rigid ICP. [sent-109, score-0.247]
</p><p>49 We extend the domain of each correspondence variables ck , where each value encodes a matching point and a particular rotation from the precomputed set for that point. [sent-110, score-0.366]
</p><p>50 The literature on scan registration — for rigid and non-rigid models alike — relies on the preserving Euclidean distance. [sent-114, score-0.669]
</p><p>51 1C, we see that the two legs in one conﬁguration of our puppet are fairly close together, allowing the algorithm to map two adjacent points in the data mesh to the two separate legs, with minimal deformation penalty. [sent-117, score-0.965]
</p><p>52 In the complementary situation, especially when object symmetries are present, two distant yet similar points in one scan might get mapped to the same region in the other. [sent-118, score-0.492]
</p><p>53 For example, in the same ﬁgure, we see that points in both an arm and a leg in the data mesh get mapped to a single leg in the model mesh. [sent-119, score-0.699]
</p><p>54 We therefore want to enforce constraints preserving distance along the mesh surface (geodesic distance). [sent-120, score-0.658]
</p><p>55 We encode a nearness preservation  Figure 2: A) Automatic interpolation between two scans of an arm and a wooden puppet. [sent-122, score-0.461]

</p><p>57 constraint which prevents adjacent points in mesh Z to be mapped to distant points in X in the geodesic distance sense. [sent-125, score-0.778]
</p><p>58 For adjacent points zk , zl in the data mesh, we deﬁne the following potential: ψn (ck = i, cl = j) =  0 1  distGeodesic (xi , xj ) > αρ otherwise  (2)  where ρ is the data mesh resolution and α is some constant, chosen to be 3. [sent-126, score-0.754]
</p><p>59 For every pair of points zk , zl whose geodesic distance is more than 5ρ on the data mesh, we have a potential: 0 distGeodesic (xi , xj ) < βρ (3) ψf (ck = i, cl = j) = 1 otherwise where β is also a constant, chosen to be 2 in our implementation. [sent-129, score-0.382]
</p><p>60 Finally, we encode a set of potentials that correspond to the preservation of local surface properties between the model mesh and data mesh. [sent-132, score-0.858]
</p><p>61 The use of local surface signatures is important, because it helps to guide the optimization in the exponential space of assignments. [sent-133, score-0.257]
</p><p>62 We use spin images [14] compressed with principal component analysis to produce a low-dimensional signature sx of the local surface geometry around a point x. [sent-134, score-0.248]
</p><p>63 In general, most pairs of points in the mesh are not close, so that the total number of such potentials grows as O(M 2 ), where M is the number of points in the data mesh. [sent-146, score-0.625]
</p><p>64 We applied our registration algorithm to three different datasets, containing meshes of a human arm, wooden puppet and the CAESAR dataset of whole human bodies [1], all acquired by a 3D range scanner. [sent-152, score-0.875]
</p><p>65 We use a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy, using the result of a coarse sub-sampling of the mesh surface to constrain the correspondences at a ﬁner-grained level. [sent-157, score-0.803]
</p><p>66 The resulting set of correspondences were used as markers to initialize the non-rigid ICP algorithm of H¨ hnel et al. [sent-158, score-0.304]
</p><p>67 a The Correlated Correspondence algorithm successfully aligned all mesh pairs in our human arm data set containing 7 arms. [sent-160, score-0.597]
</p><p>68 In the puppet data set we registered one of the meshes to the remaining 6 puppets. [sent-161, score-0.353]
</p><p>69 In the two remaining cases, the algorithm produced a registration where the torso was ﬂipped, so that the front was mapped to the back. [sent-163, score-0.486]
</p><p>70 Importantly, our probabilistic model assigns a higher likelihood score to the correct solution, so that the incorrect registration is a consequence of local maxima in the LBP algorithm. [sent-165, score-0.477]
</p><p>71 We ran the modiﬁed algorithm to register one puppet mesh to the remaining 6 meshes in the dataset, obtaining the correct registration in all cases. [sent-168, score-1.232]
</p><p>72 The modiﬁed algorithm was applied to the CAESAR dataset and produced very good registration for challenging cases exhibiting both articulated motion and deformation (Fig. [sent-171, score-0.901]
</p><p>73 2B), or exhibiting deformation and a (small) change in object scale (Fig. [sent-172, score-0.404]
</p><p>74 Overall, the algorithm performed robustly, producing a close-to-optimal registrations even for pairs of meshes that involve large deformations, articulated motion or both. [sent-174, score-0.391]
</p><p>75 The registration is accomplished in an unsupervised way, without any prior knowledge about object shape, dynamics, or alignment. [sent-175, score-0.635]
</p><p>76 The Correlated Correspondence algorithm allows us to register a data mesh containing only a partial scan of an object to a known complete surface model of the object, which serves as a template. [sent-177, score-1.196]
</p><p>77 We can then transform the template mesh to the partial scan, a process which leaves undisturbed the links that are not involved in the partial mesh. [sent-178, score-0.71]
</p><p>78 The result is a mesh that matches the data on the observed points, while completing the unknown portion of the surface using the template. [sent-179, score-0.631]
</p><p>79 We register the partial mesh to models of the object in a different pose (Fig. [sent-184, score-0.762]
</p><p>80 The result demonstrates a largely correct reconstruction of the complete surface geometry from the partial scan and the deformed template. [sent-188, score-0.532]
</p><p>81 Current research [20] shows that if a nonrigid transformation Θ between the poses is available, believable animation can be produced by linear interpolation be-  Figure 3: A) The results produced by the CC algorithm were used for unsupervised recovery of articulated models. [sent-191, score-0.714]
</p><p>82 15 puppet parts and 4 arm parts, as well as the articulated object skeletons, were recovered. [sent-192, score-0.632]
</p><p>83 The missing parts of the surface were estimated by registering the partial view to a complete model of the object in a different conﬁguration. [sent-194, score-0.576]
</p><p>84 tween the model mesh and the transformed model mesh. [sent-195, score-0.449]
</p><p>85 The interpolation is performed in the space of local link parameters (li,j , di→j , dj→i ), We demonstrate that transformation estimates produced by our algorithm can be used to automatically generate believable animation sequences between fairly different poses, as shown in Fig. [sent-196, score-0.347]
</p><p>86 Articulated object models have a number of applications in animation and motion capture, and there has been work on recovering them automatically from 3D data [7, 3]. [sent-199, score-0.286]
</p><p>87 We show that our unsupervised registration capability can greatly assist articulated model recovery. [sent-200, score-0.64]
</p><p>88 In particular, the algorithm in [3] requires an estimate of the correspondences between a template mesh and the remaining meshes in the dataset. [sent-201, score-0.838]
</p><p>89 We supplied it with registration computed with the Correlated Correspondence algorithm. [sent-202, score-0.403]
</p><p>90 5  Conclusion  The contribution of this paper is an algorithm for unsupervised registration of non-rigid 3D surfaces in signiﬁcantly different conﬁgurations. [sent-207, score-0.613]
</p><p>91 Our results show that the algorithm can deal with articulated objects subject to large joint movements, as well as with non-rigid surface deformations. [sent-208, score-0.459]
</p><p>92 The algorithm was not provided with markers or other cues regarding correspondence, and makes no assumptions about object shape, dynamics, or alignment. [sent-209, score-0.259]
</p><p>93 We show the quality and the utility of the registration results we obtain by using them as a starting point for compelling computer graphics applications: partial view completion, interpolation between scans, and recovery of articulated object models. [sent-210, score-0.98]
</p><p>94 In some cases, the mesh topology may change drastically, for example, when an arm touches the body. [sent-214, score-0.535]
</p><p>95 A second limitation of our approach is that it assumes that the data mesh is a subset of the model mesh. [sent-217, score-0.449]
</p><p>96 If the data mesh contains clutter, our algorithm will attempt to embed the clutter into the model. [sent-218, score-0.506]
</p><p>97 We feel that the general nonrigid registration problem becomes underspeciﬁed when signiﬁcant clutter and occlusion are present simultaneously. [sent-219, score-0.58]
</p><p>98 Given more scans of the  same object, we can try to learn the deformation penalty associated with different links, and bootstrap the algorithm. [sent-222, score-0.364]

<p>Author: Dragomir Anguelov, Praveen Srinivasan, Hoi-cheung Pang, Daphne Koller, Sebastian Thrun, James Davis</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised algorithm for registering 3D surface scans of an object undergoing signiﬁcant deformations. Our algorithm does not need markers, nor does it assume prior knowledge about object shape, the dynamics of its deformation, or scan alignment. The algorithm registers two meshes by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over all point-topoint correspondences between them. This model enforces preservation of local mesh geometry, as well as more global constraints that capture the preservation of geodesic distance between corresponding point pairs. The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically ﬁll in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different conﬁguration. We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of signiﬁcant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. Finally, we show that the output of the algorithm can be used for compelling computer graphics tasks such as interpolation between two scans of a non-rigid object and automatic recovery of articulated object models. 1</p><p>2 0.20533384 <a title="186-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2004-Surface_Reconstruction_using_Learned_Shape_Models.html">179 nips-2004-Surface Reconstruction using Learned Shape Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan E. Solem, Fredrik Kahl</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of geometrical surface reconstruction from one or several images using learned shape models. While humans can effortlessly retrieve 3D shape information, this inverse problem has turned out to be difﬁcult to perform automatically. We introduce a framework based on level set surface reconstruction and shape models for achieving this goal. Through this merging, we obtain an efﬁcient and robust method for reconstructing surfaces of an object category of interest. The shape model includes surface cues such as point, curve and silhouette features. Based on ideas from Active Shape Models, we show how both the geometry and the appearance of these features can be modelled consistently in a multi-view context. The complete surface is obtained by evolving a level set driven by a PDE, which tries to ﬁt the surface to the inferred 3D features. In addition, an a priori 3D surface model is used to regularize the solution, in particular, where surface features are sparse. Experiments are demonstrated on a database of real face images.</p><p>3 0.14427313 <a title="186-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Kernel_Methods_for_Implicit_Surface_Modeling.html">92 nips-2004-Kernel Methods for Implicit Surface Modeling</a></p>

Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method, Parametric Embedding (PE), for visualizing the posteriors estimated over a mixture model. PE simultaneously embeds both objects and their classes in a low-dimensional space. PE takes as input a set of class posterior vectors for given data points, and tries to preserve the posterior structure in an embedding space by minimizing a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, under the assumption that samples are generated by a Gaussian mixture with equal covariances in the embedding space. PE has many potential uses depending on the source of the input data, providing insight into the classiﬁer’s behavior in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The PE algorithm has a computational advantage over conventional embedding methods based on pairwise object relations since its complexity scales with the product of the number of objects and the number of classes. We demonstrate PE by visualizing supervised categorization of web pages, semi-supervised categorization of digits, and the relations of words and latent topics found by an unsupervised algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 1</p><p>5 0.10530588 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Detecting_Significant_Multidimensional_Spatial_Clusters.html">51 nips-2004-Detecting Significant Multidimensional Spatial Clusters</a></p>

<p>Author: Dragomir Anguelov, Praveen Srinivasan, Hoi-cheung Pang, Daphne Koller, Sebastian Thrun, James Davis</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised algorithm for registering 3D surface scans of an object undergoing signiﬁcant deformations. Our algorithm does not need markers, nor does it assume prior knowledge about object shape, the dynamics of its deformation, or scan alignment. The algorithm registers two meshes by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over all point-topoint correspondences between them. This model enforces preservation of local mesh geometry, as well as more global constraints that capture the preservation of geodesic distance between corresponding point pairs. The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically ﬁll in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different conﬁguration. We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of signiﬁcant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. Finally, we show that the output of the algorithm can be used for compelling computer graphics tasks such as interpolation between two scans of a non-rigid object and automatic recovery of articulated object models. 1</p><p>2 0.81085676 <a title="186-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Surface_Reconstruction_using_Learned_Shape_Models.html">179 nips-2004-Surface Reconstruction using Learned Shape Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan E. Solem, Fredrik Kahl</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of geometrical surface reconstruction from one or several images using learned shape models. While humans can effortlessly retrieve 3D shape information, this inverse problem has turned out to be difﬁcult to perform automatically. We introduce a framework based on level set surface reconstruction and shape models for achieving this goal. Through this merging, we obtain an efﬁcient and robust method for reconstructing surfaces of an object category of interest. The shape model includes surface cues such as point, curve and silhouette features. Based on ideas from Active Shape Models, we show how both the geometry and the appearance of these features can be modelled consistently in a multi-view context. The complete surface is obtained by evolving a level set driven by a PDE, which tries to ﬁt the surface to the inferred 3D features. In addition, an a priori 3D surface model is used to regularize the solution, in particular, where surface features are sparse. Experiments are demonstrated on a database of real face images.</p><p>3 0.56785691 <a title="186-lsi-3" href="./nips-2004-Kernel_Methods_for_Implicit_Surface_Modeling.html">92 nips-2004-Kernel Methods for Implicit Surface Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Finn \. Nielsen</p><p>Abstract: We provide a method for mass meta-analysis in a neuroinformatics database containing stereotaxic Talairach coordinates from neuroimaging experiments. Database labels are used to group the individual experiments, e.g., according to cognitive function, and the consistent pattern of the experiments within the groups are determined. The method voxelizes each group of experiments via a kernel density estimation, forming probability density volumes. The values in the probability density volumes are compared to null-hypothesis distributions generated by resamplings from the entire unlabeled set of experiments, and the distances to the nullhypotheses are used to sort the voxels across groups of experiments. This allows for mass meta-analysis, with the construction of a list with the most prominent associations between brain areas and group labels. Furthermore, the method can be used for functional labeling of voxels. 1</p><p>6 0.33160752 <a title="186-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Parametric_Embedding_for_Class_Visualization.html">145 nips-2004-Parametric Embedding for Class Visualization</a></p>

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel a framework for deriving approximations for intractable probabilistic models. This framework is based on a free energy (negative log marginal likelihood) and can be seen as a generalization of adaptive TAP [1, 2, 3] and expectation propagation (EP) [4, 5]. The free energy is constructed from two approximating distributions which encode different aspects of the intractable model such a single node constraints and couplings and are by construction consistent on a chosen set of moments. We test the framework on a difﬁcult benchmark problem with binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grid graphs. We ﬁnd good performance using sets of moments which either specify factorized nodes or a spanning tree on the nodes (structured approximation). Surprisingly, the Bethe approximation gives very inferior results even on grids. 1</p><p>2 0.99585664 <a title="186-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Coarticulation_in_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">39 nips-2004-Coarticulation in Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

For each activity we deﬁne a set of admissible solutions consisting of the redundant set of optimal policies, and those policies that ascend the optimal statevalue function associated with them. A plan is then generated by merging them in such a way that the solutions to the subordinate activities are realized in the set of admissible solutions satisfying the superior activities. We present our theoretical results and empirically evaluate our approach in a simulated domain. 1</p><p>3 0.99567598 <a title="186-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Modeling_Conversational_Dynamics_as_a_Mixed-Memory_Markov_Process.html">120 nips-2004-Modeling Conversational Dynamics as a Mixed-Memory Markov Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Tanzeem Choudhury, Sumit Basu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we quantitatively investigate the ways in which a given person influences the joint turn-taking behavior in a conversation. After collecting an auditory database of social interactions among a group of twenty-three people via wearable sensors (66 hours of data each over two weeks), we apply speech and conversation detection methods to the auditory streams. These methods automatically locate the conversations, determine their participants, and mark which participant was speaking when. We then model the joint turn-taking behavior as a Mixed-Memory Markov Model [1] that combines the statistics of the individual subjects' self-transitions and the partners ' cross-transitions. The mixture parameters in this model describe how much each person 's individual behavior contributes to the joint turn-taking behavior of the pair. By estimating these parameters, we thus estimate how much influence each participant has in determining the joint turntaking behavior. We show how this measure correlates significantly with betweenness centrality [2], an independent measure of an individual's importance in a social network. This result suggests that our estimate of conversational influence is predictive of social influence. 1</p><p>4 0.99557132 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Optimal_Aggregation_of_Classifiers_and_Boosting_Maps_in_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging.html">139 nips-2004-Optimal Aggregation of Classifiers and Boosting Maps in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</a></p>

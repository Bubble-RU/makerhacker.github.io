<p>Author: Aharon Bar-hillel, Adam Spiro, Eran Stark</p><p>Abstract: Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron. It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework. At a ﬁrst search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame. At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model. Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The method was applied to several recordings. The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.10193704 <a title="15-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-On_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">136 nips-2004-On Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balaji Krishnapuram, David Williams, Ya Xue, Lawrence Carin, Mário Figueiredo, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: A graph-based prior is proposed for parametric semi-supervised classiﬁcation. The prior utilizes both labelled and unlabelled data; it also integrates features from multiple views of a given sample (e.g., multiple sensors), thus implementing a Bayesian form of co-training. An EM algorithm for training the classiﬁer automatically adjusts the tradeoff between the contributions of: (a) the labelled data; (b) the unlabelled data; and (c) the co-training information. Active label query selection is performed using a mutual information based criterion that explicitly uses the unlabelled data and the co-training information. Encouraging results are presented on public benchmarks and on measured data from single and multiple sensors. 1</p><p>6 0.090169825 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_by_Entropy_Minimization.html">164 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Andrew Zisserman, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm to overcome the local maxima problem in estimating the parameters of mixture models. It combines existing approaches from both EM and a robust ﬁtting algorithm, RANSAC, to give a data-driven stochastic learning scheme. Minimal subsets of data points, sufﬁcient to constrain the parameters of the model, are drawn from proposal densities to discover new regions of high likelihood. The proposal densities are learnt using EM and bias the sampling toward promising solutions. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, as well as effective at escaping from local maxima. We compare it with alternative methods, including EM and RANSAC, on both challenging synthetic data and the computer vision problem of alpha-matting. 1</p><p>5 0.49079505 <a title="15-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Semi-parametric_Exponential_Family_PCA.html">163 nips-2004-Semi-parametric Exponential Family PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Sajama Sajama, Alon Orlitsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a semi-parametric latent variable model based technique for density modelling, dimensionality reduction and visualization. Unlike previous methods, we estimate the latent distribution non-parametrically which enables us to model data generated by an underlying low dimensional, multimodal distribution. In addition, we allow the components of latent variable models to be drawn from the exponential family which makes the method suitable for special data types, for example binary or count data. Simulations on real valued, binary and count data show favorable comparison to other related schemes both in terms of separating different populations and generalization to unseen samples. 1</p><p>6 0.49030325 <a title="15-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Semi-supervised_Learning_via_Gaussian_Processes.html">166 nips-2004-Semi-supervised Learning via Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel B. Neill, Andrew W. Moore, Francisco Pereira, Tom M. Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Assume a uniform, multidimensional grid of bivariate data, where each cell of the grid has a count ci and a baseline bi . Our goal is to ﬁnd spatial regions (d-dimensional rectangles) where the ci are signiﬁcantly higher than expected given bi . We focus on two applications: detection of clusters of disease cases from epidemiological data (emergency department visits, over-the-counter drug sales), and discovery of regions of increased brain activity corresponding to given cognitive tasks (from fMRI data). Each of these problems can be solved using a spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff, 1997), where we compute the maximum of a likelihood ratio statistic over all spatial regions, and ﬁnd the signiﬁcance of this region by randomization. However, computing the scan statistic for all spatial regions is generally computationally infeasible, so we introduce a novel fast spatial scan algorithm, generalizing the 2D scan algorithm of (Neill and Moore, 2004) to arbitrary dimensions. Our new multidimensional multiresolution algorithm allows us to ﬁnd spatial clusters up to 1400x faster than the naive spatial scan, without any loss of accuracy. 1</p><p>2 0.97647321 <a title="15-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Who%27s_In_the_Picture.html">205 nips-2004-Who's In the Picture</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamara L. Berg, Alexander C. Berg, Jaety Edwards, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: The context in which a name appears in a caption provides powerful cues as to who is depicted in the associated image. We obtain 44,773 face images, using a face detector, from approximately half a million captioned news images and automatically link names, obtained using a named entity recognizer, with these faces. A simple clustering method can produce fair results. We improve these results signiﬁcantly by combining the clustering process with a model of the probability that an individual is depicted given its context. Once the labeling procedure is over, we have an accurately labeled set of faces, an appearance model for each individual depicted, and a natural language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation. 1</p><p>3 0.94869882 <a title="15-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Integrating_Topics_and_Syntax.html">87 nips-2004-Integrating Topics and Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Steyvers, David M. Blei, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Statistical approaches to language learning typically focus on either short-range syntactic dependencies or long-range semantic dependencies between words. We present a generative model that uses both kinds of dependencies, and can be used to simultaneously ﬁnd syntactic classes and semantic topics despite having no representation of syntax or semantics beyond statistical dependency. This model is competitive on tasks like part-of-speech tagging and document classiﬁcation with models that exclusively use short- and long-range dependencies respectively. 1</p><p>4 0.92133576 <a title="15-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference.html">43 nips-2004-Conditional Models of Identity Uncertainty with Application to Noun Coreference</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, Ben Wellner</p><p>Abstract: Coreference analysis, also known as record linkage or identity uncertainty, is a difﬁcult and important problem in natural language processing, databases, citation matching and many other tasks. This paper introduces several discriminative, conditional-probability models for coreference analysis, all examples of undirected graphical models. Unlike many historical approaches to coreference, the models presented here are relational—they do not assume that pairwise coreference decisions should be made independently from each other. Unlike other relational models of coreference that are generative, the conditional model here can incorporate a great variety of features of the input without having to be concerned about their dependencies—paralleling the advantages of conditional random ﬁelds over hidden Markov models. We present positive results on noun phrase coreference in two standard text data sets. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.87696004 <a title="15-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Active_Learning_for_Anomaly_and_Rare-Category_Detection.html">15 nips-2004-Active Learning for Anomaly and Rare-Category Detection</a></p>

This property promises wide applicability in real-life scenarios and for various statistical models. We give an overview of several alternative methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and conclude with a detailed empirical analysis. We show that our method can quickly zoom in on an anomaly set containing a few tens of points in a dataset of hundreds of thousands. 1</p><p>6 0.79542392 <a title="15-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Using_Random_Forests_in_the_Structured_Language_Model.html">200 nips-2004-Using Random Forests in the Structured Language Model</a></p>

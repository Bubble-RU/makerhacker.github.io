<p>Author: Tobias Blaschke, Laurenz Wiskott</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the equivalence of linear blind source separation and linear independent component analysis it is not possible to recover the original source signal from some unknown nonlinear transformations of the sources using only the independence assumption. Integrating the objectives of statistical independence and temporal slowness removes this indeterminacy leading to a new method for nonlinear blind source separation. The principle of temporal slowness is adopted from slow feature analysis, an unsupervised method to extract slowly varying features from a given observed vectorial signal. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on nonlinearly mixed speech data. 1</p><p>3 0.15126695 <a title="198-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-A_Harmonic_Excitation_State-Space_Approach_to_Blind_Separation_of_Speech.html">5 nips-2004-A Harmonic Excitation State-Space Approach to Blind Separation of Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshitatsu Matsuda, Kazunori Yamaguchi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, linear multilayer ICA (LMICA) is proposed for extracting independent components from quite high-dimensional observed signals such as large-size natural scenes. There are two phases in each layer of LMICA. One is the mapping phase, where a one-dimensional mapping is formed by a stochastic gradient algorithm which makes more highlycorrelated (non-independent) signals be nearer incrementally. Another is the local-ICA phase, where each neighbor (namely, highly-correlated) pair of signals in the mapping is separated by the MaxKurt algorithm. Because LMICA separates only the highly-correlated pairs instead of all ones, it can extract independent components quite efﬁciently from appropriate observed signals. In addition, it is proved that LMICA always converges. Some numerical experiments verify that LMICA is quite efﬁcient and effective in large-size natural image processing.</p><p>5 0.53599465 <a title="198-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Efficient_Kernel_Machines_Using_the_Improved_Fast_Gauss_Transform.html">60 nips-2004-Efficient Kernel Machines Using the Improved Fast Gauss Transform</a></p>

<p>Author: Pradeep Shenoy, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to building brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and learning. We show how a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can be used to infer probability distributions over brain- and body-states during planning and execution of actions. The DBN is learned directly from observed data and allows measured signals such as EEG and EMG to be interpreted in terms of internal states such as intent to move, preparatory activity, and movement execution. Unlike traditional classiﬁcation-based approaches to BCI, the proposed approach (1) allows continuous tracking and prediction of internal states over time, and (2) generates control signals based on an entire probability distribution over states rather than binary yes/no decisions. We present preliminary results of brain- and body-state estimation using simultaneous EEG and EMG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7960999 <a title="198-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-Unsupervised_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Nonlinear_Models.html">198 nips-2004-Unsupervised Variational Bayesian Learning of Nonlinear Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to inﬂuence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We ﬁt the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.</p><p>4 0.7245667 <a title="198-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-A_Harmonic_Excitation_State-Space_Approach_to_Blind_Separation_of_Speech.html">5 nips-2004-A Harmonic Excitation State-Space Approach to Blind Separation of Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm to perform blind, one-microphone speech separation. Our algorithm separates mixtures of speech without modeling individual speakers. Instead, we formulate the problem of speech separation as a problem in segmenting the spectrogram of the signal into two or more disjoint sets. We build feature sets for our segmenter using classical cues from speech psychophysics. We then combine these features into parameterized afﬁnity matrices. We also take advantage of the fact that we can generate training examples for segmentation by artiﬁcially superposing separately-recorded signals. Thus the parameters of the afﬁnity matrices can be tuned using recent work on learning spectral clustering [1]. This yields an adaptive, speech-speciﬁc segmentation algorithm that can successfully separate one-microphone speech mixtures. 1</p><p>6 0.71686804 <a title="198-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Three_Tiered_Approach_for_Articulated_Object_Action_Modeling_and_Recognition.html">13 nips-2004-A Three Tiered Approach for Articulated Object Action Modeling and Recognition</a></p>

</p><p>4 1  Introduction  It has been proposed that extensive computational capabilities are achieved by systems whose dynamics is neither chaotic nor ordered but somewhere in between order and chaos. [sent-14, score-0.933]

</p><p>9 The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the computational capabilities of randomly connected recurrent neural networks in the domain of real-time processing and the type of dynamics induced by the underlying distribution of synaptic weights are related to each other.

</p><p>16 6 of this paper we propose and analyze a synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality (SOC) for the types of networks considered here. [sent-56, score-0.401]
</p><p>17 In contrast to previous work [7], we do not only check that the proposed rule shows adaptation towards critical dynamics, but also show that the computational capabilities of the network are actually increased if the rule is applied. [sent-57, score-0.779]
</p><p>18 Relation to previous work: In [5], the so-called liquid state machine (LSM) approach was proposed and used do analyze the computational capabilities in the time-series domain of randomly connected networks of biologically inspired network models (composed of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons). [sent-58, score-0.751]
</p><p>19 A similar analysis for a restricted case (zero mean of synaptic weights) of the network model considered in this paper can be found in [4]. [sent-61, score-0.278]
</p><p>20 2  The Network Model and its Dynamics  We consider input driven recurrent networks consisting of N threshold gates with states xi ∈ {0, 1}. [sent-62, score-0.507]
</p><p>21 Each node i receives nonzero incoming weights wij from exactly K randomly chosen nodes j. [sent-63, score-0.248]
</p><p>22 Furthermore, the network is driven by an external input signal u(·) which is injected into each node. [sent-65, score-0.382]
</p><p>23 Hence, in summary, the update of N the network state xt = (x1,t , . [sent-66, score-0.375]
</p><p>24 In the following we consider a randomly drawn binary input signal u (·) : at each  time step ut assumes the value u + 1 with probability r and the value u with probability ¯ ¯ 1 − r. [sent-70, score-0.478]
</p><p>25 This network model is similar to the one we have considered in [4]. [sent-71, score-0.206]
</p><p>26 This implies that the network activity N 1 at = N i=1 xi,t can vary considerably for different parameters (compare Fig. [sent-73, score-0.279]
</p><p>27 1 shows typical examples of ordered, critical and chaotic dynamics (see the next section for a deﬁnition of order and chaos). [sent-76, score-0.799]
</p><p>28 The system parameters corresponding to each type of dynamics are indicated in the lower panel (phase plot). [sent-77, score-0.212]
</p><p>29 We refer to the (phase) transition from the ordered to the chaotic regime as the critical line (shown as the solid line in the phase plot). [sent-78, score-1.21]
</p><p>30 Note that increasing the variance σ 2 of the weights consistently leads to chaotic behavior. [sent-79, score-0.443]
</p><p>31 These states are mapped to their corresponding successor states (using the same weight matrix) with the same input in each case and the change in the Hamming distance is observed. [sent-81, score-0.25]
</p><p>32 If small distances tend to grow this is a sign of chaos whereas if the distance tends to decrease this is a signature of order. [sent-82, score-0.24]
</p><p>33 Note that dt+1 depends on the input ut (in contrast to [3]) and also on the activity at (in contrast to [4]). [sent-84, score-0.479]
</p><p>34 Hence the two-dimensional map Fu (dt , at ) := (dt+1 , at+1 ) = (f (dt , at , ut ), A(at , ut )) describes the time evolution of dt and at given the input times series u(·) . [sent-85, score-0.944]
</p><p>35 Let us consider the steady state of the averaged Hamming distance f ∗ as well as the steady t state of the averaged network activity a∗ , i. [sent-86, score-0.714]
</p><p>36 1 If f ∗ = 0 we know that any state differences will eventually die out and the network is in the ordered phase. [sent-89, score-0.53]
</p><p>37 If on the other hand a small difference is ampliﬁed and never dies out we have f ∗ = 0 and the network is in the chaotic phase. [sent-90, score-0.616]
</p><p>38 Since at does not depend on dt we calculate the averaged steady state activity a∗ and determine the slope α∗ of the map rf (d, a, u + 1) + (1 − r)f (d, a, u) at the point (d, a) = (0, a∗ ). [sent-92, score-0.423]
</p><p>39 Accordingly ¯ ¯ we say that the network is in the ordered, critical or chaotic regime if α ∗ < 1, α∗ = 1 or α∗ > 1 respectively. [sent-93, score-0.953]
</p><p>40 2 Examples of t Fu denotes t-fold composition of the map Fu (·, ·) where in the k-th iteration the input uk is applied and · denotes the average over all possible initial conditions and all input signals with a given statistics determined by u and r. [sent-95, score-0.247]

</p><p>42 The solid line marks the critical values for µ and σ 2 . [sent-135, score-0.313]
</p><p>43 ¯ critical lines that were calculated from this formula (marked by the solid lines) can be seen in Fig. [sent-136, score-0.251]
</p><p>44 3 The ordered phase can also be described by using the notion of fading memory (see [5] and the references therein). [sent-138, score-0.455]
</p><p>45 Intuitively speaking in a network with fading memory a state x t is fully determined by a ﬁnite history ut−T , ut−T +1 , . [sent-139, score-0.476]
</p><p>46 Fading memory plays an important role in the “liquid state machine” framework [5] since together with the separation property (see below) it would in principle allow an appropriate readout function to deduce the recent input, or any function of it, from the network state. [sent-146, score-0.586]
</p><p>47 If on the other hand the network does not have fading memory (i. [sent-147, score-0.384]
</p><p>48 is in the chaotic regime) a given network state xt also contains “spurious” information about the initial conditions and hence it is hard or even impossible to deduce any features of the recent input. [sent-149, score-0.861]
</p><p>49 4  NM-Separation as a Predictor for Computational Power  The already mentioned separation property [5] is especially important if a network is to be useful for computations on input time-series: only if different input signals separate the network state, i. [sent-150, score-0.741]
</p><p>50 Hence it is necessary that any two different input time series for which the readout function should produce different outputs drive the recurrent network into two sufﬁciently different states. [sent-153, score-0.493]
</p><p>51 ) of the Hamming distance that result from applying different inputs u(·) and u(·) with a mean distance of b := Pr {ut = ut }, i. [sent-157, score-0.449]
</p><p>52 In summary the three-dimensional map Su,˜ (dt , at , at ) := (dt+1 , at+1 , at+1 ) = ˜ ˜ u (s(dt , at , at , ut , ut ), A(at , ut ), A(˜t , ut )) fully describes the time evolution of the Ham˜ ˜ a ˜ ming distance and the network activities. [sent-160, score-1.616]
</p><p>53 Again we consider the steady state of the averaged t Hamming distance s∗ and the network activities a∗ , a∗ , i. [sent-161, score-0.447]

</p><p>55 A The gray coded image (an interpolation between the data points marked with open diamonds) shows the performance of trained networks in dependence of the parameters µ and σ 2 for the delayed 3-bit parity task. [sent-189, score-0.286]
</p><p>56 tional power since chaotic networks separate even minor differences in the input to a very high degree. [sent-198, score-0.688]
</p><p>57 Note that f ∗ is always zero in the ordered phase and non-zero in the chaotic phase. [sent-201, score-0.687]
</p><p>58 Since we want the complexity measure, which we will call N M -separation, to be a predictor for computational power we correct s∗ − f ∗ by a term which accounts for the separation due to an all-dominant input drive. [sent-202, score-0.289]
</p><p>59 Hence ˜ v a measure of the network mediated separation N Msep due to input differences is given by N Msep = s∗ − f ∗ − i∗  (2)  In Fig. [sent-204, score-0.446]
</p><p>60 1 is shown in dependence of the network parameters µ and σ 2 . [sent-206, score-0.206]
</p><p>61 4 Note that the N M -separation peaks very close to the critical line. [sent-207, score-0.251]
</p><p>62 Because of the computational importance of the separation property this also suggests that the computational capabilities of the networks will peak at the onset of chaos, which is conﬁrmed in the next section. [sent-208, score-0.432]
</p><p>63 5  Real-Time Computations at the Edge of Chaos  To access the computational power of a network we make use of the so called “liquid state machine” framework which was proposed by Maass et. [sent-209, score-0.382]
</p><p>64 20, 10 values for σ 2 where chosen near the critical line and 10 other values where equally spaced (on a logarithmic scale) over the interval [0. [sent-217, score-0.361]
</p><p>65 properly chosen general-purpose recurrent network with “rich” dynamics and b) a readout function that is trained to map the network state to the desired outputs (see [5, 6, 4] for more details). [sent-221, score-0.87]
</p><p>66 This approach is potentially successful if the general-purpose network encodes the relevant features of the input signal in the network state in such a way that the readout function can easily extract it. [sent-222, score-0.695]
</p><p>67 We will show that near the critical line the networks considered in this paper encode the input in such a way that a simple linear classiﬁer C(xt ) = Θ(w · xt + w0 ) sufﬁces to implement a broad range of complex nonlinear ﬁlters. [sent-223, score-0.666]
</p><p>68 Note that in order to train the network for a given task only the parameters w ∈ R N , w0 ∈ R of the linear classiﬁer are adjusted such that the actual network output vt = C(xt ) is as close as possible to the target values yt . [sent-224, score-0.48]
</p><p>69 To access the computational power in a principled way networks with different parameters were tested on a delayed 3-bit parity task for increasing delays and on randomly drawn Boolean functions of the last 5 input bits. [sent-225, score-0.531]
</p><p>70 Hence to achieve good performance it is necessary that a state xt contains information about several input bits ut , t < t in a nonlinear transformed form such that a linear classiﬁer C is sufﬁcient to perform the nonlinear computations. [sent-229, score-0.623]
</p><p>71 3 where the performance (measured in terms of mutual information) on a test set between the network output and the target signal is shown for various parameter settings (for details see [4]). [sent-231, score-0.245]
</p><p>72 The highest performance is clearly achieved for parameter values close to the critical line where the phase transition occurs. [sent-232, score-0.458]
</p><p>73 In contrast to these previous results the networks used here are not optimized for any speciﬁc task but their computational capabilities are assessed by evaluating them for many different tasks. [sent-234, score-0.302]
</p><p>74 6  Self-Organized Criticality via Synaptic Scaling  Since the computational capabilities of a network depend crucially on having almost critical dynamics an adaptive system should be able to adjust its dynamics accordingly. [sent-239, score-0.982]
</p><p>75 (1) states that critical dynamics are achieved if the probability Pbf that a single bitﬂip in the input shows up in the output should on average (over the external and internal 1 input statistics given by u, r and a∗ respectively) be equal to K . [sent-241, score-0.734]
</p><p>76 Intuitively a node with an activation that is much higher or lower than its ﬁring threshold is rather unlikely to change its output if a i single bit in its input is ﬂipped. [sent-246, score-0.213]
</p><p>77 Formally Pbf of node i is given by the average (over the internal and external input statistics) of the following quantity: 1 K  N  Θ (wij (1 − 2xj,t−1 )(1 − 2xi,t ) − mi,t )  (3)  j=1,wij =0  N  where mi,t = j=1 wij xj,t−1 + ut−1 denotes the margin of node i (see [8] for details). [sent-247, score-0.361]
</p><p>78 Each node now applies synaptic scaling to adjust itself towards the critical line. [sent-248, score-0.514]
</p><p>79 Accordingly we arrive at the following SOC-rule: wij (t + 1) =  1 1+ν  · wij (1 + ν) · wij (t)  est if Pbf i (t) > est if Pbf i (t) <  1 K 1 K  (4)  A  neuron #  50 100 150 200  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  timesteps  B  C  1  1  K*P  K*P  bf  1. [sent-249, score-0.519]
</p><p>80 A Time evolution of the network state x t starting in a chaotic regime while the SOC-rule (4) is active (black: xi,t = 1, white: xi,t = 0). [sent-254, score-0.859]
</p><p>81 The dotted line shows how the node averaged estimate of Pbf evolves over time for the network shown in A. [sent-259, score-0.37]
</p><p>82 The running average of this estimate (thick black line) as used by the SOC-rule clearly shows that Pbf approaches its critical value (dashed line). [sent-260, score-0.251]
</p><p>83 Applying this rule in parallel to all nodes of the network is then able to adjust the network dynamics towards criticality as shown in Fig. [sent-265, score-0.811]
</p><p>84 The upper row shows the time evolution of the network states xt while the SOC-rule (4) is running. [sent-267, score-0.405]
</p><p>85 It is clearly visible how the network dynamics changes from chaotic (the initial network had the parameters K = 5, µ = 0 and σ 2 = 100) to critical dynamics that respect the input signal. [sent-268, score-1.477]
</p><p>86 4 shows how the averaged estimated bit-ﬂip probability N esti 1 i=1 Pbf (t) approaches its critical value for the case of the above network and one N that started in the ordered regime (K = 10, µ = 0, σ 2 = 0. [sent-270, score-0.783]
</p><p>87 Since critical dynamics are better suited for information processing (see Fig. [sent-272, score-0.389]
</p><p>88 3) grows for networks that were initialized in the chaotic and ordered regime respectively. [sent-276, score-0.801]
</p><p>89 Note that the performance reached by these networks using the SOC-rule (4) is as high as for networks where the critical value for σ 2 is chosen apriori and stays at this level. [sent-277, score-0.473]
</p><p>90 This shows that rule (4) is stable in the sense that it keeps the dynamics critical and does not destroy the computational capabilities. [sent-278, score-0.476]
</p><p>91 7  Discussion  We developed a mean-ﬁeld theory for input-driven networks which allows to determine the position of the transition line between ordered and chaotic dynamics with respect to the 5 Here a learning rate of ν = 0. [sent-279, score-1.006]

</p><p>94 B Same as in A but for K = 10 and networks initialized in the ordered regime. [sent-288, score-0.305]
</p><p>95 Based on this theory we proposed a complexity measure (called N M -separation) which assumes its highest values at the critical line and shows a clear correlation with the computational power for real-time time-series processing. [sent-290, score-0.424]
</p><p>96 These results provide further evidence for the idea of “computation at the edge of chaos” [1] and support the hypothesis that dynamics near the critical line are expected to be a general property of input driven dynamical systems which support complex real-time computations.

We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: H. J. Kim, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms have enjoyed numerous successes in robotic control tasks. In problems with time-varying dynamics, online learning methods have also proved to be a powerful tool for automatically tracking and/or adapting to the changing circumstances. However, for safety-critical applications such as airplane ﬂight, the adoption of these algorithms has been signiﬁcantly hampered by their lack of safety, such as “stability,” guarantees. Rather than trying to show difﬁcult, a priori, stability guarantees for speciﬁc learning methods, in this paper we propose a method for “monitoring” the controllers suggested by the learning algorithm online, and rejecting controllers leading to instability. We prove that even if an arbitrary online learning method is used with our algorithm to control a linear dynamical system, the resulting system is stable. 1</p><p>5 0.1386181 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-Synchronization_of_neural_networks_by_mutual_learning_and_its_application_to_cryptography.html">180 nips-2004-Synchronization of neural networks by mutual learning and its application to cryptography</a></p>

<p>Author: Nils Bertschinger, Thomas Natschläger, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relationship between the computational capabilities of randomly connected networks of threshold gates in the timeseries domain and their dynamical properties. In particular we propose a complexity measure which we ﬁnd to assume its highest values near the edge of chaos, i.e. the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics. Furthermore we show that the proposed complexity measure predicts the computational capabilities very well: only near the edge of chaos are such networks able to perform complex computations on time series. Additionally a simple synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality is presented and analyzed. 1</p><p>2 0.75112557 <a title="26-lsi-2" href="./nips-2004-Edge_of_Chaos_Computation_in_Mixed-Mode_VLSI_-_A_Hard_Liquid.html">58 nips-2004-Edge of Chaos Computation in Mixed-Mode VLSI - A Hard Liquid</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim K. Marks, J. C. Roddey, Javier R. Movellan, John R. Hershey</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic ﬁltering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact ﬁltering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace’s method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic ﬂow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking. 1 Background Recent algorithms track morphable objects by solving optic ﬂow equations, subject to the constraint that the tracked points belong to an object whose non-rigid deformations are linear combinations of a set of basic shapes [10, 2, 11]. These algorithms require precise initialization of the object pose and tend to drift out of alignment on long video sequences. We present G-ﬂow, a generative model and stochastic ﬁltering formulation of tracking that address the problems of initialization and error recovery in a principled manner. We deﬁne a non-rigid object by the 3D locations of n vertices. The object is a linear combination of k ﬁxed morph bases, with coefﬁcients c = [c1 , c2 , · · · , ck ]T . The ﬁxed 3 × k matrix hi contains the position of the ith vertex in all k morph bases. The transformation from object-centered to image coordinates consists of a rotation, weak perspective projection, and translation. Thus xi , the 2D location of the ith vertex on the image plane, is xi = grhi c + l, (1) where r is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix, l is the 2 × 1 translation vector, and g = 1 0 0 is the 010 projection matrix. The object pose, ut , comprises both the rigid motion parameters and the morph parameters at time t: ut = {r(t), l(t), c(t)}. (2) 1.1 Optic ﬂow Let yt represent the current image, and let xi (ut ) index the image pixel that is rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut . Suppose that we know ut−1 , the pose at time t − 1, and we want to ﬁnd ut , the pose at time t. This problem can be solved by minimizing the following form with respect to ut : ut = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n 2 [yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 ))] . (3) i=1 In the special case in which the xi (ut ) are neighboring points that move with the same 2D displacement, this reduces to the standard Lucas-Kanade optic ﬂow algorithm [9, 1]. Recent work [10, 2, 11] has shown that in the general case, this optimization problem can be solved efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. We will take advantage of this fact to develop an efﬁcient stochastic inference algorithm within the framework of G-ﬂow. Notational conventions Unless otherwise stated, capital letters are used for random variables, small letters for speciﬁc values taken by random variables, and Greek letters for ﬁxed model parameters. Subscripted colons indicate sequences: e.g., X1:t = X1 · · · Xt . The term In stands for the n × n identity matrix, E for expected value, V ar for the covariance matrix, and V ar−1 for the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix). 2 The Generative Model for G-Flow Figure 1: Left: a(Ut ) determines which texel (color at a vertex of the object model or a pixel of the background model) is responsible for rendering each image pixel. Right: G-ﬂow video generation model: At time t, the object’s 3D pose, Ut , is used to project the object texture, Vt , into 2D. This projection is combined with the background texture, Bt , to generate the observed image, Yt . We model the image sequence Y as a stochastic process generated by three hidden causes, U , V , and B, as shown in the graphical model (Figure 1, right). The m × 1 random vector Yt represents the m-pixel image at time t. The n × 1 random vector Vt and the m × 1 random vector Bt represent the n-texel object texture and the m-texel background texture, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1, left, the object pose, Ut , determines onto which image pixels the object and background texels project at time t. This is formulated using the projection function a(Ut ). For a given pose, ut , the projection a(ut ) is a block matrix, def a(ut ) = av (ut ) ab (ut ) . Here av (ut ), the object projection function, is an m × n matrix of 0s and 1s that tells onto which image pixel each object vertex projects; e.g., a 1 at row j, column i it means that the ith object point projects onto image pixel j. Matrix ab plays the same role for background pixels. Assuming the foreground mapping is one-toone, we let ab = Im −av (ut )av (ut )T , expressing the simple occlusion constraint that every image pixel is rendered by object or background, but not both. In the G-ﬂow generative model: Vt Yt = a(Ut ) + Wt Wt ∼ N (0, σw Im ), σw > 0 Bt (4) Ut ∼ p(ut | ut−1 ) v v Vt = Vt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψv ), Ψv is diagonal b b Bt = Bt−1 + Zt−1 Zt−1 ∼ N (0, Ψb ), Ψb is diagonal where p(ut | ut−1 ) is the pose transition distribution, and Z v , Z b , W are independent of each other, of the initial conditions, and over time. The form of the pose distribution is left unspeciﬁed since the algorithm proposed here does not require the pose distribution or the pose dynamics to be Gaussian. For the initial conditions, we require that the variance of V1 and the variance of B1 are both diagonal. Non-rigid 3D tracking is a difﬁcult nonlinear ﬁltering problem because changing the pose has a nonlinear effect on the image pixels. Fortunately, the problem has a rich structure that we can exploit: under the G-ﬂow model, video generation is a conditionally Gaussian process [3, 6, 4, 5]. If the speciﬁc values taken by the pose sequence, u1:t , were known, then the texture processes, V and B, and the image process, Y , would be jointly Gaussian. This suggests the following scheme: we could use particle ﬁltering to obtain a distribution of pose experts (each expert corresponds to a highly probable sample of pose, u1:t ). For each expert we could then use Kalman ﬁltering equations to infer the posterior distribution of texture given the observed images. This method is known in the statistics community as a Monte Carlo ﬁltering solution for conditionally Gaussian processes [3, 4], and in the machine learning community as Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁltering [6, 5]. We found that in addition to Rao-Blackwellization, it was also critical to use Laplace’s method to generate the proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. In the context of G-ﬂow, we accomplished this by performing an optic ﬂow-like optimization, using an efﬁcient algorithm similar to those in [10, 2]. 3 Inference Our goal is to ﬁnd an expression for the ﬁltering distribution, p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ). Using the law of total probability, we have the following equation for the ﬁltering distribution: p(ut , vt , bt | y1:t ) = p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) du1:t−1 Opinion of expert (5) Credibility of expert We can think of the integral in (5) as a sum over a distribution of experts, where each expert corresponds to a single pose history, u1:t−1 . Based on its hypothesis about pose history, each expert has an opinion about the current pose of the object, Ut , and the texture maps of the object and background, Vt and Bt . Each expert also has a credibility, a scalar that measures how well the expert’s opinion matches the observed image yt . Thus, (5) can be interpreted as follows: The ﬁltering distribution at time t is obtained by integrating over the entire ensemble of experts the opinion of each expert weighted by that expert’s credibility. The opinion distribution of expert u1:t−1 can be factorized into the expert’s opinion about the pose Ut times the conditional distribution of texture Vt , Bt given pose: p(ut , vt , bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) p(vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t ) (6) Opinion of expert Pose Opinion Texture Opinion given pose The rest of this section explains how we evaluate each term in (5) and (6). We cover the distribution of texture given pose in 3.1, pose opinion in 3.2, and credibility in 3.3. 3.1 Texture opinion given pose The distribution of Vt and Bt given the pose history u1:t is Gaussian with mean and covariance that can be obtained using the Kalman ﬁlter estimation equations: −1 V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw a(ut ) E(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) = V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t , y1:t ) −1 × V ar−1 (Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + a(ut )T σw yt (7) (8) This requires p(Vt , Bt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ), which we get from the Kalman prediction equations: E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = E(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = V ar(Vt−1 , Bt−1 | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) + (9) Ψv 0 0 Ψb (10) In (9), the expected value E(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) consists of texture maps (templates) for the object and background. In (10), V ar(Vt , Bt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) represents the degree of uncertainty about each texel in these texture maps. Since this is a diagonal matrix, we can refer to the mean and variance of each texel individually. For the ith texel in the object texture map, we use the following notation: µv (i) t v σt (i) def = ith element of E(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) def = (i, i)th element of V ar(Vt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) b Similarly, deﬁne µb (j) and σt (j) as the mean and variance of the jth texel in the backt ground texture map. (This notation leaves the dependency on u1:t−1 and y1:t−1 implicit.) 3.2 Pose opinion Based on its current texture template (derived from the history of poses and images up to time t−1) and the new image yt , each expert u1:t−1 has a pose opinion, p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ), a probability distribution representing that expert’s beliefs about the pose at time t. Since the effect of ut on the likelihood function is nonlinear, we will not attempt to ﬁnd an analytical solution for the pose opinion distribution. However, due to the spatio-temporal smoothness of video signals, it is possible to estimate the peak and variance of an expert’s pose opinion. 3.2.1 Estimating the peak of an expert’s pose opinion We want to estimate ut (u1:t−1 ), the value of ut that maximizes the pose opinion. Since ˆ p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = p(y1:t−1 | u1:t−1 ) p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), p(y1:t | u1:t−1 ) (11) def ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmax p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = argmax p(ut | ut−1 ) p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). ˆ ut ut (12) We now need an expression for the ﬁnal term in (12), the predictive distribution p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ). By integrating out the hidden texture variables from p(yt , vt , bt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ), and using the conditional independence relationships deﬁned by the graphical model (Figure 1, right), we can derive: 1 m log p(yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 ) = − log 2π − log |V ar(Yt | u1:t , y1:t−1 )| 2 2 n v 2 1 (yt (xi (ut )) − µt (i)) 1 (yt (j) − µb (j))2 t − − , (13) v (i) + σ b 2 i=1 σt 2 σt (j) + σw w j∈X (ut ) where xi (ut ) is the image pixel rendered by the ith object vertex when the object assumes pose ut , and X (ut ) is the set of all image pixels rendered by the object under pose ut . Combining (12) and (13), we can derive ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin − log p(ut | ut−1 ) ˆ (14) ut + 1 2 n i=1 [yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i)]2 [yt (xi (ut )) − µb (xi (ut ))]2 t t b − − log[σt (xi (ut )) + σw ] v b σt (i) + σw σt (xi (ut )) + σw Foreground term Background terms Note the similarity between (14) and constrained optic ﬂow (3). For example, focus on the foreground term in (14) and ignore the weights in the denominator. The previous image yt−1 from (3) has been replaced by µv (·), the estimated object texture based on the images t and poses up to time t − 1. As in optic ﬂow, we can ﬁnd the pose estimate ut (u1:t−1 ) ˆ efﬁciently using the Gauss-Newton method. 3.2.2 Estimating the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion We estimate the distribution of an expert’s pose opinion using a combination of Laplace’s method and importance sampling. Suppose at time t − 1 we are given a sample of experts (d) (d) indexed by d, each endowed with a pose sequence u1:t−1 , a weight wt−1 , and the means and variances of Gaussian distributions for object and background texture. For each expert (d) (d) u1:t−1 , we use (14) to compute ut , the peak of the pose distribution at time t according ˆ (d) to that expert. Deﬁne σt as the inverse Hessian matrix of (14) at this peak, the Laplace ˆ estimate of the covariance matrix of the expert’s opinion. We then generate a set of s (d,e) (d) independent samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} from a Gaussian distribution with mean ut ˆ (d) (d) (d) and variance proportional to σt , g(·|ˆt , αˆt ), where the parameter α > 0 determines ˆ u σ the sharpness of the sampling distribution. (Note that letting α → 0 would be equivalent to (d,e) (d) simply setting the new pose equal to the peak of the pose opinion, ut = ut .) To ﬁnd ˆ the parameters of this Gaussian proposal distribution, we use the Gauss-Newton method, ignoring the second of the two background terms in (14). (This term is not ignored in the importance sampling step.) To reﬁne our estimate of the pose opinion we use importance sampling. We assign each sample from the proposal distribution an importance weight wt (d, e) that is proportional to the ratio between the posterior distribution and the proposal distribution: s (d) p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ) = ˆ (d,e) δ(ut − ut ) wt (d, e) s f =1 wt (d, f ) (15) e=1 (d,e) (d) (d) (d,e) p(ut | ut−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 ) wt (d, e) = (16) (d,e) (d) (d) g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ (d,e) (d) The numerator of (16) is proportional to p(ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t ) by (12), and the denominator of (16) is the sampling distribution. 3.3 Estimating an expert’s credibility (d) The credibility of the dth expert, p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ), is proportional to the product of a prior term and a likelihood term: (d) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t−1 )p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) (d) p(u1:t−1 | y1:t ) = . (17) p(yt | y1:t−1 ) Regarding the likelihood, p(yt |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = p(yt , ut |u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 )dut = p(yt |u1:t , y1:t−1 )p(ut |ut−1 )dut (18) (d,e) We already generated a set of samples {ut : e = 1, · · · , s} that estimate the pose opin(d) ion of the dth expert, p(ut | u1:t−1 , y1:t ). We can now use these samples to estimate the likelihood for the dth expert: (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , y1:t−1 ) = (d) (d) p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )p(ut | ut−1 )dut (19) (d) (d) (d) (d) = p(yt | u1:t−1 , ut , y1:t−1 )g(ut | ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ 3.4 p(ut | ut−1 ) s e=1 dut ≈ wt (d, e) s Updating the ﬁltering distribution g(ut | (d) (d) ut , αˆt ) ˆ σ Once we have calculated the opinion and credibility of each expert u1:t−1 , we evaluate the integral in (5) as a weighted sum over experts. The credibilities of all of the experts are normalized to sum to 1. New experts u1:t (children) are created from the old experts u1:t−1 (parents) by appending a pose ut to the parent’s history of poses u1:t−1 . Every expert in the new generation is created as follows: One parent is chosen to sire the child. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the parent’s credibility. The child’s value of ut is chosen at random from its parent’s pose opinion (the weighted samples described in Section 3.2.2). 4 Relation to Optic Flow and Template Matching In basic template-matching, the same time-invariant texture map is used to track every frame in the video sequence. Optic ﬂow can be thought of as template-matching with a template that is completely reset at each frame for use in the subsequent frame. In most cases, optimal inference under G-ﬂow involves a combination of optic ﬂow-based and template-based tracking, in which the texture template gradually evolves as new images are presented. Pure optic ﬂow and template-matching emerge as special cases. Optic Flow as a Special Case Suppose that the pose transition probability p(ut | ut−1 ) is uninformative, that the background is uninformative, that every texel in the initial object texture map has equal variance, V ar(V1 ) = κIn , and that the texture transition uncertainty is very high, Ψv → diag(∞). Using (7), (8), and (10), it follows that: µv (i) = [av (ut−1 )]T yt−1 = yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) , t (20) i.e., the object texture map at time t is determined by the pixels from image yt−1 that according to pose ut−1 were rendered by the object. As a result, (14) reduces to: ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 1 2 n yt (xi (ut )) − yt−1 (xi (ut−1 )) 2 (21) i=1 which is identical to (3). Thus constrained optic ﬂow [10, 2, 11] is simply a special case of optimal inference under G-ﬂow, with a single expert and with sampling parameter α → 0. The key assumption that Ψv → diag(∞) means that the object’s texture is very different in adjacent frames. However, optic ﬂow is typically applied in situations in which the object’s texture in adjacent frames is similar. The optimal solution in such situations calls not for optic ﬂow, but for a texture map that integrates information across multiple frames. Template Matching as a Special Case Suppose the initial texture map is known precisely, V ar(V1 ) = 0, and the texture transition uncertainty is very low, Ψv → 0. By (7), (8), and (10), it follows that µv (i) = µv (i) = µv (i), i.e., the texture map does not change t t−1 1 over time, but remains ﬁxed at its initial value (it is a texture template). Then (14) becomes: n yt (xi (ut )) − µv (i) 1 ut (u1:t−1 ) = argmin ˆ ut 2 (22) i=1 where µv (i) is the ith texel of the ﬁxed texture template. This is the error function mini1 mized by standard template-matching algorithms. The key assumption that Ψv → 0 means the object’s texture is constant from each frame to the next, which is rarely true in real data. G-ﬂow provides a principled way to relax this unrealistic assumption of template methods. General Case In general, if the background is uninformative, then minimizing (14) results in a weighted combination of optic ﬂow and template matching, with the weight of each approach depending on the current level of certainty about the object template. In addition, when there is useful information in the background, G-ﬂow infers a model of the background which is used to improve tracking. Figure 2: G-ﬂow tracking an outdoor video. Results are shown for frames 1, 81, and 620. 5 Simulations We collected a video (30 frames/sec) of a subject in an outdoor setting who made a variety of facial expressions while moving her head. A later motion-capture session was used to create a 3D morphable model of her face, consisting of a set of 5 morph bases (k = 5). Twenty experts were initialized randomly near the correct pose on frame 1 of the video and propagated using G-ﬂow inference (assuming an uninformative background). See http://mplab.ucsd.edu for video. Figure 2 shows the distribution of experts for three frames. In each frame, every expert has a hypothesis about the pose (translation, rotation, scale, and morph coefﬁcients). The 38 points in the model are projected into the image according to each expert’s pose, yielding 760 red dots in each frame. In each frame, the mean of the experts gives a single hypothesis about the 3D non-rigid deformation of the face (lower right) as well as the rigid pose of the face (rotated 3D axes, lower left). Notice G-ﬂow’s ability to recover from error: bad initial hypotheses are weeded out, leaving only good hypotheses. To compare G-ﬂow’s performance versus deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithms such as [10, 2, 11] , we used both G-ﬂow and the method from [2] to track the same video sequence. We ran each tracker several times, introducing small errors in the starting pose. Figure 3: Average error over time for G-ﬂow (green) and for deterministic optic ﬂow [2] (blue). Results were averaged over 16 runs (deterministic algorithm) or 4 runs (G-ﬂow) and smoothed. As ground truth, the 2D locations of 6 points were hand-labeled in every 20th frame. The error at every 20th frame was calculated as the distance from these labeled locations to the inferred (tracked) locations, averaged across several runs. Figure 3 compares this tracking error as a function of time for the deterministic constrained optic ﬂow algorithm and for a 20-expert version of the G-ﬂow tracking algorithm. Notice that the deterministic system has a tendency to drift (increase in error) over time, whereas G-ﬂow can recover from drift. Acknowledgments Tim K.

<p>Author: Einat Klein, Rachel Mislovaty, Ido Kanter, Andreas Ruttor, Wolfgang Kinzel</p><p>Abstract: Two neural networks that are trained on their mutual output synchronize to an identical time dependant weight vector. This novel phenomenon can be used for creation of a secure cryptographic secret-key using a public channel. Several models for this cryptographic system have been suggested, and have been tested for their security under different sophisticated attack strategies. The most promising models are networks that involve chaos synchronization. The synchronization process of mutual learning is described analytically using statistical physics methods.</p><p>5 0.48514196 <a title="26-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Neural_Network_Computation_by_In_Vitro_Transcriptional_Circuits.html">128 nips-2004-Neural Network Computation by In Vitro Transcriptional Circuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Jongmin Kim, John Hopfield, Erik Winfree</p><p>Abstract: The structural similarity of neural networks and genetic regulatory networks to digital circuits, and hence to each other, was noted from the very beginning of their study [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components. 1</p><p>6 0.43411812 <a title="26-lsi-6" href="./nips-2004-Economic_Properties_of_Social_Networks.html">57 nips-2004-Economic Properties of Social Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Moreels, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A generative probabilistic model for objects in images is presented. An object consists of a constellation of features. Feature appearance and pose are modeled probabilistically. Scene images are generated by drawing a set of objects from a given database, with random clutter sprinkled on the remaining image surface. Occlusion is allowed. We study the case where features from the same object share a common reference frame. Moreover, parameters for shape and appearance densities are shared across features. This is to be contrasted with previous work on probabilistic ‘constellation’ models where features depend on each other, and each feature and model have different pose and appearance statistics [1, 2]. These two differences allow us to build models containing hundreds of features, as well as to train each model from a single example. Our model may also be thought of as a probabilistic revisitation of Lowe’s model [3, 4]. We propose an efﬁcient entropy-minimization inference algorithm that constructs the best interpretation of a scene as a collection of objects and clutter. We test our ideas with experiments on two image databases. We compare with Lowe’s algorithm and demonstrate better performance, in particular in presence of large amounts of background clutter.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.8575362 <a title="26-lda-2" href="./nips-2004-At_the_Edge_of_Chaos%3A_Real-time_Computations_and_Self-Organized_Criticality_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">26 nips-2004-At the Edge of Chaos: Real-time Computations and Self-Organized Criticality in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nils Bertschinger, Thomas Natschläger, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relationship between the computational capabilities of randomly connected networks of threshold gates in the timeseries domain and their dynamical properties. In particular we propose a complexity measure which we ﬁnd to assume its highest values near the edge of chaos, i.e. the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics. Furthermore we show that the proposed complexity measure predicts the computational capabilities very well: only near the edge of chaos are such networks able to perform complex computations on time series. Additionally a simple synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality is presented and analyzed. 1</p><p>3 0.74546754 <a title="26-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-A_Method_for_Inferring_Label_Sampling_Mechanisms_in_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">9 nips-2004-A Method for Inferring Label Sampling Mechanisms in Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, Hui Zou, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the situation in semi-supervised learning, where the “label sampling” mechanism stochastically depends on the true response (as well as potentially on the features). We suggest a method of moments for estimating this stochastic dependence using the unlabeled data. This is potentially useful for two distinct purposes: a. As an input to a supervised learning procedure which can be used to “de-bias” its results using labeled data only and b. As a potentially interesting learning task in itself. We present several examples to illustrate the practical usefulness of our method.</p><p>4 0.73543191 <a title="26-lda-4" href="./nips-2004-Edge_of_Chaos_Computation_in_Mixed-Mode_VLSI_-_A_Hard_Liquid.html">58 nips-2004-Edge of Chaos Computation in Mixed-Mode VLSI - A Hard Liquid</a></p>

The liquid computing approach seems well suited for operating analog computing devices such as the used VLSI neural network. 1</p><p>5 0.72934562 <a title="26-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Methods_for_Estimating_the_Computational_Power_and_Generalization_Capability_of_Neural_Microcircuits.html">118 nips-2004-Methods for Estimating the Computational Power and Generalization Capability of Neural Microcircuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein, Nils Bertschinger</p><p>Abstract: What makes a neural microcircuit computationally powerful? Or more precisely, which measurable quantities could explain why one microcircuit C is better suited for a particular family of computational tasks than another microcircuit C ? We propose in this article quantitative measures for evaluating the computational power and generalization capability of a neural microcircuit, and apply them to generic neural microcircuit models drawn from different distributions. We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied ﬁrst to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efﬁcacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo. 1</p><p>6 0.72250044 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./nips-2004-Discriminant_Saliency_for_Visual_Recognition_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">53 nips-2004-Discriminant Saliency for Visual Recognition from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Andras D. Ferencz, Erik G. Learned-miller, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of identifying speciﬁc instances of a class (cars) from a set of images all belonging to that class. Although we cannot build a model for any particular instance (as we may be provided with only one “training” example of it), we can use information extracted from observing other members of the class. We pose this task as a learning problem, in which the learner is given image pairs, labeled as matching or not, and must discover which image features are most consistent for matching instances and discriminative for mismatches. We explore a patch based representation, where we model the distributions of similarity measurements deﬁned on the patches. Finally, we describe an algorithm that selects the most salient patches based on a mutual information criterion. This algorithm performs identiﬁcation well for our challenging dataset of car images, after matching only a few, well chosen patches. 1</p><p>3 0.15688738 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2004-Breaking_SVM_Complexity_with_Cross-Training.html">34 nips-2004-Breaking SVM Complexity with Cross-Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Léon Bottou, Jason Weston, Gökhan H. Bakir</p><p>Abstract: We propose to selectively remove examples from the training set using probabilistic estimates related to editing algorithms (Devijver and Kittler, 1982). This heuristic procedure aims at creating a separable distribution of training examples with minimal impact on the position of the decision boundary. It breaks the linear dependency between the number of SVs and the number of training examples, and sharply reduces the complexity of SVMs during both the training and prediction stages. 1</p><p>4 0.15344121 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2004-Synergistic_Face_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_with_Energy-Based_Models.html">182 nips-2004-Synergistic Face Detection and Pose Estimation with Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Matthew L. Miller, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single conﬁguration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for proﬁles – and ﬁnd that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system’s accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.</p><p>5 0.14801572 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2004-The_power_of_feature_clustering%3A_An_application_to_object_detection.html">192 nips-2004-The power of feature clustering: An application to object detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: We give a fast rejection scheme that is based on image segments and demonstrate it on the canonical example of face detection. However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classiﬁers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classiﬁers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classiﬁer. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable. 1</p><p>6 0.13944665 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2004-A_Large_Deviation_Bound_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">7 nips-2004-A Large Deviation Bound for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Williams, Andrew Blake, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the past decade in the development of object classiﬁers for images, for example of faces, humans and vehicles. Here we address the problem of contaminations (e.g. occlusion, shadows) in test images which have not explicitly been encountered in training data. The Variational Ising Classiﬁer (VIC) algorithm models contamination as a mask (a ﬁeld of binary variables) with a strong spatial coherence prior. Variational inference is used to marginalize over contamination and obtain robust classiﬁcation. In this way the VIC approach can turn a kernel classiﬁer for clean data into one that can tolerate contamination, without any speciﬁc training on contaminated positives. 1</p><p>5 0.54955173 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="./nips-2004-Learning_Hyper-Features_for_Visual_Identification.html">99 nips-2004-Learning Hyper-Features for Visual Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Andrew Emili</p><p>Abstract: Multiple realizations of continuous-valued time series from a stochastic process often contain systematic variations in rate and amplitude. To leverage the information contained in such noisy replicate sets, we need to align them in an appropriate way (for example, to allow the data to be properly combined by adaptive averaging). We present the Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data. 1 A Proﬁle Model for Continuous Data When observing multiple time series generated by a noisy, stochastic process, large systematic sources of variability are often present. For example, within a set of nominally replicate time series, the time axes can be variously shifted, compressed and expanded, in complex, non-linear ways. Additionally, in some circumstances, the scale of the measured data can vary systematically from one replicate to the next, and even within a given replicate. We propose a Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) for simultaneously analyzing a set of such time series. In this model, each time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single latent trace. The latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series. Output time series are generated from this model by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as in an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a particular location in the latent trace, and the emitted value from the state depends on the value of the latent trace at that position. To account for changes in the amplitude of the signals across and within replicates, the latent time states are augmented by a set of scale states, which control how the emission signal will be scaled relative to the value of the latent trace. During training, the latent trace is learned, as well as the transition probabilities controlling the Markovian evolution of the scale and time states and the overall noise level of the observed data. After training, the latent trace learned by the model represents a higher resolution ’fusion’ of the experimental replicates. Figure 1 illustrate the model in action.

The 1 2 N temporal sampling rate within each xk need not be uniform, nor must it be the same across the different xk . Constraints on the variability of the sampling rate are discussed at the end of this section. For notational convenience, we henceforth assume N k = N for all k, but this is not a requirement of the model. The CPM is set up as follows: We assume that there is a latent trace, z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ), a canonical representation of the set of noisy input replicate time series. Any given observed time series in the set is modeled as a non-uniformly subsampled version of the latent trace to which local scale transformations have been applied. Ideally, M would be inﬁnite, or at least very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent trace is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made effectively to speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. The subsampling and local scaling used during the generation of each observed time series are determined by a sequence of hidden state variables. Let the state sequence for observation k be π k . Each state in the state sequence maps to a time state/scale state pair: k πi → {τik , φk }. Time states belong to the integer set (1..M ); scale states belong to an i ordered set (φ1 ..φQ ). (In our experiments we have used Q=7, evenly spaced scales in k logarithmic space). States, πi , and observation values, xk , are related by the emission i k probability distribution: Aπi (xk |z) ≡ p(xk |πi , z, σ, uk ) ≡ N (xk ; zτik φk uk , σ), where σ k i i i i is the noise level of the observed data, N (a; b, c) denotes a Gaussian probability density for a with mean b and standard deviation c. The uk are real-valued scale parameters, one per observed time series, that correct for any overall scale difference between time series k and the latent trace. To fully specify our model we also need to deﬁne the state transition probabilities. We deﬁne the transitions between time states and between scale states separately, so that k Tπi−1 ,πi ≡ p(πi |πi−1 ) = p(φi |φi−1 )pk (τi |τi−1 ). The constraint that time must move forward, cannot stand still, and that it can jump ahead no more than Jτ time states is enforced. (In our experiments we used Jτ = 3.) As well, we only allow scale state transitions between neighbouring scale states so that the local scale cannot jump arbitrarily. These constraints keep the number of legal transitions to a tractable computational size and work well in practice. Each observed time series has its own time transition probability distribution to account for experiment-speciﬁc patterns. Both the time and scale transition probability distributions are given by multinomials:  dk , if a − b = 1  1  k  d2 , if a − b = 2   k . p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = . .  k d , if a − b = J  τ  Jτ  0, otherwise p(φi = a|φi−1  s0 , if D(a, b) = 0   s1 , if D(a, b) = 1 = b) =  s1 , if D(a, b) = −1  0, otherwise where D(a, b) = 1 means that a is one scale state larger than b, and D(a, b) = −1 means that a is one scale state smaller than b, and D(a, b) = 0 means that a = b. The distributions Jτ are constrained by: i=1 dk = 1 and 2s1 + s0 = 1. i Jτ determines the maximum allowable instantaneous speedup of one portion of a time series relative to another portion, within the same series or across different series. However, the length of time for which any series can move so rapidly is constrained by the length of the latent trace; thus the maximum overall ratio in speeds achievable by the model between any two entire time series is given by min(Jτ , M ). N After training, one may examine either the latent trace or the alignment of each observable time series to the latent trace. Such alignments can be achieved by several methods, including use of the Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the highest likelihood path through the hidden states [1], or sampling from the posterior over hidden state sequences. We found Viterbi alignments to work well in the experiments below; samples from the posterior looked quite similar. 3 Training with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm As with HMMs, training with the EM algorithm (often referred to as Baum-Welch in the context of HMMs [1]), is a natural choice. In our model the E-Step is computed exactly using the Forward-Backward algorithm [1], which provides the posterior probability over k states for each time point of every observed time series, γs (i) ≡ p(πi = s|x) and also the pairwise state posteriors, ξs,t (i) ≡ p(πi−1 = s, πi = t|xk ). The algorithm is modiﬁed only in that the emission probabilities depend on the latent trace as described in Section 2. The M-Step consists of a series of analytical updates to the various parameters as detailed below. Given the latent trace (and the emission and state transition probabilities), the complete log likelihood of K observed time series, xk , is given by Lp ≡ L + P. L is the likelihood term arising in a (conditional) HMM model, and can be obtained from the Forward-Backward algorithm. It is composed of the emission and state transition terms. P is the log prior (or penalty term), regularizing various aspects of the model parameters as explained below. These two terms are: K N N L≡ log Aπi (xk |z) + i log p(π1 ) + τ −1 K (zj+1 − zj )2 + P ≡ −λ (1) i=2 i=1 k=1 k log Tπi−1 ,πi j=1 k log D(dk |{ηv }) + log D(sv |{ηv }), v (2) k=1 where p(π1 ) are priors over the initial states. The ﬁrst term in Equation 2 is a smoothing k penalty on the latent trace, with λ controlling the amount of smoothing. ηv and ηv are Dirichlet hyperprior parameters for the time and scale state transition probability distributions respectively. These ensure that all non-zero transition probabilities remain non-zero. k For the time state transitions, v ∈ {1, Jτ } and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for k the parameters d1 , d2 . . . dJτ . For the scale state transitions, v ∈ {0, 1} and ηv corresponds to the pseudo-count data for the parameters s0 and s1 . Letting S be the total number of possible states, that is, the number of elements in the cross-product of possible time states and possible scale states, the expected complete log likelihood is: K S K p k k γs (1) log T0,s</p><p>3 0.85110509 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./nips-2004-Probabilistic_Computation_in_Spiking_Populations.html">148 nips-2004-Probabilistic Computation in Spiking Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Rama Natarajan, Peter Dayan, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: As animals interact with their environments, they must constantly update estimates about their states. Bayesian models combine prior probabilities, a dynamical model and sensory evidence to update estimates optimally. These models are consistent with the results of many diverse psychophysical studies. However, little is known about the neural representation and manipulation of such Bayesian information, particularly in populations of spiking neurons. We consider this issue, suggesting a model based on standard neural architecture and activations. We illustrate the approach on a simple random walk example, and apply it to a sensorimotor integration task that provides a particularly compelling example of dynamic probabilistic computation. Bayesian models have been used to explain a gamut of experimental results in tasks which require estimates to be derived from multiple sensory cues. These include a wide range of psychophysical studies of perception;13 motor action;7 and decision-making.3, 5 Central to Bayesian inference is that computations are sensitive to uncertainties about afferent and efferent quantities, arising from ignorance, noise, or inherent ambiguity (e.g., the aperture problem), and that these uncertainties change over time as information accumulates and dissipates. Understanding how neurons represent and manipulate uncertain quantities is therefore key to understanding the neural instantiation of these Bayesian inferences. Most previous work on representing probabilistic inference in neural populations has focused on the representation of static information.1, 12, 15 These encompass various strategies for encoding and decoding uncertain quantities, but do not readily generalize to real-world dynamic information processing tasks, particularly the most interesting cases with stimuli changing over the same timescale as spiking itself.11 Notable exceptions are the recent, seminal, but, as we argue, representationally restricted, models proposed by Gold and Shadlen,5 Rao,10 and Deneve.4 In this paper, we ﬁrst show how probabilistic information varying over time can be represented in a spiking population code. Second, we present a method for producing spiking codes that facilitate further processing of the probabilistic information. Finally, we show the utility of this method by applying it to a temporal sensorimotor integration task. 1 TRAJECTORY ENCODING AND DECODING We assume that population spikes R(t) arise stochastically in relation to the trajectory X(t) of an underlying (but hidden) variable. We use RT and XT for the whole trajectory and spike trains respectively from time 0 to T . The spikes RT constitute the observations and are assumed to be probabilistically related to the signal by a tuning function f (X, θ i ): P (R(i, T )|X(T )) ∝ f (X, θi ) (1) for the spike train of the ith neuron, with parameters θi . Therefore, via standard Bayesian inference, RT determines a distribution over the hidden variable at time T , P (X(T )|RT ). We ﬁrst consider a version of the dynamics and input coding that permits an analytical examination of the impact of spikes. Let X(t) follow a stationary Gaussian process such that the joint distribution P (X(t1 ), X(t2 ), . . . , X(tm )) is Gaussian for any ﬁnite collection of times, with a covariance matrix which depends on time differences: Ctt = c(|t − t |). Function c(|∆t|) controls the smoothness of the resulting random walks. Then, P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) X(T ) dX(T )P (RT |X(T ))P (X(T )|X(T )) (2) where P (X(T )|X(T )) is the distribution over the whole trajectory X(T ) conditional on the value of X(T ) at its end point. If RT are a set of conditionally independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we have P (RT |X(T )) ∝ iτ f (X(tiτ ), θi ) exp − i τ dτ f (X(τ ), θi ) , (3) where tiτ ∀τ are the spike times τ of neuron i in RT . Let χ = [X(tiτ )] be the vector of stimulus positions at the times at which we observed a spike and Θ = [θ(tiτ )] be the vector of spike positions. If the tuning functions are Gaussian f (X, θi ) ∝ exp(−(X − θi )2 /2σ 2 ) and sufﬁciently dense that i τ dτ f (X, θi ) is independent of X (a standard assumption in population coding), then P (RT |X(T )) ∝ exp(− χ − Θ 2 /2σ 2 ) and in Equation 2, we can marginalize out X(T ) except at the spike times tiτ : P (X(T )|RT ) ∝ p(X(T )) −1 χ dχ exp −[χ, X(T )]T C 2 [χ, X(T )] − χ−Θ 2σ 2 2 (4) and C is the block covariance matrix between X(tiτ ), x(T ) at the spike times [ttτ ] and the ﬁnal time T . This Gaussian integral has P (X(T )|RT ) ∼ N (µ(T ), ν(T )), with µ(T ) = CT t (Ctt + Iσ 2 )−1 Θ = kΘ ν(T ) = CT T − kCtT (5) CT T is the T, T th element of the covariance matrix and CT t is similarly a row vector. The dependence in µ on past spike times is speciﬁed chieﬂy by the inverse covariance matrix, and acts as an effective kernel (k). This kernel is not stationary, since it depends on factors such as the local density of spiking in the spike train RT . For example, consider where X(t) evolves according to a diffusion process with drift: dX = −αXdt + σ dN (t) (6) where α prevents it from wandering too far, N (t) is white Gaussian noise with mean zero and σ 2 variance. Figure 1A shows sample kernels for this process. Inspection of Figure 1A reveals some important traits. First, the monotonically decreasing kernel magnitude as the time span between the spike and the current time T grows matches the intuition that recent spikes play a more signiﬁcant role in determining the posterior over X(T ). Second, the kernel is nearly exponential, with a time constant that depends on the time constant of the covariance function and the density of the spikes; two settings of these parameters produced the two groupings of kernels in the ﬁgure. Finally, the fully adaptive kernel k can be locally well approximated by a metronomic kernel k  (shown in red in Figure 1A) that assumes regular spiking. This takes advantage of the general fact, indicated by the grouping of kernels, that the kernel depends weakly on the actual spike pattern, but strongly on the average rate. The merits of the metronomic kernel are that it is stationary and only depends on a single mean rate rather than the full spike train RT .

<p>Author: Tanzeem Choudhury, Sumit Basu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we quantitatively investigate the ways in which a given person influences the joint turn-taking behavior in a conversation. After collecting an auditory database of social interactions among a group of twenty-three people via wearable sensors (66 hours of data each over two weeks), we apply speech and conversation detection methods to the auditory streams. These methods automatically locate the conversations, determine their participants, and mark which participant was speaking when. We then model the joint turn-taking behavior as a Mixed-Memory Markov Model [1] that combines the statistics of the individual subjects' self-transitions and the partners ' cross-transitions. The mixture parameters in this model describe how much each person 's individual behavior contributes to the joint turn-taking behavior of the pair. By estimating these parameters, we thus estimate how much influence each participant has in determining the joint turntaking behavior. We show how this measure correlates significantly with betweenness centrality [2], an independent measure of an individual's importance in a social network. This result suggests that our estimate of conversational influence is predictive of social influence. 1</p><p>5 0.8417787 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./nips-2004-Hierarchical_Eigensolver_for_Transition_Matrices_in_Spectral_Methods.html">79 nips-2004-Hierarchical Eigensolver for Transition Matrices in Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Chakra Chennubhotla, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: We show how to build hierarchical, reduced-rank representation for large stochastic matrices and use this representation to design an efﬁcient algorithm for computing the largest eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvectors. In particular, the eigen problem is ﬁrst solved at the coarsest level of the representation. The approximate eigen solution is then interpolated over successive levels of the hierarchy. A small number of power iterations are employed at each stage to correct the eigen solution. The typical speedups obtained by a Matlab implementation of our fast eigensolver over a standard sparse matrix eigensolver [13] are at least a factor of ten for large image sizes. The hierarchical representation has proven to be effective in a min-cut based segmentation algorithm that we proposed recently [8]. 1 Spectral Methods Graph-theoretic spectral methods have gained popularity in a variety of application domains: segmenting images [22]; embedding in low-dimensional spaces [4, 5, 8]; and clustering parallel scientiﬁc computation tasks [19]. Spectral methods enable the study of properties global to a dataset, using only local (pairwise) similarity or afﬁnity measurements between the data points. The global properties that emerge are best understood in terms of a random walk formulation on the graph. For example, the graph can be partitioned into clusters by analyzing the perturbations to the stationary distribution of a Markovian relaxation process deﬁned in terms of the afﬁnity weights [17, 18, 24, 7]. The Markovian relaxation process need never be explicitly carried out; instead, it can be analytically expressed using the leading order eigenvectors, and eigenvalues, of the Markov transition matrix. In this paper we consider the practical application of spectral methods to large datasets. In particular, the eigen decomposition can be very expensive, on the order of O(n 3 ), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. While it is possible to compute analytically the ﬁrst eigenvector (see §3 below), the remaining subspace of vectors (necessary for say clustering) has to be explicitly computed. A typical approach to dealing with this difﬁculty is to ﬁrst sparsify the links in the graph [22] and then apply an efﬁcient eigensolver [13, 23, 3]. In comparison, we propose in this paper a specialized eigensolver suitable for large stochastic matrices with known stationary distributions. In particular, we exploit the spectral properties of the Markov transition matrix to generate hierarchical, successively lower-ranked approximations to the full transition matrix. The eigen problem is solved directly at the coarsest level of representation. The approximate eigen solution is then interpolated over successive levels of the hierarchy, using a small number of power iterations to correct the solution at each stage. 2 Previous Work One approach to speeding up the eigen decomposition is to use the fact that the columns of the afﬁnity matrix are typically correlated. The idea then is to pick a small number of representative columns to perform eigen decomposition via SVD. For example, in the Nystrom approximation procedure, originally proposed for integral eigenvalue problems, the idea is to randomly pick a small set of m columns; generate the corresponding afﬁnity matrix; solve the eigenproblem and ﬁnally extend the solution to the complete graph [9, 10]. The Nystrom method has also been recently applied in the kernel learning methods for fast Gaussian process classiﬁcation and regression [25]. Other sampling-based approaches include the work reported in [1, 2, 11]. Our starting point is the transition matrix generated from afﬁnity weights and we show how building a representational hierarchy follows naturally from considering the stochastic matrix. A closely related work is the paper by Lin on reduced rank approximations of transition matrices [14]. We differ in how we approximate the transition matrices, in particular our objective function is computationally less expensive to solve. In particular, one of our goals in reducing transition matrices is to develop a fast, specialized eigen solver for spectral clustering. Fast eigensolving is also the goal in ACE [12], where successive levels in the hierarchy can potentially have negative afﬁnities. A graph coarsening process for clustering was also pursued in [21, 3]. 3 Markov Chain Terminology We ﬁrst provide a brief overview of the Markov chain terminology here (for more details see [17, 15, 6]). We consider an undirected graph G = (V, E) with vertices vi , for i = {1, . . . , n}, and edges ei,j with non-negative weights ai,j . Here the weight ai,j represents the afﬁnity between vertices vi and vj . The afﬁnities are represented by a non-negative, symmetric n × n matrix A having weights ai,j as elements. The degree of a node j is n n deﬁned to be: dj = i=1 ai,j = j=1 aj,i , where we deﬁne D = diag(d1 , . . . , dn ). A Markov chain is deﬁned using these afﬁnities by setting a transition probability matrix M = AD −1 , where the columns of M each sum to 1. The transition probability matrix deﬁnes the random walk of a particle on the graph G. The random walk need never be explicitly carried out; instead, it can be analytically expressed using the leading order eigenvectors, and eigenvalues, of the Markov transition matrix. Because the stochastic matrices need not be symmetric in general, a direct eigen decomposition step is not preferred for reasons of instability. This problem is easily circumvented by considering a normalized afﬁnity matrix: L = D −1/2 AD−1/2 , which is related to the stochastic matrix by a similarity transformation: L = D −1/2 M D1/2 . Because L is symmetric, it can be diagonalized: L = U ΛU T , where U = [u1 , u2 , · · · , un ] is an orthogonal set of eigenvectors and Λ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues [λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λn ] sorted in decreasing order. The eigenvectors have unit length uk = 1 and from the form of A and D it can be shown that the eigenvalues λi ∈ (−1, 1], with at least one eigenvalue equal to one. Without loss of generality, we take λ1 = 1. Because L and M are similar we can perform an eigen decomposition of the Markov transition matrix as: M = D1/2 LD−1/2 = D1/2 U Λ U T D−1/2 . Thus an eigenvector u of L corresponds to an eigenvector D 1/2 u of M with the same eigenvalue λ. The Markovian relaxation process after β iterations, namely M β , can be represented as: M β = D1/2 U Λβ U T D−1/2 . Therefore, a particle undertaking a random walk with an initial distribution p 0 acquires after β steps a distribution p β given by: p β = M β p 0 . Assuming the graph is connected, as β → ∞, the Markov chain approaches a unique n stationary distribution given by π = diag(D)/ i=1 di , and thus, M ∞ = π1T , where 1 is a n-dim column vector of all ones. Observe that π is an eigenvector of M as it is easy to show that M π = π and the corresponding eigenvalue is 1. Next, we show how to generate hierarchical, successively low-ranked approximations for the transition matrix M . 4 Building a Hierarchy of Transition Matrices The goal is to generate a very fast approximation, while simultaneously achieving sufﬁcient accuracy. For notational ease, we think of M as a ﬁne-scale representation and M as some coarse-scale approximation to be derived here. By coarsening M further, we can generate successive levels of the representation hierarchy. We use the stationary distribution π to construct a corresponding coarse-scale stationary distribution δ. As we just discussed a critical property of the ﬁne scale Markov matrix M is that it is similar to the symmetric matrix L and we wish to preserve this property at every level of the representation hierarchy. 4.1 Deriving Coarse-Scale Stationary Distribution We begin by expressing the stationary distribution π as a probabilistic mixture of latent distributions. In matrix notation, we have (1) π = K δ, where δ is an unknown mixture coefﬁcient vector of length m, K is an n × m non-negative n kernel matrix whose columns are latent distributions that each sum to 1: i=1 Ki,j = 1 and m n. It is easy to derive a maximum likelihood approximation of δ using an EM type algorithm [16]. The main step is to ﬁnd a stationary point δ, λ for the Lagrangian: m n i=1 m Ki,j δj + λ πi ln E≡− j=1 δj − 1 . (2) j=1 An implicit step in this EM procedure is to compute the the ownership probability r i,j of the j th kernel (or node) at the coarse scale for the ith node on the ﬁne scale and is given by ri,j = δj Ki,j . m k=1 δk Ki,k (3) The EM procedure allows for an update of both δ and the latent distributions in the kernel matrix K (see §8.3.1 in [6]). For initialization, δ is taken to be uniform over the coarse-scale states. But in choosing kernels K, we provide a good initialization for the EM procedure. Speciﬁcally, the Markov matrix M is diffused using a small number of iterations to get M β . The diffusion causes random walks from neighboring nodes to be less distinguishable. This in turn helps us select a small number of columns of M β in a fast and greedy way to be the kernel matrix K. We defer the exact details on kernel selection to a later section (§4.3). 4.2 Deriving the Coarse-Scale Transition Matrix In order to deﬁne M , the coarse-scale transition matrix, we break it down into three steps. First, the Markov chain propagation at the coarse scale can be deﬁned as: q k+1 = M q k , (4) where q is the coarse scale probability distribution after k steps of the random walk. Second, we expand q k into the ﬁne scale using the kernels K resulting in a ﬁne scale probability distribution p k : p k = Kq k . (5) k Finally, we lift p k back into the coarse scale by using the ownership probability of the j th kernel for the ith node on the ﬁne grid: n qjk+1 = ri,j pik i=1 (6) Substituting for Eqs.(3) and (5) in Eq. 6 gives n m qjk+1 = i=1 n Ki,t qtk = ri,j t=1 i=1 δj Ki,j m k=1 δk Ki,k m Ki,t qtk . (7) t=1 We can write the preceding equation in a matrix form: q k+1 = diag( δ ) K T diag K δ −1 Kq k . (8) Comparing this with Eq. 4, we can derive the transition matrix M as: M = diag( δ ) K T diag K δ −1 (9) K. It is easy to see that δ = M δ, so δ is the stationary distribution for M . Following the deﬁnition of M , and its stationary distribution δ, we can generate a symmetric coarse scale afﬁnity matrix A given by A = M diag(δ) = diag( δ ) K T diag K δ −1 Kdiag(δ) , (10) where we substitute for the expression M from Eq. 9. The coarse-scale afﬁnity matrix A is then normalized to get: L = D−1/2 AD−1/2 ; D = diag(d1 , d2 , · · · , dm ), (11) where dj is the degree of node j in the coarse-scale graph represented by the matrix A (see §3 for degree deﬁnition). Thus, the coarse scale Markov matrix M is precisely similar to a symmetric matrix L. 4.3 Selecting Kernels For demonstration purpose, we present the kernel selection details on the image of an eye shown below. To begin with, a random walk is deﬁned where each pixel in the test image is associated with a vertex of the graph G. The edges in G are deﬁned by the standard 8-neighbourhood of each pixel. For the demonstrations in this paper, the edge weight ai,j between neighbouring pixels xi and xj is given by a function of the difference in the 2 corresponding intensities I(xi ) and I(xj ): ai,j = exp(−(I(xi ) − I(xj ))2 /2σa ), where σa is set according to the median absolute difference |I(xi ) − I(xj )| between neighbours measured over the entire image. The afﬁnity matrix A with the edge weights is then used to generate a Markov transition matrix M . The kernel selection process we use is fast and greedy. First, the ﬁne scale Markov matrix M is diffused to M β using β = 4. The Markov matrix M is sparse as we make the afﬁnity matrix A sparse. Every column in the diffused matrix M β is a potential kernel. To facilitate the selection process, the second step is to rank order the columns of M β based on a probability value in the stationary distribution π. Third, the kernels (i.e. columns of M β ) are picked in such a way that for a kernel Ki all of the neighbours of pixel i which are within the half-height of the the maximum value in the kernel Ki are suppressed from the selection process. Finally, the kernel selection is continued until every pixel in the image is within a half-height of the peak value of at least one kernel. If M is a full matrix, to avoid the expense of computing M β explicitly, random kernel centers can be selected, and only the corresponding columns of M β need be computed. We show results from a three-scale hierarchy on the eye image (below). The image has 25 × 20 pixels but is shown here enlarged for clarity. At the ﬁrst coarse scale 83 kernels are picked. The kernels each correspond to a different column in the ﬁne scale transition matrix and the pixels giving rise to these kernels are shown numbered on the image. Using these kernels as an initialization, the EM procedure derives a coarse-scale stationary distribution δ 21 14 26 4 (Eq. 2), while simultaneously updating the kernel ma12 27 2 19 trix. Using the newly updated kernel matrix K and the 5 8 13 23 30 18 6 9 derived stationary distribution δ a transition matrix M 28 20 15 32 10 22 is generated (Eq. 9). The coarse scale Markov matrix 24 17 7 is then diffused to M β , again using β = 4. The kernel Coarse Scale 1 Coarse Scale 2 selection algorithm is reapplied, this time picking 32 kernels for the second coarse scale. Larger values of β cause the coarser level to have fewer elements. But the exact number of elements depends on the form of the kernels themselves. For the random experiments that we describe later in §6 we found β = 2 in the ﬁrst iteration and 4 thereafter causes the number of kernels to be reduced by a factor of roughly 1/3 to 1/4 at each level. 72 28 35 44 51 64 82 4 12 31 56 19 77 36 45 52 65 13 57 23 37 5 40 53 63 73 14 29 6 66 38 74 47 24 7 30 41 54 71 78 58 15 8 20 39 48 59 67 25 68 79 21 16 2 11 26 42 49 55 60 75 32 83 43 9 76 50 17 27 61 33 69 80 3 46 18 70 81 34 10 62 22 1 25 11 1 3 16 31 29 At coarser levels of the hierarchy, we expect the kernels to get less sparse and so will the afﬁnity and the transition matrices. In order to promote sparsity at successive levels of the hierarchy we sparsify A by zeroing out elements associated with “small” transition probabilities in M . However, in the experiments described later in §6, we observe this sparsiﬁcation step to be not critical. To summarize, we use the stationary distribution π at the ﬁne-scale to derive a transition matrix M , and its stationary distribution δ, at the coarse-scale. The coarse scale transition in turn helps to derive an afﬁnity matrix A and its normalized version L. It is obvious that this procedure can be repeated recursively. We describe next how to use this representation hierarchy for building a fast eigensolver. 5 Fast EigenSolver Our goal in generating a hierarchical representation of a transition matrix is to develop a fast, specialized eigen solver for spectral clustering. To this end, we perform a full eigen decomposition of the normalized afﬁnity matrix only at the coarsest level. As discussed in the previous section, the afﬁnity matrix at the coarsest level is not likely to be sparse, hence it will need a full (as opposed to a sparse) version of an eigen solver. However it is typically the case that e ≤ m n (even in the case of the three-scale hierarchy that we just considered) and hence we expect this step to be the least expensive computationally. The resulting eigenvectors are interpolated to the next lower level of the hierarchy by a process which will be described next. Because the eigen interpolation process between every adjacent pair of scales in the hierarchy is similar, we will assume we have access to the leading eigenvectors U (size: m × e) for the normalized afﬁnity matrix L (size: m × m) and describe how to generate the leading eigenvectors U (size: n × e), and the leading eigenvalues S (size: e × 1), for the ﬁne-scale normalized afﬁnity matrix L (size: n × n). There are several steps to the eigen interpolation process and in the discussion that follows we refer to the lines in the pseudo-code presented below. First, the coarse-scale eigenvectors U can be interpolated using the kernel matrix K to generate U = K U , an approximation for the ﬁne-scale eigenvectors (line 9). Second, interpolation alone is unlikely to set the directions of U exactly aligned with U L , the vectors one would obtain by a direct eigen decomposition of the ﬁne-scale normalized afﬁnity matrix L. We therefore update the directions in U by applying a small number of power iterations with L, as given in lines 13-15. e e function (U, S) = CoarseToFine(L, K, U , S) 1: INPUT 2: L, K ⇐ {L is n × n and K is n × m where m n} e e e e 3: U /S ⇐ {leading coarse-scale eigenvectors/eigenvalues of L.

Suppose v = U c where U is a matrix of true eigenvectors and c is a coefﬁcient vector for an arbitrary vector v. After TPI power iterations v becomes v = U diag(S TPI )c, where S has the exact eigenvalues. In order for the component of a vector v in the direction Ue (the eth column of U ) not to be swamped by other components, we can limit it’s decay after TPI iterations as TPI follows: (S(e)/S(1)) >= e×eps/TOL, where S(e) is the exact eth eigenvalue, S(1) = 1, eps is the machine precision, TOL is requested accuracy. Because we do not have access to the exact value S(e) at the beginning of the interpolation procedure, we estimate it from the coarse eigenvalues S. This leads to a bound on the power iterations TPI, as derived on the line 9 above. Third, the interpolation process and the power iterations need not preserve orthogonality in the eigenvectors in U . We ﬁx this by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure (line 16). Finally, there is a still a problem with power iterations that needs to be resolved, in that it is very hard to separate nearby eigenvalues. In particular, for the convergence of the power iterations the ratio that matters is between the (e + 1) st and eth eigenvalues. So the idea we pursue is to use the power iterations only to separate the reduced space of eigenvectors (of dimension e) from the orthogonal subspace (of dimension n − e). We then use a full SVD on the reduced space to update the leading eigenvectors U , and eigenvalues S, for the ﬁne-scale (lines 17-20). This idea is similar to computing the Ritz values and Ritz vectors in a Rayleigh-Ritz method. 6 Interpolation Results Our multi-scale decomposition code is in Matlab. For the direct eigen decomposition, we have used the Matlab program svds.m which invokes the compiled ARPACKC routine [13], with a default convergence tolerance of 1e-10. In Fig. 1a we compare the spectrum S obtained from a three-scale decomposition on the eye image (blue line) with the ground truth, which is the spectrum SL resulting from direct eigen decomposition of the ﬁne-scale normalized afﬁnity matrices L (red circles). There is an excellent agreement in the leading eigenvalues. To illustrate this, we show absolute relative error between the spectra: |S−SL | in Fig. 1b. The spectra agree mostly, except for SL the last few eigenvalues. For a quantitative comparison between the eigenvectors, we plot in Fig. 1c the following measure: 1 − diag(|U T UL |), where U is the matrix of eigenvectors obtained by the multi-scale approximation, UL is the ground-truth resulting from a direct eigen decomposition of the ﬁne-scale afﬁnity matrix L and 1 is a vector of all ones. The relative error plot demonstrates a close match, within the tolerance threshold of 1e-4 that we chose for the multi-scale method, in the leading eigenvector directions between the two methods. The relative error is high with the last few eigen vectors, which suggests that the power iterations have not clearly separated them from other directions. So, the strategy we suggest is to pad the required number of leading eigen basis by about 20% before invoking the multi-scale procedure. Obviously, the number of hierarchical stages for the multi-scale procedure must be chosen such that the transition matrix at the coarsest scale can accommodate the slight increase in the subspace dimensions. For lack of space we are omitting extra results (see Ch.8 in [6]). Next we measure the time the hierarchical eigensolver takes to compute the leading eigenbasis for various input sizes, in comparison with the svds.m procedure [13]. We form images of different input sizes by Gaussian smoothing of i.i.d noise. The Gaussian function has a standard deviation of 3 pixels. The edges in graph G are deﬁned by the standard 8-neighbourhood of each pixel. The edge weights between neighbouring pixels are simply given by a function of the difference in the corresponding intensities (see §4.3). The afﬁnity matrix A with the edge weights is then used to generate a Markov transition matrix M . The fast eigensolver is run on ten different instances of the input image of a given size and the average of these times is reported here. For a fair comparison between the two procedures, we set the convergence tolerance value for the svds.m procedure to be 1e-4, the same as the one used for the fast eigensolver. We found the hierarchical representation derived from this tolerance threshold to be sufﬁciently accurate for a novel min-cut based segmentation results that we reported in [8]. Also, the subspace dimensionality is ﬁxed to be 51 where we expect (and indeed observe) the leading 40 eigenpairs derived from the multi-scale procedure to be accurate. Hence, while invoking svds.m we compute only the leading 41 eigenpairs. In the table shown below, the ﬁrst column corresponds to the number of nodes in the graph, while the second and third columns report the time taken in seconds by the svds.m procedure and the Matlab implementation of the multi-scale eigensolver respectively. The fourth column reports the speedups of the multi-scale eigensolver over svds.m procedure on a standard desktop (Intel P4, 2.5GHz, 1GB RAM). Lowering the tolerance threshold for svds.m made it faster by about 20 − 30%. Despite this, the multi-scale algorithm clearly outperforms the svds.m procedure. The most expensive step in the multi-scale algorithm is the power iteration required in the last stage, that is interpolating eigenvectors from the ﬁrst coarse scale to the required ﬁne scale. The complexity is of the order of n × e where e is the subspace dimensionality and n is the size of the graph. Indeed, from the table we can see that the multi-scale procedure is taking time roughly proportional to n. Deviations from the linear trend are observed at speciﬁc values of n, which we believe are due to the n 322 632 642 652 1002 1272 1282 1292 1602 2552 2562 2572 5112 5122 5132 6002 7002 8002 svds.m 1.6 10.8 20.5 12.6 44.2 91.1 230.9 96.9 179.3 819.2 2170.8 871.7 7977.2 20269 7887.2 10841.4 15048.8 Multi-Scale 1.5 4.9 5.5 5.1 13.1 20.4 35.2 20.9 34.4 90.3 188.7 93.3 458.8 739.3 461.9 644.2 1162.4 1936.6 Speedup 1.1 2.2 3.7 2.5 3.4 4.5 6.6 4.6 5.2 9.1 11.5 9.3 17.4 27.4 17.1 16.8 12.9 variations in the difﬁculty of the speciﬁc eigenvalue problem (eg. nearly multiple eigenvalues). The hierarchical representation has proven to be effective in a min-cut based segmentation algorithm that we proposed recently [8]. Here we explored the use of random walks and associated spectral embedding techniques for the automatic generation of suitable proposal (source and sink) regions for a min-cut based algorithm. The multiscale algorithm was used to generate the 40 leading eigenvectors of large transition matrices (eg. size 20K × 20K). In terms of future work, it will be useful to compare our work with other approximate methods for SVD such as [23]. Ack: We thank S. Roweis, F. Estrada and M. Sakr for valuable comments.

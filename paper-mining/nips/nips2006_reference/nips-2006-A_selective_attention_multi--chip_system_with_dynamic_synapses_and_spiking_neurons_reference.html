<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2006-18-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3028-a-selective-attention-multi-chip-system-with-dynamic-synapses-and-spiking-neurons.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: Selective attention is the strategy used by biological sensory systems to solve the problem of limited parallel processing capacity: salient subregions of the input stimuli are serially processed, while non–salient regions are suppressed. We present an mixed mode analog/digital Very Large Scale Integration implementation of a building block for a multi–chip neuromorphic hardware model of selective attention. We describe the chip’s architecture and its behavior, when its is part of a multi–chip system with a spiking retina as input, and show how it can be used to implement in real-time ﬂexible models of bottom-up attention. 1</p><br/>

The setup, stimulus and ﬁgure content are the same as in Fig. 4. (a) We turn on the WTA competition, and the hysteretic self-excitation. The retina activity is unchanged, the node Vnet now reﬂects the input current from the synapse, and also the contribution of the hysteretic current: when the monitored pixel wins the competition for saliency a current is fed in the input node, and Vnet does not reset to its resting value when the synapse is not active. Now there is only one active neuron in the whole chip, when it does not win the competition for saliency the hysteretic current fades away and another neuron begins spiking. (b) We turn on the inhibitory synapse that implements the self-inhibition (IOR). We can observe the effect of the inhibitory current subtracted from the input node (see text) on Vnet , that with the same input as before sets back to its resting level much faster. The raster plot shows how this mechanism allows to deselect the current winner and select other inputs.</p>

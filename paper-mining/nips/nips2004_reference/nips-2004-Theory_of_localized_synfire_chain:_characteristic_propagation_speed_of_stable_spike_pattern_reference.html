<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2004-194-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2697-theory-of-localized-synfire-chain-characteristic-propagation-speed-of-stable-spike-pattern.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Kosuke Hamaguchi, Masato Okada, Kazuyuki Aihara</p><p>Abstract: Repeated spike patterns have often been taken as evidence for the synﬁre chain, a phenomenon that a stable spike synchrony propagates through a feedforward network. Inter-spike intervals which represent a repeated spike pattern are inﬂuenced by the propagation speed of a spike packet. However, the relation between the propagation speed and network structure is not well understood. While it is apparent that the propagation speed depends on the excitatory synapse strength, it might also be related to spike patterns. We analyze a feedforward network with Mexican-Hattype connectivity (FMH) using the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that both a uniform and a localized spike packet are stable in the FMH in a certain parameter region. We also demonstrate that the propagation speed depends on the distinct ﬁring patterns in the same network.</p><br/>

Two attractors in high r1 region (Localized) and high r0 with r1 = 0 region (Uniform) are shown. A sequence of arrows indicates the evolution of ¯ a spike packet in the (r0 , σ/τ, r1 ) space. B: Plot of propagation time ∆t that is necessary time for a spike packet to propagate one neural layer. These results indicate that localized spike packets propagate slower than the uniform ones.</p>

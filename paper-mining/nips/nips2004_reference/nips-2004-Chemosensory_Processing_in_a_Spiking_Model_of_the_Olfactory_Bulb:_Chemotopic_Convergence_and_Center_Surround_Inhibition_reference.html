A self-organizing model of receptor convergence onto glomeruli is used to generate a spatially organized map, an olfactory image. This map serves as input to a lattice of spiking neurons with lateral connections. The dynamics of this recurrent network transforms the initial olfactory image into a spatio-temporal pattern that evolves and stabilizes into odor- and intensity-coding attractors. The model is validated using experimental data from an array of temperature-modulated gas sensors. Our results are consistent with recent neurobiological findings on the antennal lobe of the honeybee and the locust. 1 In trod u ction An artificial olfactory system comprises of an array of cross-selective chemical sensors followed by a pattern recognition engine. An elegant alternative for the processing of sensor-array signals, normally performed with statistical pattern recognition techniques [1], involves adopting solutions from the biological olfactory system. The use of neuromorphic approaches provides an opportunity for formulating new computational problems in machine olfaction, including mixture segmentation, background suppression, olfactory habituation, and odor-memory associations. A biologically inspired approach to machine olfaction involves (1) identifying key signal processing primitives in the olfactory pathway, (2) adapting these primitives to account for the unique properties of chemical sensor signals, and (3) applying the models to solving specific computational problems. The biological olfactory pathway can be divided into three general stages: (i) olfactory epithelium, where primary reception takes place, (ii) olfactory bulb (OB), where the bulk of signal processing is performed and, (iii) olfactory cortex, where odor associations are stored. A review of literature on olfactory signal processing reveals six key primitives in the olfactory pathway that can be adapted for use in machine olfaction. These primitives are: (a) chemical transduction into a combinatorial code by a large population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORN), (b) chemotopic convergence of ORN axons onto glomeruli (GL), (c) logarithmic compression through lateral inhibition at the GL level by periglomerular interneurons, (d) contrast enhancement through lateral inhibition of mitral (M) projection neurons by granule interneurons, (e) storage and association of odor memories in the piriform cortex, and (f) bulbar modulation through cortical feedback [2, 3]. This article presents a model that captures the first three abovementioned primitives: population coding, chemotopic convergence and contrast enhancement. The model operates as follows. First, a large population of cross-selective pseudosensors is generated from an array of metal-oxide (MOS) gas sensors by means of temperature modulation. Next, a self-organizing model of convergence is used to cluster these pseudo-sensors according to their relative selectivity. This clustering generates an initial spatial odor map at the GL layer. Finally, a lattice of spiking neurons with center on-off surround lateral connections is used to transform the GL map into identity- and intensity-specific attractors. The model is validated using a database of temperature-modulated sensor patterns from three analytes at three concentration levels. The model is shown to address the first problem in biologically-inspired machine olfaction: intensity and identity coding of a chemical stimulus in a manner consistent with neurobiology [4, 5]. 2 M o d e l i n g c h e m o t opi c c o n v e r g e n c e The projection of sensory signals onto the olfactory bulb is organized such that ORNs expressing the same receptor gene converge onto one or a few GLs [3]. This convergence transforms the initial combinatorial code into an organized spatial pattern (i.e., an olfactory image). In addition, massive convergence improves the signal to noise ratio by integrating signals from multiple receptor neurons [6]. When incorporating this principle into machine olfaction, a fundamental difference between the artificial and biological counterparts must be overcome: the input dimensionality at the receptor/sensor level. The biological olfactory system employs a large population of ORNs (over 100 million in humans, replicated from 1,000 primary receptor types), whereas its artificial analogue uses a few chemical sensors (commonly one replica of up to 32 different sensor types). To bridge this gap, we employ a sensor excitation technique known as temperature modulation [7]. MOS sensors are conventionally driven in an isothermal fashion by maintaining a constant temperature. However, the selectivity of these devices is a function of the operating temperature. Thus, capturing the sensor response at multiple temperatures generates a wealth of additional information as compared to the isothermal mode of operation. If the temperature is modulated slow enough (e.g., mHz), the behavior of the sensor at each point in the temperature cycle can then be treated as a pseudo-sensor, and thus used to simulate a large population of cross-selective ORNs (refer to Figure 1(a)). To model chemotopic convergence, these temperature-modulated pseudo-sensors (referred to as ORNs in what follows) must be clustered according to their selectivity [8]. As a first approximation, each ORN can be modeled by an affinity vector [9] consisting of the responses across a set of C analytes: r K i = K i1 , K i2 ,..., K iC (1) [ ] where K ia is the response of the ith ORN to analyte a. The selectivity of this ORN r is then defined by the orientation of the affinity vector Κ i . A close look at the OB also shows that neighboring GLs respond to similar odors [10]. Therefore, we model the ORN-GL projection with a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) [11]. In our model, the SOM is trained to model the distribution of r ORNs in chemical sensitivity space, defined by the affinity vector Κ i . Once the training of the SOM is completed, each ORN is assigned to the closest SOM node (a simulated GL) in affinity space, thereby forming a convergence map. The response of each GL can then be computed as Ga = σ j (∑ N i =1 Wij ⋅ ORN ia ) (2) where ORN ia is the response of pseudo-sensor i to analyte a, Wij=1 if pseudo-sensor i converges to GL j and zero otherwise, and σ (⋅) is a squashing sigmoidal function that models saturation. This convergence model works well under the assumption that the different sensory inputs are reasonably uncorrelated. Unfortunately, most gas sensors are extremely collinear. As a result, this convergence model degenerates into a few dominant GLs that capture most of the sensory activity, and a large number of dormant GLs that do not receive any projections. To address this issue, we employ a form of competition known as conscience learning [12], which incorporates a habituation mechanism to prevent certain SOM nodes from dominating the competition. In this scheme, the fraction of times that a particular SOM node wins the competition is used as a bias to favor non-winning nodes. This results in a spreading of the ORN projections to neighboring units and, therefore, significantly reduces the number of dormant units. We measure the performance of the convergence mapping with the entropy across the lattice, H = −∑ Pi log Pi , where Pi is the fraction of ORNs that project to SOM node i [13]. To compare Kohonen and conscience learning, we built convergence mappings with 3,000 pseudo-sensors and 400 GL units (refer to section 4 for details). The theoretical maximum of the entropy for this network, which corresponds to a uniform distribution, is 8.6439. When trained with Kohonen’s algorithm, the entropy of the SOM is 7.3555. With conscience learning, the entropy increases to 8.2280. Thus, conscience is an effective mechanism to improve the spreading of ORN projections across the GL lattice. 3 M o d e l i n g t h e o l f a c t o r y b u l b n e t wo r k Mitral cells, which synapse ORNs at the GL level, transform the initial olfactory image into a spatio-temporal code by means of lateral inhibition. Two roles have been suggested for this lateral inhibition: (a) sharpening of the molecular tuning range of individual M cells with respect to that of their corresponding ORNs [10], and (b) global redistribution of activity, such that the bulb-wide representation of an odorant, rather than the individual tuning ranges, becomes specific and concise over time [3]. More recently, center on-off surround inhibitory connections have been found in the OB [14]. These circuits have been suggested to perform pattern normalization, noise reduction and contrast enhancement of the spatial patterns. We model each M cell using a leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neuron [15]. The input current I(t) and change in membrane potential u(t) of a neuron are given by: I (t ) = du u (t ) +C dt R (3) du τ = −u (t ) + R ⋅ I (t ) [τ = RC ] dt Each M cell receives current Iinput from ORNs and current Ilateral from lateral connections with other M cells: I input ( j ) = ∑Wij ⋅ ORNi i (4) I lateral ( j , t ) = ∑ Lkj ⋅ α (k , t − 1) k where Wij indicates the presence/absence of a synapse between ORNi and Mj, as determined by the chemotopic mapping, Lkj is the efficacy of the lateral connection between Mk and Mj, and α(k,t-1) is the post-synaptic current generated by a spike at Mk: α (k , t − 1) = − g (k , t − 1) ⋅ [u ( j, t − 1) + − Esyn ] (5) g(k,t-1) is the conductance of the synapse between Mk and Mj at time t-1, u(j,t-1) is the membrane potential of Mj at time t-1 and the + subscript indicates this value becomes zero if negative, and Esyn is the reverse synaptic potential. The change in conductance of post-synaptic membrane is: & g (k , t ) = dg (k , t ) − g (k , t ) = + z (k , t ) dt τ syn & z (k , t ) = dz (k , t ) − z ( k , t ) = + g norm ⋅ spk ( k , t ) dt τ syn (6) where z(.) and g(.) are low pass filters of the form exp(-t/τsyn) and t ⋅ exp(−t / τ syn ) , respectively, τsyn is the synaptic time constant, gnorm is a normalization constant, and spk(j,t) marks the occurrence of a spike in neuron i at time t: 1 u ( j , t ) = Vspike  spk ( j , t ) =   0 u ( j , t ) ≠ Vspike  (7) Combining equations (3) and (4), the membrane potential can be expressed as: du ( j , t ) − u ( j, t ) I lateral ( j, t ) I input ( j ) = + + dt RC C C & u ( j , t − 1) + u ( j , t − 1) ⋅ dt u ( j, t ) < Vthreshold  u ( j, t ) =   Vspike u ( j, t ) ≥ Vthreshold   & u ( j, t ) = (8) When the membrane potential reaches Vthreshold, a spike is generated, and the membrane potential is reset to Vrest. Any further inputs to the neuron are ignored during the subsequent refractory period. Following [14], lateral interactions are modeled with a center on-off surround matrix Lij. Each M cell makes excitatory synapses to nearby M cells (d</p><br/>

<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Chaitanya Ekanadham, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the cortex, a number of algorithms have recently been proposed that try to learn hierarchical, or “deep,” structure from unlabeled data. While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their ﬁdelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Speciﬁcally, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the ﬁrst layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge ﬁlters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive ﬁelds. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the ﬁrst layer responses in the data. Speciﬁcally, it picks up both colinear (“contour”) features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex “corner” features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu’s study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features. 1</p><p>3 0.26701689 <a title="180-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Modeling_image_patches_with_a_directed_hierarchy_of_Markov_random_fields.html">132 nips-2007-Modeling image patches with a directed hierarchy of Markov random fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Osindero, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe an efﬁcient learning procedure for multilayer generative models that combine the best aspects of Markov random ﬁelds and deep, directed belief nets. The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images. 1</p><p>4 0.2208823 <a title="180-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-On_Sparsity_and_Overcompleteness_in_Image_Models.html">145 nips-2007-On Sparsity and Overcompleteness in Image Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Pietro Berkes, Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Computational models of visual cortex, and in particular those based on sparse coding, have enjoyed much recent attention. Despite this currency, the question of how sparse or how over-complete a sparse representation should be, has gone without principled answer. Here, we use Bayesian model-selection methods to address these questions for a sparse-coding model based on a Student-t prior. Having validated our methods on toy data, we ﬁnd that natural images are indeed best modelled by extremely sparse distributions; although for the Student-t prior, the associated optimal basis size is only modestly over-complete. 1</p><p>5 0.2136212 <a title="180-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes.html">212 nips-2007-Using Deep Belief Nets to Learn Covariance Kernels for Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We show how to use unlabeled data and a deep belief net (DBN) to learn a good covariance kernel for a Gaussian process. We ﬁrst learn a deep generative model of the unlabeled data using the fast, greedy algorithm introduced by [7]. If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classiﬁcation can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively ﬁne-tune the covariance kernel.</p><p>6 0.16035967 <a title="180-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Horizontal_Connections_in_a_Sparse_Coding_Model_of_Natural_Images.html">111 nips-2007-Learning Horizontal Connections in a Sparse Coding Model of Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that adapting a dictionary of basis functions to the statistics of natural images so as to maximize sparsity in the coefﬁcients results in a set of dictionary elements whose spatial properties resemble those of V1 (primary visual cortex) receptive ﬁelds. However, the resulting sparse coefﬁcients still exhibit pronounced statistical dependencies, thus violating the independence assumption of the sparse coding model. Here, we propose a model that attempts to capture the dependencies among the basis function coefﬁcients by including a pairwise coupling term in the prior over the coefﬁcient activity states. When adapted to the statistics of natural images, the coupling terms learn a combination of facilitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring basis functions. These learned interactions may offer an explanation for the function of horizontal connections in V1 in terms of a prior over natural images.</p><p>5 0.57330877 <a title="180-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-On_Sparsity_and_Overcompleteness_in_Image_Models.html">145 nips-2007-On Sparsity and Overcompleteness in Image Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to model relational data on edges of networks. We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics. We develop an efﬁcient learning algorithm that can handle a large number of observations. The experimental results on several real-world data sets verify superior learning capacity. 1</p><p>2 0.84777856 <a title="180-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Collapsed_Variational_Inference_for_HDP.html">47 nips-2007-Collapsed Variational Inference for HDP</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.82933933 <a title="180-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Semi-Supervised_Multitask_Learning.html">175 nips-2007-Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiuhua Liu, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A semi-supervised multitask learning (MTL) framework is presented, in which M parameterized semi-supervised classiﬁers, each associated with one of M partially labeled data manifolds, are learned jointly under the constraint of a softsharing prior imposed over the parameters of the classiﬁers. The unlabeled data are utilized by basing classiﬁer learning on neighborhoods, induced by a Markov random walk over a graph representation of each manifold. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that semi-supervised MTL yields signiﬁcant improvements in generalization performance over either semi-supervised single-task learning (STL) or supervised MTL. 1</p><p>4 0.81286848 <a title="180-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_ROC_Curve_for_a_Combination_of_Classifiers.html">149 nips-2007-Optimal ROC Curve for a Combination of Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Barreno, Alvaro Cardenas, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: We present a new analysis for the combination of binary classiﬁers. Our analysis makes use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma as a theoretical basis to analyze combinations of classiﬁers. We give a method for ﬁnding the optimal decision rule for a combination of classiﬁers and prove that it has the optimal ROC curve. We show how our method generalizes and improves previous work on combining classiﬁers and generating ROC curves. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.78819919 <a title="180-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>6 0.71775055 <a title="180-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Infinite_State_Bayes-Nets_for_Structured_Domains.html">105 nips-2007-Infinite State Bayes-Nets for Structured Domains</a></p>

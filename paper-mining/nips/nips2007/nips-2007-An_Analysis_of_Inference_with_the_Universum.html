<p>Author: Krishnan Kumar, Chiru Bhattacharya, Ramesh Hariharan</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of randomized algorithms for large scale SVM learning. The key contribution of the paper is to show that, by using ideas random projections, the minimal number of support vectors required to solve almost separable classiﬁcation problems, such that the solution obtained is near optimal with a very high probability, is given by O(log n); if on removal of properly chosen O(log n) points the data becomes linearly separable then it is called almost separable. The second contribution is a sampling based algorithm, motivated from randomized algorithms, which solves a SVM problem by considering subsets of the dataset which are greater in size than the number of support vectors for the problem. These two ideas are combined to obtain an algorithm for SVM classiﬁcation problems which performs the learning by considering only O(log n) points at a time. Experiments done on synthetic and real life datasets show that the algorithm does scale up state of the art SVM solvers in terms of memory required and execution time without loss in accuracy. It is to be noted that the algorithm presented here nicely complements existing large scale SVM learning approaches as it can be used to scale up any SVM solver. 1</p><p>3 0.15834798 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Learning_with_Invariances.html">62 nips-2007-Convex Learning with Invariances</a></p>
<p>Author: Choon H. Teo, Amir Globerson, Sam T. Roweis, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating invariances into a learning algorithm is a common problem in machine learning. We provide a convex formulation which can deal with arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary losses. In addition, it is a drop-in replacement for most optimization algorithms for kernels, including solvers of the SVMStruct family. The advantage of our setting is that it relies on column generation instead of modifying the underlying optimization problem directly. 1</p><p>4 0.14448655 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Invariant_Common_Spatial_Patterns%3A_Alleviating_Nonstationarities_in_Brain-Computer_Interfacing.html">106 nips-2007-Invariant Common Spatial Patterns: Alleviating Nonstationarities in Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Blankertz, Motoaki Kawanabe, Ryota Tomioka, Friederike Hohlefeld, Klaus-Robert Müller, Vadim V. Nikulin</p><p>Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces can suffer from a large variance of the subject conditions within and across sessions. For example vigilance ﬂuctuations in the individual, variable task involvement, workload etc. alter the characteristics of EEG signals and thus challenge a stable BCI operation. In the present work we aim to deﬁne features based on a variant of the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm that are constructed invariant with respect to such nonstationarities. We enforce invariance properties by adding terms to the denominator of a Rayleigh coefﬁcient representation of CSP such as disturbance covariance matrices from ﬂuctuations in visual processing. In this manner physiological prior knowledge can be used to shape the classiﬁcation engine for BCI.

<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>6 0.13918319 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_with_Transformation_Invariant_Kernels.html">118 nips-2007-Learning with Transformation Invariant Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Walder, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers kernels invariant to translation, rotation and dilation. We show that no non-trivial positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels exist which are radial and dilation invariant, only conditionally positive deﬁnite (c.p.d.) ones. Accordingly, we discuss the c.p.d. case and provide some novel analysis, including an elementary derivation of a c.p.d. representer theorem. On the practical side, we give a support vector machine (s.v.m.) algorithm for arbitrary c.p.d. kernels. For the thinplate kernel this leads to a classiﬁer with only one parameter (the amount of regularisation), which we demonstrate to be as effective as an s.v.m. with the Gaussian kernel, even though the Gaussian involves a second parameter (the length scale). 1</p><p>5 0.63039094 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Randomized_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Support_Vector_Learning.html">10 nips-2007-A Randomized Algorithm for Large Scale Support Vector Learning</a></p>

Our model extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and incorporates the intuition that words’ distributions over tags, p(t|w), are sparse. In addition we introduce a model for determining the set of possible tags of a word which captures important dependencies in the ambiguity classes of words. Our model outperforms the best previously proposed model for this task on a standard dataset. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7844336 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-An_Analysis_of_Inference_with_the_Universum.html">24 nips-2007-An Analysis of Inference with the Universum</a></p>

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Harald Steck, R. B. Rao, Rómer Rosales</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, unlike some previous multi-view learning methods. Furthermore, it can automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted, and thus accommodate noisy or unreliable views. Experiments on toy data and real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach. 1</p><p>4 0.69385284 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Invariant_Common_Spatial_Patterns%3A_Alleviating_Nonstationarities_in_Brain-Computer_Interfacing.html">106 nips-2007-Invariant Common Spatial Patterns: Alleviating Nonstationarities in Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></p>

As a proof of concept we present a BCI classiﬁer that is robust to changes in the level of parietal α -activity. In other words, the EEG decoding still works when there are lapses in vigilance.</p><p>5 0.69296122 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Catching_Change-points_with_Lasso.html">43 nips-2007-Catching Change-points with Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Céline Levy-leduc, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for dealing with the estimation of the location of change-points in one-dimensional piecewise constant signals observed in white noise. Our approach consists in reframing this task in a variable selection context. We use a penalized least-squares criterion with a 1 -type penalty for this purpose. We prove some theoretical results on the estimated change-points and on the underlying piecewise constant estimated function. Then, we explain how to implement this method in practice by combining the LAR algorithm and a reduced version of the dynamic programming algorithm and we apply it to synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>6 0.69277608 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Hippocampal_Contributions_to_Control%3A_The_Third_Way.html">100 nips-2007-Hippocampal Contributions to Control: The Third Way</a></p>

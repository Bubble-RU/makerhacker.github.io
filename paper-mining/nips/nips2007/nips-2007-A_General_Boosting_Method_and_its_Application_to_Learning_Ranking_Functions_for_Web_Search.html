<p>Author: Ping Li, Qiang Wu, Christopher J. Burges</p><p>Abstract: We cast the ranking problem as (1) multiple classiﬁcation (“Mc”) (2) multiple ordinal classiﬁcation, which lead to computationally tractable learning algorithms for relevance ranking in Web search. We consider the DCG criterion (discounted cumulative gain), a standard quality measure in information retrieval. Our approach is motivated by the fact that perfect classiﬁcations result in perfect DCG scores and the DCG errors are bounded by classiﬁcation errors. We propose using the Expected Relevance to convert class probabilities into ranking scores. The class probabilities are learned using a gradient boosting tree algorithm. Evaluations on large-scale datasets show that our approach can improve LambdaRank [5] and the regressions-based ranker [6], in terms of the (normalized) DCG scores. An efﬁcient implementation of the boosting tree algorithm is also presented.</p><p>3 0.22281523 <a title="6-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Evaluating_Search_Engines_by_Modeling_the_Relationship_Between_Relevance_and_Clicks.html">83 nips-2007-Evaluating Search Engines by Modeling the Relationship Between Relevance and Clicks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Carterette, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model that leverages the millions of clicks received by web search engines to predict document relevance. This allows the comparison of ranking functions when clicks are available but complete relevance judgments are not. After an initial training phase using a set of relevance judgments paired with click data, we show that our model can predict the relevance score of documents that have not been judged. These predictions can be used to evaluate the performance of a search engine, using our novel formalization of the conﬁdence of the standard evaluation metric discounted cumulative gain (DCG), so comparisons can be made across time and datasets. This contrasts with previous methods which can provide only pair-wise relevance judgments between results shown for the same query. When no relevance judgments are available, we can identify the better of two ranked lists up to 82% of the time, and with only two relevance judgments for each query, we can identify the better ranking up to 94% of the time. While our experiments are on sponsored search results, which is the ﬁnancial backbone of web search, our method is general enough to be applicable to algorithmic web search results as well. Furthermore, we give an algorithm to guide the selection of additional documents to judge to improve conﬁdence. 1</p><p>4 0.14774442 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Active_Preference_Learning_with_Discrete_Choice_Data.html">19 nips-2007-Active Preference Learning with Discrete Choice Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Brochu Eric, Nando D. Freitas, Abhijeet Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active learning algorithm that learns a continuous valuation model from discrete preferences. The algorithm automatically decides what items are best presented to an individual in order to ﬁnd the item that they value highly in as few trials as possible, and exploits quirks of human psychology to minimize time and cognitive burden. To do this, our algorithm maximizes the expected improvement at each query without accurately modelling the entire valuation surface, which would be needlessly expensive. The problem is particularly difﬁcult because the space of choices is inﬁnite. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to related active learning methods. We also embed the algorithm within a decision making tool for assisting digital artists in rendering materials. The tool ﬁnds the best parameters while minimizing the number of queries. 1</p><p>5 0.14382274 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Regularized_Boost_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">166 nips-2007-Regularized Boost for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shihai Wang</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised inductive learning concerns how to learn a decision rule from a data set containing both labeled and unlabeled data. Several boosting algorithms have been extended to semi-supervised learning with various strategies. To our knowledge, however, none of them takes local smoothness constraints among data into account during ensemble learning. In this paper, we introduce a local smoothness regularizer to semi-supervised boosting algorithms based on the universal optimization framework of margin cost functionals. Our regularizer is applicable to existing semi-supervised boosting algorithms to improve their generalization and speed up their training. Comparative results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our local smoothness regularizer. We discuss relevant issues and relate our regularizer to previous work. 1</p><p>6 0.13630237 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Boosting_the_Area_under_the_ROC_Curve.html">39 nips-2007-Boosting the Area under the ROC Curve</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, i.e. learning from both labeled and unlabeled data has received signiﬁcant attention in the machine learning literature in recent years. Still our understanding of the theoretical foundations of the usefulness of unlabeled data remains somewhat limited. The simplest and the best understood situation is when the data is described by an identiﬁable mixture model, and where each class comes from a pure component. This natural setup and its implications ware analyzed in [11, 5]. One important result was that in certain regimes, labeled data becomes exponentially more valuable than unlabeled data. However, in most realistic situations, one would not expect that the data comes from a parametric mixture distribution with identiﬁable components. There have been recent efforts to analyze the non-parametric situation, for example, “cluster” and “manifold” assumptions have been suggested as a basis for analysis. Still, a satisfactory and fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nonparametric problem, similar to that in [11, 5] has not yet been developed. In this paper we investigate an intermediate situation, when the data comes from a probability distribution, which can be modeled, but not perfectly, by an identiﬁable mixture distribution. This seems applicable to many situation, when, for example, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model the data. the contribution of this paper is an analysis of the role of labeled and unlabeled data depending on the amount of imperfection in the model.</p><p>3 0.72098845 <a title="6-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-A_Unified_Near-Optimal_Estimator_For_Dimension_Reduction_in_%24l_%5Calpha%24_%28%240%3C%5Calpha%5Cleq_2%24%29_Using_Stable_Random_Projections.html">13 nips-2007-A Unified Near-Optimal Estimator For Dimension Reduction in $l \alpha$ ($0<\alpha\leq 2$) Using Stable Random Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks (e.g., clustering) in machine learning only require the lα distances instead of the original data. For dimension reductions in the lα norm (0 < α ≤ 2), the method of stable random projections can efﬁciently compute the lα distances in massive datasets (e.g., the Web or massive data streams) in one pass of the data. The estimation task for stable random projections has been an interesting topic. We propose a simple estimator based on the fractional power of the samples (projected data), which is surprisingly near-optimal in terms of the asymptotic variance. In fact, it achieves the Cram´ r-Rao bound when α = 2 and α = 0+. This e new result will be useful when applying stable random projections to distancebased clustering, classiﬁcations, kernels, massive data streams etc.</p><p>4 0.71766764 <a title="6-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a new, convex relaxation of an expectation-maximization (EM) variant that approximates a standard objective while eliminating local minima. First, a cautionary result is presented, showing that any convex relaxation of EM over hidden variables must give trivial results if any dependence on the missing values is retained. Although this appears to be a strong negative outcome, we then demonstrate how the problem can be bypassed by using equivalence relations instead of value assignments over hidden variables. In particular, we develop new algorithms for estimating exponential conditional models that only require equivalence relation information over the variable values. This reformulation leads to an exact expression for EM variants in a wide range of problems. We then develop a semideﬁnite relaxation that yields global training by eliminating local minima. 1</p><p>5 0.71390802 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Co-Training.html">32 nips-2007-Bayesian Co-Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Harald Steck, R. B. Rao, Rómer Rosales</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, unlike some previous multi-view learning methods. Furthermore, it can automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted, and thus accommodate noisy or unreliable views. Experiments on toy data and real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach. 1</p><p>6 0.71351206 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Theoretical_Analysis_of_Heuristic_Search_Methods_for_Online_POMDPs.html">204 nips-2007-Theoretical Analysis of Heuristic Search Methods for Online POMDPs</a></p>

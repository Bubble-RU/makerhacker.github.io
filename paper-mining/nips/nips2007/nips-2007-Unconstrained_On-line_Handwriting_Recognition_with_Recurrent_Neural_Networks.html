<p>Author: Kristina Toutanova, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel Bayesian model for semi-supervised part-of-speech tagging. Our model extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and incorporates the intuition that words’ distributions over tags, p(t|w), are sparse. In addition we introduce a model for determining the set of possible tags of a word which captures important dependencies in the ambiguity classes of words. Our model outperforms the best previously proposed model for this task on a standard dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.17767116 <a title="210-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Keyword_Selection_Using_Support_Vector_Machines.html">71 nips-2007-Discriminative Keyword Selection Using Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Fred Richardson, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in speech processing involve classiﬁcation of long term characteristics of a speech segment such as language, speaker, dialect, or topic. A natural technique for determining these characteristics is to ﬁrst convert the input speech into a sequence of tokens such as words, phones, etc. From these tokens, we can then look for distinctive sequences, keywords, that characterize the speech. In many applications, a set of distinctive keywords may not be known a priori. In this case, an automatic method of building up keywords from short context units such as phones is desirable. We propose a method for the construction of keywords based upon Support Vector Machines. We cast the problem of keyword selection as a feature selection problem for n-grams of phones. We propose an alternating ﬁlter-wrapper method that builds successively longer keywords. Application of this method to language recognition and topic recognition tasks shows that the technique produces interesting and signiﬁcant qualitative and quantitative results.</p><p>4 0.097562537 <a title="210-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-HM-BiTAM%3A_Bilingual_Topic_Exploration%2C_Word_Alignment%2C_and_Translation.html">95 nips-2007-HM-BiTAM: Bilingual Topic Exploration, Word Alignment, and Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Zhao, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel paradigm for statistical machine translation (SMT), based on a joint modeling of word alignment and the topical aspects underlying bilingual document-pairs, via a hidden Markov Bilingual Topic AdMixture (HM-BiTAM). In this paradigm, parallel sentence-pairs from a parallel document-pair are coupled via a certain semantic-ﬂow, to ensure coherence of topical context in the alignment of mapping words between languages, likelihood-based training of topic-dependent translational lexicons, as well as in the inference of topic representations in each language. The learned HM-BiTAM can not only display topic patterns like methods such as LDA [1], but now for bilingual corpora; it also offers a principled way of inferring optimal translation using document context. Our method integrates the conventional model of HMM — a key component for most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems, with the recently proposed BiTAM model [10]; we report an extensive empirical analysis (in many ways complementary to the description-oriented [10]) of our method in three aspects: bilingual topic representation, word alignment, and translation.</p><p>5 0.093582816 <a title="210-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Mining_Internet-Scale_Software_Repositories.html">129 nips-2007-Mining Internet-Scale Software Repositories</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik Linstead, Paul Rigor, Sushil Bajracharya, Cristina Lopes, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Large repositories of source code create new challenges and opportunities for statistical machine learning. Here we ﬁrst develop Sourcerer, an infrastructure for the automated crawling, parsing, and database storage of open source software. Sourcerer allows us to gather Internet-scale source code. For instance, in one experiment, we gather 4,632 java projects from SourceForge and Apache totaling over 38 million lines of code from 9,250 developers. Simple statistical analyses of the data ﬁrst reveal robust power-law behavior for package, SLOC, and lexical containment distributions. We then develop and apply unsupervised author-topic, probabilistic models to automatically discover the topics embedded in the code and extract topic-word and author-topic distributions. In addition to serving as a convenient summary for program function and developer activities, these and other related distributions provide a statistical and information-theoretic basis for quantifying and analyzing developer similarity and competence, topic scattering, and document tangling, with direct applications to software engineering. Finally, by combining software textual content with structural information captured by our CodeRank approach, we are able to signiﬁcantly improve software retrieval performance, increasing the AUC metric to 0.84– roughly 10-30% better than previous approaches based on text alone.

<p>Author: Alexandre Bouchard-côté, Percy Liang, Dan Klein, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic approach to language change in which word forms are represented by phoneme sequences that undergo stochastic edits along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. This framework combines the advantages of the classical comparative method with the robustness of corpus-based probabilistic models. We use this framework to explore the consequences of two different schemes for deﬁning probabilistic models of phonological change, evaluating these schemes by reconstructing ancient word forms of Romance languages. The result is an efﬁcient inference procedure for automatically inferring ancient word forms from modern languages, which can be generalized to support inferences about linguistic phylogenies. 1</p><p>5 0.48838702 <a title="210-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-HM-BiTAM%3A_Bilingual_Topic_Exploration%2C_Word_Alignment%2C_and_Translation.html">95 nips-2007-HM-BiTAM: Bilingual Topic Exploration, Word Alignment, and Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Edwin V. Bonilla, Kian M. Chai, Christopher Williams</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate multi-task learning in the context of Gaussian Processes (GP). We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a “free-form” covariance matrix over tasks. This allows for good ﬂexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assumption of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task transfer occurs. We evaluate the beneﬁts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.65161747 <a title="210-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-On_Sparsity_and_Overcompleteness_in_Image_Models.html">145 nips-2007-On Sparsity and Overcompleteness in Image Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Pietro Berkes, Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Computational models of visual cortex, and in particular those based on sparse coding, have enjoyed much recent attention. Despite this currency, the question of how sparse or how over-complete a sparse representation should be, has gone without principled answer. Here, we use Bayesian model-selection methods to address these questions for a sparse-coding model based on a Student-t prior. Having validated our methods on toy data, we ﬁnd that natural images are indeed best modelled by extremely sparse distributions; although for the Student-t prior, the associated optimal basis size is only modestly over-complete. 1</p><p>4 0.65045989 <a title="210-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-GRIFT%3A_A_graphical_model_for_inferring_visual_classification_features_from_human_data.html">93 nips-2007-GRIFT: A graphical model for inferring visual classification features from human data</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Ross, Andrew Cohen</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a new model for human visual classiﬁcation that enables the recovery of image features that explain human subjects’ performance on different visual classiﬁcation tasks. Unlike previous methods, this algorithm does not model their performance with a single linear classiﬁer operating on raw image pixels. Instead, it represents classiﬁcation as the combination of multiple feature detectors. This approach extracts more information about human visual classiﬁcation than previous methods and provides a foundation for further exploration. 1</p><p>5 0.6498158 <a title="210-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas L. Roux, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Marc Joliveau, Balázs Kégl</p><p>Abstract: We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a ﬁxed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes, but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.</p><p>6 0.64896196 <a title="210-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Better_than_least_squares%3A_comparison_of_objective_functions_for_estimating_linear-nonlinear_models.html">36 nips-2007-Better than least squares: comparison of objective functions for estimating linear-nonlinear models</a></p>

<p>Author: Céline Levy-leduc, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for dealing with the estimation of the location of change-points in one-dimensional piecewise constant signals observed in white noise. Our approach consists in reframing this task in a variable selection context. We use a penalized least-squares criterion with a 1 -type penalty for this purpose. We prove some theoretical results on the estimated change-points and on the underlying piecewise constant estimated function. Then, we explain how to implement this method in practice by combining the LAR algorithm and a reduced version of the dynamic programming algorithm and we apply it to synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>3 0.12423062 <a title="53-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-SpAM%3A_Sparse_Additive_Models.html">179 nips-2007-SpAM: Sparse Additive Models</a></p>

Our methods combine ideas from sparse linear modeling and additive nonparametric regression. We derive a method for ﬁtting the models that is effective even when the number of covariates is larger than the sample size.

<p>Author: Marie Szafranski, Yves Grandvalet, Pierre Morizet-mahoudeaux</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical penalization is a generic framework for incorporating prior information in the ﬁtting of statistical models, when the explicative variables are organized in a hierarchical structure. The penalizer is a convex functional that performs soft selection at the group level, and shrinks variables within each group. This favors solutions with few leading terms in the ﬁnal combination. The framework, originally derived for taking prior knowledge into account, is shown to be useful in linear regression, when several parameters are used to model the inﬂuence of one feature, or in kernel regression, for learning multiple kernels.

<p>Author: David P. Wipf, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular update rules used for ARD are either difﬁcult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it remains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary functions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformulation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted 1 problems. The result is an efﬁcient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature- and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promoting sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the methodology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.095504016 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Random_Projections_for_Manifold_Learning.html">161 nips-2007-Random Projections for Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Victoria Manfredi, Jim Kurose</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of adaptive sensor control in dynamic resourceconstrained sensor networks. We focus on a meteorological sensing network comprising radars that can perform sector scanning rather than always scanning 360◦ . We compare three sector scanning strategies. The sit-and-spin strategy always scans 360◦ . The limited lookahead strategy additionally uses the expected environmental state K decision epochs in the future, as predicted from Kalman ﬁlters, in its decision-making. The full lookahead strategy uses all expected future states by casting the problem as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to estimate the optimal scan strategy. We show that the main beneﬁts of using a lookahead strategy are when there are multiple meteorological phenomena in the environment, and when the maximum radius of any phenomenon is sufﬁciently smaller than the radius of the radars. We also show that there is a trade-off between the average quality with which a phenomenon is scanned and the number of decision epochs before which a phenomenon is rescanned. 1</p><p>2 0.82860154 <a title="53-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Learning_to_classify_complex_patterns_using_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">117 nips-2007-Learning to classify complex patterns using a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.73764557 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Compressed_Regression.html">53 nips-2007-Compressed Regression</a></p>

In this paper we study a variant of this problem where the original n input variables are compressed by a random linear transformation to m n examples in p dimensions, and establish conditions under which a sparse linear model can be successfully recovered from the compressed data. A primary motivation for this compression procedure is to anonymize the data and preserve privacy by revealing little information about the original data. We characterize the number of random projections that are required for 1 -regularized compressed regression to identify the nonzero coefﬁcients in the true model with probability approaching one, a property called “sparsistence.” In addition, we show that 1 -regularized compressed regression asymptotically predicts as well as an oracle linear model, a property called “persistence.” Finally, we characterize the privacy properties of the compression procedure in information-theoretic terms, establishing upper bounds on the rate of information communicated between the compressed and uncompressed data that decay to zero. 1</p><p>4 0.72602749 <a title="53-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Variational_inference_for_Markov_jump_processes.html">214 nips-2007-Variational inference for Markov jump processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: Markov jump processes play an important role in a large number of application domains. However, realistic systems are analytically intractable and they have traditionally been analysed using simulation based techniques, which do not provide a framework for statistical inference. We propose a mean ﬁeld approximation to perform posterior inference and parameter estimation. The approximation allows a practical solution to the inference problem, while still retaining a good degree of accuracy. We illustrate our approach on two biologically motivated systems.</p><p>5 0.70723379 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>
<p>Author: Massimiliano Giulioni, Mario Pannunzi, Davide Badoni, Vittorio Dante, Paolo D. Giudice</p><p>Abstract: We summarize the implementation of an analog VLSI chip hosting a network of 32 integrate-and-ﬁre (IF) neurons with spike-frequency adaptation and 2,048 Hebbian plastic bistable spike-driven stochastic synapses endowed with a selfregulating mechanism which stops unnecessary synaptic changes. The synaptic matrix can be ﬂexibly conﬁgured and provides both recurrent and AER-based connectivity with external, AER compliant devices. We demonstrate the ability of the network to efﬁciently classify overlapping patterns, thanks to the self-regulating mechanism.</p><p>6 0.70659721 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Visual_Attributes.html">113 nips-2007-Learning Visual Attributes</a></p>

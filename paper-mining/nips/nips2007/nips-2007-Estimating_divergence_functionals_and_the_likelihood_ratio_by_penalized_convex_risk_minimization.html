<p>Author: Marie Szafranski, Yves Grandvalet, Pierre Morizet-mahoudeaux</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical penalization is a generic framework for incorporating prior information in the ﬁtting of statistical models, when the explicative variables are organized in a hierarchical structure. The penalizer is a convex functional that performs soft selection at the group level, and shrinks variables within each group. This favors solutions with few leading terms in the ﬁnal combination. The framework, originally derived for taking prior knowledge into account, is shown to be useful in linear regression, when several parameters are used to model the inﬂuence of one feature, or in kernel regression, for learning multiple kernels. Keywords – Optimization: constrained and convex optimization. Supervised learning: regression, kernel methods, sparsity and feature selection. 1</p><p>3 0.091393679 <a title="82-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Overcomplete_Latent_Variable_Decomposition_of_Counts_Data.html">181 nips-2007-Sparse Overcomplete Latent Variable Decomposition of Counts Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Madhusudana Shashanka, Bhiksha Raj, Paris Smaragdis</p><p>Abstract: An important problem in many ﬁelds is the analysis of counts data to extract meaningful latent components. Methods like Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been proposed for this purpose. However, they are limited in the number of components they can extract and lack an explicit provision to control the “expressiveness” of the extracted components. In this paper, we present a learning formulation to address these limitations by employing the notion of sparsity. We start with the PLSA framework and use an entropic prior in a maximum a posteriori formulation to enforce sparsity. We show that this allows the extraction of overcomplete sets of latent components which better characterize the data. We present experimental evidence of the utility of such representations.</p><p>4 0.082981654 <a title="82-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Stable_Dual_Dynamic_Programming.html">185 nips-2007-Stable Dual Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Yingbo Song, Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: A method is proposed for semiparametric estimation where parametric and nonparametric criteria are exploited in density estimation and unsupervised learning. This is accomplished by making sampling assumptions on a dataset that smoothly interpolate between the extreme of independently distributed (or id) sample data (as in nonparametric kernel density estimators) to the extreme of independent identically distributed (or iid) sample data. This article makes independent similarly distributed (or isd) sampling assumptions and interpolates between these two using a scalar parameter. The parameter controls a Bhattacharyya afﬁnity penalty between pairs of distributions on samples. Surprisingly, the isd method maintains certain consistency and unimodality properties akin to maximum likelihood estimation. The proposed isd scheme is an alternative for handling nonstationarity in data without making drastic hidden variable assumptions which often make estimation difﬁcult and laden with local optima. Experiments in density estimation on a variety of datasets conﬁrm the value of isd over iid estimation, id estimation and mixture modeling.</p><p>3 0.62347794 <a title="82-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-How_SVMs_can_estimate_quantiles_and_the_median.html">101 nips-2007-How SVMs can estimate quantiles and the median</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We investigate quantile regression based on the pinball loss and the ǫ-insensitive loss. For the pinball loss a condition on the data-generating distribution P is given that ensures that the conditional quantiles are approximated with respect to · 1 . This result is then used to derive an oracle inequality for an SVM based on the pinball loss. Moreover, we show that SVMs based on the ǫ-insensitive loss estimate the conditional median only under certain conditions on P . 1</p><p>4 0.54500377 <a title="82-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Progressive_mixture_rules_are_deviation_suboptimal.html">159 nips-2007-Progressive mixture rules are deviation suboptimal</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean-yves Audibert</p><p>Abstract: We consider the learning task consisting in predicting as well as the best function in a ﬁnite reference set G up to the smallest possible additive term. If R(g) denotes the generalization error of a prediction function g, under reasonable assumptions on the loss function (typically satisﬁed by the least square loss when the output is bounded), it is known that the progressive mixture rule g satisﬁes ˆ log |G| (1) ER(ˆ) ≤ ming∈G R(g) + Cst g , n where n denotes the size of the training set, and E denotes the expectation w.r.t. the training set distribution.This work shows that, surprisingly, for appropriate reference sets G, the deviation convergence rate of the progressive mixture rule is √ no better than Cst / n: it fails to achieve the expected Cst /n. We also provide an algorithm which does not suffer from this drawback, and which is optimal in both deviation and expectation convergence rates. 1</p><p>5 0.50982326 <a title="82-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Catching_Up_Faster_in_Bayesian_Model_Selection_and_Model_Averaging.html">44 nips-2007-Catching Up Faster in Bayesian Model Selection and Model Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Steven D. Rooij, Peter Grünwald</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model averaging, model selection and their approximations such as BIC are generally statistically consistent, but sometimes achieve slower rates of convergence than other methods such as AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation. On the other hand, these other methods can be inconsistent. We identify the catch-up phenomenon as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of Bayesian methods. Based on this analysis we deﬁne the switch-distribution, a modiﬁcation of the Bayesian model averaging distribution. We prove that in many situations model selection and prediction based on the switch-distribution is both consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates, thereby resolving the AIC-BIC dilemma. The method is practical; we give an efﬁcient algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.49081725 <a title="82-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Overcomplete_Latent_Variable_Decomposition_of_Counts_Data.html">181 nips-2007-Sparse Overcomplete Latent Variable Decomposition of Counts Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Varsha Dani, Sham M. Kakade, Thomas P. Hayes</p><p>Abstract: In the online linear optimization problem, a learner must choose, in each round, a decision from a set D ⊂ Rn in order to minimize an (unknown and changing) linear cost function. We present sharp rates of convergence (with respect to additive regret) for both the full information setting (where the cost function is revealed at the end of each round) and the bandit setting (where only the scalar cost incurred is revealed). In particular, this paper is concerned with the price of bandit information, by which we mean the ratio of the best achievable regret in the bandit setting to that in the full-information setting. For the full informa√ tion case, the upper bound on the regret is O∗ ( nT ), where n is the ambient dimension and T is the time horizon. For the bandit case, we present an algorithm √ which achieves O∗ (n3/2 T ) regret — all previous (nontrivial) bounds here were O(poly(n)T 2/3 ) or worse. It is striking that the convergence rate for the bandit setting is only a factor of n worse than in the full information case — in stark contrast to the K-arm bandit setting, where the gap in the dependence on K is √ √ exponential ( T K√ vs. T log K). We also present lower bounds showing that this gap is at least n, which we conjecture to be the correct order. The bandit algorithm we present can be implemented efﬁciently in special cases of particular interest, such as path planning and Markov Decision Problems. 1</p><p>3 0.93857956 <a title="82-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Learning_with_Invariances.html">62 nips-2007-Convex Learning with Invariances</a></p>

We provide a convex formulation which can deal with arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary losses. In addition, it is a drop-in replacement for most optimization algorithms for kernels, including solvers of the SVMStruct family. The advantage of our setting is that it relies on column generation instead of modifying the underlying optimization problem directly. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.92964864 <a title="82-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Estimating_divergence_functionals_and_the_likelihood_ratio_by_penalized_convex_risk_minimization.html">82 nips-2007-Estimating divergence functionals and the likelihood ratio by penalized convex risk minimization</a></p>

</p><p>2 ch  Abstract We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. [sent-4, score-0.485]
</p><p>3 The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. [sent-5, score-0.771]
</p><p>4 Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. [sent-6, score-0.314]
</p><p>5 The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). [sent-7, score-0.909]
</p><p>6 We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates. [sent-8, score-0.341]
</p><p>7 Temporal patterns of spikes can be encoded with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms (e. [sent-10, score-0.37]
</p><p>8 However, STDP in its simplest form is not suitable for learning patterns of mean ﬁring rates [3], and most of the proposed STDP learning algorithms solved the problems of memory encoding and memory preservation only for relatively simple patterns of mean ﬁring rates. [sent-13, score-0.364]
</p><p>9 Recently a new model of stochastic spike-driven synaptic plasticity has been proposed [4] that is very effective in protecting old learned memories, and captures the rich phenomenology observed in neurophysiological experiments on synaptic plasticity, including STDP protocols. [sent-14, score-0.607]
</p><p>10 It has been shown that networks of spiking neurons that use this synaptic plasticity model can learn to classify complex patterns of spike trains ranging from stimuli generated by auditory/vision sensors to images of handwritten digits from the MNIST database [4]. [sent-15, score-0.958]
</p><p>11 Here we describe a neuromorphic VLSI implementation of this spike-driven synaptic plasticity model and present classiﬁcation experiments using the VLSI device that validate the model’s implementation. [sent-16, score-0.482]
</p><p>12 The silicon neurons and synapses inside the chip are implemented using full custom hybrid analog/digital circuits, and the network’s spikes are received in input and transmitted in output using asynchronous digital circuits. [sent-17, score-0.849]
</p><p>13 Each spike is represented as an Address-Event, where the address encodes either the source neuron or the destination synapse. [sent-18, score-0.375]
</p><p>14 The focus of this paper is to show that the VLSI device proposed here can successfully classify complex patterns of spike trains, producing results that are in accordance with the theoretical predictions. [sent-21, score-0.424]
</p><p>15 1  Figure 1: Layout of a test chip comprising a network of I&F; neurons and plastic synapses. [sent-22, score-0.462]
</p><p>16 The placement of a single neuron along with its synapses is highlighted in the top part of the ﬁgure. [sent-23, score-0.62]
</p><p>17 the synaptic weight cannot have an inﬁnite number of states). [sent-29, score-0.306]
</p><p>18 It has been demonstrated that the number of random uncorrelated patterns p which can be classiﬁed or stored in a network of neurons connected by bounded synapses grows only logarithmically with the number of synapses [9]. [sent-31, score-1.044]
</p><p>19 its weight has to traverse n states to go from the lower bound to the upped bound), then the number of patterns p can grow quadratically n. [sent-34, score-0.262]
</p><p>20 Therefore, an efﬁcient strategy for implementing long lasting memories in VLSI networks of spiking neurons is to use a large number of synapses with only two stable states (i. [sent-37, score-0.635]
</p><p>21 Using this strategy we can build large networks of spiking neurons with very compact learning circuits (e. [sent-41, score-0.337]
</p><p>22 By construction, these types of devices operate in a massively parallel fashion and are faulttolerant: even if a considerable fraction of the synaptic circuits is faulty due to fabrication problems, the overall functionality of the chip is not compromised. [sent-44, score-0.617]
</p><p>23 The chip comprises 16 low-power integrate-and-ﬁre (I&F;) neurons [5] and 2048 dynamic synapses. [sent-48, score-0.293]
</p><p>24 We use an AER communication infrastructure that allows the chip to receive and transmit asynchronous events (spikes) off-chip to a workstation (for data logging and prototyping) and/or to other neuromorphic event-based devices [10]. [sent-52, score-0.275]
</p><p>25 A single neuron can be connected to 128, 256, 512 or 1024 synapses. [sent-54, score-0.243]
</p><p>26 In this work we conﬁgured the chip to use all 16 neurons with 128 synapses per neuron. [sent-56, score-0.608]
</p><p>27 The synapses are divided into different functional blocks: 4 are excitatory with ﬁxed (externally adjustable) weights, 4 inhibitory and 120 excitatory with local learning circuits. [sent-57, score-0.456]
</p><p>28 Every silicon neuron in the chip can be used as a classiﬁer that separates the input patterns into two categories. [sent-58, score-0.683]
</p><p>29 The synaptic weight node w is modiﬁed when there is a pre-synaptic input (i. [sent-60, score-0.347]
</p><p>30 In parallel, the bistable circuit slowly drives the node w toward either of its two stable states depending on its amplitude. [sent-63, score-0.253]
</p><p>31 The DPI is a pulse integrator circuit that produces an Excitatory Post-Synaptic Current (IEPSC ), with an amplitude that depends on the synaptic weight w. [sent-64, score-0.499]
</p><p>32 It comprises a low-power I&F; neuron block, a DPI integrator, a voltage comparator and a three current comparators(CC). [sent-66, score-0.374]
</p><p>33 Winnertake-all (WTA) circuits are used as current comparators that set the output to be either the bias current IB , or zero. [sent-67, score-0.24]
</p><p>34 The post-synaptic neuron responds with an activity that is proportional to its net input current, generated by the input pattern weighted by the learned synaptic efﬁcacies, and by the teacher signal. [sent-71, score-0.677]
</p><p>35 If the neuron’s mean activity is in accordance with the teacher signal (typically either very high or very low), then the output neuron produces the correct response. [sent-72, score-0.453]
</p><p>36 In this case the the synapses should not be updated. [sent-73, score-0.348]
</p><p>37 Otherwise, the synapses are updated at the time of arrival of the (Poisson distributed) input spikes, and eventually make a transition to one of the two stable states. [sent-74, score-0.486]
</p><p>38 Such stochasticity, in addition to the ’stop-learning’ mechanism which prevents the synapses from being modiﬁed when the output is correct, allows each neuron to classify a wide class of highly correlated, linearly separable patterns. [sent-75, score-0.699]
</p><p>39 Furthermore, by using more than one neuron per class, it is possible to classify also complex non-linearly separable patterns [4]. [sent-76, score-0.488]
</p><p>40 3 The VLSI learning circuits The learning circuits are responsible for locally updating the synaptic weights with the spike-based learning rule proposed in [4]. [sent-77, score-0.552]
</p><p>41 Upon the arrival of a pre-synaptic spike (an address-event), the plastic synapse circuit updates its weight w according to the spike-driven learning rule. [sent-78, score-0.679]
</p><p>42 The EPSC currents of all synapses afferent to the target neuron are summed into the neuron’s membrane capacitance, and eventually the I&F; neuron’s membrane potential exceeds a threshold and the circuit generates an output spike. [sent-80, score-1.014]
</p><p>43 These weight change values are expressed in the chip as subthreshold currents. [sent-82, score-0.266]
</p><p>44 Speciﬁcally, the signal that triggers positive weight updates is represented by an IUP current, and the signal that triggers weight decreases if represented by the IDN current. [sent-83, score-0.238]
</p><p>45 The weight updates are performed locally at each synapse, in a pre-synaptic weight update module, while the ∆w values are computed globally (for each neuron), in a post-synaptic weight control module. [sent-84, score-0.24]
</p><p>46 2(a), comprises four main blocks: an input AER interfacing circuit [12], a bistable weight refresh circuit, a weight update circuit and a log-domain current-mode integrator, dubbed the “diff-pair integrator” (DPI) circuit, and fully characterized in [11]. [sent-126, score-0.544]
</p><p>47 Upon the arrival of an input event (pre-synaptic spike), the asynchronous AER interfacing circuits produce output pulses that activate switches S1 and S2. [sent-127, score-0.319]
</p><p>48 The same input event activates the DPI circuit that produces an EPSC current (IEPSC ) with an amplitude that depends on the synaptic weight value w. [sent-129, score-0.49]
</p><p>49 In parallel, the bistable weight refresh circuit slowly drives w toward one of two stable states depending on whether it is higher or lower than a set threshold value. [sent-130, score-0.383]
</p><p>50 2  Post-synaptic weight control module  This module is responsible for generating the two global signals VUP and VDN , mirrored to all synapses belonging to the same dendritic tree. [sent-133, score-0.724]
</p><p>51 Post-synaptic spikes (Vspk ), generated in the soma are integrated by an other instance of the DPI circuit to produce a current ICa proportional to the neuron’s average spiking activity. [sent-134, score-0.297]
</p><p>52 To characterize these circuits we injected a step current in the neuron, produced a regular output mean ﬁring rate, and measured the voltages VCa , VUP , and VDN (see Fig. [sent-143, score-0.287]
</p><p>53 VCa is the gate voltage of the P-FET transistor producing ICa , while VDN , VUP are the gate voltages of the P- and N-FET transistors mirroring IDN and IUP respectively (Fig. [sent-145, score-0.219]
</p><p>54 The small ∼ 300mV changes in VUP and VDN produce subthreshold currents (IUP and IDN ) that are mirrored to the synapses (Fig. [sent-152, score-0.452]
</p><p>55 3(b) the VDN and VUP signals are zoomed in along with the membrane potential of the post-synaptic neuron (Vmem ), for values of VCa ∼ 2. [sent-155, score-0.345]
</p><p>56 (a) The updates in the synaptic weight did not produce any LTP transition during the 250ms stimulus presentation. [sent-196, score-0.337]
</p><p>57 (b) The updates in the synaptic weight produced an LTP transition that remains consolidated. [sent-197, score-0.337]
</p><p>58 4 Stochastic plasticity To characterize the stochastic nature of the weight update process we stimulated the neuron’s plastic synapses with Poisson distributed spike trains. [sent-200, score-0.895]
</p><p>59 When any irregular spike train is used as a presynaptic input, the synaptic weight voltage crosses the synapse bistability threshold in a stochastic manner, and the probability of crossing the threshold depends on the input’s mean frequency. [sent-201, score-0.759]
</p><p>60 Although these frequencies were the same for both experiments, LTP occurred only in one of the two cases (compare synaptic weight changes in middle row of both panels). [sent-205, score-0.372]
</p><p>61 In this experiment we set the efﬁcacy of the “high” state of all plastic synapses to a relatively low value. [sent-206, score-0.567]
</p><p>62 In this way the neuron’s mean output ﬁring rate depends primarily on the teacher signal, irrespective of the states of plastic synapses. [sent-207, score-0.335]
</p><p>63 Such a non-monotonicity is essential to slow down and eventually stop-learning when ν post is very high or very low (indicating that the learned synaptic weights are already correctly classifying the input pattern). [sent-209, score-0.411]
</p><p>64 5 we show experimental results where we measured the LTP and LTD transitions of 60 synapses over 20 training sessions: for the LTD case (top row) we initialized the synapses to a high state (white pixel) and plotted a black pixel if its ﬁnal state was low, at the end of the training session.

<p>Author: Dejan Pecevski, Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: Reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has recently emerged as a candidate for a learning rule that could explain how local learning rules at single synapses support behaviorally relevant adaptive changes in complex networks of spiking neurons. However the potential and limitations of this learning rule could so far only be tested through computer simulations. This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allow us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will be able to achieve a desired learning effect.

<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We show that under suitable assumptions (primarily linearization) a simple and perspicuous online learning rule for Information Bottleneck optimization with spiking neurons can be derived. This rule performs on common benchmark tasks as well as a rather complex rule that has previously been proposed [1]. Furthermore, the transparency of this new learning rule makes a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties feasible. A variation of this learning rule (with sign changes) provides a theoretically founded method for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with spiking neurons. By applying this rule to an ensemble of neurons, different principal components of the input can be extracted. In addition, it is possible to preferentially extract those principal components from incoming signals X that are related or are not related to some additional target signal YT . In a biological interpretation, this target signal YT (also called relevance variable) could represent proprioceptive feedback, input from other sensory modalities, or top-down signals. 1</p><p>5 0.21761651 <a title="117-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Contraction_Properties_of_VLSI_Cooperative_Competitive_Neural_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">60 nips-2007-Contraction Properties of VLSI Cooperative Competitive Neural Networks of Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Devarajan Sridharan, Brian Percival, John Arthur, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neurobiologically plausible model to implement dynamic routing using the concept of neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The model has a three-tier architecture: a raw input tier, a routing control tier, and an invariant output tier. The correct mapping between input and output tiers is realized by an appropriate alignment of the phases of their respective background oscillations by the routing control units. We present an example architecture, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, that is able to achieve circular-shift invariance. A simple extension to our model can accomplish circular-shift dynamic routing with only O(N ) connections, compared to O(N 2 ) connections required by traditional models. 1 Dynamic Routing Circuit Models for Circular-Shift Invariance Dynamic routing circuit models are among the most prominent neural models for invariant recognition [1] (also see [2] for review). These models implement shift invariance by dynamically changing spatial connectivity to transform an object to a standard position or orientation. The connectivity between the raw input and invariant output layers is controlled by routing units, which turn certain subsets of connections on or off (Figure 1A). An important feature of this model is the explicit representation of what and where information in the main network and the routing units, respectively; the routing units use the where information to create invariant representations. Traditional solutions for shift invariance are neurobiologically implausible for at least two reasons. First, there are too many synaptic connections: for N input neurons, N output neurons and N possible input-output mappings, the network requires O(N 2 ) connections in the routing layer— between each of the N routing units and each set of N connections that that routing unit gates (Figure 1A). Second, these connections must be extremely precise: each routing unit must activate an inputoutput mapping (N individual connections) corresponding to the desired shift (as highlighted in Figure 1A). Other approaches that have been proposed, including invariant feature networks [3,4], also suffer from signiﬁcant drawbacks, such as the inability to explicitly represent where information [2]. It remains an open question how biology could achieve shift invariance without proﬂigate and precise connections. In this article, we propose a simple solution for shift invariance for quantities that are circular or periodic in nature—circular-shift invariance (CSI)—orientation invariance in vision and key invariance in music. The visual system may create orientation-invariant representations to aid recognition under conditions of object rotation or head-tilt [5,6]; a similar mechanism could be employed by the auditory system to create key-invariant representations under conditions where the same melody 1 Figure 1: Dynamic routing. A In traditional dynamic routing, connections from the (raw) input layer to the (invariant) output layer are gated by routing units. For instance, the mapping from A to 5, B to 6, . . . , F to 4 is achieved by turning on the highlighted routing unit. B In time-division multiplexing (TDM), the encoder samples input channels periodically (using a rotating switch) while the decoder sends each sample to the appropriate output channel (based on its time bin). TDM can be extended to achieve a circular-shift transformation by altering the angle between encoder and decoder switches (θ), thereby creating a rotated mapping between input and output channels (adapted from [7]). is played in different keys. Similar to orientation, which is a periodic quantity, musical notes one octave apart sound alike, a phenomenon known as octave equivalence [8]. Thus, the problems of key invariance and orientation invariance admit similar solutions. Deriving inspiration from time-division multiplexing (TDM), we propose a neural network for CSI that uses phase to encode and decode information. We modulate the temporal window of communication between (raw) input and (invariant) output neurons to achieve the appropriate input–output mapping. Extending TDM, any particular circular-shift transformation can be accomplished by changing the relative angle, θ, between the rotating switches of the encoder (that encodes the raw input in time) and decoder (that decodes the invariant output in time) (Figure 1B). This obviates the need to hardwire routing control units that speciﬁcally modulate the strength of each possible inputoutput connection, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the complexity inherent in the traditional dynamic routing solution. Similarly, a remapping between the input and output neurons can be achieved by introducing a relative phase-shift in their background oscillations. 2 Dynamic Routing through Neuronal Coherence To modulate the temporal window of communication, the model uses a ring of neurons (the oscillation ring) to select the pool of neurons (in the projection ring) that encode or decode information at a particular time (Figure 2A). Each projection pool encodes a speciﬁc value of the feature (for example, one of twelve musical notes). Upon activation by external input, each pool is active only when background inhibition generated by the oscillation ring (outer ring of neurons) is at a minimum. In addition to exciting 12 inhibitory interneurons in the projection ring, each oscillation ring neuron excites its nearest 18 neighbors in the clockwise direction around the oscillation ring. As a result, a wave of inhibition travels around the projection ring that allows only one pool to be excitable at any point in time. These neurons become excitable at roughly the same time (numbered sectors, inner ring) by virtue of recurrent excitatory intra-pool connections. Decoding is accomplished by a second tier of rings (Figure 2B). The projection ring of the ﬁrst (input) tier connects all-to-all to the projection ring of the second (output) tier. The two oscillation rings create a window of excitability for the pools of neurons in their respective projection rings. Hence, the most effective communication occurs between input and output pools that become excitable at the same time (i.e. are oscillating in phase with one another [9]). The CSI problem is solved by introducing a phase-shift between the input and output tiers. If they are exactly in phase, then an input pool is simply mapped to the output pool directly above it. If their 2 Figure 2: Double-Ring Network for Encoding and Decoding. A The projection (inner) ring is divided into (numbered) pools. The oscillation (outer) ring modulates sub-threshold activity (waveforms) of the projection ring by exciting (black distribution) inhibitory neurons that inhibit neighboring projection neurons. A wave of activity travels around the oscillation ring due to asymmetric excitatory connections, creating a corresponding wave of inhibitory activity in the projection ring, such that only one pool of projection neurons is excitable (spikes) at a given time. B Two instances of the double-ring structure from A. The input projection ring connects all-to-all to the output projection ring (dashed lines). Because each input pool will spike only during a distinct time bin, and each output pool is excitable only in a certain time bin, communication occurs between input and output pools that are oscillating in phase with each other. Appropriate phase offset between input and output oscillation rings realizes the desired circular shift (input pool H to output pool 1, solid arrow). C Interactions among pools highlighted in B. phases are different, the input is dynamically routed to an appropriate circularly shifted position in the output tier. Such changes in phase are analogous to adjusting the angle of the rotating switch at either the encoder or the decoder in TDM (see Figure 1B). There is some evidence that neural systems could employ phase relationships of subthreshold oscillations to selectively target neural populations [9-11]. 3 Implementation in Silicon We implemented this solution to CSI on a neuromorphic silicon chip [12]. The neuromorphic chip has neurons whose properties resemble that of biological neurons; these neurons even have intrinsic differences, thereby mimicking heterogeneity in real neurobiological systems. The chip uses a conductance-based spiking model for both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons project to nearby excitatory and inhibitory neurons via a diffusor network that determines the spread of inhibition. A lookup table of excitatory synaptic connectivity is stored in a separate randomaccess memory (RAM) chip. Spikes occurring on-chip are converted to a neuron address, mapped to synapses (if any) via the lookup table, and routed to the targeted on-chip synapse. A universal serial bus (USB) interface chip communicates spikes to and from a computer, for external input and 3 Figure 3: Traveling-wave activity in the oscillation ring. A Population activity (5ms bins) of a pool of eighteen (adjacent) oscillation neurons. B Increasing the strength of feedforward excitation led to increasing frequencies of periodic ﬁring in the θ and α range (1-10 Hz). Strength of excitation is the amplitude change in post-synaptic conductance due to a single pre-synaptic spike (measured relative to minimum amplitude used). data analysis, respectively. Simulations on the chip occur in real-time, making it an attractive option for implementing the model. We conﬁgured the following parameters: • Magnitude of a potassium M-current: increasing this current’s magnitude increased the post-spike repolarization time of the membrane potential, thereby constraining spiking to a single time bin per cycle. • The strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses: a correct balance had to be established between excitation and inhibition to make only a small subset of neurons in the projection rings ﬁre at a time—too much excitation led to widespread ﬁring and too much inhibition led to neurons that were entirely silent or ﬁred sporadically. • The space constant of inhibitory spread: increasing the spread was effective in preventing runaway excitation, which could occur due to the recurrent excitatory connections. We were able to create a stable traveling wave of background activity within the oscillation ring. We transiently stimulated a small subset of the neurons, which initiated a wave of activity that propagated in a stable manner around the ring after the transient external stimulation had ceased (Figure 3A). The network frequency determined from a Fourier transform of the network activity smoothed with a non-causal Gaussian kernel (FDHM = 80ms) was 7.4Hz. The frequency varied with the strength of the neurons’ excitatory connections (Figure 3B), measured as the amplitude of the step increase in membrane conductivity due to the arrival of a pre-synaptic spike. Over much of the range of the synaptic strengths tested, we observed stable oscillations in the θ and α bands (1-10Hz); the frequency appeared to increase logarithmically with synaptic strength. 4 Phase-based Encoding and Decoding In order to assess the best-case performance of the model, the background activity in the input and output projection rings was derived from the input oscillation ring. Their spikes were delivered to the appropriately circularly-shifted output oscillation neurons. The asymmetric feedforward connections were disabled in the output oscillation ring. For instance, in order to achieve a circular shift by k pools (i.e. mapping input projection pool 1 to output projection pool k + 1, input pool 2 to output pool k + 2, and so on), activity from the input oscillation neurons closest to input pool 1 was fed into the output oscillation neurons closest to output pool k. By providing the appropriate phase difference between input and output oscillation, we were able to assess the performance of the model under ideal conditions. In the Discussion section, we discuss a biologically plausible mechanism to control the relative phases. 4 Figure 4: Phase-based encoding. Rasters indicating activity of projection pools in 1ms bins, and mean phase of ﬁring (×’s) for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time). The abscissa shows ﬁring time normalized by the period of oscillation (which may be converted to ﬁring phase by multiplication by 2π). Under constant input to the input projection ring, the input pools ﬁre approximately in sequence. Two cycles of pool activity normalized by maximum ﬁring rate for each pool are shown in left inset (for clarity, pools 1-6 are shown in the top panel and pools 7-12 are shown separately in the bottom panel); phase of background inhibition of pool 4 is shown (below) for reference. Phase-aligned average1 of activity (right inset) showed that the ﬁring times were relatively tight and uniform across pools: a standard deviation of 0.0945 periods, or equivalently, a spread of 1.135 pools at any instant of time. We veriﬁed that the input projection pools ﬁred in a phase-shifted fashion relative to one another, a property critical for accurate encoding (see Figure 2). We stimulated all pools in the input projection ring simultaneously while the input oscillation ring provided a periodic wave of background inhibition. The mean phase of ﬁring for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time) increased nearly linearly with pool number, thereby providing evidence for accurate, phase-based encoding (Figure 4). The ﬁring times of all pools are shown for two cycles of background oscillatory activity (Figure 4 left inset). A phase-aligned average1 showed that the timing was relatively tight (standard deviation 1.135 pools) and uniform across pools of neurons (Figure 4 right inset). We then characterized the system’s ability to correctly decode this encoding under a given circular shift. The shift was set to seven pools, mapping input pool 1 to output pool 8, and so on. Each input pool was stimulated in turn. We expected to see only the appropriately shifted output pool become highly active. In fact, not only was this pool active, but other pools around it were also active, though to a lesser extent (Figure 5A). Thus, the phase-encoded input was decoded successfully, and circularly shifted, except that the output units were broadly tuned. To quantify the overall precision of encoding and decoding, we constructed an input-locked average of the tuning curves (Figure 5B): the curves were circularly shifted to the left by an amount corresponding to the stimulated input pool number, and the raw pool ﬁring rates were averaged. If the phase-based encoding and decoding were perfect, the peak should occur at a shift of 7 pools. 1 The phase-aligned average was constructed by shifting the pool-activity curves by the (# of the pool) × 1 ( 12 of the period) to align activity across pools, which was then averaged. 5 Figure 5: Decoding phase-encoded input. A In order to assess decoding performance under a given circular shift (here 7 pools) each input pool was stimulated in turn and activity in each output pool was recorded and averaged over 500ms. The pool’s response, normalized by its maximum ﬁring rate, is plotted for each stimulated input pool (arrows pointing to curves, color code as in Figure 4). Each input pool stimulation trial consistently resulted in peak activity in the appropriate output pool; however, adjacent pools were also active, but to a lesser extent, resulting in a broad tuning curve. B The best-ﬁt Gaussian (dot-dashed grey curve, σ = 2.30 pools) to the input-locked average of the raw pool ﬁring rates (see text for details) revealed a maximum between a shift of 7 and 8 pools (inverted grey triangle; expected peak at a shift of 7 pools). Indeed, the highest (average) ﬁring rate corresponded to a shift of 7 pools. However, the activity corresponding to a shift of 8 pools was nearly equal to that of 7 pools, and the best ﬁtting Gaussian curve to the activity histogram (grey dot-dashed line) peaked at a point between pools 7 and 8 (inverted grey triangle). The standard deviation (σ) was 2.30 pools, versus the expected ideal σ of 1.60, which corresponds to the encoding distribution (σ = 1.135 pools) convolved with itself. 5 Discussion We have demonstrated a biologically plausible mechanism for the dynamic routing of information in time that obviates the need for precise gating of connections. This mechanism requires that a wave of activity propagate around pools of neurons arranged in a ring. While previous work has described traveling waves in a ring of neurons [13], and a double ring architecture (for determining head-direction) [14], our work combines these two features (twin rings with phase-shifted traveling waves) to achieve dynamic routing. These features of the model are found in the cortex: Bonhoeffer and Grinwald [15] describe iso-orientation columns in the cat visual cortex that are arranged in ring-like pinwheel patterns, with orientation tuning changing gradually around the pinwheel center. Moreover, Rubino et al. [16] have shown that coherent oscillations can propagate as waves across the cortical surface in the motor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys performing a delayed reaching task. Our solution for CSI is also applicable to music perception. In the Western twelve-tone, equaltemperament tuning system (12-tone scale), each octave is divided into twelve logarithmicallyspaced notes. Human observers are known to construct mental representations for raw notes that are invariant of the (perceived) key of the music: a note of C heard in the key of C-Major is perceptually equivalent to the note C# heard in the key of C#-Major [8,17]. In previous dynamic routing models of key invariance, the tonic—the ﬁrst note of the key (e.g., C is the tonic of C-Major)— supplies the equivalent where information used by routing units that gate precise connections to map the raw note into a key-invariant output representation [17]. To achieve key invariance in our model, the bottom tier encodes raw note information while the top tier decodes key-invariant notes (Figure 6). The middle tier receives the tonic information and aligns the phase of the ﬁrst output pool (whose invariant representation corresponds to the tonic) with the appropriate input pool (whose raw note representation corresponds to the tonic of the perceived key). 6 Figure 6: Phase-based dynamic routing to achieve key-invariance. The input (bottom) tier encodes raw note information, and the output (top) tier decodes key-invariant information. The routing (middle) tier sets the phase of the background wave activity in the input and output oscillation rings (dashed arrows) such that the ﬁrst output pool is in phase with the input pool representing the note corresponding to the tonic. On the left, where G is the tonic, input pool G, output pool 1, and the routing tier are in phase with one another (black clocks), while input pool C and output pool 6 are in phase with one another (grey clocks). Thus, the raw note input, G, activates the invariant output 1, which corresponds to the perceived tonic invariant representation (heavy solid arrows). On the right, the same raw input note, G, is active, but the key is different and A is now the active tonic; thus the raw input, G, is now mapped to output pool 11. The tonic information is supplied to a speciﬁc pool in the routing ring according to the perceived key. This pool projects directly down to the input pool corresponding to the tonic. This ensures that the current tonic’s input pool is excitable in the same time bin as the ﬁrst output pool. Each of the remaining raw input notes of the octave is mapped by time binning to the corresponding key-invariant representation in the output tier, as the phases of input pools are all shifted by the same amount. Supporting evidence for phase-based encoding of note information comes from MEG recordings in humans: the phase of the MEG signal (predominantly over right hemispheric sensor locations) tracks the note of the heard note sequence with surprising accuracy [18]. The input and output tiers’ periods must be kept in lock-step, which can be accomplished through more plausible means than employed in the current implementation of this model. Here, we maintained a ﬁxed phase shift between the input and output oscillation rings by feeding activity from the input oscillation ring to the appropriately shifted pool in the output oscillation ring. This approach allowed us to avoid difﬁculties achieving coherent oscillations at identical frequencies in the input and output oscillation rings. Alternatively, entrainment could be achieved even when the frequencies are not identical—a more biologically plausible scenario—if the routing ring resets the phase of the input and output rings on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Lakatos et al. [19] have shown that somatosensory inputs can reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations in the primary auditory cortex (A1), which helps in the generation of a uniﬁed auditory-tactile percept (the so-called “Hearing-Hands Effect”). A simple extension to our model can reduce the number of connections below the requirements of traditional dynamic routing models. Instead of having all-to-all connections between the input and output layers, a relay layer of very few (M N ) neurons could be used to transmit the spikes form the input neurons to the output neurons (analogous to the single wire connecting encoder and decoder in Figure 1B). A small number of (or ideally even one) relay neurons sufﬁces because encoding and decoding occur in time. Hence, the connections between each input pool and the relay neurons require O(M N ) ≈ O(N ) connections (as long as M does not scale with N ) and those between the relay neurons and each output pool require O(M N) ≈ O(N ) connections as well. Thus, by removing all-to-all connectivity between the input and output units (a standard feature in traditional dynamic routing models), the number of required connections is reduced from O(N 2 ) 7 to O(N ). Further, by replacing the strict pool boundaries with nearest neighbor connectivity in the projection rings, the proposed model can accommodate a continuum of rotation angles. In summary, we propose that the mechanism of dynamic routing through neuronal coherence could be a general mechanism that could be used by multiple sensory and motor modalities in the neocortex: it is particularly suitable for placing raw information in an appropriate context (deﬁned by the routing tier).

<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>2 0.59745544 <a title="117-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-The_Generalized_FITC_Approximation.html">195 nips-2007-The Generalized FITC Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Naish-guzman, Sean Holden</p><p>Abstract: We present an efﬁcient generalization of the sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) model developed by Snelson and Ghahramani [1], applying it to binary classiﬁcation problems. By taking advantage of the SPGP prior covariance structure, we derive a numerically stable algorithm with O(N M 2 ) training complexity—asymptotically the same as related sparse methods such as the informative vector machine [2], but which more faithfully represents the posterior. We present experimental results for several benchmark problems showing that in many cases this allows an exceptional degree of sparsity without compromising accuracy. Following [1], we locate pseudo-inputs by gradient ascent on the marginal likelihood, but exhibit occasions when this is likely to fail, for which we suggest alternative solutions.</p><p>3 0.54071015 <a title="117-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>

The synaptic matrix can be ﬂexibly conﬁgured and provides both recurrent and AER-based connectivity with external, AER compliant devices. We demonstrate the ability of the network to efﬁciently classify overlapping patterns, thanks to the self-regulating mechanism.</p><p>4 0.47753516 <a title="117-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Contraction_Properties_of_VLSI_Cooperative_Competitive_Neural_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">60 nips-2007-Contraction Properties of VLSI Cooperative Competitive Neural Networks of Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Emre Neftci, Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Jean-jeacques Slotine, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: A non–linear dynamic system is called contracting if initial conditions are forgotten exponentially fast, so that all trajectories converge to a single trajectory. We use contraction theory to derive an upper bound for the strength of recurrent connections that guarantees contraction for complex neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we apply this theory to a special class of recurrent networks, often called Cooperative Competitive Networks (CCNs), which are an abstract representation of the cooperative-competitive connectivity observed in cortex. This speciﬁc type of network is believed to play a major role in shaping cortical responses and selecting the relevant signal among distractors and noise. In this paper, we analyze contraction of combined CCNs of linear threshold units and verify the results of our analysis in a hybrid analog/digital VLSI CCN comprising spiking neurons and dynamic synapses. 1</p><p>5 0.45651641 <a title="117-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Keyword_Selection_Using_Support_Vector_Machines.html">71 nips-2007-Discriminative Keyword Selection Using Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Fred Richardson, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in speech processing involve classiﬁcation of long term characteristics of a speech segment such as language, speaker, dialect, or topic. A natural technique for determining these characteristics is to ﬁrst convert the input speech into a sequence of tokens such as words, phones, etc. From these tokens, we can then look for distinctive sequences, keywords, that characterize the speech. In many applications, a set of distinctive keywords may not be known a priori. In this case, an automatic method of building up keywords from short context units such as phones is desirable. We propose a method for the construction of keywords based upon Support Vector Machines. We cast the problem of keyword selection as a feature selection problem for n-grams of phones. We propose an alternating ﬁlter-wrapper method that builds successively longer keywords. Application of this method to language recognition and topic recognition tasks shows that the technique produces interesting and signiﬁcant qualitative and quantitative results.</p><p>6 0.45039636 <a title="117-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Temporal_Difference_Updating_without_a_Learning_Rate.html">191 nips-2007-Temporal Difference Updating without a Learning Rate</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Lazaric, Marcello Restelli, Andrea Bonarini</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-world domains often requires to deal with continuous state and action spaces. Although many solutions have been proposed to apply Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous state problems, the same techniques can be hardly extended to continuous action spaces, where, besides the computation of a good approximation of the value function, a fast method for the identiﬁcation of the highest-valued action is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic approach in which the policy of the actor is estimated through sequential Monte Carlo methods. The importance sampling step is performed on the basis of the values learned by the critic, while the resampling step modiﬁes the actor’s policy. The proposed approach has been empirically compared to other learning algorithms into several domains; in this paper, we report results obtained in a control problem consisting of steering a boat across a river. 1</p><p>3 0.081397139 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Configuration_Estimates_Improve_Pedestrian_Finding.html">56 nips-2007-Configuration Estimates Improve Pedestrian Finding</a></p>
<p>Author: Duan Tran, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Fair discriminative pedestrian ﬁnders are now available. In fact, these pedestrian ﬁnders make most errors on pedestrians in conﬁgurations that are uncommon in the training data, for example, mounting a bicycle. This is undesirable. However, the human conﬁguration can itself be estimated discriminatively using structure learning. We demonstrate a pedestrian ﬁnder which ﬁrst ﬁnds the most likely human pose in the window using a discriminative procedure trained with structure learning on a small dataset. We then present features (local histogram of oriented gradient and local PCA of gradient) based on that conﬁguration to an SVM classiﬁer. We show, using the INRIA Person dataset, that estimates of conﬁguration signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of a discriminative pedestrian ﬁnder. 1</p><p>4 0.07326559 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_Brain_States_from_fMRI_Data%3A_Incremental_Functional_Principal_Component_Regression.html">154 nips-2007-Predicting Brain States from fMRI Data: Incremental Functional Principal Component Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Sennay Ghebreab, Arnold Smeulders, Pieter Adriaans</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for reconstruction of human brain states directly from functional neuroimaging data. The method extends the traditional multivariate regression analysis of discretized fMRI data to the domain of stochastic functional measurements, facilitating evaluation of brain responses to complex stimuli and boosting the power of functional imaging. The method searches for sets of voxel time courses that optimize a multivariate functional linear model in terms of R2 statistic. Population based incremental learning is used to identify spatially distributed brain responses to complex stimuli without attempting to localize function ﬁrst. Variation in hemodynamic lag across brain areas and among subjects is taken into account by voxel-wise non-linear registration of stimulus pattern to fMRI data. Application of the method on an international test benchmark for prediction of naturalistic stimuli from new and unknown fMRI data shows that the method successfully uncovers spatially distributed parts of the brain that are highly predictive of a given stimulus. 1</p><p>5 0.05941708 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Omer Bobrowski, Ron Meir, Shy Shoham, Yonina Eldar</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly evident that organisms acting in uncertain dynamical environments often employ exact or approximate Bayesian statistical calculations in order to continuously estimate the environmental state, integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, form predictions and choose actions. What is less clear is how these putative computations are implemented by cortical neural networks. An additional level of complexity is introduced because these networks observe the world through spike trains received from primary sensory afferents, rather than directly. A recent line of research has described mechanisms by which such computations can be implemented using a network of neurons whose activity directly represents a probability distribution across the possible “world states”. Much of this work, however, uses various approximations, which severely restrict the domain of applicability of these implementations. Here we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process ﬁltering, and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using linear neural networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with several examples, and relate the required network properties to the statistical nature of the environment, thereby quantifying the compatibility of a given network with its environment. 1</p><p>6 0.04760905 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Combined_discriminative_and_generative_articulated_pose_and_non-rigid_shape_estimation.html">50 nips-2007-Combined discriminative and generative articulated pose and non-rigid shape estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Lawrence Murray, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: We construct a biologically motivated stochastic differential model of the neural and hemodynamic activity underlying the observed Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The model poses a difﬁcult parameter estimation problem, both theoretically due to the nonlinearity and divergence of the differential system, and computationally due to its time and space complexity. We adapt a particle ﬁlter and smoother to the task, and discuss some of the practical approaches used to tackle the difﬁculties, including use of sparse matrices and parallelisation. Results demonstrate the tractability of the approach in its application to an effective connectivity study. 1</p><p>4 0.42492032 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Visual_Attributes.html">113 nips-2007-Learning Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Vittorio Ferrari, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic generative model of visual attributes, together with an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as ‘red’, ‘striped’, or ‘spotted’. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images.</p><p>5 0.41921896 <a title="171-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Locality_and_low-dimensions_in_the_prediction_of_natural_experience_from_fMRI.html">122 nips-2007-Locality and low-dimensions in the prediction of natural experience from fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Meyer, Greg Stephens</p><p>Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides dynamical access into the complex functioning of the human brain, detailing the hemodynamic activity of thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We ﬁnd that the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-deﬁned Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke’s area for verbal instructions, visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions, with the highest correlation (c ∼ 0.8) between the predicted and experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The interpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual basis upon which to build more sophisticated techniques for fMRI decoding and offers a window into cognitive function during dynamic, natural experience. 1</p><p>6 0.41319638 <a title="171-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_Brain_States_from_fMRI_Data%3A_Incremental_Functional_Principal_Component_Regression.html">154 nips-2007-Predicting Brain States from fMRI Data: Incremental Functional Principal Component Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>3 0.61277997 <a title="171-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Compressed_Regression.html">53 nips-2007-Compressed Regression</a></p>

In this paper we study a variant of this problem where the original n input variables are compressed by a random linear transformation to m n examples in p dimensions, and establish conditions under which a sparse linear model can be successfully recovered from the compressed data. A primary motivation for this compression procedure is to anonymize the data and preserve privacy by revealing little information about the original data. We characterize the number of random projections that are required for 1 -regularized compressed regression to identify the nonzero coefﬁcients in the true model with probability approaching one, a property called “sparsistence.” In addition, we show that 1 -regularized compressed regression asymptotically predicts as well as an oracle linear model, a property called “persistence.” Finally, we characterize the privacy properties of the compression procedure in information-theoretic terms, establishing upper bounds on the rate of information communicated between the compressed and uncompressed data that decay to zero. 1</p><p>4 0.6082679 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Variational_inference_for_Markov_jump_processes.html">214 nips-2007-Variational inference for Markov jump processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: Markov jump processes play an important role in a large number of application domains. However, realistic systems are analytically intractable and they have traditionally been analysed using simulation based techniques, which do not provide a framework for statistical inference. We propose a mean ﬁeld approximation to perform posterior inference and parameter estimation. The approximation allows a practical solution to the inference problem, while still retaining a good degree of accuracy. We illustrate our approach on two biologically motivated systems.</p><p>5 0.58757204 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Visual_Attributes.html">113 nips-2007-Learning Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Vittorio Ferrari, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic generative model of visual attributes, together with an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as ‘red’, ‘striped’, or ‘spotted’. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images.</p><p>6 0.58600569 <a title="171-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>

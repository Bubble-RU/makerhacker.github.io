<p>Author: Quoc V. Le, Alex J. Smola, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: We present a globally convergent method for regularized risk minimization problems. Our method applies to Support Vector estimation, regression, Gaussian Processes, and any other regularized risk minimization setting which leads to a convex optimization problem. SVMPerf can be shown to be a special case of our approach. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ ) steps to precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ )) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate in experiments the performance of our approach. 1</p><p>3 0.16656604 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Batch_Mode_Active_Learning.html">69 nips-2007-Discriminative Batch Mode Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classiﬁer. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classiﬁcation performance of the target classiﬁer, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.15787254 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-The_rat_as_particle_filter.html">203 nips-2007-The rat as particle filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: Although theorists have interpreted classical conditioning as a laboratory model of Bayesian belief updating, a recent reanalysis showed that the key features that theoretical models capture about learning are artifacts of averaging over subjects. Rather than learning smoothly to asymptote (reﬂecting, according to Bayesian models, the gradual tradeoff from prior to posterior as data accumulate), subjects learn suddenly and their predictions ﬂuctuate perpetually. We suggest that abrupt and unstable learning can be modeled by assuming subjects are conducting inference using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with a small number of samples — one, in our simulations. Ensemble behavior resembles exact Bayesian models since, as in particle ﬁlters, it averages over many samples. Further, the model is capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviors like retrospective revaluation at the ensemble level, even given minimally sophisticated individuals that do not track uncertainty in their beliefs over trials. 1</p><p>5 0.13801967 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Spectral_Regularization_Framework_for_Multi-Task_Structure_Learning.html">12 nips-2007-A Spectral Regularization Framework for Multi-Task Structure Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying, Charles A. Micchelli</p><p>Abstract: Learning the common structure shared by a set of supervised tasks is an important practical and theoretical problem. Knowledge of this structure may lead to better generalization performance on the tasks and may also facilitate learning new tasks. We propose a framework for solving this problem, which is based on regularization with spectral functions of matrices. This class of regularization problems exhibits appealing computational properties and can be optimized efﬁciently by an alternating minimization algorithm. In addition, we provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for convexity of the regularizer. We analyze concrete examples of the framework, which are equivalent to regularization with Lp matrix norms. Experiments on two real data sets indicate that the algorithm scales well with the number of tasks and improves on state of the art statistical performance. 1</p><p>6 0.12854248 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-A_Randomized_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Support_Vector_Learning.html">10 nips-2007-A Randomized Algorithm for Large Scale Support Vector Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Krishnan Kumar, Chiru Bhattacharya, Ramesh Hariharan</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of randomized algorithms for large scale SVM learning. The key contribution of the paper is to show that, by using ideas random projections, the minimal number of support vectors required to solve almost separable classiﬁcation problems, such that the solution obtained is near optimal with a very high probability, is given by O(log n); if on removal of properly chosen O(log n) points the data becomes linearly separable then it is called almost separable. The second contribution is a sampling based algorithm, motivated from randomized algorithms, which solves a SVM problem by considering subsets of the dataset which are greater in size than the number of support vectors for the problem. These two ideas are combined to obtain an algorithm for SVM classiﬁcation problems which performs the learning by considering only O(log n) points at a time. Experiments done on synthetic and real life datasets show that the algorithm does scale up state of the art SVM solvers in terms of memory required and execution time without loss in accuracy. It is to be noted that the algorithm presented here nicely complements existing large scale SVM learning approaches as it can be used to scale up any SVM solver. 1</p><p>5 0.45561409 <a title="11-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Parallelizing_Support_Vector_Machines_on_Distributed_Computers.html">152 nips-2007-Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaihua Zhu, Hao Wang, Hongjie Bai, Jian Li, Zhihuan Qiu, Hang Cui, Edward Y. Chang</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) suffer from a widely recognized scalability problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability, we have developed a parallel SVM algorithm (PSVM), which reduces memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization, and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is signiﬁcantly smaller than n), and m the number of machines. PSVM reduces the memory requirement from O(n2 ) to O(np/m), and improves computation time to O(np2 /m). Empirical study shows PSVM to be effective.

<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, i.e. learning from both labeled and unlabeled data has received signiﬁcant attention in the machine learning literature in recent years. Still our understanding of the theoretical foundations of the usefulness of unlabeled data remains somewhat limited. The simplest and the best understood situation is when the data is described by an identiﬁable mixture model, and where each class comes from a pure component. This natural setup and its implications ware analyzed in [11, 5]. One important result was that in certain regimes, labeled data becomes exponentially more valuable than unlabeled data. However, in most realistic situations, one would not expect that the data comes from a parametric mixture distribution with identiﬁable components. There have been recent efforts to analyze the non-parametric situation, for example, “cluster” and “manifold” assumptions have been suggested as a basis for analysis. Still, a satisfactory and fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nonparametric problem, similar to that in [11, 5] has not yet been developed. In this paper we investigate an intermediate situation, when the data comes from a probability distribution, which can be modeled, but not perfectly, by an identiﬁable mixture distribution. This seems applicable to many situation, when, for example, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model the data. the contribution of this paper is an analysis of the role of labeled and unlabeled data depending on the amount of imperfection in the model.</p><p>3 0.67146719 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-A_Unified_Near-Optimal_Estimator_For_Dimension_Reduction_in_%24l_%5Calpha%24_%28%240%3C%5Calpha%5Cleq_2%24%29_Using_Stable_Random_Projections.html">13 nips-2007-A Unified Near-Optimal Estimator For Dimension Reduction in $l \alpha$ ($0<\alpha\leq 2$) Using Stable Random Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks (e.g., clustering) in machine learning only require the lα distances instead of the original data. For dimension reductions in the lα norm (0 < α ≤ 2), the method of stable random projections can efﬁciently compute the lα distances in massive datasets (e.g., the Web or massive data streams) in one pass of the data. The estimation task for stable random projections has been an interesting topic. We propose a simple estimator based on the fractional power of the samples (projected data), which is surprisingly near-optimal in terms of the asymptotic variance. In fact, it achieves the Cram´ r-Rao bound when α = 2 and α = 0+.

First, a cautionary result is presented, showing that any convex relaxation of EM over hidden variables must give trivial results if any dependence on the missing values is retained. Although this appears to be a strong negative outcome, we then demonstrate how the problem can be bypassed by using equivalence relations instead of value assignments over hidden variables. In particular, we develop new algorithms for estimating exponential conditional models that only require equivalence relation information over the variable values. This reformulation leads to an exact expression for EM variants in a wide range of problems. We then develop a semideﬁnite relaxation that yields global training by eliminating local minima. 1</p><p>5 0.66869497 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-New_Outer_Bounds_on_the_Marginal_Polytope.html">141 nips-2007-New Outer Bounds on the Marginal Polytope</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We give a new class of outer bounds on the marginal polytope, and propose a cutting-plane algorithm for efﬁciently optimizing over these constraints. When combined with a concave upper bound on the entropy, this gives a new variational inference algorithm for probabilistic inference in discrete Markov Random Fields (MRFs). Valid constraints on the marginal polytope are derived through a series of projections onto the cut polytope. As a result, we obtain tighter upper bounds on the log-partition function. We also show empirically that the approximations of the marginals are signiﬁcantly more accurate when using the tighter outer bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of the new constraints for ﬁnding the MAP assignment in protein structure prediction. 1</p><p>6 0.66832221 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-A_General_Boosting_Method_and_its_Application_to_Learning_Ranking_Functions_for_Web_Search.html">6 nips-2007-A General Boosting Method and its Application to Learning Ranking Functions for Web Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Harald Steck, R. B. Rao, Rómer Rosales</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, unlike some previous multi-view learning methods. Furthermore, it can automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted, and thus accommodate noisy or unreliable views. Experiments on toy data and real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach. 1</p><p>3 0.32901728 <a title="94-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Inferring_Neural_Firing_Rates_from_Spike_Trains_Using_Gaussian_Processes.html">104 nips-2007-Inferring Neural Firing Rates from Spike Trains Using Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani, Byron M. Yu, John P. Cunningham, Krishna V. Shenoy</p><p>Abstract: Neural spike trains present challenges to analytical efforts due to their noisy, spiking nature. Many studies of neuroscientiﬁc and neural prosthetic importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of the spike train’s underlying ﬁring rate. Current techniques to ﬁnd time-varying ﬁring rates require ad hoc choices of parameters, offer no conﬁdence intervals on their estimates, and can obscure potentially important single trial variability. We present a new method, based on a Gaussian Process prior, for inferring probabilistically optimal estimates of ﬁring rate functions underlying single or multiple neural spike trains. We test the performance of the method on simulated data and experimentally gathered neural spike trains, and we demonstrate improvements over conventional estimators. 1</p><p>4 0.30712673 <a title="94-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Prediction.html">135 nips-2007-Multi-task Gaussian Process Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Edwin V. Bonilla, Kian M. Chai, Christopher Williams</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate multi-task learning in the context of Gaussian Processes (GP). We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a “free-form” covariance matrix over tasks. This allows for good ﬂexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assumption of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task transfer occurs. We evaluate the beneﬁts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.27290067 <a title="94-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Robust_Regression_with_Twinned_Gaussian_Processes.html">170 nips-2007-Robust Regression with Twinned Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Naish-guzman, Sean Holden</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Gaussian process (GP) framework for robust inference in which a GP prior on the mixing weights of a two-component noise model augments the standard process over latent function values. This approach is a generalization of the mixture likelihood used in traditional robust GP regression, and a specialization of the GP mixture models suggested by Tresp [1] and Rasmussen and Ghahramani [2]. The value of this restriction is in its tractable expectation propagation updates, which allow for faster inference and model selection, and better convergence than the standard mixture. An additional beneﬁt over the latter method lies in our ability to incorporate knowledge of the noise domain to inﬂuence predictions, and to recover with the predictive distribution information about the outlier distribution via the gating process. The model has asymptotic complexity equal to that of conventional robust methods, but yields more conﬁdent predictions on benchmark problems than classical heavy-tailed models and exhibits improved stability for data with clustered corruptions, for which they fail altogether. We show further how our approach can be used without adjustment for more smoothly heteroscedastic data, and suggest how it could be extended to more general noise models. We also address similarities with the work of Goldberg et al.

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.72204298 <a title="94-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Semi-Supervised_Multitask_Learning.html">175 nips-2007-Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiuhua Liu, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A semi-supervised multitask learning (MTL) framework is presented, in which M parameterized semi-supervised classiﬁers, each associated with one of M partially labeled data manifolds, are learned jointly under the constraint of a softsharing prior imposed over the parameters of the classiﬁers. The unlabeled data are utilized by basing classiﬁer learning on neighborhoods, induced by a Markov random walk over a graph representation of each manifold. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that semi-supervised MTL yields signiﬁcant improvements in generalization performance over either semi-supervised single-task learning (STL) or supervised MTL. 1</p><p>4 0.68811321 <a title="94-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_ROC_Curve_for_a_Combination_of_Classifiers.html">149 nips-2007-Optimal ROC Curve for a Combination of Classifiers</a></p>

Our analysis makes use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma as a theoretical basis to analyze combinations of classiﬁers.

We show how our method generalizes and improves previous work on combining classiﬁers and generating ROC curves. 1</p><p>5 0.62427878 <a title="94-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>6 0.55891973 <a title="94-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Density_Estimation_under_Independent_Similarly_Distributed_Sampling_Assumptions.html">66 nips-2007-Density Estimation under Independent Similarly Distributed Sampling Assumptions</a></p>

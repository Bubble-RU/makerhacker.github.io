[sent-10, score-0.869]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  In many real world problems, the proportion of data points in different classes is highly skewed: some classes dominate the data set (majority classes), and the remaining classes may have only a few examples (minority classes). [sent-11, score-0.687]
</p><p>6 However, it is very important to detect examples from the minority classes via active learning. [sent-12, score-1.018]
</p><p>7 For example, in fraud detection tasks, most of the records correspond to normal transactions, and yet once we identify a new type of fraud transaction, we are well on our way to stopping similar future fraud transactions [2]. [sent-13, score-0.317]
</p><p>8 Rare category detection is also a bottleneck in reducing the sampling complexity of active learning [1, 5]. [sent-18, score-0.299]
</p><p>9 The difference between rare category detection and outlier detection is that: in rare category detection, the examples from one or more minority classes are often self-similar, potentially forming compact clusters, while in outlier detection, the outliers are typically scattered. [sent-19, score-1.764]
</p><p>10 For example, in [8], the authors assumed a mixture model to ﬁt the data, and selected examples for labeling according to different criteria; in [6], the authors proposed a generic consistency algorithm, and proved upper bounds and lower bounds for this algorithm in some speciﬁc situations. [sent-21, score-0.137]
</p><p>11 Most of the existing methods require that the majority classes and the minority classes be separable or work best in the separable case. [sent-22, score-1.197]
</p><p>12 However, in real applications, the support regions of the majority and minority classes often overlap, which affects negatively the performance of these methods. [sent-23, score-0.98]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we propose a novel method for rare category detection in the context of active learning. [sent-24, score-0.43]
</p><p>14 The method stops once it has found at least one example from each class (given the knowledge of the number of classes). [sent-31, score-0.131]
</p><p>15 When the minority classes form compact clusters and the majority class distribution is locally smooth, the method will select examples both on the boundary and in the interior of the minority classes, and is proved to be effective theoretically. [sent-32, score-1.925]
</p><p>16 In Section 2, we introduce our method and provide theoretical justiﬁcation, ﬁrst for binary classes and then for multiple classes. [sent-35, score-0.169]
</p><p>17 1  Rare category detection Problem deﬁnition  Given a set of unlabeled examples S = {x1 , . [sent-39, score-0.324]
</p><p>18 For the sake of simplicity, assume that there is only one majority class, which corresponds to yi = 1, and all the other classes are minority classes. [sent-48, score-0.98]
</p><p>19 2  Rare category detection for the binary case  First let us focus on the simplest case where m = 2, and Pr[yi = 1] Pr[yi = 2] = p, i. [sent-50, score-0.226]
</p><p>20 Next, we introduce our method for rare category detection based on nearest neighbors, which is presented in Algorithm 1. [sent-54, score-0.421]
</p><p>21 The basic idea is to ﬁnd maximum changes in local density, which might indicate the location of a rare category. [sent-55, score-0.187]
</p><p>22 Given the unlabeled set S and the prior of the minority class p, we ﬁrst estimate the number K of minority class examples in S. [sent-57, score-1.616]
</p><p>23 The minimum distance over all the examples is assigned to r . [sent-59, score-0.141]
</p><p>24 Next, we draw a hyper-ball centered at each example with radius r , and count the number of examples enclosed by this hyper-ball, which is denoted as ni . [sent-60, score-0.503]
</p><p>25 ni is roughly in proportion to the local density. [sent-61, score-0.38]
</p><p>26 To measure the change of local density around a certain point xi , in each iteration of Step 3, we subtract nj of neighboring points from ni , and let the maximum value be the score of xi . [sent-62, score-0.685]
</p><p>27 If the example is from the minority class, stop the iteration; otherwise, enlarge the neighborhood where the scores of the examples are re-calculated and continue. [sent-64, score-0.855]
</p><p>28 Assume that the minority class is concentrated in a small region and the probability distribution function (pdf) of the majority class is locally smooth. [sent-66, score-1.019]
</p><p>29 Firstly, since the support region of the minority class is very small, it is important to ﬁnd its scale. [sent-67, score-0.793]
</p><p>30 The r value obtained in Step 1 will be used to calculate the local density ni . [sent-68, score-0.418]
</p><p>31 Since r is based on the minimum K th nearest neighbor distance, it is never too large to smooth out changes of local density, and thus it is a good measure of the scale. [sent-69, score-0.187]
</p><p>32 Secondly, the score of a certain point, corresponding to the change in local density, is the maximum of the difference in local density between this point and all of its neighboring points. [sent-70, score-0.163]
</p><p>33 In this way, we are not only able to select points on the boundary of the minority class, but also points in the interior, given that the region is small. [sent-71, score-0.726]
</p><p>34 Finally, by gradually enlarging the neighborhood where the scores are calculated, we can further explore the interior of the support region, and increase our chance of ﬁnding a minority class example. [sent-72, score-0.851]
</p><p>35 3  Correctness  In this subsection, we prove that if the minority class is concentrated in a small region and the pdf of the majority class is locally smooth, the proposed algorithm will repeatedly sample in the region where minority class examples occur with high probability. [sent-74, score-1.988]
</p><p>36 Let f1 (x) and f2 (x) denote the pdf of the majority and minority classes respectively, where x ∈ Rd . [sent-75, score-1.038]
</p><p>37 For each example, calculate the distance to its K th nearest neighbor. [sent-78, score-0.163]
</p><p>38 2: ∀xi ∈ S, let N N (xi , r ) = {x|x ∈ S, x − xi ≤ r }, and ni = |N N (xi , r )|. [sent-80, score-0.364]
</p><p>39 3: for t = 1 : n do 4: ∀xi ∈ S, if xi has not been selected, then si = max (ni − nj ); otherwise, si = −∞. [sent-81, score-0.284]
</p><p>40 xj ∈N N (xi ,tr )  5: Query x = arg maxxi ∈S si . [sent-82, score-0.166]
</p><p>41 Note that variants of the following proof apply if we assume a different minority class distribution, such as a tight Gaussian. [sent-93, score-0.759]
</p><p>42 First, notice that the expected proportion of points falling inside B, E( |N Nn 2 and that the maximum expected proportion of points falling inside any hyper-ball of radius r2 ,  max[E(  x∈Rd  |N N (x, n  r2 2  )|  )] ≤ 2−d p. [sent-97, score-0.319]
</p><p>43 Then  ni ni − E( )| > V (r )] n n ni ni r2 and ∃xi ∈ S s. [sent-98, score-1.128]

</p><p>45 min{ xi − xj |xi , xj ∈ S, xi − b ≤ r, xj − b > 2r} ≤ α, where α is a positive parameter. [sent-110, score-0.392]
</p><p>46 In the separable case where the support regions of the two classes do not overlap, we can use other methods to detect the minority class, such as the one proposed in [8]. [sent-112, score-0.892]
</p><p>47 ∀x, y ∈ Rd , |f1 (x)−f1 (y)| ≤ β x−y , where β ≤ 2d+1 V (r)2 α r2 and OV ( 2 , r) is the volume of the overlapping region of two hyper-balls: one is of radius 2 r, the other one is of radius r2 , and its center is on the sphere of the bigger one. [sent-116, score-0.254]
</p><p>48 −d 4 δ δ δ 1  2  then with probability at least 1 − δ, after 2α iterations, NNDB will query at least one example r2 1 whose probability of coming from the minority class is at least 3 , and it will continue querying such α th 2d examples until the ( p(1−p) − 2) · r iteration. [sent-121, score-1.037]
</p><p>49 Based on Claim 1, using condition 3, if the number of examples is sufﬁciently large, then with 2 probability at least 1 − δ, r2 ≤ r ≤ r and | ni − E( ni )| ≤ (1 − p)βV (r ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n. [sent-123, score-0.685]
</p><p>50 xi − b > 2r, xj − b > 2r and xi − xj ≤ α, E( ni ) and E( nj ) n nj ni will not be affected by the minority class, and |E( n ) − E( n )| ≤ (1 − p)βV (r ) ≤ (1 − p)βV (r). [sent-126, score-1.722]
</p><p>51 Based on the above inequalities, we have nj ni nj nj ni nj ni ni | − | ≤ | − E( )| + | − E( )| + |E( ) − E( )| ≤ 3(1 − p)βV (r) (1) n n n n n n n n From inequality (1), it is not hard to see that ∀xi , xj ∈ S, s. [sent-128, score-1.54]
</p><p>52 xi − b > 2r and xi − xj ≤ α, nj ni n − n ≤ 3(1 − p)βV (r), i. [sent-130, score-0.606]
</p><p>53 when tr = α, si ≤ 3(1 − p)βV (r) n  (2)  This is because if xj − b ≤ 2r, the minority class may also contribute to may be even smaller. [sent-132, score-0.924]
</p><p>54 nj n ,  and thus the score  On the other hand, based on condition 1, there exist two points xk , xl ∈ S, s. [sent-133, score-0.162]
</p><p>55 Since the contribution of the minority class to E( nk ) is at least n r  2 p·OV ( 2 ,r) , V (r)  p·OV (  r2  ,r)  p·OV (  r2  ,r)  2 2 − (1 − p)βV (r ) ≥ − (1 − p)βV (r). [sent-136, score-0.818]
</p><p>56 when tr = α,  sk > 3(1 − p)βV (r) (3) n In Step 4 of the proposed method, we gradually enlarge the neighborhood to calculate the change of local density. [sent-139, score-0.276]
</p><p>57 When tr = α, based on inequalities (2) and (3), ∀xi ∈ S, xi − b > 2r, we have sk > si . [sent-140, score-0.194]
</p><p>58 xi − b > 2r and xi − xj ≤ cα, ni − nj ≤ (c + 2)(1 − p)βV (r), i. [sent-145, score-0.606]
</p><p>59 c ≤ p(1−p) − 2, then ∀xi ∈ S, xi − b > 2r, sk > si , 2d 2 and we will pick examples from B . [sent-150, score-0.262]
</p><p>60 Since r ≤ r, the method will continue querying examples in 2d B 2 until the ( p(1−p) − 2) · α th iteration. [sent-151, score-0.186]
</p><p>61 r  1 Finally, we show that the probability of picking a minority class example from B 2 is at least 3 . [sent-152, score-0.782]
</p><p>62 To this end, we need to calculate the maximum probability mass of the majority class within B 2 . [sent-153, score-0.257]
</p><p>63 Consider the case where the maximum value of f1 (x) occurs at b, and this pdf decreases by β every time x moves away from b in the direction of the radius by α, i. [sent-154, score-0.164]
</p><p>64 Therefore, if we select a point at random p p 1 from B 2 , the probability that this point is from the minority class is at least p+(1−p)·2p ≥ p+2p = 3 . [sent-161, score-0.8]
</p><p>65 4  Rare category detection for multiple classes  In subsection 2. [sent-163, score-0.477]
</p><p>66 2, we have discussed rare category detection for the binary case. [sent-164, score-0.377]
</p><p>67 Our goal is to use as few label requests as possible to ﬁnd at least one example from each class. [sent-170, score-0.173]
</p><p>68 In this algorithm, we are given the priors of all the minority classes. [sent-173, score-0.713]
</p><p>69 Using each pi , we estimate the number Ki of examples from this class, and calculate the corresponding ri value in the same manner as NNDB. [sent-174, score-0.223]
</p><p>70 Then, we calculate the local density at each example based on different scales ri . [sent-175, score-0.206]
</p><p>71 In the outer loop of Step 9, we calculate the r value which is the minimum of all the ri whose corresponding classes have not been discovered yet and its index. [sent-176, score-0.432]
</p><p>72 In the inner loop of Step 11, we gradually enlarge the neighborhood to calculate the score of each example. [sent-177, score-0.222]
</p><p>73 This is the same as NNDB, except that we preclude the examples that are within a certain distance of any selected example from being selected. [sent-178, score-0.159]
</p><p>74 This heuristic is to avoid repeatedly selecting examples from the same discovered class. [sent-179, score-0.192]
</p><p>75 If the minority classes form compact clusters and are far apart from each other, NNDM is able to detect examples from each minority class with a small number of label requests. [sent-182, score-1.832]
</p><p>76 th 3: For each example, calculate the distance between this example and its Ki nearest neighbor. [sent-187, score-0.163]
</p><p>77 i=2 6: for i = 1 : m do 7: ∀xj ∈ S, let N N (xj , ri ) = {x|x ∈ S, x − xj ≤ ri }, and ni = |N N (xj , ri )|. [sent-190, score-0.568]
</p><p>78 j 8: end for 9: while not all the classes have been discovered do 10: Let r = min{ri |1 ≤ i ≤ m, and class i has not been discovered}, and s be the corresponding index, i. [sent-191, score-0.366]
</p><p>79 11: for t = 1 : n do 12: for each xi that has been selected and labeled yi , ∀x ∈ S, s. [sent-194, score-0.141]
</p><p>80 x − xi ≤ ryi , si = −∞; for all the other examples, si = max (ns − ns ). [sent-196, score-0.221]
</p><p>81 i j xj ∈N N (xi ,tr )  13: Query x = arg maxxi ∈S si . [sent-197, score-0.166]
</p><p>82 15: end for 16: end while  In NNDB and NNDM, we need the priors of the minority classes as the input. [sent-199, score-0.918]
</p><p>83 In Interleave, we use the number of classes as the number of components in the mixture model. [sent-202, score-0.169]
</p><p>84 1  Synthetic data sets  Figure 1(a) shows a synthetic data set where the pdf of the majority class is Gaussian and the pdf of the minority class is uniform within a small hyper-ball. [sent-205, score-1.163]
</p><p>85 There are 1000 examples from the majority class and only 10 examples from the minority class. [sent-206, score-1.072]
</p><p>86 Using Interleave, we need to label 35 examples, using RS, we need to label 101 examples, and using NNDB, we only need to label 3 examples in order to sample one from the minority class, which are denoted as ‘x’ in Figure 1(b). [sent-207, score-1.008]
</p><p>87 This is because the number of examples from the minority class is very small, and the local density may be affected by the randomness in the data. [sent-209, score-0.938]
</p><p>88 In Figure 2(a), the X-shaped data consisting of 3000 examples correspond to the majority class, and the four characters ‘NIPS’ correspond to four minority classes, which consist of 138, 79, 118, and 206 examples respectively. [sent-211, score-0.987]
</p><p>89 Using Interleave, we need to label 1190 examples, using RS, we need to label 83 examples, and using NNDM, we only need to label 5 examples in order to get one from each of the minority classes, which are denoted as ‘x’ in Figure 2(b). [sent-212, score-1.008]
</p><p>90 This might be because some minority classes are located in the region where the density of the majority class is not negligible, and thus may be ‘explained’ by the majority-class mixture-model component. [sent-214, score-1.124]
</p><p>91 The examples come from 20 classes: the proportion of the largest class is 16. [sent-218, score-0.265]
</p><p>92 50%, and the proportion of the smallest class is 0. [sent-219, score-0.147]
</p><p>93 The examples come from 7 classes: the proportion of the largest class is 75. [sent-222, score-0.265]
</p><p>94 53%, and the proportion of the smallest class is 0. [sent-223, score-0.147]
</p><p>95 all the classes, Interleave needs 280 label requests, RS needs 483 label requests, and NNDM only needs 125 label requests; with Shuttle data set, to ﬁnd all the classes, Interleave needs 140 label requests, RS needs 512 label requests, and NNDM only needs 87 label requests. [sent-227, score-0.6]
</p><p>96 Furthermore, the majority and minority classes may not be near-separable, which is a disaster for Interleave. [sent-229, score-0.96]
</p><p>97 3  Imprecise priors  The proposed algorithms need the priors of the minority classes as input. [sent-232, score-0.921]
</p><p>98 2, and add/subtract 5%, 10%, and 20% from the true priors of the minority classes. [sent-236, score-0.713]
</p><p>99 It works by selecting examples corresponding to regions with the maximum change in local density, and depending on scaling, it will select class-boundary or class-internal samples of minority classes. [sent-242, score-0.843]
</p><p>100 Moreover, it is very robust to modest perturbations in estimating true class priors. [sent-245, score-0.14]

<p>Author: Jingrui He, Jaime G. Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Rare category detection is an open challenge for active learning, especially in the de-novo case (no labeled examples), but of signiﬁcant practical importance for data mining - e.g. detecting new ﬁnancial transaction fraud patterns, where normal legitimate transactions dominate. This paper develops a new method for detecting an instance of each minority class via an unsupervised local-density-differential sampling strategy. Essentially a variable-scale nearest neighbor process is used to optimize the probability of sampling tightly-grouped minority classes, subject to a local smoothness assumption of the majority class. Results on both synthetic and real data sets are very positive, detecting each minority class with only a fraction of the actively sampled points required by random sampling and by Pelleg’s Interleave method, the prior best technique in the sparse literature on this topic. 1</p><p>2 0.071567543 <a title="139-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2007-Kernels_on_Attributed_Pointsets_with_Applications.html">109 nips-2007-Kernels on Attributed Pointsets with Applications</a></p>

The embedding gives the notion of neighborhood, which is used to deﬁne positive semideﬁnite kernels on pointsets. Two novel kernels on neighborhoods are proposed, one evaluating the attribute similarity and the other evaluating shape similarity. Shape similarity function is motivated from spectral graph matching techniques. The kernels are tested on three real life applications: face recognition, photo album tagging, and shot annotation in video sequences, with encouraging results. 1</p><p>3 0.062909439 <a title="139-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Fixing_Max-Product%3A_Convergent_Message_Passing_Algorithms_for_MAP_LP-Relaxations.html">92 nips-2007-Fixing Max-Product: Convergent Message Passing Algorithms for MAP LP-Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel message passing algorithm for approximating the MAP problem in graphical models. The algorithm is similar in structure to max-product but unlike max-product it always converges, and can be proven to ﬁnd the exact MAP solution in various settings. The algorithm is derived via block coordinate descent in a dual of the LP relaxation of MAP, but does not require any tunable parameters such as step size or tree weights. We also describe a generalization of the method to cluster based potentials. The new method is tested on synthetic and real-world problems, and compares favorably with previous approaches. Graphical models are an effective approach for modeling complex objects via local interactions. In such models, a distribution over a set of variables is assumed to factor according to cliques of a graph with potentials assigned to each clique. Finding the assignment with highest probability in these models is key to using them in practice, and is often referred to as the MAP (maximum aposteriori) assignment problem. In the general case the problem is NP hard, with complexity exponential in the tree-width of the underlying graph. Linear programming (LP) relaxations have proven very useful in approximating the MAP problem, and often yield satisfactory empirical results. These approaches relax the constraint that the solution is integral, and generally yield non-integral solutions. However, when the LP solution is integral, it is guaranteed to be the exact MAP. For some classes of problems the LP relaxation is provably correct. These include the minimum cut problem and maximum weight matching in bi-partite graphs [8]. Although LP relaxations can be solved using standard LP solvers, this may be computationally intensive for large problems [13]. The key problem with generic LP solvers is that they do not use the graph structure explicitly and thus may be sub-optimal in terms of computational efﬁciency. The max-product method [7] is a message passing algorithm that is often used to approximate the MAP problem. In contrast to generic LP solvers, it makes direct use of the graph structure in constructing and passing messages, and is also very simple to implement. The relation between max-product and the LP relaxation has remained largely elusive, although there are some notable exceptions: For tree-structured graphs, max-product and LP both yield the exact MAP. A recent result [1] showed that for maximum weight matching on bi-partite graphs max-product and LP also yield the exact MAP [1]. Finally, Tree-Reweighted max-product (TRMP) algorithms [5, 10] were shown to converge to the LP solution for binary xi variables, as shown in [6]. In this work, we propose the Max Product Linear Programming algorithm (MPLP) - a very simple variation on max-product that is guaranteed to converge, and has several advantageous properties. MPLP is derived from the dual of the LP relaxation, and is equivalent to block coordinate descent in the dual. Although this results in monotone improvement of the dual objective, global convergence is not always guaranteed since coordinate descent may get stuck in suboptimal points. This can be remedied using various approaches, but in practice we have found MPLP to converge to the LP 1 solution in a majority of the cases we studied. To derive MPLP we use a special form of the dual LP, which involves the introduction of redundant primal variables and constraints. We show how the dual variables corresponding to these constraints turn out to be the messages in the algorithm. We evaluate the method on Potts models and protein design problems, and show that it compares favorably with max-product (which often does not converge for these problems) and TRMP. 1 The Max-Product and MPLP Algorithms The max-product algorithm [7] is one of the most often used methods for solving MAP problems. Although it is neither guaranteed to converge to the correct solution, or in fact converge at all, it provides satisfactory results in some cases. Here we present two algorithms: EMPLP (edge based MPLP) and NMPLP (node based MPLP), which are structurally very similar to max-product, but have several key advantages: • After each iteration, the messages yield an upper bound on the MAP value, and the sequence of bounds is monotone decreasing and convergent. The messages also have a limit point that is a ﬁxed point of the update rule. • No additional parameters (e.g., tree weights as in [6]) are required. • If the ﬁxed point beliefs have a unique maximizer then they correspond to the exact MAP. • For binary variables, MPLP can be used to obtain the solution to an LP relaxation of the MAP problem. Thus, when this LP relaxation is exact and variables are binary, MPLP will ﬁnd the MAP solution. Moreover, for any variable whose beliefs are not tied, the MAP assignment can be found (i.e., the solution is partially decodable). Pseudo code for the algorithms (and for max-product) is given in Fig. 1. As we show in the next sections, MPLP is essentially a block coordinate descent algorithm in the dual of a MAP LP relaxation. Every update of the MPLP messages corresponds to exact minimization of a set of dual variables. For EMPLP minimization is over the set of variables corresponding to an edge, and for NMPLP it is over the set of variables corresponding to all the edges a given node appears in (i.e., a star). The properties of MPLP result from its relation to the LP dual. In what follows we describe the derivation of the MPLP algorithms and prove their properties. 2 The MAP Problem and its LP Relaxation We consider functions over n variables x = {x1 , . . . , xn } deﬁned as follows. Given a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices, and potentials θij (xi , xj ) for all edges ij ∈ E, deﬁne the function1 f (x; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) . (1) ij∈E The MAP problem is deﬁned as ﬁnding an assignment xM that maximizes the function f (x; θ). Below we describe the standard LP relaxation for this problem. Denote by {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E distributions over variables corresponding to edges ij ∈ E and {µi (xi )}i∈V distributions corresponding to nodes i ∈ V . We will use µ to denote a given set of distributions over all edges and nodes. The set ML (G) is deﬁned as the set of µ where pairwise and singleton distributions are consistent x ˆ xi µij (ˆi , xj ) = µj (xj ) , ˆ xj µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ) ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ˆ ML (G) = µ ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ V xi µi (xi ) = 1 Now consider the following linear program: MAPLPR : µL∗ = arg max µ∈ML (G) µ·θ. (2) where µ·θ is shorthand for µ·θ = ij∈E xi ,xj θij (xi , xj )µij (xi , xj ). It is easy to show (see e.g., [10]) that the optimum of MAPLPR yields an upper bound on the MAP value, i.e. µL∗ ·θ ≥ f (xM ). Furthermore, when the optimal µi (xi ) have only integral values, the assignment that maximizes µi (xi ) yields the correct MAP assignment. In what follows we show how the MPLP algorithms can be derived from the dual of MAPLPR. 1 P We note that some authors also add a term i∈V θi (xi ) to f (x; θ). However, these terms can be included in the pairwise functions θij (xi , xj ), so we ignore them for simplicity. 2 3 The LP Relaxation Dual Since MAPLPR is an LP, it has an equivalent convex dual. In App. A we derive a special dual of MAPLPR using a different representation of ML (G) with redundant variables. The advantage of this dual is that it allows the derivation of simple message passing algorithms. The dual is described in the following proposition. Proposition 1 The following optimization problem is a convex dual of MAPLPR DMAPLPR : min max xi i s.t. max βki (xk , xi ) (3) k∈N (i) xk βji (xj , xi ) + βij (xi , xj ) = θij (xi , xj ) , where the dual variables are βij (xi , xj ) for all ij, ji ∈ E and values of xi and xj . The dual has an intuitive interpretation in terms of re-parameterizations. Consider the star shaped graph Gi consisting of node i and all its neighbors N (i). Assume the potential on edge ki (for k ∈ N (i)) is βki (xk , xi ). The value of the MAP assignment for this model is max max βki (xk , xi ). This is exactly the term in the objective of DMAPLPR. Thus the dual xi k∈N (i) xk corresponds to individually decoding star graphs around all nodes i ∈ V where the potentials on the graph edges should sum to the original potential. It is easy to see that this will always result in an upper bound on the MAP value. The somewhat surprising result of the duality is that there exists a β assignment such that star decoding yields the optimal value of MAPLPR. 4 Block Coordinate Descent in the Dual To obtain a convergent algorithm we use a simple block coordinate descent strategy. At every iteration, ﬁx all variables except a subset, and optimize over this subset. It turns out that this can be done in closed form for the cases we consider. We begin by deriving the EMPLP algorithm. Consider ﬁxing all the β variables except those corresponding to some edge ij ∈ E (i.e., βij and βji ), and minimizing DMAPLPR over the non-ﬁxed variables. Only two terms in the DMAPLPR objective depend on βij and βji . We can write those as f (βij , βji ) = max λ−j (xi ) + max βji (xj , xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + max βij (xi , xj ) i j xi where we deﬁned λ−j (xi ) = i xj k∈N (i)\j xi xi (4) λki (xi ) and λki (xi ) = maxxk βki (xk , xi ) as in App. A. Note that the function f (βij , βji ) depends on the other β values only through λ−i (xj ) and λ−j (xi ). j i This implies that the optimization can be done solely in terms of λij (xj ) and there is no need to store the β values explicitly. The optimal βij , βji are obtained by minimizing f (βij , βji ) subject to the re-parameterization constraint βji (xj , xi ) + βij (xi , xj ) = θij (xi , xj ). The following proposition characterizes the minimum of f (βij , βji ). In fact, as mentioned above, we do not need to characterize the optimal βij (xi , xj ) itself, but only the new λ values. Proposition 2 Maximizing the function f (βij , βji ) yields the following λji (xi ) (and the equivalent expression for λij (xj )) 1 −j 1 λji (xi ) = − λi (xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) j 2 2 xj The proposition is proved in App. B. The λ updates above result in the EMPLP algorithm, described in Fig. 1. Note that since the β optimization affects both λji (xi ) and λij (xj ), both these messages need to be updated simultaneously. We proceed to derive the NMPLP algorithm. For a given node i ∈ V , we consider all its neighbors j ∈ N (i), and wish to optimize over the variables βji (xj , xi ) for ji, ij ∈ E (i.e., all the edges in a star centered on i), while the other variables are ﬁxed. One way of doing so is to use the EMPLP algorithm for the edges in the star, and iterate it until convergence. We now show that the result of 3 Inputs: A graph G = (V, E), potential functions θij (xi , xj ) for each edge ij ∈ E. Initialization: Initialize messages to any value. Algorithm: • Iterate until a stopping criterion is satisﬁed: – Max-product: Iterate over messages and update (cji shifts the max to zero) h i mji (xi )← max m−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) − cji j xj – EMPLP: For each ij ∈ E, update λji (xi ) and λij (xj ) simultaneously (the update for λij (xj ) is the same with i and j exchanged) h i 1 1 λji (xi )← − λ−j (xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) j i 2 2 xj – NMPLP: Iterate over nodes i ∈ V and update all γij (xj ) where j ∈ N (i) 2 3 X 2 γij (xj )← max 4θij (xi , xj ) − γji (xi ) + γki (xi )5 xi |N (i)| + 1 k∈N(i) • Calculate node “beliefs”: Set biP i ) to be the sum of incoming messages into node i ∈ V (x (e.g., for NMPLP set bi (xi ) = k∈N(i) γki (xi )). Output: Return assignment x deﬁned as xi = arg maxxi b(ˆi ). x ˆ Figure 1: The max-product, EMPLP and NMPLP algorithms. Max-product, EMPLP and NMPLP use mesP sages mij , λij and γij respectively. We use the notation m−i (xj ) = k∈N(j)\i mkj (xj ). j this optimization can be found in closed form. The assumption about β being ﬁxed outside the star implies that λ−i (xj ) is ﬁxed. Deﬁne: γji (xi ) = maxxj θij (xi , xj ) + λ−i (xj ) . Simple algebra j j yields the following relation between λ−j (xi ) and γki (xi ) for k ∈ N (i) i 2 λ−j (xi ) = −γji (xi ) + γki (xi ) (5) i |N (i)| + 1 k∈N (i) Plugging this into the deﬁnition of γji (xi ) we obtain the NMPLP update in Fig. 1. The messages for both algorithms can be initialized to any value since it can be shown that after one iteration they will correspond to valid β values. 5 Convergence Properties The MPLP algorithm decreases the dual objective (i.e., an upper bound on the MAP value) at every iteration, and thus its dual objective values form a convergent sequence. Using arguments similar to [5] it can be shown that MPLP has a limit point that is a ﬁxed point of its updates. This in itself does not guarantee convergence to the dual optimum since coordinate descent algorithms may get stuck at a point that is not a global optimum. There are ways of overcoming this difﬁculty, for example by smoothing the objective [4] or using techniques as in [2] (see p. 636). We leave such extensions for further work. In this section we provide several results about the properties of the MPLP ﬁxed points and their relation to the corresponding LP. First, we claim that if all beliefs have unique maxima then the exact MAP assignment is obtained. Proposition 3 If the ﬁxed point of MPLP has bi (xi ) such that for all i the function bi (xi ) has a unique maximizer x∗ , then x∗ is the solution to the MAP problem and the LP relaxation is exact. i Since the dual objective is always greater than or equal to the MAP value, it sufﬁces to show that there exists a dual feasible point whose objective value is f (x∗ ). Denote by β ∗ , λ∗ the value of the corresponding dual parameters at the ﬁxed point of MPLP. Then the dual objective satisﬁes λ∗ (xi ) = ki max i xi k∈N (i) ∗ max βki (xk , x∗ ) = i i k∈N (i) xk ∗ βki (x∗ , x∗ ) = f (x∗ ) k i i 4 k∈N (i) To see why the second equality holds, note that bi (x∗ ) = maxxi ,xj λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) and i i bj (x∗ ) = maxxi ,xj λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ). By the equalization property in Eq. 9 the arguments of j j the two max operations are equal. From the unique maximum assumption it follows that x∗ , x∗ are i j the unique maximizers of the above. It follows that βji , βij are also maximized by x∗ , x∗ . i j In the general case, the MPLP ﬁxed point may not correspond to a primal optimum because of the local optima problem with coordinate descent. However, when the variables are binary, ﬁxed points do correspond to primal solutions, as the following proposition states. Proposition 4 When xi are binary, the MPLP ﬁxed point can be used to obtain the primal optimum. The claim can be shown by constructing a primal optimal solution µ∗ . For tied bi , set µ∗ (xi ) to 0.5 i and for untied bi , set µ∗ (x∗ ) to 1. If bi , bj are not tied we set µ∗ (x∗ , x∗ ) = 1. If bi is not tied but bj i i ij i j is, we set µ∗ (x∗ , xj ) = 0.5. If bi , bj are tied then βji , βij can be shown to be maximized at either ij i x∗ , x∗ = (0, 0), (1, 1) or x∗ , x∗ = (0, 1), (1, 0). We then set µ∗ to be 0.5 at one of these assignment i j i j ij ∗ pairs. The resulting µ∗ is clearly primal feasible. Setting δi = b∗ we obtain that the dual variables i (δ ∗ , λ∗ , β ∗ ) and primal µ∗ satisfy complementary slackness for the LP in Eq. 7 and therefore µ∗ is primal optimal. The binary optimality result implies partial decodability, since [6] shows that the LP is partially decodable for binary variables. 6 Beyond pairwise potentials: Generalized MPLP In the previous sections we considered maximizing functions which factor according to the edges of the graph. A more general setting considers clusters c1 , . . . , ck ⊂ {1, . . . , n} (the set of clusters is denoted by C), and a function f (x; θ) = c θc (xc ) deﬁned via potentials over clusters θc (xc ). The MAP problem in this case also has an LP relaxation (see e.g. [11]). To deﬁne the LP we introduce the following deﬁnitions: S = {c ∩ c : c, c ∈ C, c ∩ c = ∅} is the set of intersection between clusters ˆ ˆ ˆ and S(c) = {s ∈ S : s ⊆ c} is the set of overlap sets for cluster c.We now consider marginals over the variables in c ∈ C and s ∈ S and require that cluster marginals agree on their overlap. Denote this set by ML (C). The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ subject to µ ∈ ML (C). As in Sec. 4, we can derive message passing updates that result in monotone decrease of the dual LP of the above relaxation. The derivation is similar and we omit the details. The key observation is that one needs to introduce |S(c)| copies of each marginal µc (xc ) (instead of the two copies in the pairwise case). Next, as in the EMPLP derivation we assume all β are ﬁxed except those corresponding to some cluster c. The resulting messages are λc→s (xs ) from a cluster c to all of its intersection sets s ∈ S(c). The update on these messages turns out to be:   1 1 λ−c (xs ) + max  λ−c (xs ) + θc (xc ) λc→s (xs ) = − 1 − ˆ s s ˆ |S(c)| |S(c)| xc\s s∈S(c)\s ˆ where for a given c ∈ C all λc→s should be updated simultaneously for s ∈ S(c), and λ−c (xs ) is s deﬁned as the sum of messages into s that are not from c. We refer to this algorithm as Generalized EMPLP (GEMPLP). It is possible to derive an algorithm similar to NMPLP that updates several clusters simultaneously, but its structure is more involved and we do not address it here. 7 Related Work Weiss et al. [11] recently studied the ﬁxed points of a class of max-product like algorithms. Their analysis focused on properties of ﬁxed points rather than convergence guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they showed that if the counting numbers used in a generalized max-product algorithm satisfy certain properties, then its ﬁxed points will be the exact MAP if the beliefs have unique maxima, and for binary variables the solution can be partially decodable. Both these properties are obtained for the MPLP ﬁxed points, and in fact we can show that MPLP satisﬁes the conditions in [11], so that we obtain these properties as corollaries of [11]. We stress however, that [11] does not address convergence of algorithms, but rather properties of their ﬁxed points, if they converge. MPLP is similar in some aspects to Kolmogorov’s TRW-S algorithm [5]. TRW-S is also a monotone coordinate descent method in a dual of the LP relaxation and its ﬁxed points also have similar 5 guarantees to those of MPLP [6]. Furthermore, convergence to a local optimum may occur, as it does for MPLP. One advantage of MPLP lies in the simplicity of its updates and the fact that it is parameter free. The other is its simple generalization to potentials over clusters of nodes (Sec. 6). Recently, several new dual LP algorithms have been introduced, which are more closely related to our formalism. Werner [12] presented a class of algorithms which also improve the dual LP at every iteration. The simplest of those is the max-sum-diffusion algorithm, which is similar to our EMPLP algorithm, although the updates are different from ours. Independently, Johnson et al. [4] presented a class of algorithms that improve duals of the MAP-LP using coordinate descent. They decompose the model into tractable parts by replicating variables and enforce replication constraints within the Lagrangian dual. Our basic formulation in Eq. 3 could be derived from their perspective. However, the updates in the algorithm and the analysis differ. Johnson et al. also presented a method for overcoming the local optimum problem, by smoothing the objective so that it is strictly convex. Such an approach could also be used within our algorithms. Vontobel and Koetter [9] recently introduced a coordinate descent algorithm for decoding LDPC codes. Their method is speciﬁcally tailored for this case, and uses updates that are similar to our edge based updates. Finally, the concept of dual coordinate descent may be used in approximating marginals as well. In [3] we use such an approach to optimize a variational bound on the partition function. The derivation uses some of the ideas used in the MPLP dual, but importantly does not ﬁnd the minimum for each coordinate. Instead, a gradient like step is taken at every iteration to decrease the dual objective. 8 Experiments We compared NMPLP to three other message passing algorithms:2 Tree-Reweighted max-product (TRMP) [10],3 standard max-product (MP), and GEMPLP. For MP and TRMP we used the standard approach of damping messages using a factor of α = 0.5. We ran all algorithms for a maximum of 2000 iterations, and used the hit-time measure to compare their speed of convergence. This measure is deﬁned as follows: At every iteration the beliefs can be used to obtain an assignment x with value f (x). We deﬁne the hit-time as the ﬁrst iteration at which the maximum value of f (x) is achieved.4 We ﬁrst experimented with a 10 × 10 grid graph, with 5 values per state. The function f (x) was 5 a Potts model: f (x) = The values for θij and θi (xi ) ij∈E θij I(xi = xj ) + i∈V θi (xi ). were randomly drawn from [−cI , cI ] and [−cF , cF ] respectively, and we used values of cI and cF in the range range [0.1, 2.35] (with intervals of 0.25), resulting in 100 different models. The clusters for GEMPLP were the faces of the graph [14]. To see if NMPLP converges to the LP solution we also used an LP solver to solve the LP relaxation. We found that the the normalized difference between NMPLP and LP objective was at most 10−3 (median 10−7 ), suggesting that NMPLP typically converged to the LP solution. Fig. 2 (top row) shows the results for the three algorithms. It can be seen that while all non-cluster based algorithms obtain similar f (x) values, NMPLP has better hit-time (in the median) than TRMP and MP, and MP does not converge in many cases (see caption). GEMPLP converges more slowly than NMPLP, but obtains much better f (x) values. In fact, in 99% of the cases the normalized difference between the GEMPLP objective and the f (x) value was less than 10−5 , suggesting that the exact MAP solution was found. We next applied the algorithms to the real world problems of protein design. In [13], Yanover et al. show how these problems can be formalized in terms of ﬁnding a MAP in an appropriately constructed graphical model.6 We used all algorithms except GNMPLP (since there is no natural choice for clusters in this case) to approximate the MAP solution on the 97 models used in [13]. In these models the number of states per variable is 2 − 158, and there are up to 180 variables per model. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows results for all the design problems. In this case only 11% of the MP runs converged, and NMPLP was better than TRMP in terms of hit-time and comparable in f (x) value. The performance of MP was good on the runs where it converged. 2 As expected, NMPLP was faster than EMPLP so only NMPLP results are given. The edge weights for TRMP corresponded to a uniform distribution over all spanning trees. 4 This is clearly a post-hoc measure since it can only be obtained after the algorithm has exceeded its maximum number of iterations. However, it is a reasonable algorithm-independent measure of convergence. 5 The potential θi (xi ) may be folded into the pairwise potential to yield a model as in Eq. 1. 6 Data available from http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/yanover06a/Rosetta Design Dataset.tgz 3 6 (a) (b) (c) 100 (d) 0.6 2000 0.04 0.4 0.02 −50 0 −0.02 −0.04 ∆(Value) 0 1000 ∆(Hit Time) ∆(Value) ∆(Hit Time) 50 0 MP TRMP GMPLP 0 −0.2 −1000 −0.4 −0.06 −100 0.2 MP TRMP GMPLP MP TRMP MP TRMP Figure 2: Evaluation of message passing algorithms on Potts models and protein design problems.

Only convergent max-product runs are shown. 9 Conclusion We have presented a convergent algorithm for MAP approximation that is based on block coordinate descent of the MAP-LP relaxation dual. The algorithm can also be extended to cluster based functions, which result empirically in improved MAP estimates. This is in line with the observations in [14] that generalized belief propagation algorithms can result in signiﬁcant performance improvements. However generalized max-product algorithms [14] are not guaranteed to converge whereas GMPLP is. Furthermore, the GMPLP algorithm does not require a region graph and only involves intersection between pairs of clusters. In conclusion, MPLP has the advantage of resolving the convergence problems of max-product while retaining its simplicity, and offering the theoretical guarantees of LP relaxations. We thus believe it should be useful in a wide array of applications. A Derivation of the dual Before deriving the dual, we ﬁrst express the constraint set ML (G) in a slightly different way. The deﬁnition of ML (G) in Sec. 2 uses a single distribution µij (xi , xj ) for every ij ∈ E. In what follows, we use two copies of this pairwise distribution for every edge, which we denote µij (xi , xj ) ¯ and µji (xj , xi ), and we add the constraint that these two copies both equal the original µij (xi , xj ). ¯ For this extended set of pairwise marginals, we consider the following set of constraints which is clearly equivalent to ML (G). On the rightmost column we give the dual variables that will correspond to each constraint (we omit non-negativity constraints). µij (xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) ¯ µji (xj , xi ) = µij (xi , xj ) ¯ x xi µij (ˆi , xj ) = µj (xj ) ˆ ¯ µji (ˆj , xi ) = µi (xi ) ¯ x xj ˆ xi µi (xi ) = 1 ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xj ∀ji ∈ E, xi ∀i ∈ V βij (xi , xj ) βji (xj , xi ) λij (xj ) λji (xi ) δi (6) ¯ We denote the set of (µ, µ) satisfying these constraints by ML (G). We can now state an LP that ¯ is equivalent to MAPLPR, only with an extended set of variables and constraints. The equivalent ¯ problem is to maximize µ · θ subject to (µ, µ) ∈ ML (G) (note that the objective uses the original ¯ µ copy). LP duality transformation of the extended problem yields the following LP min i δi s.t. λij (xj ) − βij (xi , xj ) ≥ 0 βij (xi , xj ) + βji (xj , xi ) = θij (xi , xj ) − k∈N (i) λki (xi ) + δi ≥ 0 ∀ij, ji ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀i ∈ V, xi (7) We next simplify the above LP by eliminating some of its constraints and variables. Since each variable δi appears in only one constraint, and the objective minimizes δi it follows that δi = maxxi k∈N (i) λki (xi ) and the constraints with δi can be discarded. Similarly, since λij (xj ) appears in a single constraint, we have that for all ij ∈ E, ji ∈ E, xi , xj λij (xj ) = maxxi βij (xi , xj ) and the constraints with λij (xj ), λji (xi ) can also be discarded. Using the eliminated δi and λji (xi ) 7 variables, we obtain that the LP in Eq. 7 is equivalent to that in Eq. 3. Note that the objective in Eq. 3 is convex since it is a sum of point-wise maxima of convex functions. B Proof of Proposition 2 We wish to minimize f in Eq. 4 subject to the constraint that βij + βji = θij . Rewrite f as f (βij , βji ) = max λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ) j i xi ,xj xi ,xj (8) The sum of the two arguments in the max is λ−j (xi ) + λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) i j (because of the constraints on β). Thus the minimum must be greater than −j −i 1 2 maxxi ,xj λi (xi ) + λj (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) . One assignment to β that achieves this minimum is obtained by requiring an equalization condition:7 λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ) = λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) = j i 1 θij (xi , xj ) + λ−j (xi ) + λ−i (xj ) i j 2 (9) which implies βij (xi , xj ) = 1 θij (xi , xj ) + λ−j (xi ) − λ−i (xj ) and a similar expression for βji . i j 2 The resulting λij (xj ) = maxxi βij (xi , xj ) are then the ones in Prop. 2.

Most previous work on active learning either makes strong distributional assumptions, or else is computationally prohibitive. Our algorithm extends the simple scheme of Cohn, Atlas, and Ladner [1] to the agnostic setting, using reductions to supervised learning that harness generalization bounds in a simple but subtle manner. We provide a fall-back guarantee that bounds the algorithm’s label complexity by the agnostic PAC sample complexity. Our analysis yields asymptotic label complexity improvements for certain hypothesis classes and distributions.

This paper develops a new method for detecting an instance of each minority class via an unsupervised local-density-differential sampling strategy. Essentially a variable-scale nearest neighbor process is used to optimize the probability of sampling tightly-grouped minority classes, subject to a local smoothness assumption of the majority class. Results on both synthetic and real data sets are very positive, detecting each minority class with only a fraction of the actively sampled points required by random sampling and by Pelleg’s Interleave method, the prior best technique in the sparse literature on this topic. 1</p><p>2 0.55516064 <a title="139-lsi-2" href="./nips-2007-Privacy-Preserving_Belief_Propagation_and_Sampling.html">157 nips-2007-Privacy-Preserving Belief Propagation and Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Gertjan Burghouts, Arnold Smeulders, Jan-mark Geusebroek</p><p>Abstract: Assessing similarity between features is a key step in object recognition and scene categorization tasks. We argue that knowledge on the distribution of distances generated by similarity functions is crucial in deciding whether features are similar or not. Intuitively one would expect that similarities between features could arise from any distribution. In this paper, we will derive the contrary, and report the theoretical result that Lp -norms –a class of commonly applied distance metrics– from one feature vector to other vectors are Weibull-distributed if the feature values are correlated and non-identically distributed. Besides these assumptions being realistic for images, we experimentally show them to hold for various popular feature extraction algorithms, for a diverse range of images. This fundamental insight opens new directions in the assessment of feature similarity, with projected improvements in object and scene recognition algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.47822806 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-A_Randomized_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Support_Vector_Learning.html">10 nips-2007-A Randomized Algorithm for Large Scale Support Vector Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Krishnan Kumar, Chiru Bhattacharya, Ramesh Hariharan</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of randomized algorithms for large scale SVM learning. The key contribution of the paper is to show that, by using ideas random projections, the minimal number of support vectors required to solve almost separable classiﬁcation problems, such that the solution obtained is near optimal with a very high probability, is given by O(log n); if on removal of properly chosen O(log n) points the data becomes linearly separable then it is called almost separable. The second contribution is a sampling based algorithm, motivated from randomized algorithms, which solves a SVM problem by considering subsets of the dataset which are greater in size than the number of support vectors for the problem. These two ideas are combined to obtain an algorithm for SVM classiﬁcation problems which performs the learning by considering only O(log n) points at a time. Experiments done on synthetic and real life datasets show that the algorithm does scale up state of the art SVM solvers in terms of memory required and execution time without loss in accuracy. It is to be noted that the algorithm presented here nicely complements existing large scale SVM learning approaches as it can be used to scale up any SVM solver. 1</p><p>5 0.45841545 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Semi-Supervised_Multitask_Learning.html">175 nips-2007-Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel message passing algorithm for approximating the MAP problem in graphical models. The algorithm is similar in structure to max-product but unlike max-product it always converges, and can be proven to ﬁnd the exact MAP solution in various settings. The algorithm is derived via block coordinate descent in a dual of the LP relaxation of MAP, but does not require any tunable parameters such as step size or tree weights. We also describe a generalization of the method to cluster based potentials. The new method is tested on synthetic and real-world problems, and compares favorably with previous approaches. Graphical models are an effective approach for modeling complex objects via local interactions. In such models, a distribution over a set of variables is assumed to factor according to cliques of a graph with potentials assigned to each clique. Finding the assignment with highest probability in these models is key to using them in practice, and is often referred to as the MAP (maximum aposteriori) assignment problem. In the general case the problem is NP hard, with complexity exponential in the tree-width of the underlying graph. Linear programming (LP) relaxations have proven very useful in approximating the MAP problem, and often yield satisfactory empirical results. These approaches relax the constraint that the solution is integral, and generally yield non-integral solutions. However, when the LP solution is integral, it is guaranteed to be the exact MAP. For some classes of problems the LP relaxation is provably correct. These include the minimum cut problem and maximum weight matching in bi-partite graphs [8]. Although LP relaxations can be solved using standard LP solvers, this may be computationally intensive for large problems [13]. The key problem with generic LP solvers is that they do not use the graph structure explicitly and thus may be sub-optimal in terms of computational efﬁciency. The max-product method [7] is a message passing algorithm that is often used to approximate the MAP problem. In contrast to generic LP solvers, it makes direct use of the graph structure in constructing and passing messages, and is also very simple to implement. The relation between max-product and the LP relaxation has remained largely elusive, although there are some notable exceptions: For tree-structured graphs, max-product and LP both yield the exact MAP. A recent result [1] showed that for maximum weight matching on bi-partite graphs max-product and LP also yield the exact MAP [1]. Finally, Tree-Reweighted max-product (TRMP) algorithms [5, 10] were shown to converge to the LP solution for binary xi variables, as shown in [6]. In this work, we propose the Max Product Linear Programming algorithm (MPLP) - a very simple variation on max-product that is guaranteed to converge, and has several advantageous properties. MPLP is derived from the dual of the LP relaxation, and is equivalent to block coordinate descent in the dual. Although this results in monotone improvement of the dual objective, global convergence is not always guaranteed since coordinate descent may get stuck in suboptimal points. This can be remedied using various approaches, but in practice we have found MPLP to converge to the LP 1 solution in a majority of the cases we studied. To derive MPLP we use a special form of the dual LP, which involves the introduction of redundant primal variables and constraints. We show how the dual variables corresponding to these constraints turn out to be the messages in the algorithm. We evaluate the method on Potts models and protein design problems, and show that it compares favorably with max-product (which often does not converge for these problems) and TRMP. 1 The Max-Product and MPLP Algorithms The max-product algorithm [7] is one of the most often used methods for solving MAP problems. Although it is neither guaranteed to converge to the correct solution, or in fact converge at all, it provides satisfactory results in some cases. Here we present two algorithms: EMPLP (edge based MPLP) and NMPLP (node based MPLP), which are structurally very similar to max-product, but have several key advantages: • After each iteration, the messages yield an upper bound on the MAP value, and the sequence of bounds is monotone decreasing and convergent. The messages also have a limit point that is a ﬁxed point of the update rule. • No additional parameters (e.g., tree weights as in [6]) are required. • If the ﬁxed point beliefs have a unique maximizer then they correspond to the exact MAP. • For binary variables, MPLP can be used to obtain the solution to an LP relaxation of the MAP problem. Thus, when this LP relaxation is exact and variables are binary, MPLP will ﬁnd the MAP solution. Moreover, for any variable whose beliefs are not tied, the MAP assignment can be found (i.e., the solution is partially decodable). Pseudo code for the algorithms (and for max-product) is given in Fig. 1. As we show in the next sections, MPLP is essentially a block coordinate descent algorithm in the dual of a MAP LP relaxation. Every update of the MPLP messages corresponds to exact minimization of a set of dual variables. For EMPLP minimization is over the set of variables corresponding to an edge, and for NMPLP it is over the set of variables corresponding to all the edges a given node appears in (i.e., a star). The properties of MPLP result from its relation to the LP dual. In what follows we describe the derivation of the MPLP algorithms and prove their properties. 2 The MAP Problem and its LP Relaxation We consider functions over n variables x = {x1 , . . . , xn } deﬁned as follows. Given a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices, and potentials θij (xi , xj ) for all edges ij ∈ E, deﬁne the function1 f (x; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) . (1) ij∈E The MAP problem is deﬁned as ﬁnding an assignment xM that maximizes the function f (x; θ). Below we describe the standard LP relaxation for this problem. Denote by {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E distributions over variables corresponding to edges ij ∈ E and {µi (xi )}i∈V distributions corresponding to nodes i ∈ V . We will use µ to denote a given set of distributions over all edges and nodes. The set ML (G) is deﬁned as the set of µ where pairwise and singleton distributions are consistent x ˆ xi µij (ˆi , xj ) = µj (xj ) , ˆ xj µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ) ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ˆ ML (G) = µ ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ V xi µi (xi ) = 1 Now consider the following linear program: MAPLPR : µL∗ = arg max µ∈ML (G) µ·θ. (2) where µ·θ is shorthand for µ·θ = ij∈E xi ,xj θij (xi , xj )µij (xi , xj ). It is easy to show (see e.g., [10]) that the optimum of MAPLPR yields an upper bound on the MAP value, i.e. µL∗ ·θ ≥ f (xM ). Furthermore, when the optimal µi (xi ) have only integral values, the assignment that maximizes µi (xi ) yields the correct MAP assignment. In what follows we show how the MPLP algorithms can be derived from the dual of MAPLPR. 1 P We note that some authors also add a term i∈V θi (xi ) to f (x; θ). However, these terms can be included in the pairwise functions θij (xi , xj ), so we ignore them for simplicity. 2 3 The LP Relaxation Dual Since MAPLPR is an LP, it has an equivalent convex dual. In App. A we derive a special dual of MAPLPR using a different representation of ML (G) with redundant variables. The advantage of this dual is that it allows the derivation of simple message passing algorithms. The dual is described in the following proposition. Proposition 1 The following optimization problem is a convex dual of MAPLPR DMAPLPR : min max xi i s.t. max βki (xk , xi ) (3) k∈N (i) xk βji (xj , xi ) + βij (xi , xj ) = θij (xi , xj ) , where the dual variables are βij (xi , xj ) for all ij, ji ∈ E and values of xi and xj . The dual has an intuitive interpretation in terms of re-parameterizations. Consider the star shaped graph Gi consisting of node i and all its neighbors N (i). Assume the potential on edge ki (for k ∈ N (i)) is βki (xk , xi ). The value of the MAP assignment for this model is max max βki (xk , xi ). This is exactly the term in the objective of DMAPLPR. Thus the dual xi k∈N (i) xk corresponds to individually decoding star graphs around all nodes i ∈ V where the potentials on the graph edges should sum to the original potential. It is easy to see that this will always result in an upper bound on the MAP value. The somewhat surprising result of the duality is that there exists a β assignment such that star decoding yields the optimal value of MAPLPR. 4 Block Coordinate Descent in the Dual To obtain a convergent algorithm we use a simple block coordinate descent strategy. At every iteration, ﬁx all variables except a subset, and optimize over this subset. It turns out that this can be done in closed form for the cases we consider. We begin by deriving the EMPLP algorithm. Consider ﬁxing all the β variables except those corresponding to some edge ij ∈ E (i.e., βij and βji ), and minimizing DMAPLPR over the non-ﬁxed variables. Only two terms in the DMAPLPR objective depend on βij and βji . We can write those as f (βij , βji ) = max λ−j (xi ) + max βji (xj , xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + max βij (xi , xj ) i j xi where we deﬁned λ−j (xi ) = i xj k∈N (i)\j xi xi (4) λki (xi ) and λki (xi ) = maxxk βki (xk , xi ) as in App. A. Note that the function f (βij , βji ) depends on the other β values only through λ−i (xj ) and λ−j (xi ). j i This implies that the optimization can be done solely in terms of λij (xj ) and there is no need to store the β values explicitly. The optimal βij , βji are obtained by minimizing f (βij , βji ) subject to the re-parameterization constraint βji (xj , xi ) + βij (xi , xj ) = θij (xi , xj ). The following proposition characterizes the minimum of f (βij , βji ). In fact, as mentioned above, we do not need to characterize the optimal βij (xi , xj ) itself, but only the new λ values. Proposition 2 Maximizing the function f (βij , βji ) yields the following λji (xi ) (and the equivalent expression for λij (xj )) 1 −j 1 λji (xi ) = − λi (xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) j 2 2 xj The proposition is proved in App. B. The λ updates above result in the EMPLP algorithm, described in Fig. 1. Note that since the β optimization affects both λji (xi ) and λij (xj ), both these messages need to be updated simultaneously. We proceed to derive the NMPLP algorithm. For a given node i ∈ V , we consider all its neighbors j ∈ N (i), and wish to optimize over the variables βji (xj , xi ) for ji, ij ∈ E (i.e., all the edges in a star centered on i), while the other variables are ﬁxed. One way of doing so is to use the EMPLP algorithm for the edges in the star, and iterate it until convergence. We now show that the result of 3 Inputs: A graph G = (V, E), potential functions θij (xi , xj ) for each edge ij ∈ E. Initialization: Initialize messages to any value. Algorithm: • Iterate until a stopping criterion is satisﬁed: – Max-product: Iterate over messages and update (cji shifts the max to zero) h i mji (xi )← max m−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) − cji j xj – EMPLP: For each ij ∈ E, update λji (xi ) and λij (xj ) simultaneously (the update for λij (xj ) is the same with i and j exchanged) h i 1 1 λji (xi )← − λ−j (xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) j i 2 2 xj – NMPLP: Iterate over nodes i ∈ V and update all γij (xj ) where j ∈ N (i) 2 3 X 2 γij (xj )← max 4θij (xi , xj ) − γji (xi ) + γki (xi )5 xi |N (i)| + 1 k∈N(i) • Calculate node “beliefs”: Set biP i ) to be the sum of incoming messages into node i ∈ V (x (e.g., for NMPLP set bi (xi ) = k∈N(i) γki (xi )). Output: Return assignment x deﬁned as xi = arg maxxi b(ˆi ). x ˆ Figure 1: The max-product, EMPLP and NMPLP algorithms. Max-product, EMPLP and NMPLP use mesP sages mij , λij and γij respectively. We use the notation m−i (xj ) = k∈N(j)\i mkj (xj ). j this optimization can be found in closed form. The assumption about β being ﬁxed outside the star implies that λ−i (xj ) is ﬁxed. Deﬁne: γji (xi ) = maxxj θij (xi , xj ) + λ−i (xj ) . Simple algebra j j yields the following relation between λ−j (xi ) and γki (xi ) for k ∈ N (i) i 2 λ−j (xi ) = −γji (xi ) + γki (xi ) (5) i |N (i)| + 1 k∈N (i) Plugging this into the deﬁnition of γji (xi ) we obtain the NMPLP update in Fig. 1. The messages for both algorithms can be initialized to any value since it can be shown that after one iteration they will correspond to valid β values. 5 Convergence Properties The MPLP algorithm decreases the dual objective (i.e., an upper bound on the MAP value) at every iteration, and thus its dual objective values form a convergent sequence. Using arguments similar to [5] it can be shown that MPLP has a limit point that is a ﬁxed point of its updates. This in itself does not guarantee convergence to the dual optimum since coordinate descent algorithms may get stuck at a point that is not a global optimum. There are ways of overcoming this difﬁculty, for example by smoothing the objective [4] or using techniques as in [2] (see p. 636). We leave such extensions for further work. In this section we provide several results about the properties of the MPLP ﬁxed points and their relation to the corresponding LP. First, we claim that if all beliefs have unique maxima then the exact MAP assignment is obtained. Proposition 3 If the ﬁxed point of MPLP has bi (xi ) such that for all i the function bi (xi ) has a unique maximizer x∗ , then x∗ is the solution to the MAP problem and the LP relaxation is exact. i Since the dual objective is always greater than or equal to the MAP value, it sufﬁces to show that there exists a dual feasible point whose objective value is f (x∗ ). Denote by β ∗ , λ∗ the value of the corresponding dual parameters at the ﬁxed point of MPLP. Then the dual objective satisﬁes λ∗ (xi ) = ki max i xi k∈N (i) ∗ max βki (xk , x∗ ) = i i k∈N (i) xk ∗ βki (x∗ , x∗ ) = f (x∗ ) k i i 4 k∈N (i) To see why the second equality holds, note that bi (x∗ ) = maxxi ,xj λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) and i i bj (x∗ ) = maxxi ,xj λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ). By the equalization property in Eq. 9 the arguments of j j the two max operations are equal. From the unique maximum assumption it follows that x∗ , x∗ are i j the unique maximizers of the above. It follows that βji , βij are also maximized by x∗ , x∗ . i j In the general case, the MPLP ﬁxed point may not correspond to a primal optimum because of the local optima problem with coordinate descent. However, when the variables are binary, ﬁxed points do correspond to primal solutions, as the following proposition states. Proposition 4 When xi are binary, the MPLP ﬁxed point can be used to obtain the primal optimum. The claim can be shown by constructing a primal optimal solution µ∗ . For tied bi , set µ∗ (xi ) to 0.5 i and for untied bi , set µ∗ (x∗ ) to 1. If bi , bj are not tied we set µ∗ (x∗ , x∗ ) = 1. If bi is not tied but bj i i ij i j is, we set µ∗ (x∗ , xj ) = 0.5. If bi , bj are tied then βji , βij can be shown to be maximized at either ij i x∗ , x∗ = (0, 0), (1, 1) or x∗ , x∗ = (0, 1), (1, 0). We then set µ∗ to be 0.5 at one of these assignment i j i j ij ∗ pairs. The resulting µ∗ is clearly primal feasible. Setting δi = b∗ we obtain that the dual variables i (δ ∗ , λ∗ , β ∗ ) and primal µ∗ satisfy complementary slackness for the LP in Eq. 7 and therefore µ∗ is primal optimal. The binary optimality result implies partial decodability, since [6] shows that the LP is partially decodable for binary variables. 6 Beyond pairwise potentials: Generalized MPLP In the previous sections we considered maximizing functions which factor according to the edges of the graph. A more general setting considers clusters c1 , . . . , ck ⊂ {1, . . . , n} (the set of clusters is denoted by C), and a function f (x; θ) = c θc (xc ) deﬁned via potentials over clusters θc (xc ). The MAP problem in this case also has an LP relaxation (see e.g. [11]). To deﬁne the LP we introduce the following deﬁnitions: S = {c ∩ c : c, c ∈ C, c ∩ c = ∅} is the set of intersection between clusters ˆ ˆ ˆ and S(c) = {s ∈ S : s ⊆ c} is the set of overlap sets for cluster c.We now consider marginals over the variables in c ∈ C and s ∈ S and require that cluster marginals agree on their overlap. Denote this set by ML (C). The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ subject to µ ∈ ML (C). As in Sec. 4, we can derive message passing updates that result in monotone decrease of the dual LP of the above relaxation. The derivation is similar and we omit the details. The key observation is that one needs to introduce |S(c)| copies of each marginal µc (xc ) (instead of the two copies in the pairwise case). Next, as in the EMPLP derivation we assume all β are ﬁxed except those corresponding to some cluster c. The resulting messages are λc→s (xs ) from a cluster c to all of its intersection sets s ∈ S(c). The update on these messages turns out to be:   1 1 λ−c (xs ) + max  λ−c (xs ) + θc (xc ) λc→s (xs ) = − 1 − ˆ s s ˆ |S(c)| |S(c)| xc\s s∈S(c)\s ˆ where for a given c ∈ C all λc→s should be updated simultaneously for s ∈ S(c), and λ−c (xs ) is s deﬁned as the sum of messages into s that are not from c. We refer to this algorithm as Generalized EMPLP (GEMPLP). It is possible to derive an algorithm similar to NMPLP that updates several clusters simultaneously, but its structure is more involved and we do not address it here. 7 Related Work Weiss et al. [11] recently studied the ﬁxed points of a class of max-product like algorithms. Their analysis focused on properties of ﬁxed points rather than convergence guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they showed that if the counting numbers used in a generalized max-product algorithm satisfy certain properties, then its ﬁxed points will be the exact MAP if the beliefs have unique maxima, and for binary variables the solution can be partially decodable. Both these properties are obtained for the MPLP ﬁxed points, and in fact we can show that MPLP satisﬁes the conditions in [11], so that we obtain these properties as corollaries of [11]. We stress however, that [11] does not address convergence of algorithms, but rather properties of their ﬁxed points, if they converge. MPLP is similar in some aspects to Kolmogorov’s TRW-S algorithm [5]. TRW-S is also a monotone coordinate descent method in a dual of the LP relaxation and its ﬁxed points also have similar 5 guarantees to those of MPLP [6]. Furthermore, convergence to a local optimum may occur, as it does for MPLP. One advantage of MPLP lies in the simplicity of its updates and the fact that it is parameter free. The other is its simple generalization to potentials over clusters of nodes (Sec. 6). Recently, several new dual LP algorithms have been introduced, which are more closely related to our formalism. Werner [12] presented a class of algorithms which also improve the dual LP at every iteration. The simplest of those is the max-sum-diffusion algorithm, which is similar to our EMPLP algorithm, although the updates are different from ours. Independently, Johnson et al. [4] presented a class of algorithms that improve duals of the MAP-LP using coordinate descent. They decompose the model into tractable parts by replicating variables and enforce replication constraints within the Lagrangian dual. Our basic formulation in Eq. 3 could be derived from their perspective. However, the updates in the algorithm and the analysis differ. Johnson et al. also presented a method for overcoming the local optimum problem, by smoothing the objective so that it is strictly convex. Such an approach could also be used within our algorithms. Vontobel and Koetter [9] recently introduced a coordinate descent algorithm for decoding LDPC codes. Their method is speciﬁcally tailored for this case, and uses updates that are similar to our edge based updates. Finally, the concept of dual coordinate descent may be used in approximating marginals as well. In [3] we use such an approach to optimize a variational bound on the partition function. The derivation uses some of the ideas used in the MPLP dual, but importantly does not ﬁnd the minimum for each coordinate. Instead, a gradient like step is taken at every iteration to decrease the dual objective. 8 Experiments We compared NMPLP to three other message passing algorithms:2 Tree-Reweighted max-product (TRMP) [10],3 standard max-product (MP), and GEMPLP. For MP and TRMP we used the standard approach of damping messages using a factor of α = 0.5. We ran all algorithms for a maximum of 2000 iterations, and used the hit-time measure to compare their speed of convergence. This measure is deﬁned as follows: At every iteration the beliefs can be used to obtain an assignment x with value f (x). We deﬁne the hit-time as the ﬁrst iteration at which the maximum value of f (x) is achieved.4 We ﬁrst experimented with a 10 × 10 grid graph, with 5 values per state. The function f (x) was 5 a Potts model: f (x) = The values for θij and θi (xi ) ij∈E θij I(xi = xj ) + i∈V θi (xi ). were randomly drawn from [−cI , cI ] and [−cF , cF ] respectively, and we used values of cI and cF in the range range [0.1, 2.35] (with intervals of 0.25), resulting in 100 different models. The clusters for GEMPLP were the faces of the graph [14]. To see if NMPLP converges to the LP solution we also used an LP solver to solve the LP relaxation. We found that the the normalized difference between NMPLP and LP objective was at most 10−3 (median 10−7 ), suggesting that NMPLP typically converged to the LP solution. Fig. 2 (top row) shows the results for the three algorithms. It can be seen that while all non-cluster based algorithms obtain similar f (x) values, NMPLP has better hit-time (in the median) than TRMP and MP, and MP does not converge in many cases (see caption). GEMPLP converges more slowly than NMPLP, but obtains much better f (x) values. In fact, in 99% of the cases the normalized difference between the GEMPLP objective and the f (x) value was less than 10−5 , suggesting that the exact MAP solution was found. We next applied the algorithms to the real world problems of protein design. In [13], Yanover et al. show how these problems can be formalized in terms of ﬁnding a MAP in an appropriately constructed graphical model.6 We used all algorithms except GNMPLP (since there is no natural choice for clusters in this case) to approximate the MAP solution on the 97 models used in [13]. In these models the number of states per variable is 2 − 158, and there are up to 180 variables per model. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows results for all the design problems. In this case only 11% of the MP runs converged, and NMPLP was better than TRMP in terms of hit-time and comparable in f (x) value. The performance of MP was good on the runs where it converged. 2 As expected, NMPLP was faster than EMPLP so only NMPLP results are given. The edge weights for TRMP corresponded to a uniform distribution over all spanning trees. 4 This is clearly a post-hoc measure since it can only be obtained after the algorithm has exceeded its maximum number of iterations. However, it is a reasonable algorithm-independent measure of convergence. 5 The potential θi (xi ) may be folded into the pairwise potential to yield a model as in Eq. 1. 6 Data available from http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/yanover06a/Rosetta Design Dataset.tgz 3 6 (a) (b) (c) 100 (d) 0.6 2000 0.04 0.4 0.02 −50 0 −0.02 −0.04 ∆(Value) 0 1000 ∆(Hit Time) ∆(Value) ∆(Hit Time) 50 0 MP TRMP GMPLP 0 −0.2 −1000 −0.4 −0.06 −100 0.2 MP TRMP GMPLP MP TRMP MP TRMP Figure 2: Evaluation of message passing algorithms on Potts models and protein design problems.

Only convergent max-product runs are shown. 9 Conclusion We have presented a convergent algorithm for MAP approximation that is based on block coordinate descent of the MAP-LP relaxation dual. The algorithm can also be extended to cluster based functions, which result empirically in improved MAP estimates. This is in line with the observations in [14] that generalized belief propagation algorithms can result in signiﬁcant performance improvements. However generalized max-product algorithms [14] are not guaranteed to converge whereas GMPLP is. Furthermore, the GMPLP algorithm does not require a region graph and only involves intersection between pairs of clusters. In conclusion, MPLP has the advantage of resolving the convergence problems of max-product while retaining its simplicity, and offering the theoretical guarantees of LP relaxations. We thus believe it should be useful in a wide array of applications. A Derivation of the dual Before deriving the dual, we ﬁrst express the constraint set ML (G) in a slightly different way. The deﬁnition of ML (G) in Sec. 2 uses a single distribution µij (xi , xj ) for every ij ∈ E. In what follows, we use two copies of this pairwise distribution for every edge, which we denote µij (xi , xj ) ¯ and µji (xj , xi ), and we add the constraint that these two copies both equal the original µij (xi , xj ). ¯ For this extended set of pairwise marginals, we consider the following set of constraints which is clearly equivalent to ML (G). On the rightmost column we give the dual variables that will correspond to each constraint (we omit non-negativity constraints). µij (xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) ¯ µji (xj , xi ) = µij (xi , xj ) ¯ x xi µij (ˆi , xj ) = µj (xj ) ˆ ¯ µji (ˆj , xi ) = µi (xi ) ¯ x xj ˆ xi µi (xi ) = 1 ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xj ∀ji ∈ E, xi ∀i ∈ V βij (xi , xj ) βji (xj , xi ) λij (xj ) λji (xi ) δi (6) ¯ We denote the set of (µ, µ) satisfying these constraints by ML (G). We can now state an LP that ¯ is equivalent to MAPLPR, only with an extended set of variables and constraints. The equivalent ¯ problem is to maximize µ · θ subject to (µ, µ) ∈ ML (G) (note that the objective uses the original ¯ µ copy). LP duality transformation of the extended problem yields the following LP min i δi s.t. λij (xj ) − βij (xi , xj ) ≥ 0 βij (xi , xj ) + βji (xj , xi ) = θij (xi , xj ) − k∈N (i) λki (xi ) + δi ≥ 0 ∀ij, ji ∈ E, xi , xj ∀ij ∈ E, xi , xj ∀i ∈ V, xi (7) We next simplify the above LP by eliminating some of its constraints and variables. Since each variable δi appears in only one constraint, and the objective minimizes δi it follows that δi = maxxi k∈N (i) λki (xi ) and the constraints with δi can be discarded. Similarly, since λij (xj ) appears in a single constraint, we have that for all ij ∈ E, ji ∈ E, xi , xj λij (xj ) = maxxi βij (xi , xj ) and the constraints with λij (xj ), λji (xi ) can also be discarded. Using the eliminated δi and λji (xi ) 7 variables, we obtain that the LP in Eq. 7 is equivalent to that in Eq. 3. Note that the objective in Eq. 3 is convex since it is a sum of point-wise maxima of convex functions. B Proof of Proposition 2 We wish to minimize f in Eq. 4 subject to the constraint that βij + βji = θij . Rewrite f as f (βij , βji ) = max λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) + max λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ) j i xi ,xj xi ,xj (8) The sum of the two arguments in the max is λ−j (xi ) + λ−i (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) i j (because of the constraints on β). Thus the minimum must be greater than −j −i 1 2 maxxi ,xj λi (xi ) + λj (xj ) + θij (xi , xj ) . One assignment to β that achieves this minimum is obtained by requiring an equalization condition:7 λ−i (xj ) + βij (xi , xj ) = λ−j (xi ) + βji (xj , xi ) = j i 1 θij (xi , xj ) + λ−j (xi ) + λ−i (xj ) i j 2 (9) which implies βij (xi , xj ) = 1 θij (xi , xj ) + λ−j (xi ) − λ−i (xj ) and a similar expression for βji . i j 2 The resulting λij (xj ) = maxxi βij (xi , xj ) are then the ones in Prop. 2.

Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation has been employed in a wide variety of applications with great empirical success, but it comes with few theoretical guarantees. In this paper we investigate the use of the max-product form of belief propagation for weighted matching problems on general graphs. We show that max-product converges to the correct answer if the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the weighted matching problem is tight and does not converge if the LP relaxation is loose. This provides an exact characterization of max-product performance and reveals connections to the widely used optimization technique of LP relaxation. In addition, we demonstrate that max-product is effective in solving practical weighted matching problems in a distributed fashion by applying it to the problem of self-organization in sensor networks. 1</p><p>4 0.60678786 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>5 0.60138047 <a title="139-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>

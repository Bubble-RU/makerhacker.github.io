<p>Author: Xiaogang Wang, Eric Grimson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely applied in the computer vision ﬁeld. However, many of these applications have difﬁculty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since LDA assumes that a document is a “bag-of-words”. It is also critical to properly design “words” and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA), which better encodes spatial structures among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the values of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents a priori, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in SLDA. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be ﬂexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use SLDA to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than LDA. 1</p><p>3 0.14319769 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas L. Roux, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Marc Joliveau, Balázs Kégl</p><p>Abstract: We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a ﬁxed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes, but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.</p><p>4 0.12603709 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Horizontal_Connections_in_a_Sparse_Coding_Model_of_Natural_Images.html">111 nips-2007-Learning Horizontal Connections in a Sparse Coding Model of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that adapting a dictionary of basis functions to the statistics of natural images so as to maximize sparsity in the coefﬁcients results in a set of dictionary elements whose spatial properties resemble those of V1 (primary visual cortex) receptive ﬁelds. However, the resulting sparse coefﬁcients still exhibit pronounced statistical dependencies, thus violating the independence assumption of the sparse coding model. Here, we propose a model that attempts to capture the dependencies among the basis function coefﬁcients by including a pairwise coupling term in the prior over the coefﬁcient activity states. When adapted to the statistics of natural images, the coupling terms learn a combination of facilitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring basis functions. These learned interactions may offer an explanation for the function of horizontal connections in V1 in terms of a prior over natural images.</p><p>5 0.12238964 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Object_Recognition_by_Scene_Alignment.html">143 nips-2007-Object Recognition by Scene Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba, Ce Liu, Rob Fergus, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Current object recognition systems can only recognize a limited number of object categories; scaling up to many categories is the next challenge. We seek to build a system to recognize and localize many different object categories in complex scenes. We achieve this through a simple approach: by matching the input image, in an appropriate representation, to images in a large training set of labeled images. Due to regularities in object identities across similar scenes, the retrieved matches provide hypotheses for object identities and locations. We build a probabilistic model to transfer the labels from the retrieval set to the input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and study algorithm component contributions using held-out test sets from the LabelMe database. 1</p><p>6 0.12162197 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Batch_Mode_Active_Learning.html">69 nips-2007-Discriminative Batch Mode Active Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Vittorio Ferrari, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic generative model of visual attributes, together with an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as ‘red’, ‘striped’, or ‘spotted’. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images.</p><p>3 0.615197 <a title="172-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-Spatial_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">183 nips-2007-Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We present a probability distribution over non-negative integer valued matrices with possibly an inﬁnite number of columns. We also derive a stochastic process that reproduces this distribution over equivalence classes. This model can play the role of the prior in nonparametric Bayesian learning scenarios where multiple latent features are associated with the observed data and each feature can have multiple appearances or occurrences within each data point. Such data arise naturally when learning visual object recognition systems from unlabelled images. Together with the nonparametric prior we consider a likelihood model that explains the visual appearance and location of local image patches. Inference with this model is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.56246763 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Fast_and_Scalable_Training_of_Semi-Supervised_CRFs_with_Application_to_Activity_Recognition.html">88 nips-2007-Fast and Scalable Training of Semi-Supervised CRFs with Application to Activity Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm called Optimistic Linear Programming (OLP) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown Markov decision process (MDP). OLP uses its experience so far to estimate the MDP. It chooses actions by optimistically maximizing estimated future rewards over a set of next-state transition probabilities that are close to the estimates, a computation that corresponds to solving linear programs. We show that the total expected reward obtained by OLP up to time T is within C(P ) log T of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where C(P ) is an explicit, MDP-dependent constant. OLP is closely related to an algorithm proposed by Burnetas and Katehakis with four key differences: OLP is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm. OLP is also similar in ﬂavor to an algorithm recently proposed by Auer and Ortner. But OLP is simpler and its regret bound has a better dependence on the size of the MDP. 1</p><p>3 0.68409717 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Omer Bobrowski, Ron Meir, Shy Shoham, Yonina Eldar</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly evident that organisms acting in uncertain dynamical environments often employ exact or approximate Bayesian statistical calculations in order to continuously estimate the environmental state, integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, form predictions and choose actions. What is less clear is how these putative computations are implemented by cortical neural networks. An additional level of complexity is introduced because these networks observe the world through spike trains received from primary sensory afferents, rather than directly. A recent line of research has described mechanisms by which such computations can be implemented using a network of neurons whose activity directly represents a probability distribution across the possible “world states”. Much of this work, however, uses various approximations, which severely restrict the domain of applicability of these implementations. Here we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process ﬁltering, and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using linear neural networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with several examples, and relate the required network properties to the statistical nature of the environment, thereby quantifying the compatibility of a given network with its environment. 1</p><p>4 0.66255403 <a title="172-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Clustering_with_Exemplar-Based_Models.html">61 nips-2007-Convex Clustering with Exemplar-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Danial Lashkari, Polina Golland</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is often formulated as the maximum likelihood estimation of a mixture model that explains the data. The EM algorithm widely used to solve the resulting optimization problem is inherently a gradient-descent method and is sensitive to initialization. The resulting solution is a local optimum in the neighborhood of the initial guess. This sensitivity to initialization presents a signiﬁcant challenge in clustering large data sets into many clusters. In this paper, we present a different approach to approximate mixture ﬁtting for clustering. We introduce an exemplar-based likelihood function that approximates the exact likelihood. This formulation leads to a convex minimization problem and an efﬁcient algorithm with guaranteed convergence to the globally optimal solution. The resulting clustering can be thought of as a probabilistic mapping of the data points to the set of exemplars that minimizes the average distance and the information-theoretic cost of mapping. We present experimental results illustrating the performance of our algorithm and its comparison with the conventional approach to mixture model clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.58781004 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Continuous_Action_Spaces_through_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods.html">168 nips-2007-Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Action Spaces through Sequential Monte Carlo Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Lazaric, Marcello Restelli, Andrea Bonarini</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-world domains often requires to deal with continuous state and action spaces. Although many solutions have been proposed to apply Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous state problems, the same techniques can be hardly extended to continuous action spaces, where, besides the computation of a good approximation of the value function, a fast method for the identiﬁcation of the highest-valued action is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic approach in which the policy of the actor is estimated through sequential Monte Carlo methods. The importance sampling step is performed on the basis of the values learned by the critic, while the resampling step modiﬁes the actor’s policy. The proposed approach has been empirically compared to other learning algorithms into several domains; in this paper, we report results obtained in a control problem consisting of steering a boat across a river. 1</p><p>6 0.5838539 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Spatial_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">183 nips-2007-Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

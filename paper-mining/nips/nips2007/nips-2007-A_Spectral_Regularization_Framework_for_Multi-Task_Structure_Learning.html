<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>3 0.15223302 <a title="12-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Prediction.html">135 nips-2007-Multi-task Gaussian Process Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Edwin V. Bonilla, Kian M. Chai, Christopher Williams</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate multi-task learning in the context of Gaussian Processes (GP). We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a “free-form” covariance matrix over tasks. This allows for good ﬂexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assumption of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task transfer occurs. We evaluate the beneﬁts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.1402894 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-DIFFRAC%3A_a_discriminative_and_flexible_framework_for_clustering.html">65 nips-2007-DIFFRAC: a discriminative and flexible framework for clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>5 0.13801967 <a title="12-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Risk_Minimization_Principle_for_a_Class_of_Parzen_Estimators.html">11 nips-2007-A Risk Minimization Principle for a Class of Parzen Estimators</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristiaan Pelckmans, Johan Suykens, Bart D. Moor</p><p>Abstract: This paper1 explores the use of a Maximal Average Margin (MAM) optimality principle for the design of learning algorithms. It is shown that the application of this risk minimization principle results in a class of (computationally) simple learning machines similar to the classical Parzen window classiﬁer. A direct relation with the Rademacher complexities is established, as such facilitating analysis and providing a notion of certainty of prediction. This analysis is related to Support Vector Machines by means of a margin transformation. The power of the MAM principle is illustrated further by application to ordinal regression tasks, resulting in an O(n) algorithm able to process large datasets in reasonable time. 1</p><p>6 0.10712366 <a title="12-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Bundle_Methods_for_Machine_Learning.html">40 nips-2007-Bundle Methods for Machine Learning</a></p>

Our method applies to Support Vector estimation, regression, Gaussian Processes, and any other regularized risk minimization setting which leads to a convex optimization problem. SVMPerf can be shown to be a special case of our approach. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ ) steps to precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ )) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate in experiments the performance of our approach. 1</p><p>3 0.60723495 <a title="12-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Prediction.html">135 nips-2007-Multi-task Gaussian Process Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised methods use unlabeled data in addition to labeled data to construct predictors. While existing semi-supervised methods have shown some promising empirical performance, their development has been based largely based on heuristics. In this paper we study semi-supervised learning from the viewpoint of minimax theory. Our ﬁrst result shows that some common methods based on regularization using graph Laplacians do not lead to faster minimax rates of convergence. Thus, the estimators that use the unlabeled data do not have smaller risk than the estimators that use only labeled data. We then develop several new approaches that provably lead to improved performance. The statistical tools of minimax analysis are thus used to offer some new perspective on the problem of semi-supervised learning. 1</p><p>2 0.86899096 <a title="12-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Retrieved_context_and_the_discovery_of_semantic_structure.html">169 nips-2007-Retrieved context and the discovery of semantic structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinayak Rao, Marc Howard</p><p>Abstract: Semantic memory refers to our knowledge of facts and relationships between concepts. A successful semantic memory depends on inferring relationships between items that are not explicitly taught. Recent mathematical modeling of episodic memory argues that episodic recall relies on retrieval of a gradually-changing representation of temporal context. We show that retrieved context enables the development of a global memory space that reﬂects relationships between all items that have been previously learned. When newly-learned information is integrated into this structure, it is placed in some relationship to all other items, even if that relationship has not been explicitly learned. We demonstrate this effect for global semantic structures shaped topologically as a ring, and as a two-dimensional sheet. We also examined the utility of this learning algorithm for learning a more realistic semantic space by training it on a large pool of synonym pairs. Retrieved context enabled the model to “infer” relationships between synonym pairs that had not yet been presented. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86370993 <a title="12-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-A_Spectral_Regularization_Framework_for_Multi-Task_Structure_Learning.html">12 nips-2007-A Spectral Regularization Framework for Multi-Task Structure Learning</a></p>

Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: The notion of algorithmic stability has been used effectively in the past to derive tight generalization bounds. A key advantage of these bounds is that they are designed for speciﬁc learning algorithms, exploiting their particular properties. But, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence, which is clear in system diagnosis or time series prediction problems. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary mixing sequence, which implies a dependence between observations that weaken over time. It proves novel stability-based generalization bounds that hold even with this more general setting. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case. It also illustrates their application in the case of several general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression.</p><p>5 0.69184506 <a title="12-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes.html">212 nips-2007-Using Deep Belief Nets to Learn Covariance Kernels for Gaussian Processes</a></p>

If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classiﬁcation can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively ﬁne-tune the covariance kernel.</p><p>6 0.66552049 <a title="12-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-A_General_Boosting_Method_and_its_Application_to_Learning_Ranking_Functions_for_Web_Search.html">6 nips-2007-A General Boosting Method and its Application to Learning Ranking Functions for Web Search</a></p>

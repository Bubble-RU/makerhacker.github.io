</p><p>3 We demonstrate the ability of the network to efﬁciently classify overlapping patterns, thanks to the self-regulating mechanism. [sent-14, score-0.111]
</p><p>4 In line with standard assumptions in computational neuroscience, neuromorphic devices are endowed with adaptive capabilities through various forms of plasticity in the synapses which connect the neural elements. [sent-16, score-0.585]
</p><p>5 A widely adopted framework goes under the name of Hebbian learning, by which the efﬁcacy of a synapse is potentiated (the post-synaptic effect of a spike is enhanced) if the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are simultaneously active on a suitable time scale. [sent-17, score-0.63]
</p><p>6 The synaptic circuits described in what follows implement a stochastic version of rate-based Hebbian learning. [sent-19, score-0.37]
</p><p>7 In the last decade, it has been realized that general constraints plausibly met by any concrete implementation of a synaptic device in a neural network, bear profound consequences on ∗  http://neural. [sent-20, score-0.293]
</p><p>8 Speciﬁcally, once one accepts that a synaptic element can neither have an unlimited dynamic range (i. [sent-24, score-0.293]
</p><p>9 synaptic efﬁcacy is bounded), nor can it undergo arbitrarily small changes (i. [sent-26, score-0.293]
</p><p>10 synaptic efﬁcacy has a ﬁnite analog depth), it has been proven ([1], [7]) that a deterministic learning prescription implies an extremely low memory capacity, and a severe “palimpsest” property: new memories quickly erase the trace of older ones. [sent-28, score-0.405]
</p><p>11 The stochastic element of the learning dynamics would imply ad hoc new elements, were it not for the fact that for a spike-driven implementation of the synapse, the noisy activity of the neurons in the network can provide the needed “noise generator” [7]. [sent-30, score-0.221]
</p><p>12 Therefore, for an efﬁcient learning electronic network, the implementation of the neuron as a spiking element is not only a requirement of “biological plausibility”, but a compelling computational requirement. [sent-31, score-0.175]
</p><p>13 Learning in networks of spiking IF neurons with stochastic plastic synapses has been studied theoretically [7], [10], [2], and stochastic, bi-stable synaptic models have been implemented in silicon [8], [6]. [sent-32, score-1.016]
</p><p>14 A detailed learning strategy along this line was proven in [13] to be appropriate for linearly separable patterns for a Perceptron-like network; the extension to spiking and recurrent networks is currently studied. [sent-38, score-0.175]
</p><p>15 In section 2 we give an overview of the chip architecture and of the implemented synaptic model. [sent-39, score-0.423]
</p><p>16 In section 3 we show an example of the measures effectuated on the chip useful to characterize the synaptic and neuronal parameters. [sent-40, score-0.423]
</p><p>17 The last paragraph describes chip performances in a simple classiﬁcation task, and illustrate the improvement brought about by the stop-learning mechanism. [sent-42, score-0.169]
</p><p>18 2 Chip architecture and main features The chip, already described in [3] implements a recurrent network of 32 integrate-and-ﬁre neurons with spike-frequency adaptation and bi-stable, stochastic, Hebbian synapses. [sent-43, score-0.186]
</p><p>19 A completely reconﬁgurable synaptic matrix supports up to all-to-all recurrent connectivity, and AER-based external connectivity. [sent-44, score-0.393]
</p><p>20 Besides establishing an arbitrary synaptic connectivity, the excitatory/inhibitory nature of each synapse can also be set. [sent-45, score-0.428]
</p><p>21 The implemented neuron is the IF neuron with constant leakage term and a lower bound for the membrane potential V (t) introduced in [12] and studied theoretically in [9]. [sent-46, score-0.278]
</p><p>22 The dendritic tree of each neuron is composed of up to 31 activated recurrent synapses and up to 32 activated external, AER ones. [sent-51, score-0.858]
</p><p>23 For the recurrent synapses, each impinging spike triggers short-time (and possibly long-term) changes in the state of the synapse, as detailed below. [sent-52, score-0.175]
</p><p>24 Spikes from neurons outside the chip come in the form of AER events, and are targeted to the correct AER synapse by the X-Y Decoder. [sent-53, score-0.339]
</p><p>25 Synapses which are set to be excitatory, either AER or recurrent are plastic; inhibitory synapses are ﬁxed. [sent-54, score-0.625]
</p><p>26 Spikes generated by the neurons in the chip are arbitrated for access to the AER bus for monitoring and/or mapping to external targets. [sent-55, score-0.238]
</p><p>27 The synaptic circuit described in [3] implements the model proposed in [4] and brieﬂy motivated in the Introduction. [sent-56, score-0.343]
</p><p>28 The synapse possesses only two states of efﬁcacy (a bi-stable device): the internal synaptic dynamics is associated with an internal variable X; when X > θX the efﬁcacy is set to be 2  potentiated, otherwise is set to be depressed. [sent-57, score-0.524]
</p><p>29 In the absence of intervening spikes X is forced to drift towards a “high” or “low” value depending on whether the last jump left it above or below θX . [sent-60, score-0.124]
</p><p>30 This preserves the synaptic efﬁcacy on long time scale. [sent-61, score-0.293]
</p><p>31 A further variable is associated with the post-synaptic neuron dynamics, which essentially measures the average ﬁring activity. [sent-62, score-0.139]
</p><p>32 Following [4], by analogy with the role played by the intracellular concentration of calcium ions upon spike emission, we will call it a “calcium variable” C(t). [sent-63, score-0.32]
</p><p>33 C(t) undergoes an upward jump when the postsynaptic neuron emits a spike, and linearly decays between two spikes. [sent-64, score-0.276]
</p><p>34 It therefore integrates the spikes sequence and, when compared to suitable thresholds as detailed below, it determines which candidate synaptic jumps will be allowed to occur; for example, it can constrain the synapse to stop up-regulating because the post-synaptic neuron is already very active. [sent-65, score-0.722]
</p><p>35 C(t) acts as a regulatory element of the synaptic dynamics. [sent-66, score-0.321]
</p><p>36 The resulting short-term dynamics for the internal synaptic variable X is described by the following conditions: X(t) → X(t) + Jup if Vpost (t) > θV and VT H1 < C(t) < VT H3 ; X(t) → X(t) − Jdw if Vpost (t) ≤ θV and VT H1 < C(t) < VT H2 where Jup and Jdw are positive constants. [sent-67, score-0.363]
</p><p>37 In ﬁgure 1 we illustrate the effect of the calcium dynamics on X. [sent-69, score-0.29]
</p><p>38 Increasing input forces the postsynaptic neuron to ﬁre at increasing frequencies. [sent-70, score-0.229]
</p><p>39 When C(t) > VT H2 = VT H3 jumps are inhibited and X is forced to drift towards its lower bound. [sent-72, score-0.093]

</p><p>41 For each synapse in a subset of 31, we generate a pre-synaptic poisson spike train at 70 Hz. [sent-75, score-0.251]
</p><p>42 The post synaptic neuron is forced to ﬁre a poisson spike train by applying an external DC current and a poisson train of inhibitory spikes through AER. [sent-76, score-0.76]
</p><p>43 Setting to zero both the potentiated and depressed efﬁcacies, the activity of the post-synaptic neuron can be easily tuned by varying the amplitude of the DC current and the frequency of the inhibitory AER train. [sent-77, score-0.629]
</p><p>44 We initialize the 31 (AER) synapses to depressed (potentiated) and we monitor the post-synaptic neuron activity during a stimulation 3  trial lasting 0. [sent-78, score-0.909]
</p><p>45 At the end of the trial we read the synaptic state using an AER protocol developed to this purpose. [sent-80, score-0.384]
</p><p>46 For each chosen value of the post-synaptic ﬁring rate, we evaluate the probability to ﬁnd synapses in a potentiated (depressed) state repeating the test 50 times. [sent-81, score-0.784]
</p><p>47 Tests were performed both with active and inactive Calcium mechanism. [sent-83, score-0.197]
</p><p>48 When calcium mechanism is inactive, the LTP is monotonically increasing with the post-synaptic ﬁring rate while when the calcium circuit is activated the LTP probability has a max form Vpost around 80 Hz. [sent-84, score-0.792]
</p><p>49 For the purpose of a meaningful comparison with the chip behaviour relevant parameter affecting neural and synaptic dynamics and their distributions (due to inhomogenities and mismatches) are characterized. [sent-86, score-0.467]
</p><p>50 Red and blue lines are LTP probabilities with and without calcium stop-learning mechanism respectively. [sent-96, score-0.419]
</p><p>51 Gray lines are LTD probabilities without calcium stoplearning mechanism, the case LTD with Ca mechanism is not shown. [sent-97, score-0.395]
</p><p>52 Error bars are standard deviations over the 50 trials  4 Learning overlapping patterns We conﬁgured the synaptic matrix to have a perceptron like network with 1 output and 32 inputs (32 AER synapses). [sent-98, score-0.648]
</p><p>53 31 synapses are set as plastic excitatory ones, the 32nd is set as inhibitory and used to modulate the post-synpatic neuron activity. [sent-99, score-0.807]
</p><p>54 Our aim is to teach the perceptron to classify two patterns through a semi-supervised learning strategy: “Up” and “Down”. [sent-100, score-0.228]
</p><p>55 We expect that after learning the perceptron will respond with high output frequency for pattern “Up” and with low output frequency for pattern “Down”. [sent-101, score-0.388]
</p><p>56 The self regulating Ca mechanism is exploited to improve performances when Up and Down patterns have a signiﬁcant overlap. [sent-102, score-0.261]
</p><p>57 The learning is semi-supervised: for each pattern a “teacher” input is sent to the output neuron steering its activity to be high or low, as desired. [sent-103, score-0.262]
</p><p>58 At the end of the learning period the “teacher” is turned off and the perceptron output is driven only by the input stimuli: in this conditions its classiﬁcation ability is tested. [sent-104, score-0.165]
</p><p>59 We present learning performances for input patterns with increasing overlap, and demonstrate the effect of the stop learning mechanism (overlap ranging from 6 to 14 synapses). [sent-105, score-0.35]
</p><p>60 Upon stimulation active pre-synaptic inputs are poisson spike trains at 70 Hz, while inactive inputs are poisson spike trains at 10 Hz. [sent-106, score-0.553]
</p><p>61 Up and Down patterns are randomly presented with equal probability. [sent-108, score-0.073]
</p><p>62 The teaching signal, a combination of an excitatory constant cur4  rent and of an inhibitory AER spike train, forces the output ﬁring rate to 50 or 0. [sent-109, score-0.239]
</p><p>63 One run lasts for 150 trials which is sufﬁcient for the stabilization of the output frequencies. [sent-111, score-0.098]
</p><p>64 At the end of each trial we turn off the teaching signal, we freeze the synaptic dynamics and we read the state of each synapse using an AER protocol developed for this purpose. [sent-112, score-0.605]
</p><p>65 In these conditions we performed a 5 seconds test (“Checking Phase”) to measure the perceptron frequencies when pattern Up or pattern Down are presented. [sent-113, score-0.258]
</p><p>66 For each run we change: a) the “deﬁnition” of patterns Up and Down: inputs activated by pattern Up and Down are chosen randomly at the beginning of each run; b) the initial synaptic state, with the constraint that only about 30 % of the synapses are potentiated; c) the stimulation sequence. [sent-115, score-1.111]
</p><p>67 For the ﬁrst experiment we turned off the stop learning mechanism and we chose orthogonal patterns. [sent-116, score-0.21]
</p><p>68 In this case the perceptron was able to correctly classify the stimuli: after about 50 trials, choosing a suitable threshold, one can discriminate the perceptron ouput to different patterns (lower left panel on ﬁgure 4). [sent-117, score-0.352]
</p><p>69 The output frequency separation slightly increases until trial number 100 remaining almost stable after that point. [sent-118, score-0.171]
</p><p>70 We then studied the case of overlapped patterns both with active and inactive Calcium mechanism. [sent-119, score-0.301]
</p><p>71 Only the up threshold Khigh is active (the threshold above which up jumps are inhibnited). [sent-124, score-0.154]
</p><p>72 The Calcium circuit up parameters are tuned so that the Ca variable passes Khigh for the mean ﬁring rate of the postsynaptic neuron around 80 Hz. [sent-125, score-0.251]
</p><p>73 We show in ﬁgure 3 the distributions of the potentiated fraction of the synapses over the 50 runs at different stages along the run for overlap 10 with inactive (upper panels) and active (lower panels) calcium mechanism. [sent-126, score-1.525]
</p><p>74 We divided synapses in three subgroups: Up (red) synapses with pre-synaptic input activated solely by Up pattern, Down (blue) synapses with pre-synaptic inputs activated only by Down pattern, and Overlap (green) synapses with pre-synpatic inputs activated by both pattern Up and Down. [sent-127, score-2.373]
</p><p>75 The state of the synapses is recorded after every learning step. [sent-128, score-0.507]
</p><p>76 The fraction of potentiated synapses is calculated over the number of synapses belonging to each subgroup. [sent-130, score-1.291]
</p><p>77 When the stop learning mechanism is inactive, at the end of the experiment, the green Ca mechanism inactive trial 2  trial 50  1  trial 100  1  trial 150  1  1  0. [sent-131, score-0.85]

</p><p>79 5 w+  1  Figure 3: Distribution of the fraction of potentiated synapses. [sent-171, score-0.277]
</p><p>80 The number of inputs belonging to both patterns is 10. [sent-172, score-0.11]
</p><p>81 distribution of overlap synapses is broad, when the Calcium mechanism is active, synapses overlap tend to be depotentiated. [sent-173, score-1.707]
</p><p>82 This result is the “microscopic” effect of the stop learning mechanism: once the number of potentiated synapses is sufﬁcient to drive the perceptron output frequency above 80 Hz, the overlap synapses tend to be depotentiated. [sent-174, score-1.828]
</p><p>83 Overlap synapses would be pushed half of the 5  times to the potentiated state and half of the times to the depressed state, so that it is more likely for the Up synapses to reach earlier the potentiated state. [sent-175, score-1.66]
</p><p>84 When the stop learning mechanism is active, the potentiated synapses are enogh to drive the output neuron about 80 Hz, further potentiation is inhibited for all synapses so that overlap synapses get depressed on average. [sent-176, score-2.629]
</p><p>85 This happens under the condition that the transition probability are sufﬁciently small to avoid that at each trial the learning is completely disrupted. [sent-177, score-0.091]
</p><p>86 The distribution of the output frequencies for increasing overlap is illustrated in ﬁgure 4 (Ca mechanism inactive in the upper panels, active for the lower panels). [sent-178, score-0.717]
</p><p>87 In blue the histograms of the output frequency for the down pattern, in red those for up pattern. [sent-180, score-0.104]

</p><p>94 66  For each run the number of potentiated synapses is different due to the random choices of Up, Down and Overlap synapses for each run and the mismatches affecting the behavior of different synapses. [sent-226, score-1.371]
</p><p>95 The failure of the discrimination for high overlap in the absence of this stop learning mechanism is due to the fact that the number of potentiated synapses can overcome the effect of the teaching signal for the down pattern. [sent-227, score-1.308]
</p><p>96 The Calcium mechanism, deﬁning a maximum number of allowed potentiated synapses, limits this problem. [sent-228, score-0.277]
</p><p>97 This offer the possibility of establishing a priori threshold to discriminate the perceptron outputs on the basis of the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the LTP probability curve. [sent-229, score-0.188]
</p><p>98 6  5 Conclusions We brieﬂy illustrate an analog VLSI chip implementing a network of 32 IF neurons and 2,048 reconﬁgurable, Hebbian, plastic, stop-learning synapses. [sent-230, score-0.309]
</p><p>99 Once conﬁgured the network as a perceptron (31 AER synapses and one output neuron), a classiﬁcation task has been performed. [sent-233, score-0.718]
</p><p>100 The results show the ability of the network to efﬁciently classify the presented patterns as well as the improvement of the performances due to the calcium stop-learning mechanism. [sent-235, score-0.435]

<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism.

<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We show that under suitable assumptions (primarily linearization) a simple and perspicuous online learning rule for Information Bottleneck optimization with spiking neurons can be derived. This rule performs on common benchmark tasks as well as a rather complex rule that has previously been proposed [1]. Furthermore, the transparency of this new learning rule makes a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties feasible. A variation of this learning rule (with sign changes) provides a theoretically founded method for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with spiking neurons. By applying this rule to an ensemble of neurons, different principal components of the input can be extracted. In addition, it is possible to preferentially extract those principal components from incoming signals X that are related or are not related to some additional target signal YT . In a biological interpretation, this target signal YT (also called relevance variable) could represent proprioceptive feedback, input from other sensory modalities, or top-down signals. 1</p><p>5 0.16929856 <a title="14-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Contraction_Properties_of_VLSI_Cooperative_Competitive_Neural_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">60 nips-2007-Contraction Properties of VLSI Cooperative Competitive Neural Networks of Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Devarajan Sridharan, Brian Percival, John Arthur, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neurobiologically plausible model to implement dynamic routing using the concept of neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The model has a three-tier architecture: a raw input tier, a routing control tier, and an invariant output tier. The correct mapping between input and output tiers is realized by an appropriate alignment of the phases of their respective background oscillations by the routing control units. We present an example architecture, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, that is able to achieve circular-shift invariance. A simple extension to our model can accomplish circular-shift dynamic routing with only O(N ) connections, compared to O(N 2 ) connections required by traditional models. 1 Dynamic Routing Circuit Models for Circular-Shift Invariance Dynamic routing circuit models are among the most prominent neural models for invariant recognition [1] (also see [2] for review). These models implement shift invariance by dynamically changing spatial connectivity to transform an object to a standard position or orientation. The connectivity between the raw input and invariant output layers is controlled by routing units, which turn certain subsets of connections on or off (Figure 1A). An important feature of this model is the explicit representation of what and where information in the main network and the routing units, respectively; the routing units use the where information to create invariant representations. Traditional solutions for shift invariance are neurobiologically implausible for at least two reasons. First, there are too many synaptic connections: for N input neurons, N output neurons and N possible input-output mappings, the network requires O(N 2 ) connections in the routing layer— between each of the N routing units and each set of N connections that that routing unit gates (Figure 1A). Second, these connections must be extremely precise: each routing unit must activate an inputoutput mapping (N individual connections) corresponding to the desired shift (as highlighted in Figure 1A). Other approaches that have been proposed, including invariant feature networks [3,4], also suffer from signiﬁcant drawbacks, such as the inability to explicitly represent where information [2]. It remains an open question how biology could achieve shift invariance without proﬂigate and precise connections. In this article, we propose a simple solution for shift invariance for quantities that are circular or periodic in nature—circular-shift invariance (CSI)—orientation invariance in vision and key invariance in music. The visual system may create orientation-invariant representations to aid recognition under conditions of object rotation or head-tilt [5,6]; a similar mechanism could be employed by the auditory system to create key-invariant representations under conditions where the same melody 1 Figure 1: Dynamic routing. A In traditional dynamic routing, connections from the (raw) input layer to the (invariant) output layer are gated by routing units. For instance, the mapping from A to 5, B to 6, . . . , F to 4 is achieved by turning on the highlighted routing unit. B In time-division multiplexing (TDM), the encoder samples input channels periodically (using a rotating switch) while the decoder sends each sample to the appropriate output channel (based on its time bin). TDM can be extended to achieve a circular-shift transformation by altering the angle between encoder and decoder switches (θ), thereby creating a rotated mapping between input and output channels (adapted from [7]). is played in different keys. Similar to orientation, which is a periodic quantity, musical notes one octave apart sound alike, a phenomenon known as octave equivalence [8]. Thus, the problems of key invariance and orientation invariance admit similar solutions. Deriving inspiration from time-division multiplexing (TDM), we propose a neural network for CSI that uses phase to encode and decode information. We modulate the temporal window of communication between (raw) input and (invariant) output neurons to achieve the appropriate input–output mapping. Extending TDM, any particular circular-shift transformation can be accomplished by changing the relative angle, θ, between the rotating switches of the encoder (that encodes the raw input in time) and decoder (that decodes the invariant output in time) (Figure 1B). This obviates the need to hardwire routing control units that speciﬁcally modulate the strength of each possible inputoutput connection, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the complexity inherent in the traditional dynamic routing solution. Similarly, a remapping between the input and output neurons can be achieved by introducing a relative phase-shift in their background oscillations. 2 Dynamic Routing through Neuronal Coherence To modulate the temporal window of communication, the model uses a ring of neurons (the oscillation ring) to select the pool of neurons (in the projection ring) that encode or decode information at a particular time (Figure 2A). Each projection pool encodes a speciﬁc value of the feature (for example, one of twelve musical notes). Upon activation by external input, each pool is active only when background inhibition generated by the oscillation ring (outer ring of neurons) is at a minimum. In addition to exciting 12 inhibitory interneurons in the projection ring, each oscillation ring neuron excites its nearest 18 neighbors in the clockwise direction around the oscillation ring. As a result, a wave of inhibition travels around the projection ring that allows only one pool to be excitable at any point in time. These neurons become excitable at roughly the same time (numbered sectors, inner ring) by virtue of recurrent excitatory intra-pool connections. Decoding is accomplished by a second tier of rings (Figure 2B). The projection ring of the ﬁrst (input) tier connects all-to-all to the projection ring of the second (output) tier. The two oscillation rings create a window of excitability for the pools of neurons in their respective projection rings. Hence, the most effective communication occurs between input and output pools that become excitable at the same time (i.e. are oscillating in phase with one another [9]). The CSI problem is solved by introducing a phase-shift between the input and output tiers. If they are exactly in phase, then an input pool is simply mapped to the output pool directly above it. If their 2 Figure 2: Double-Ring Network for Encoding and Decoding. A The projection (inner) ring is divided into (numbered) pools. The oscillation (outer) ring modulates sub-threshold activity (waveforms) of the projection ring by exciting (black distribution) inhibitory neurons that inhibit neighboring projection neurons. A wave of activity travels around the oscillation ring due to asymmetric excitatory connections, creating a corresponding wave of inhibitory activity in the projection ring, such that only one pool of projection neurons is excitable (spikes) at a given time. B Two instances of the double-ring structure from A. The input projection ring connects all-to-all to the output projection ring (dashed lines). Because each input pool will spike only during a distinct time bin, and each output pool is excitable only in a certain time bin, communication occurs between input and output pools that are oscillating in phase with each other. Appropriate phase offset between input and output oscillation rings realizes the desired circular shift (input pool H to output pool 1, solid arrow). C Interactions among pools highlighted in B. phases are different, the input is dynamically routed to an appropriate circularly shifted position in the output tier. Such changes in phase are analogous to adjusting the angle of the rotating switch at either the encoder or the decoder in TDM (see Figure 1B). There is some evidence that neural systems could employ phase relationships of subthreshold oscillations to selectively target neural populations [9-11]. 3 Implementation in Silicon We implemented this solution to CSI on a neuromorphic silicon chip [12]. The neuromorphic chip has neurons whose properties resemble that of biological neurons; these neurons even have intrinsic differences, thereby mimicking heterogeneity in real neurobiological systems. The chip uses a conductance-based spiking model for both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons project to nearby excitatory and inhibitory neurons via a diffusor network that determines the spread of inhibition. A lookup table of excitatory synaptic connectivity is stored in a separate randomaccess memory (RAM) chip. Spikes occurring on-chip are converted to a neuron address, mapped to synapses (if any) via the lookup table, and routed to the targeted on-chip synapse. A universal serial bus (USB) interface chip communicates spikes to and from a computer, for external input and 3 Figure 3: Traveling-wave activity in the oscillation ring. A Population activity (5ms bins) of a pool of eighteen (adjacent) oscillation neurons. B Increasing the strength of feedforward excitation led to increasing frequencies of periodic ﬁring in the θ and α range (1-10 Hz). Strength of excitation is the amplitude change in post-synaptic conductance due to a single pre-synaptic spike (measured relative to minimum amplitude used). data analysis, respectively. Simulations on the chip occur in real-time, making it an attractive option for implementing the model. We conﬁgured the following parameters: • Magnitude of a potassium M-current: increasing this current’s magnitude increased the post-spike repolarization time of the membrane potential, thereby constraining spiking to a single time bin per cycle. • The strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses: a correct balance had to be established between excitation and inhibition to make only a small subset of neurons in the projection rings ﬁre at a time—too much excitation led to widespread ﬁring and too much inhibition led to neurons that were entirely silent or ﬁred sporadically. • The space constant of inhibitory spread: increasing the spread was effective in preventing runaway excitation, which could occur due to the recurrent excitatory connections. We were able to create a stable traveling wave of background activity within the oscillation ring. We transiently stimulated a small subset of the neurons, which initiated a wave of activity that propagated in a stable manner around the ring after the transient external stimulation had ceased (Figure 3A). The network frequency determined from a Fourier transform of the network activity smoothed with a non-causal Gaussian kernel (FDHM = 80ms) was 7.4Hz. The frequency varied with the strength of the neurons’ excitatory connections (Figure 3B), measured as the amplitude of the step increase in membrane conductivity due to the arrival of a pre-synaptic spike. Over much of the range of the synaptic strengths tested, we observed stable oscillations in the θ and α bands (1-10Hz); the frequency appeared to increase logarithmically with synaptic strength. 4 Phase-based Encoding and Decoding In order to assess the best-case performance of the model, the background activity in the input and output projection rings was derived from the input oscillation ring. Their spikes were delivered to the appropriately circularly-shifted output oscillation neurons. The asymmetric feedforward connections were disabled in the output oscillation ring. For instance, in order to achieve a circular shift by k pools (i.e. mapping input projection pool 1 to output projection pool k + 1, input pool 2 to output pool k + 2, and so on), activity from the input oscillation neurons closest to input pool 1 was fed into the output oscillation neurons closest to output pool k. By providing the appropriate phase difference between input and output oscillation, we were able to assess the performance of the model under ideal conditions. In the Discussion section, we discuss a biologically plausible mechanism to control the relative phases. 4 Figure 4: Phase-based encoding. Rasters indicating activity of projection pools in 1ms bins, and mean phase of ﬁring (×’s) for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time). The abscissa shows ﬁring time normalized by the period of oscillation (which may be converted to ﬁring phase by multiplication by 2π). Under constant input to the input projection ring, the input pools ﬁre approximately in sequence. Two cycles of pool activity normalized by maximum ﬁring rate for each pool are shown in left inset (for clarity, pools 1-6 are shown in the top panel and pools 7-12 are shown separately in the bottom panel); phase of background inhibition of pool 4 is shown (below) for reference. Phase-aligned average1 of activity (right inset) showed that the ﬁring times were relatively tight and uniform across pools: a standard deviation of 0.0945 periods, or equivalently, a spread of 1.135 pools at any instant of time. We veriﬁed that the input projection pools ﬁred in a phase-shifted fashion relative to one another, a property critical for accurate encoding (see Figure 2). We stimulated all pools in the input projection ring simultaneously while the input oscillation ring provided a periodic wave of background inhibition. The mean phase of ﬁring for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time) increased nearly linearly with pool number, thereby providing evidence for accurate, phase-based encoding (Figure 4). The ﬁring times of all pools are shown for two cycles of background oscillatory activity (Figure 4 left inset). A phase-aligned average1 showed that the timing was relatively tight (standard deviation 1.135 pools) and uniform across pools of neurons (Figure 4 right inset). We then characterized the system’s ability to correctly decode this encoding under a given circular shift. The shift was set to seven pools, mapping input pool 1 to output pool 8, and so on. Each input pool was stimulated in turn. We expected to see only the appropriately shifted output pool become highly active. In fact, not only was this pool active, but other pools around it were also active, though to a lesser extent (Figure 5A). Thus, the phase-encoded input was decoded successfully, and circularly shifted, except that the output units were broadly tuned. To quantify the overall precision of encoding and decoding, we constructed an input-locked average of the tuning curves (Figure 5B): the curves were circularly shifted to the left by an amount corresponding to the stimulated input pool number, and the raw pool ﬁring rates were averaged. If the phase-based encoding and decoding were perfect, the peak should occur at a shift of 7 pools. 1 The phase-aligned average was constructed by shifting the pool-activity curves by the (# of the pool) × 1 ( 12 of the period) to align activity across pools, which was then averaged. 5 Figure 5: Decoding phase-encoded input. A In order to assess decoding performance under a given circular shift (here 7 pools) each input pool was stimulated in turn and activity in each output pool was recorded and averaged over 500ms. The pool’s response, normalized by its maximum ﬁring rate, is plotted for each stimulated input pool (arrows pointing to curves, color code as in Figure 4). Each input pool stimulation trial consistently resulted in peak activity in the appropriate output pool; however, adjacent pools were also active, but to a lesser extent, resulting in a broad tuning curve. B The best-ﬁt Gaussian (dot-dashed grey curve, σ = 2.30 pools) to the input-locked average of the raw pool ﬁring rates (see text for details) revealed a maximum between a shift of 7 and 8 pools (inverted grey triangle; expected peak at a shift of 7 pools). Indeed, the highest (average) ﬁring rate corresponded to a shift of 7 pools. However, the activity corresponding to a shift of 8 pools was nearly equal to that of 7 pools, and the best ﬁtting Gaussian curve to the activity histogram (grey dot-dashed line) peaked at a point between pools 7 and 8 (inverted grey triangle). The standard deviation (σ) was 2.30 pools, versus the expected ideal σ of 1.60, which corresponds to the encoding distribution (σ = 1.135 pools) convolved with itself. 5 Discussion We have demonstrated a biologically plausible mechanism for the dynamic routing of information in time that obviates the need for precise gating of connections. This mechanism requires that a wave of activity propagate around pools of neurons arranged in a ring. While previous work has described traveling waves in a ring of neurons [13], and a double ring architecture (for determining head-direction) [14], our work combines these two features (twin rings with phase-shifted traveling waves) to achieve dynamic routing. These features of the model are found in the cortex: Bonhoeffer and Grinwald [15] describe iso-orientation columns in the cat visual cortex that are arranged in ring-like pinwheel patterns, with orientation tuning changing gradually around the pinwheel center. Moreover, Rubino et al. [16] have shown that coherent oscillations can propagate as waves across the cortical surface in the motor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys performing a delayed reaching task. Our solution for CSI is also applicable to music perception. In the Western twelve-tone, equaltemperament tuning system (12-tone scale), each octave is divided into twelve logarithmicallyspaced notes. Human observers are known to construct mental representations for raw notes that are invariant of the (perceived) key of the music: a note of C heard in the key of C-Major is perceptually equivalent to the note C# heard in the key of C#-Major [8,17]. In previous dynamic routing models of key invariance, the tonic—the ﬁrst note of the key (e.g., C is the tonic of C-Major)— supplies the equivalent where information used by routing units that gate precise connections to map the raw note into a key-invariant output representation [17]. To achieve key invariance in our model, the bottom tier encodes raw note information while the top tier decodes key-invariant notes (Figure 6). The middle tier receives the tonic information and aligns the phase of the ﬁrst output pool (whose invariant representation corresponds to the tonic) with the appropriate input pool (whose raw note representation corresponds to the tonic of the perceived key). 6 Figure 6: Phase-based dynamic routing to achieve key-invariance. The input (bottom) tier encodes raw note information, and the output (top) tier decodes key-invariant information. The routing (middle) tier sets the phase of the background wave activity in the input and output oscillation rings (dashed arrows) such that the ﬁrst output pool is in phase with the input pool representing the note corresponding to the tonic. On the left, where G is the tonic, input pool G, output pool 1, and the routing tier are in phase with one another (black clocks), while input pool C and output pool 6 are in phase with one another (grey clocks). Thus, the raw note input, G, activates the invariant output 1, which corresponds to the perceived tonic invariant representation (heavy solid arrows). On the right, the same raw input note, G, is active, but the key is different and A is now the active tonic; thus the raw input, G, is now mapped to output pool 11. The tonic information is supplied to a speciﬁc pool in the routing ring according to the perceived key. This pool projects directly down to the input pool corresponding to the tonic. This ensures that the current tonic’s input pool is excitable in the same time bin as the ﬁrst output pool. Each of the remaining raw input notes of the octave is mapped by time binning to the corresponding key-invariant representation in the output tier, as the phases of input pools are all shifted by the same amount. Supporting evidence for phase-based encoding of note information comes from MEG recordings in humans: the phase of the MEG signal (predominantly over right hemispheric sensor locations) tracks the note of the heard note sequence with surprising accuracy [18]. The input and output tiers’ periods must be kept in lock-step, which can be accomplished through more plausible means than employed in the current implementation of this model. Here, we maintained a ﬁxed phase shift between the input and output oscillation rings by feeding activity from the input oscillation ring to the appropriately shifted pool in the output oscillation ring. This approach allowed us to avoid difﬁculties achieving coherent oscillations at identical frequencies in the input and output oscillation rings. Alternatively, entrainment could be achieved even when the frequencies are not identical—a more biologically plausible scenario—if the routing ring resets the phase of the input and output rings on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Lakatos et al. [19] have shown that somatosensory inputs can reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations in the primary auditory cortex (A1), which helps in the generation of a uniﬁed auditory-tactile percept (the so-called “Hearing-Hands Effect”). A simple extension to our model can reduce the number of connections below the requirements of traditional dynamic routing models. Instead of having all-to-all connections between the input and output layers, a relay layer of very few (M N ) neurons could be used to transmit the spikes form the input neurons to the output neurons (analogous to the single wire connecting encoder and decoder in Figure 1B). A small number of (or ideally even one) relay neurons sufﬁces because encoding and decoding occur in time. Hence, the connections between each input pool and the relay neurons require O(M N ) ≈ O(N ) connections (as long as M does not scale with N ) and those between the relay neurons and each output pool require O(M N) ≈ O(N ) connections as well. Thus, by removing all-to-all connectivity between the input and output units (a standard feature in traditional dynamic routing models), the number of required connections is reduced from O(N 2 ) 7 to O(N ). Further, by replacing the strict pool boundaries with nearest neighbor connectivity in the projection rings, the proposed model can accommodate a continuum of rotation angles. In summary, we propose that the mechanism of dynamic routing through neuronal coherence could be a general mechanism that could be used by multiple sensory and motor modalities in the neocortex: it is particularly suitable for placing raw information in an appropriate context (deﬁned by the routing tier).

Giudice</p><p>Abstract: We summarize the implementation of an analog VLSI chip hosting a network of 32 integrate-and-ﬁre (IF) neurons with spike-frequency adaptation and 2,048 Hebbian plastic bistable spike-driven stochastic synapses endowed with a selfregulating mechanism which stops unnecessary synaptic changes. The synaptic matrix can be ﬂexibly conﬁgured and provides both recurrent and AER-based connectivity with external, AER compliant devices.

<p>Author: Marcus Hutter, Shane Legg</p><p>Abstract: We derive an equation for temporal difference learning from statistical principles. Speciﬁcally, we start with the variational principle and then bootstrap to produce an updating rule for discounted state value estimates. The resulting equation is similar to the standard equation for temporal difference learning with eligibility traces, so called TD(λ), however it lacks the parameter α that speciﬁes the learning rate. In the place of this free parameter there is now an equation for the learning rate that is speciﬁc to each state transition. We experimentally test this new learning rule against TD(λ) and ﬁnd that it offers superior performance in various settings. Finally, we make some preliminary investigations into how to extend our new temporal difference algorithm to reinforcement learning. To do this we combine our update equation with both Watkins’ Q(λ) and Sarsa(λ) and ﬁnd that it again offers superior performance without a learning rate parameter. 1</p><p>3 0.84805351 <a title="14-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Keyword_Selection_Using_Support_Vector_Machines.html">71 nips-2007-Discriminative Keyword Selection Using Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Fred Richardson, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in speech processing involve classiﬁcation of long term characteristics of a speech segment such as language, speaker, dialect, or topic. A natural technique for determining these characteristics is to ﬁrst convert the input speech into a sequence of tokens such as words, phones, etc. From these tokens, we can then look for distinctive sequences, keywords, that characterize the speech. In many applications, a set of distinctive keywords may not be known a priori. In this case, an automatic method of building up keywords from short context units such as phones is desirable. We propose a method for the construction of keywords based upon Support Vector Machines. We cast the problem of keyword selection as a feature selection problem for n-grams of phones. We propose an alternating ﬁlter-wrapper method that builds successively longer keywords. Application of this method to language recognition and topic recognition tasks shows that the technique produces interesting and signiﬁcant qualitative and quantitative results.</p><p>4 0.79258704 <a title="14-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Agreement-Based_Learning.html">22 nips-2007-Agreement-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Dan Klein, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The learning of probabilistic models with many hidden variables and nondecomposable dependencies is an important and challenging problem. In contrast to traditional approaches based on approximate inference in a single intractable model, our approach is to train a set of tractable submodels by encouraging them to agree on the hidden variables. This allows us to capture non-decomposable aspects of the data while still maintaining tractability. We propose an objective function for our approach, derive EM-style algorithms for parameter estimation, and demonstrate their effectiveness on three challenging real-world learning tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.74845749 <a title="14-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Learning_with_Invariances.html">62 nips-2007-Convex Learning with Invariances</a></p>

We provide a convex formulation which can deal with arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary losses. In addition, it is a drop-in replacement for most optimization algorithms for kernels, including solvers of the SVMStruct family. The advantage of our setting is that it relies on column generation instead of modifying the underlying optimization problem directly. 1</p><p>6 0.6172539 <a title="14-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_to_classify_complex_patterns_using_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">117 nips-2007-Learning to classify complex patterns using a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>

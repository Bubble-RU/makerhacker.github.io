<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Kato, Hisashi Kashima, Masashi Sugiyama, Kiyoshi Asai</p><p>Abstract: When we have several related tasks, solving them simultaneously is shown to be more effective than solving them individually. This approach is called multi-task learning (MTL) and has been studied extensively. Existing approaches to MTL often treat all the tasks as uniformly related to each other and the relatedness of the tasks is controlled globally. For this reason, the existing methods can lead to undesired solutions when some tasks are not highly related to each other, and some pairs of related tasks can have signiﬁcantly different solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel MTL algorithm that can overcome these problems. Our method makes use of a task network, which describes the relation structure among tasks. This allows us to deal with intricate relation structures in a systematic way. Furthermore, we control the relatedness of the tasks locally, so all pairs of related tasks are guaranteed to have similar solutions. We apply the above idea to support vector machines (SVMs) and show that the optimization problem can be cast as a second order cone program, which is convex and can be solved efﬁciently. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations with protein super-family classiﬁcation and ordinal regression problems.</p><p>3 0.11490935 <a title="175-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Regularized_Boost_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">166 nips-2007-Regularized Boost for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shihai Wang</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised inductive learning concerns how to learn a decision rule from a data set containing both labeled and unlabeled data. Several boosting algorithms have been extended to semi-supervised learning with various strategies. To our knowledge, however, none of them takes local smoothness constraints among data into account during ensemble learning. In this paper, we introduce a local smoothness regularizer to semi-supervised boosting algorithms based on the universal optimization framework of margin cost functionals. Our regularizer is applicable to existing semi-supervised boosting algorithms to improve their generalization and speed up their training. Comparative results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our local smoothness regularizer. We discuss relevant issues and relate our regularizer to previous work. 1</p><p>4 0.10578285 <a title="175-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Batch_Mode_Active_Learning.html">69 nips-2007-Discriminative Batch Mode Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classiﬁer. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classiﬁcation performance of the target classiﬁer, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.10057689 <a title="175-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes.html">212 nips-2007-Using Deep Belief Nets to Learn Covariance Kernels for Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We show how to use unlabeled data and a deep belief net (DBN) to learn a good covariance kernel for a Gaussian process. We ﬁrst learn a deep generative model of the unlabeled data using the fast, greedy algorithm introduced by [7]. If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classiﬁcation can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively ﬁne-tune the covariance kernel.</p><p>6 0.099448182 <a title="175-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Regression.html">186 nips-2007-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Jingrui He, Jaime G. Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Rare category detection is an open challenge for active learning, especially in the de-novo case (no labeled examples), but of signiﬁcant practical importance for data mining - e.g. detecting new ﬁnancial transaction fraud patterns, where normal legitimate transactions dominate. This paper develops a new method for detecting an instance of each minority class via an unsupervised local-density-differential sampling strategy. Essentially a variable-scale nearest neighbor process is used to optimize the probability of sampling tightly-grouped minority classes, subject to a local smoothness assumption of the majority class. Results on both synthetic and real data sets are very positive, detecting each minority class with only a fraction of the actively sampled points required by random sampling and by Pelleg’s Interleave method, the prior best technique in the sparse literature on this topic. 1</p><p>4 0.37206957 <a title="175-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Regression.html">186 nips-2007-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised methods use unlabeled data in addition to labeled data to construct predictors. While existing semi-supervised methods have shown some promising empirical performance, their development has been based largely based on heuristics. In this paper we study semi-supervised learning from the viewpoint of minimax theory. Our ﬁrst result shows that some common methods based on regularization using graph Laplacians do not lead to faster minimax rates of convergence. Thus, the estimators that use the unlabeled data do not have smaller risk than the estimators that use only labeled data. We then develop several new approaches that provably lead to improved performance. The statistical tools of minimax analysis are thus used to offer some new perspective on the problem of semi-supervised learning. 1</p><p>5 0.35748023 <a title="175-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-The_Value_of_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples_when_the_Model_is_Imperfect.html">201 nips-2007-The Value of Labeled and Unlabeled Examples when the Model is Imperfect</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, i.e. learning from both labeled and unlabeled data has received signiﬁcant attention in the machine learning literature in recent years. Still our understanding of the theoretical foundations of the usefulness of unlabeled data remains somewhat limited. The simplest and the best understood situation is when the data is described by an identiﬁable mixture model, and where each class comes from a pure component. This natural setup and its implications ware analyzed in [11, 5]. One important result was that in certain regimes, labeled data becomes exponentially more valuable than unlabeled data. However, in most realistic situations, one would not expect that the data comes from a parametric mixture distribution with identiﬁable components. There have been recent efforts to analyze the non-parametric situation, for example, “cluster” and “manifold” assumptions have been suggested as a basis for analysis. Still, a satisfactory and fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nonparametric problem, similar to that in [11, 5] has not yet been developed. In this paper we investigate an intermediate situation, when the data comes from a probability distribution, which can be modeled, but not perfectly, by an identiﬁable mixture distribution. This seems applicable to many situation, when, for example, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model the data. the contribution of this paper is an analysis of the role of labeled and unlabeled data depending on the amount of imperfection in the model.</p><p>6 0.34407821 <a title="175-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-A_general_agnostic_active_learning_algorithm.html">15 nips-2007-A general agnostic active learning algorithm</a></p>

We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics.

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.63075924 <a title="175-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_ROC_Curve_for_a_Combination_of_Classifiers.html">149 nips-2007-Optimal ROC Curve for a Combination of Classifiers</a></p>

We show how our method generalizes and improves previous work on combining classiﬁers and generating ROC curves. 1</p><p>5 0.57036489 <a title="175-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>6 0.50695306 <a title="175-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Infinite_State_Bayes-Nets_for_Structured_Domains.html">105 nips-2007-Infinite State Bayes-Nets for Structured Domains</a></p>

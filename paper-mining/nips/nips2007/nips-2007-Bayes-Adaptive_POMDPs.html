<p>Author: Wee S. Lee, Nan Rong, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: Point-based algorithms have been surprisingly successful in computing approximately optimal solutions for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in high dimensional belief spaces. In this work, we seek to understand the belief-space properties that allow some POMDP problems to be approximated efﬁciently and thus help to explain the point-based algorithms’ success often observed in the experiments. We show that an approximately optimal POMDP solution can be computed in time polynomial in the covering number of a reachable belief space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable from a given belief point. We also show that under the weaker condition of having a small covering number for an optimal reachable space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable under an optimal policy, computing an approximately optimal solution is NP-hard. However, given a suitable set of points that “cover” an optimal reachable space well, an approximate solution can be computed in polynomial time. The covering number highlights several interesting properties that reduce the complexity of POMDP planning in practice, e.g., fully observed state variables, beliefs with sparse support, smooth beliefs, and circulant state-transition matrices. 1</p><p>3 0.24868248 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Theoretical_Analysis_of_Heuristic_Search_Methods_for_Online_POMDPs.html">204 nips-2007-Theoretical Analysis of Heuristic Search Methods for Online POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephane Ross, Joelle Pineau, Brahim Chaib-draa</p><p>Abstract: Planning in partially observable environments remains a challenging problem, despite signiﬁcant recent advances in ofﬂine approximation techniques. A few online methods have also been proposed recently, and proven to be remarkably scalable, but without the theoretical guarantees of their ofﬂine counterparts. Thus it seems natural to try to unify ofﬂine and online techniques, preserving the theoretical properties of the former, and exploiting the scalability of the latter. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees on an anytime algorithm for POMDPs which aims to reduce the error made by approximate ofﬂine value iteration algorithms through the use of an efﬁcient online searching procedure. The algorithm uses search heuristics based on an error analysis of lookahead search, to guide the online search towards reachable beliefs with the most potential to reduce error. We provide a general theorem showing that these search heuristics are admissible, and lead to complete and ǫ-optimal algorithms. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest theoretical result available for online POMDP solution methods. We also provide empirical evidence showing that our approach is also practical, and can ﬁnd (provably) near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. 1</p><p>4 0.1367451 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Exponential_Family_Predictive_Representations_of_State.html">86 nips-2007-Exponential Family Predictive Representations of State</a></p>
<p>Author: David Wingate, Satinder S. Baveja</p><p>Abstract: In order to represent state in controlled, partially observable, stochastic dynamical systems, some sort of sufﬁcient statistic for history is necessary. Predictive representations of state (PSRs) capture state as statistics of the future. We introduce a new model of such systems called the “Exponential family PSR,” which deﬁnes as state the time-varying parameters of an exponential family distribution which models n sequential observations in the future. This choice of state representation explicitly connects PSRs to state-of-the-art probabilistic modeling, which allows us to take advantage of current efforts in high-dimensional density estimation, and in particular, graphical models and maximum entropy models. We present a parameter learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood, and we show how a variety of current approximate inference methods apply. We evaluate the quality of our model with reinforcement learning by directly evaluating the control performance of the model. 1</p><p>5 0.12916259 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Hippocampal_Contributions_to_Control%3A_The_Third_Way.html">100 nips-2007-Hippocampal Contributions to Control: The Third Way</a></p>
<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental studies have focused on the specialization of different neural structures for different types of instrumental behavior. Recent theoretical work has provided normative accounts for why there should be more than one control system, and how the output of different controllers can be integrated. Two particlar controllers have been identiﬁed, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis. 1</p><p>6 0.12672287 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Policy_Learning_with_Trans-Dimensional_MCMC.html">34 nips-2007-Bayesian Policy Learning with Trans-Dimensional MCMC</a></p>

Thus it seems natural to try to unify ofﬂine and online techniques, preserving the theoretical properties of the former, and exploiting the scalability of the latter. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees on an anytime algorithm for POMDPs which aims to reduce the error made by approximate ofﬂine value iteration algorithms through the use of an efﬁcient online searching procedure. The algorithm uses search heuristics based on an error analysis of lookahead search, to guide the online search towards reachable beliefs with the most potential to reduce error. We provide a general theorem showing that these search heuristics are admissible, and lead to complete and ǫ-optimal algorithms. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest theoretical result available for online POMDP solution methods. We also provide empirical evidence showing that our approach is also practical, and can ﬁnd (provably) near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. 1</p><p>4 0.48132765 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Online_Gradient_Descent.html">21 nips-2007-Adaptive Online Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Alexander Rakhlin, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We study the rates of growth of the regret in online convex optimization. First, we show that a simple extension of the algorithm of Hazan et al eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the lower bound on the second derivatives of the observed functions. We then provide an algorithm, Adaptive Online Gradient Descent, which interpolates between the results of Zinkevich for linear functions and of Hazan et al for strongly convex functions, achieving intermediate rates √ between T and log T . Furthermore, we show strong optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we provide an extension of our results to general norms. 1</p><p>5 0.45631519 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Linear_programming_analysis_of_loopy_belief_propagation_for_weighted_matching.html">120 nips-2007-Linear programming analysis of loopy belief propagation for weighted matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujay Sanghavi, Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation has been employed in a wide variety of applications with great empirical success, but it comes with few theoretical guarantees. In this paper we investigate the use of the max-product form of belief propagation for weighted matching problems on general graphs. We show that max-product converges to the correct answer if the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the weighted matching problem is tight and does not converge if the LP relaxation is loose. This provides an exact characterization of max-product performance and reveals connections to the widely used optimization technique of LP relaxation. In addition, we demonstrate that max-product is effective in solving practical weighted matching problems in a distributed fashion by applying it to the problem of self-organization in sensor networks. 1</p><p>6 0.45145753 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Online_Linear_Regression_and_Its_Application_to_Model-Based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">148 nips-2007-Online Linear Regression and Its Application to Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

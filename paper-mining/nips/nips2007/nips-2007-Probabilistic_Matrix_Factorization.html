<p>Author: Sennay Ghebreab, Arnold Smeulders, Pieter Adriaans</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for reconstruction of human brain states directly from functional neuroimaging data. The method extends the traditional multivariate regression analysis of discretized fMRI data to the domain of stochastic functional measurements, facilitating evaluation of brain responses to complex stimuli and boosting the power of functional imaging. The method searches for sets of voxel time courses that optimize a multivariate functional linear model in terms of R2 statistic. Population based incremental learning is used to identify spatially distributed brain responses to complex stimuli without attempting to localize function ﬁrst. Variation in hemodynamic lag across brain areas and among subjects is taken into account by voxel-wise non-linear registration of stimulus pattern to fMRI data. Application of the method on an international test benchmark for prediction of naturalistic stimuli from new and unknown fMRI data shows that the method successfully uncovers spatially distributed parts of the brain that are highly predictive of a given stimulus. 1</p><p>3 0.062022548 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Predictive_Matrix-Variate_t_Models.html">156 nips-2007-Predictive Matrix-Variate t Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly important to learn from a partially-observed random matrix and predict its missing elements. We assume that the entire matrix is a single sample drawn from a matrix-variate t distribution and suggest a matrixvariate t model (MVTM) to predict those missing elements. We show that MVTM generalizes a range of known probabilistic models, and automatically performs model selection to encourage sparse predictive models. Due to the non-conjugacy of its prior, it is difﬁcult to make predictions by computing the mode or mean of the posterior distribution. We suggest an optimization method that sequentially minimizes a convex upper-bound of the log-likelihood, which is very efﬁcient and scalable. The experiments on a toy data and EachMovie dataset show a good predictive accuracy of the model. 1</p><p>4 0.059440803 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-COFI_RANK_-_Maximum_Margin_Matrix_Factorization_for_Collaborative_Ranking.html">41 nips-2007-COFI RANK - Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Chuan-sheng Foo, Chuong B. Do, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: In problems where input features have varying amounts of noise, using distinct regularization hyperparameters for different features provides an effective means of managing model complexity. While regularizers for neural networks and support vector machines often rely on multiple hyperparameters, regularizers for structured prediction models (used in tasks such as sequence labeling or parsing) typically rely only on a single shared hyperparameter for all features. In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing regularization hyperparameters for log-linear models, a class of structured prediction probabilistic models which includes conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs). Using an implicit differentiation trick, we derive an efﬁcient gradient-based method for learning Gaussian regularization priors with multiple hyperparameters. In both simulations and the real-world task of computational RNA secondary structure prediction, we ﬁnd that multiple hyperparameter learning can provide a signiﬁcant boost in accuracy compared to using only a single regularization hyperparameter. 1</p><p>6 0.049714476 <a title="158-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shigeyuki Oba, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: In bioinformatics it is often desirable to combine data from various measurement sources and thus structured feature vectors are to be analyzed that possess different intrinsic blocking characteristics (e.g., different patterns of missing values, observation noise levels, effective intrinsic dimensionalities). We propose a new machine learning tool, heterogeneous component analysis (HCA), for feature extraction in order to better understand the factors that underlie such complex structured heterogeneous data. HCA is a linear block-wise sparse Bayesian PCA based not only on a probabilistic model with block-wise residual variance terms but also on a Bayesian treatment of a block-wise sparse factor-loading matrix. We study various algorithms that implement our HCA concept extracting sparse heterogeneous structure by obtaining common components for the blocks and speciﬁc components within each block. Simulations on toy and bioinformatics data underline the usefulness of the proposed structured matrix factorization concept. 1</p><p>4 0.51579809 <a title="158-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_multiple_hyperparameter_learning_for_log-linear_models.html">79 nips-2007-Efficient multiple hyperparameter learning for log-linear models</a></p>

<p>Author: John Blitzer, Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza, Fernando Pereira, Jennifer Wortman</p><p>Abstract: Empirical risk minimization offers well-known learning guarantees when training and test data come from the same domain. In the real world, though, we often wish to adapt a classiﬁer from a source domain with a large amount of training data to different target domain with very little training data. In this work we give uniform convergence bounds for algorithms that minimize a convex combination of source and target empirical risk. The bounds explicitly model the inherent trade-off between training on a large but inaccurate source data set and a small but accurate target training set. Our theory also gives results when we have multiple source domains, each of which may have a different number of instances, and we exhibit cases in which minimizing a non-uniform combination of source risks can achieve much lower target error than standard empirical risk minimization. 1</p><p>3 0.6513899 <a title="158-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_ROC_Curve_for_a_Combination_of_Classifiers.html">149 nips-2007-Optimal ROC Curve for a Combination of Classifiers</a></p>

Our analysis makes use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma as a theoretical basis to analyze combinations of classiﬁers. We give a method for ﬁnding the optimal decision rule for a combination of classiﬁers and prove that it has the optimal ROC curve.

Roux, Pierre-antoine Manzagol, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Guided by the goal of obtaining an optimization algorithm that is both fast and yields good generalization, we study the descent direction maximizing the decrease in generalization error or the probability of not increasing generalization error. The surprising result is that from both the Bayesian and frequentist perspectives this can yield the natural gradient direction. Although that direction can be very expensive to compute we develop an efﬁcient, general, online approximation to the natural gradient descent which is suited to large scale problems. We report experimental results showing much faster convergence in computation time and in number of iterations with TONGA (Topmoumoute Online natural Gradient Algorithm) than with stochastic gradient descent, even on very large datasets.</p><p>5 0.64804375 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Collapsed_Variational_Inference_for_HDP.html">47 nips-2007-Collapsed Variational Inference for HDP</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.64510626 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Max Welling, Ian Porteous, Evgeniy Bart</p><p>Abstract: A general modeling framework is proposed that uniﬁes nonparametric-Bayesian models, topic-models and Bayesian networks. This class of inﬁnite state Bayes nets (ISBN) can be viewed as directed networks of ‘hierarchical Dirichlet processes’ (HDPs) where the domain of the variables can be structured (e.g. words in documents or features in images). We show that collapsed Gibbs sampling can be done efﬁciently in these models by leveraging the structure of the Bayes net and using the forward-ﬁltering-backward-sampling algorithm for junction trees. Existing models, such as nested-DP, Pachinko allocation, mixed membership stochastic block models as well as a number of new models are described as ISBNs. Two experiments have been performed to illustrate these ideas. 1</p><p>3 0.18346384 <a title="47-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Distributed_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">73 nips-2007-Distributed Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Newman, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a widely-used latent-variable model – the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or “topic” model – using distributed computation, where each of processors only sees of the total data set. We propose two distributed inference schemes that are motivated from different perspectives. The ﬁrst scheme uses local Gibbs sampling on each processor with periodic updates—it is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to a single processor implementation of Gibbs sampling. The second scheme relies on a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the standard LDA model to directly account for the fact that data are distributed across processors—it has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the approximate method. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works very well for LDA models, i.e., perplexity and precision-recall scores for distributed learning are indistinguishable from those obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include large-scale distributed computation on 1000 virtual processors; and speedup experiments of learning topics in a 100-million word corpus using 16 processors. ¢ ¤ ¦¥£ ¢ ¢</p><p>4 0.12846096 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Spatial_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">183 nips-2007-Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaogang Wang, Eric Grimson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely applied in the computer vision ﬁeld. However, many of these applications have difﬁculty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since LDA assumes that a document is a “bag-of-words”. It is also critical to properly design “words” and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA), which better encodes spatial structures among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the values of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents a priori, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in SLDA. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be ﬂexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use SLDA to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than LDA. 1</p><p>5 0.11941258 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Supervised_Topic_Models.html">189 nips-2007-Supervised Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jon D. Mcauliffe, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive a maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational approximations to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the ﬁtted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and web page popularity predicted from text descriptions. We illustrate the beneﬁts of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression. 1</p><p>6 0.085880905 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Mining_Internet-Scale_Software_Repositories.html">129 nips-2007-Mining Internet-Scale Software Repositories</a></p>

<p>Author: Daichi Mochihashi, Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method of estimating variable order Markov processes up to a theoretically inﬁnite order. By extending a stick-breaking prior, which is usually deﬁned on a unit interval, “vertically” to the trees of inﬁnite depth associated with a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process, our model directly infers the hidden orders of Markov dependencies from which each symbol originated. Experiments on character and word sequences in natural language showed that the model has a comparative performance with an exponentially large full-order model, while computationally much efﬁcient in both time and space. We expect that this basic model will also extend to the variable order hierarchical clustering of general data. 1</p><p>6 0.4662129 <a title="47-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Agglomerative_Clustering_with_Coalescents.html">31 nips-2007-Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents</a></p>

We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics.

<p>Author: Qiuhua Liu, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A semi-supervised multitask learning (MTL) framework is presented, in which M parameterized semi-supervised classiﬁers, each associated with one of M partially labeled data manifolds, are learned jointly under the constraint of a softsharing prior imposed over the parameters of the classiﬁers. The unlabeled data are utilized by basing classiﬁer learning on neighborhoods, induced by a Markov random walk over a graph representation of each manifold. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that semi-supervised MTL yields signiﬁcant improvements in generalization performance over either semi-supervised single-task learning (STL) or supervised MTL. 1</p><p>4 0.60810661 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_ROC_Curve_for_a_Combination_of_Classifiers.html">149 nips-2007-Optimal ROC Curve for a Combination of Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>6 0.4641737 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Infinite_State_Bayes-Nets_for_Structured_Domains.html">105 nips-2007-Infinite State Bayes-Nets for Structured Domains</a></p>

</p><p>3 We compare L1 and L2 regularization and show that L1 regularization is superior, requiring fewer iterations to converge, and yielding sparser solutions. [sent-5, score-0.402]
</p><p>4 On full-scale treebank parsing experiments, the discriminative latent models outperform both the comparable generative latent models as well as the discriminative non-latent baselines. [sent-6, score-1.848]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction In recent years, latent annotation of PCFG has been shown to perform as well as or better than standard lexicalized methods for treebank parsing [1, 2]. [sent-7, score-0.902]
</p><p>6 In the latent annotation scenario, we imagine that the observed treebank is a coarse trace of a ﬁner, unobserved grammar. [sent-8, score-0.69]
</p><p>7 For example, the single treebank category NP (noun phrase) may be better modeled by several ﬁner categories representing subject NPs, object NPs, and so on. [sent-9, score-0.546]
</p><p>8 At the same time, discriminative methods have consistently provided advantages over their generative counterparts, including less restriction on features and greater accuracy [3, 4, 5]. [sent-10, score-0.476]
</p><p>9 In this work, we therefore investigate discriminative learning of latent PCFGs, hoping to gain the best from both lines of work. [sent-11, score-0.527]
</p><p>10 However, most discriminative methods, at least those which globally trade off feature weights, require repeated parsing of the training set, which is generally impractical. [sent-13, score-0.84]
</p><p>11 Previous work on end-to-end discriminative parsing has therefore resorted to “toy setups,” considering only sentences of length 15 [6, 7, 8] or extremely small corpora [9]. [sent-14, score-0.825]
</p><p>12 To get the beneﬁts of discriminative methods, it has therefore become common practice to extract n-best candidate lists from a generative parser and then use a discriminative component to rerank this list. [sent-15, score-1.004]
</p><p>13 In such an approach, repeated parsing of the training set can be avoided because the discriminative component only needs to select the best tree from a ﬁxed candidate list. [sent-16, score-0.959]
</p><p>14 While most state-of-the-art parsing systems apply this hybrid approach [10, 11, 12], it has the limitation that the candidate list often does not contain the correct parse tree. [sent-17, score-0.565]
</p><p>15 For example 41% of the correct parses were not in the candidate pool of ≈30-best parses in [10]. [sent-18, score-0.33]
</p><p>16 In this paper we present a hierarchical pruning procedure that exploits the structure of the model and allows feature expectations to be efﬁciently approximated, making discriminative training of full-scale grammars practical. [sent-19, score-1.042]
</p><p>17 We present a gradient-based procedure for training a discriminative grammar on the entire WSJ section of the Penn Treebank (roughly 40,000 sentences containing 1 million words). [sent-20, score-0.681]
</p><p>18 We then compare L1 and L2 regularization and show that L1 regularization is superior, requiring fewer iterations to converge and yielding sparser solutions. [sent-21, score-0.436]
</p><p>19 Independent of the regularization, discriminative grammars signiﬁcantly outperform their generative counterparts in our experiments. [sent-22, score-0.986]

</p><p>21 2 Grammars with latent annotations Context-free grammars (CFGs) underlie most high-performance parsers in one way or another [13, 12, 14]. [sent-32, score-0.698]
</p><p>22 However, a CFG which simply takes the empirical productions and probabilities off of a treebank does not perform well. [sent-33, score-0.48]
</p><p>23 This naive grammar is a poor one because its context-freedom assumptions are too strong in some places and too weak in others. [sent-34, score-0.211]
</p><p>24 Therefore, a variety of techniques have been developed to both enrich and generalize the naive grammar. [sent-35, score-0.105]
</p><p>25 Recently an automatic statesplitting approach was shown to produce state-of-the art performance [2, 14]. [sent-36, score-0.033]
</p><p>26 We extend this line of work by investigating discriminative estimation techniques for automatically reﬁned grammars. [sent-37, score-0.449]
</p><p>27 We consider grammars that are automatically derived from a raw treebank. [sent-38, score-0.468]
</p><p>28 Our experiments are based on a completely unsplit X-bar grammar, obtained directly from the Penn Treebank by the binarization procedure shown in Figure 1. [sent-39, score-0.162]
</p><p>29 For each local tree rooted at an evaluation category X, we introduce a cascade of new nodes labeled X so that each has two children in a right branching fashion. [sent-40, score-0.36]
</p><p>30 Each node is then reﬁned with a latent variable, splitting each observed category into k unobserved subcategories. [sent-41, score-0.346]
</p><p>31 We refer to trees over unsplit categories as parse trees and trees over split categories as derivations. [sent-42, score-0.617]
</p><p>32 Our log-linear grammars are parametrized by a vector θ which is indexed by productions X → γ. [sent-43, score-0.601]
</p><p>33 The conditional probability of a derivation tree t given a sentence w can be written as: Pθ (t|w) =  1 Z(θ, w)  eθX→γ = X→γ∈t  T 1 eθ f (t) Z(θ, w)  (1)  where Z(θ, w) is the partition function and f (t) is a vector indicating how many times each production occurs in the derivation t. [sent-44, score-0.255]
</p><p>34 The inside/outside algorithm [15] gives us an efﬁcient way of summing over an exponential number of derivations. [sent-45, score-0.055]

<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classiﬁer. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classiﬁcation performance of the target classiﬁer, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.084915482 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Combined_discriminative_and_generative_articulated_pose_and_non-rigid_shape_estimation.html">50 nips-2007-Combined discriminative and generative articulated pose and non-rigid shape estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Alexandru Balan, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Estimation of three-dimensional articulated human pose and motion from images is a central problem in computer vision. Much of the previous work has been limited by the use of crude generative models of humans represented as articulated collections of simple parts such as cylinders. Automatic initialization of such models has proved difﬁcult and most approaches assume that the size and shape of the body parts are known a priori. In this paper we propose a method for automatically recovering a detailed parametric model of non-rigid body shape and pose from monocular imagery. Speciﬁcally, we represent the body using a parameterized triangulated mesh model that is learned from a database of human range scans. We demonstrate a discriminative method to directly recover the model parameters from monocular images using a conditional mixture of kernel regressors. This predicted pose and shape are used to initialize a generative model for more detailed pose and shape estimation. The resulting approach allows fully automatic pose and shape recovery from monocular and multi-camera imagery. Experimental results show that our method is capable of robustly recovering articulated pose, shape and biometric measurements (e.g. height, weight, etc.) in both calibrated and uncalibrated camera environments. 1</p><p>4 0.066803172 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-DIFFRAC%3A_a_discriminative_and_flexible_framework_for_clustering.html">65 nips-2007-DIFFRAC: a discriminative and flexible framework for clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>5 0.06663014 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Expectation_Maximization_and_Posterior_Constraints.html">84 nips-2007-Expectation Maximization and Posterior Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, Ben Taskar, João Gama</p><p>Abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a widely used maximum likelihood estimation procedure for statistical models when the values of some of the variables in the model are not observed. Very often, however, our aim is primarily to ﬁnd a model that assigns values to the latent variables that have intended meaning for our data and maximizing expected likelihood only sometimes accomplishes this. Unfortunately, it is typically difﬁcult to add even simple a-priori information about latent variables in graphical models without making the models overly complex or intractable. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient, principled way to inject rich constraints on the posteriors of latent variables into the EM algorithm. Our method can be used to learn tractable graphical models that satisfy additional, otherwise intractable constraints. Focusing on clustering and the alignment problem for statistical machine translation, we show that simple, intuitive posterior constraints can greatly improve the performance over standard baselines and be competitive with more complex, intractable models. 1</p><p>6 0.058487929 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-The_Infinite_Markov_Model.html">197 nips-2007-The Infinite Markov Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Cristian Sminchisescu, Miguel Á. Carreira-Perpiñán</p><p>Abstract: Reliably recovering 3D human pose from monocular video requires models that bias the estimates towards typical human poses and motions. We construct priors for people tracking using the Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model (LELVM). LELVM is a recently introduced probabilistic dimensionality reduction model that combines the advantages of latent variable models—a multimodal probability density for latent and observed variables, and globally differentiable nonlinear mappings for reconstruction and dimensionality reduction—with those of spectral manifold learning methods—no local optima, ability to unfold highly nonlinear manifolds, and good practical scaling to latent spaces of high dimension. LELVM is computationally efﬁcient, simple to learn from sparse training data, and compatible with standard probabilistic trackers such as particle ﬁlters. We analyze the performance of a LELVM-based probabilistic sigma point mixture tracker in several real and synthetic human motion sequences and demonstrate that LELVM not only provides sufﬁcient constraints for robust operation in the presence of missing, noisy and ambiguous image measurements, but also compares favorably with alternative trackers based on PCA or GPLVM priors. Recent research in reconstructing articulated human motion has focused on methods that can exploit available prior knowledge on typical human poses or motions in an attempt to build more reliable algorithms. The high-dimensionality of human ambient pose space—between 30-60 joint angles or joint positions depending on the desired accuracy level, makes exhaustive search prohibitively expensive. This has negative impact on existing trackers, which are often not sufﬁciently reliable at reconstructing human-like poses, self-initializing or recovering from failure. Such difﬁculties have stimulated research in algorithms and models that reduce the effective working space, either using generic search focusing methods (annealing, state space decomposition, covariance scaling) or by exploiting speciﬁc problem structure (e.g. kinematic jumps). Experience with these procedures has nevertheless shown that any search strategy, no matter how effective, can be made signiﬁcantly more reliable if restricted to low-dimensional state spaces. This permits a more thorough exploration of the typical solution space, for a given, comparatively similar computational effort as a high-dimensional method. The argument correlates well with the belief that the human pose space, although high-dimensional in its natural ambient parameterization, has a signiﬁcantly lower perceptual (latent or intrinsic) dimensionality, at least in a practical sense—many poses that are possible are so improbable in many real-world situations that it pays off to encode them with low accuracy. A perceptual representation has to be powerful enough to capture the diversity of human poses in a sufﬁciently broad domain of applicability (the task domain), yet compact and analytically tractable for search and optimization. This justiﬁes the use of models that are nonlinear and low-dimensional (able to unfold highly nonlinear manifolds with low distortion), yet probabilistically motivated and globally continuous for efﬁcient optimization. Reducing dimensionality is not the only goal: perceptual representations have to preserve critical properties of the ambient space. Reliable tracking needs locality: nearby regions in ambient space have to be mapped to nearby regions in latent space. If this does not hold, the tracker is forced to make unrealistically large, and difﬁcult to predict jumps in latent space in order to follow smooth trajectories in the joint angle ambient space. 1 In this paper we propose to model priors for articulated motion using a recently introduced probabilistic dimensionality reduction method, the Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model (LELVM) [1]. Section 1 discusses the requirements of priors for articulated motion in the context of probabilistic and spectral methods for manifold learning, and section 2 describes LELVM and shows how it combines both types of methods in a principled way. Section 3 describes our tracking framework (using a particle ﬁlter) and section 4 shows experiments with synthetic and real human motion sequences using LELVM priors learned from motion-capture data. Related work: There is signiﬁcant work in human tracking, using both generative and discriminative methods. Due to space limitations, we will focus on the more restricted class of 3D generative algorithms based on learned state priors, and not aim at a full literature review. Deriving compact prior representations for tracking people or other articulated objects is an active research ﬁeld, steadily growing with the increased availability of human motion capture data. Howe et al. and Sidenbladh et al. [2] propose Gaussian mixture representations of short human motion fragments (snippets) and integrate them in a Bayesian MAP estimation framework that uses 2D human joint measurements, independently tracked by scaled prismatic models [3]. Brand [4] models the human pose manifold using a Gaussian mixture and uses an HMM to infer the mixture component index based on a temporal sequence of human silhouettes. Sidenbladh et al. [5] use similar dynamic priors and exploit ideas in texture synthesis—efﬁcient nearest-neighbor search for similar motion fragments at runtime—in order to build a particle-ﬁlter tracker with observation model based on contour and image intensity measurements. Sminchisescu and Jepson [6] propose a low-dimensional probabilistic model based on ﬁtting a parametric reconstruction mapping (sparse radial basis function) and a parametric latent density (Gaussian mixture) to the embedding produced with a spectral method. They track humans walking and involved in conversations using a Bayesian multiple hypotheses framework that fuses contour and intensity measurements. Urtasun et al. [7] use a dynamic MAP estimation framework based on a GPLVM and 2D human joint correspondences obtained from an independent image-based tracker. Li et al. [8] use a coordinated mixture of factor analyzers within a particle ﬁltering framework, in order to reconstruct human motion in multiple views using chamfer matching to score different conﬁguration. Wang et al. [9] learn a latent space with associated dynamics where both the dynamics and observation mapping are Gaussian processes, and Urtasun et al. [10] use it for tracking. Taylor et al. [11] also learn a binary latent space with dynamics (using an energy-based model) but apply it to synthesis, not tracking. Our work learns a static, generative low-dimensional model of poses and integrates it into a particle ﬁlter for tracking. We show its ability to work with real or partially missing data and to track multiple activities. 1 Priors for articulated human pose We consider the problem of learning a probabilistic low-dimensional model of human articulated motion. Call y ∈ RD the representation in ambient space of the articulated pose of a person. In this paper, y contains the 3D locations of anywhere between 10 and 60 markers located on the person’s joints (other representations such as joint angles are also possible). The values of y have been normalised for translation and rotation in order to remove rigid motion and leave only the articulated motion (see section 3 for how we track the rigid motion). While y is high-dimensional, the motion pattern lives in a low-dimensional manifold because most values of y yield poses that violate body constraints or are simply atypical for the motion type considered. Thus we want to model y in terms of a small number of latent variables x given a collection of poses {yn }N (recorded from a human n=1 with motion-capture technology). The model should satisfy the following: (1) It should deﬁne a probability density for x and y, to be able to deal with noise (in the image or marker measurements) and uncertainty (from missing data due to occlusion or markers that drop), and to allow integration in a sequential Bayesian estimation framework. The density model should also be ﬂexible enough to represent multimodal densities. (2) It should deﬁne mappings for dimensionality reduction F : y → x and reconstruction f : x → y that apply to any value of x and y (not just those in the training set); and such mappings should be deﬁned on a global coordinate system, be continuous (to avoid physically impossible discontinuities) and differentiable (to allow efﬁcient optimisation when tracking), yet ﬂexible enough to represent the highly nonlinear manifold of articulated poses. From a statistical machine learning point of view, this is precisely what latent variable models (LVMs) do; for example, factor analysis deﬁnes linear mappings and Gaussian densities, while the generative topographic mapping (GTM; [12]) deﬁnes nonlinear mappings and a Gaussian-mixture density in ambient space. However, factor analysis is too limited to be of practical use, and GTM— 2 while ﬂexible—has two important practical problems: (1) the latent space must be discretised to allow tractable learning and inference, which limits it to very low (2–3) latent dimensions; (2) the parameter estimation is prone to bad local optima that result in highly distorted mappings. Another dimensionality reduction method recently introduced, GPLVM [13], which uses a Gaussian process mapping f (x), partly improves this situation by deﬁning a tunable parameter xn for each data point yn . While still prone to local optima, this allows the use of a better initialisation for {xn }N (obtained from a spectral method, see later). This has prompted the application of n=1 GPLVM for tracking human motion [7]. However, GPLVM has some disadvantages: its training is very costly (each step of the gradient iteration is cubic on the number of training points N , though approximations based on using few points exist); unlike true LVMs, it deﬁnes neither a posterior distribution p(x|y) in latent space nor a dimensionality reduction mapping E {x|y}; and the latent representation it obtains is not ideal. For example, for periodic motions such as running or walking, repeated periods (identical up to small noise) can be mapped apart from each other in latent space because nothing constrains xn and xm to be close even when yn = ym (see ﬁg. 3 and [10]). There exists a different type of dimensionality reduction methods, spectral methods (such as Isomap, LLE or Laplacian eigenmaps [14]), that have advantages and disadvantages complementary to those of LVMs. They deﬁne neither mappings nor densities but just a correspondence (xn , yn ) between points in latent space xn and ambient space yn . However, the training is efﬁcient (a sparse eigenvalue problem) and has no local optima, and often yields a correspondence that successfully models highly nonlinear, convoluted manifolds such as the Swiss roll. While these attractive properties have spurred recent research in spectral methods, their lack of mappings and densities has limited their applicability in people tracking. However, a new model that combines the advantages of LVMs and spectral methods in a principled way has been recently proposed [1], which we brieﬂy describe next. 2 The Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model (LELVM) LELVM is based on a natural way of deﬁning an out-of-sample mapping for Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) which, in addition, results in a density model. In LE, typically we ﬁrst deﬁne a k-nearestneighbour graph on the sample data {yn }N and weigh each edge yn ∼ ym by a Gaussian afﬁnity n=1 2 1 function K(yn , ym ) = wnm = exp (− 2 (yn − ym )/σ ). Then the latent points X result from: min tr XLX⊤ s.t. X ∈ RL×N , XDX⊤ = I, XD1 = 0 (1) where we deﬁne the matrix XL×N = (x1 , . . . , xN ), the symmetric afﬁnity matrix WN ×N , the deN gree matrix D = diag ( n=1 wnm ), the graph Laplacian matrix L = D−W, and 1 = (1, . . . , 1)⊤ . The constraints eliminate the two trivial solutions X = 0 (by ﬁxing an arbitrary scale) and x1 = · · · = xN (by removing 1, which is an eigenvector of L associated with a zero eigenvalue). The solution is given by the leading u2 , . . . , uL+1 eigenvectors of the normalised afﬁnity matrix 1 1 1 N = D− 2 WD− 2 , namely X = V⊤ D− 2 with VN ×L = (v2 , . . . , vL+1 ) (an a posteriori translated, rotated or uniformly scaled X is equally valid). Following [1], we now deﬁne an out-of-sample mapping F(y) = x for a new point y as a semisupervised learning problem, by recomputing the embedding as in (1) (i.e., augmenting the graph Laplacian with the new point), but keeping the old embedding ﬁxed: L K(y) X⊤ min tr ( X x ) K(y)⊤ 1⊤ K(y) (2) x⊤ x∈RL 2 where Kn (y) = K(y, yn ) = exp (− 1 (y − yn )/σ ) for n = 1, . . . , N is the kernel induced by 2 the Gaussian afﬁnity (applied only to the k nearest neighbours of y, i.e., Kn (y) = 0 if y ≁ yn ). This is one natural way of adding a new point to the embedding by keeping existing embedded points ﬁxed. We need not use the constraints from (1) because they would trivially determine x, and the uninteresting solutions X = 0 and X = constant were already removed in the old embedding anyway. The solution yields an out-of-sample dimensionality reduction mapping x = F(y): x = F(y) = X K(y) 1⊤ K(y) N K(y,yn ) PN x n=1 K(y,yn′ ) n ′ = (3) n =1 applicable to any point y (new or old). This mapping is formally identical to a Nadaraya-Watson estimator (kernel regression; [15]) using as data {(xn , yn )}N and the kernel K. We can take this n=1 a step further by deﬁning a LVM that has as joint distribution a kernel density estimate (KDE): p(x, y) = 1 N N n=1 Ky (y, yn )Kx (x, xn ) p(y) = 3 1 N N n=1 Ky (y, yn ) p(x) = 1 N N n=1 Kx (x, xn ) where Ky is proportional to K so it integrates to 1, and Kx is a pdf kernel in x–space. Consequently, the marginals in observed and latent space are also KDEs, and the dimensionality reduction and reconstruction mappings are given by kernel regression (the conditional means E {y|x}, E {x|y}): F(y) = N n=1 p(n|y)xn f (x) = N K (x,xn ) PN x y n=1 Kx (x,xn′ ) n ′ = n =1 N n=1 p(n|x)yn . (4) We allow the bandwidths to be different in the latent and ambient spaces: 2 2 1 Kx (x, xn ) ∝ exp (− 1 (x − xn )/σx ) and Ky (y, yn ) ∝ exp (− 2 (y − yn )/σy ). They 2 may be tuned to control the smoothness of the mappings and densities [1]. Thus, LELVM naturally extends a LE embedding (efﬁciently obtained as a sparse eigenvalue problem with a cost O(N 2 )) to global, continuous, differentiable mappings (NW estimators) and potentially multimodal densities having the form of a Gaussian KDE. This allows easy computation of posterior probabilities such as p(x|y) (unlike GPLVM). It can use a continuous latent space of arbitrary dimension L (unlike GTM) by simply choosing L eigenvectors in the LE embedding. It has no local optima since it is based on the LE embedding. LELVM can learn convoluted mappings (e.g. the Swiss roll) and deﬁne maps and densities for them [1]. The only parameters to set are the graph parameters (number of neighbours k, afﬁnity width σ) and the smoothing bandwidths σx , σy . 3 Tracking framework We follow the sequential Bayesian estimation framework, where for state variables s and observation variables z we have the recursive prediction and correction equations: p(st |z0:t−1 ) = p(st |st−1 ) p(st−1 |z0:t−1 ) dst−1 p(st |z0:t ) ∝ p(zt |st ) p(st |z0:t−1 ). (5) L We deﬁne the state variables as s = (x, d) where x ∈ R is the low-dim. latent space (for pose) and d ∈ R3 is the centre-of-mass location of the body (in the experiments our state also includes the orientation of the body, but for simplicity here we describe only the translation). The observed variables z consist of image features or the perspective projection of the markers on the camera plane. The mapping from state to observations is (for the markers’ case, assuming M markers): P f x ∈ RL − − → y ∈ R3M −→ ⊕ − − − z ∈ R2M −− − − −→ d ∈ R3 (6) where f is the LELVM reconstruction mapping (learnt from mocap data); ⊕ shifts each 3D marker by d; and P is the perspective projection (pinhole camera), applied to each 3D point separately. Here we use a simple observation model p(zt |st ): Gaussian with mean given by the transformation (6) and isotropic covariance (set by the user to control the inﬂuence of measurements in the tracking). We assume known correspondences and observations that are obtained either from the 3D markers (for tracking synthetic data) or 2D tracks obtained from a 2D tracker. Our dynamics model is p(st |st−1 ) ∝ pd (dt |dt−1 ) px (xt |xt−1 ) p(xt ) (7) where both dynamics models for d and x are random walks: Gaussians centred at the previous step value dt−1 and xt−1 , respectively, with isotropic covariance (set by the user to control the inﬂuence of dynamics in the tracking); and p(xt ) is the LELVM prior. Thus the overall dynamics predicts states that are both near the previous state and yield feasible poses. Of course, more complex dynamics models could be used if e.g. the speed and direction of movement are known. As tracker we use the Gaussian mixture Sigma-point particle ﬁlter (GMSPPF) [16]. This is a particle ﬁlter that uses a Gaussian mixture representation for the posterior distribution in state space and updates it with a Sigma-point Kalman ﬁlter. This Gaussian mixture will be used as proposal distribution to draw the particles. As in other particle ﬁlter implementations, the prediction step is carried out by approximating the integral (5) with particles and updating the particles’ weights. Then, a new Gaussian mixture is ﬁtted with a weighted EM algorithm to these particles. This replaces the resampling stage needed by many particle ﬁlters and mitigates the problem of sample depletion while also preventing the number of components in the Gaussian mixture from growing over time. The choice of this particular tracker is not critical; we use it to illustrate the fact that LELVM can be introduced in any probabilistic tracker for nonlinear, nongaussian models. Given the corrected distribution p(st |z0:t ), we choose its mean as recovered state (pose and location). It is also possible to choose instead the mode closest to the state at t − 1, which could be found by mean-shift or Newton algorithms [17] since we are using a Gaussian-mixture representation in state space. 4 4 Experiments We demonstrate our low-dimensional tracker on image sequences of people walking and running, both synthetic (ﬁg. 1) and real (ﬁg. 2–3). Fig. 1 shows the model copes well with persistent partial occlusion and severely subsampled training data (A,B), and quantitatively evaluates temporal reconstruction (C). For all our experiments, the LELVM parameters (number of neighbors k, Gaussian afﬁnity σ, and bandwidths σx and σy ) were set manually. We mainly considered 2D latent spaces (for pose, plus 6D for rigid motion), which were expressive enough for our experiments. More complex, higher-dimensional models are straightforward to construct. The initial state distribution p(s0 ) was chosen a broad Gaussian, the dynamics and observation covariance were set manually to control the tracking smoothness, and the GMSPPF tracker used a 5-component Gaussian mixture in latent space (and in the state space of rigid motion) and a small set of 500 particles. The 3D representation we use is a 102-D vector obtained by concatenating the 3D markers coordinates of all the body joints. These would be highly unconstrained if estimated independently, but we only use them as intermediate representation; tracking actually occurs in the latent space, tightly controlled using the LELVM prior. For the synthetic experiments and some of the real experiments (ﬁgs. 2–3) the camera parameters and the body proportions were known (for the latter, we used the 2D outputs of [6]). For the CMU mocap video (ﬁg. 2B) we roughly guessed. We used mocap data from several sources (CMU, OSU). As observations we always use 2D marker positions, which, depending on the analyzed sequence were either known (the synthetic case), or provided by an existing tracker [6] or speciﬁed manually (ﬁg. 2B). Alternatively 2D point trackers similar to the ones of [7] can be used. The forward generative model is obtained by combining the latent to ambient space mapping (this provides the position of the 3D markers) with a perspective projection transformation. The observation model is a product of Gaussians, each measuring the probability of a particular marker position given its corresponding image point track. Experiments with synthetic data: we analyze the performance of our tracker in controlled conditions (noise perturbed synthetically generated image tracks) both under regular circumstances (reasonable sampling of training data) and more severe conditions with subsampled training points and persistent partial occlusion (the man running behind a fence, with many of the 2D marker tracks obstructed). Fig. 1B,C shows both the posterior (ﬁltered) latent space distribution obtained from our tracker, and its mean (we do not show the distribution of the global rigid body motion; in all experiments this is tracked with good accuracy). In the latent space plot shown in ﬁg. 1B, the onset of running (two cycles were used) appears as a separate region external to the main loop. It does not appear in the subsampled training set in ﬁg. 1B, where only one running cycle was used for training and the onset of running was removed. In each case, one can see that the model is able to track quite competently, with a modest decrease in its temporal accuracy, shown in ﬁg. 1C, where the averages are computed per 3D joint (normalised wrt body height). Subsampling causes some ambiguity in the estimate, e.g. see the bimodality in the right plot in ﬁg. 1C. In another set of experiments (not shown) we also tracked using different subsets of 3D markers. The estimates were accurate even when about 30% of the markers were dropped. Experiments with real images: this shows our tracker’s ability to work with real motions of different people, with different body proportions, not in its latent variable model training set (ﬁgs. 2–3). We study walking, running and turns. In all cases, tracking and 3D reconstruction are reasonably accurate. We have also run comparisons against low-dimensional models based on PCA and GPLVM (ﬁg. 3). It is important to note that, for LELVM, errors in the pose estimates are primarily caused by mismatches between the mocap data used to learn the LELVM prior and the body proportions of the person in the video. For example, the body proportions of the OSU motion captured walker are quite different from those of the image in ﬁg. 2–3 (e.g. note how the legs of the stick man are shorter relative to the trunk). Likewise, the style of the runner from the OSU data (e.g. the swinging of the arms) is quite different from that of the video. Finally, the interest points tracked by the 2D tracker do not entirely correspond either in number or location to the motion capture markers, and are noisy and sometimes missing. In future work, we plan to include an optimization step to also estimate the body proportions. This would be complicated for a general, unconstrained model because the dimensions of the body couple with the pose, so either one or the other can be changed to improve the tracking error (the observation likelihood can also become singular). But for dedicated prior pose models like ours these difﬁculties should be signiﬁcantly reduced. The model simply cannot assume highly unlikely stances—these are either not representable at all, or have reduced probability—and thus avoids compensatory, unrealistic body proportion estimates. 5 n = 15 n = 40 n = 65 n = 90 n = 115 n = 140 A 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1.5 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0.3 0.2 0.1 −1 0.4 0.3 0.2 −1.5 −1.5 n = 60 0.4 0.3 −2 −1 −1.5 −1 0 −0.5 n = 49 0.4 0.1 −1 −1.5 1 0 −0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1.5 −1.5 0.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 n = 37 0.2 0.1 −1 −1 −1.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1.5 −1.5 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.4 0.3 0.2 −0.5 n = 25 0.4 0.3 −1 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0 0 −0.5 1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 0.5 0 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 1.5 1 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 −2 1 1 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −1.5 n = 13 0.4 −1 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 n=1 B −1 −1 −1.5 −1.5 1.5 1 0.5 −0.5 0 −1 −1.5 −2 −2 1 0 −0.5 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 0.5 0 0 −0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 0.5 0 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 1 0.5 1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 −0.5 1.5 1.5 1 0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1.5 1 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 0 −0.5 −0.5 1.5 1 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 −1 −1.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 1.5 1.5 1 0.5 −0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 1 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −0.5 1.5 1 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 0 0 −0.5 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 1.5 1.5 1 −0.5 −2 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 −1 −1.5 −2 −2 1 0 −0.5 1.5 1 0.5 −0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 0.5 0 −0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 0 −0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 0 1 0.5 0 −0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2 1 0.5 1.5 1 0.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 1 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0 −1 −1.5 1.5 1.5 1 0.5 −0.5 0.2 0.1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 −0.1 −0.1 −0.1 −0.1 −0.1 −0.1 −0.2 −0.2 −0.2 −0.2 −0.2 −0.2 −0.3 −0.3 −0.3 −0.3 −0.3 −0.3 −0.4 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 −0.4 0.4 2.4 1.5 0.6 0.8 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 −0.4 0.4 2.4 1.5 0.6 0.8 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 −0.4 0.4 2.4 1.5 0.6 0.8 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 −0.4 0.4 2.4 1.5 0.6 0.8 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 −0.4 0.4 2.4 1.5 0.6 0.8 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 1 −0.5 −0.5 0 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 0.1 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 0 −0.5 −1.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 0 −0.5 −0.5 −0.5 −2 −1 −1 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0.5 0 −1.5 −1 1 1 0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −0.5 −1 −2 1 −1 0 −1 −1.5 −2 −0.5 −2 −1.5 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −1.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 1 0.5 0 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −0.5 0 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1.5 −2 −0.5 −2 −1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −1.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 1 0.5 0 −1.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −0.5 0 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1.5 −2 −0.5 −2 −1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −1.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −1 1 0.5 0 −1.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −0.5 0 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1.5 −2 −0.5 −2 −1 −1.5 −0.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −2 −1.5 0 −1.5 1 0.5 0.5 0 −2 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −1 1 1 0.5 −0.5 −1 1 0.5 1 0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 1 0 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 −2 −1.5 0.5 0 −0.5 −1 −0.5 0 −0.5 −1.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 0 −0.5 0 1 −1 −0.5 −1 1 0.5 0 1 0.5 0 0.5 −0.5 −1 −0.5 −2 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 0 −1 1 0 1 −1.5 −2 0.5 0 1 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 −1.5 −1.5 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.13 0.12 RMSE C RMSE 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0.11 0.1 0.09 0.08 0.07 0.06 0 0 50 100 150 0.05 0 10 time step n 20 30 40 50 60 time step n Figure 1: OSU running man motion capture data. A: we use 217 datapoints for training LELVM (with added noise) and for tracking. Row 1: tracking in the 2D latent space. The contours (very tight in this sequence) are the posterior probability. Row 2: perspective-projection-based observations with occlusions. Row 3: each quadruplet (a, a′ , b, b′ ) show the true pose of the running man from a front and side views (a, b), and the reconstructed pose by tracking with our model (a′ , b′ ). B: we use the ﬁrst running cycle for training LELVM and the second cycle for tracking. C: RMSE errors for each frame, for the tracking of A (left plot) and B (middle plot), normalised so that 1 equals the M 1 ˆ 2 height of the stick man. RMSE(n) = M j=1 ynj − ynj −1/2 for all 3D locations of the M ˆ markers, i.e., comparison of reconstructed stick man yn with ground-truth stick man yn . Right plot: multimodal posterior distribution in pose space for the model of A (frame 42). Comparison with PCA and GPLVM (ﬁg. 3): for these models, the tracker uses the same GMSPPF setting as for LELVM (number of particles, initialisation, random-walk dynamics, etc.) but with the mapping y = f (x) provided by GPLVM or PCA, and with a uniform prior p(x) in latent space (since neither GPLVM nor the non-probabilistic PCA provide one). The LELVM-tracker uses both its f (x) and latent space prior p(x), as discussed. All methods use a 2D latent space. We ensured the best possible training of GPLVM by model selection based on multiple runs. For PCA, the latent space looks deceptively good, showing non-intersecting loops. However, (1) individual loops do not collect together as they should (for LELVM they do); (2) worse still, the mapping from 2D to pose space yields a poor observation model. The reason is that the loop in 102-D pose space is nonlinearly bent and a plane can at best intersect it at a few points, so the tracker often stays put at one of those (typically an “average” standing position), since leaving it would increase the error a lot. Using more latent dimensions would improve this, but as LELVM shows, this is not necessary. For GPLVM, we found high sensitivity to ﬁlter initialisation: the estimates have high variance across runs and are inaccurate ≈ 80% of the time. When it fails, the GPLVM tracker often freezes in latent space, like PCA. When it does succeed, it produces results that are comparable with LELVM, although somewhat less accurate visually. However, even then GPLVM’s latent space consists of continuous chunks spread apart and offset from each other; GPLVM has no incentive to place nearby two xs mapping to the same y. This effect, combined with the lack of a data-sensitive, realistic latent space density p(x), makes GPLVM jump erratically from chunk to chunk, in contrast with LELVM, which smoothly follows the 1D loop. Some GPLVM problems might be alleviated using higher-order dynamics, but our experiments suggest that such modeling sophistication is less 6 0 0.5 1 n=1 n = 15 n = 29 n = 43 n = 55 n = 69 A 100 100 100 100 100 50 50 50 50 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 −50 −50 −50 −50 −50 −50 −100 −100 −100 −100 −100 −100 50 50 40 −40 −20 −50 −30 −10 0 −40 20 −20 40 n=4 −40 10 20 −20 40 50 0 n=9 −40 −20 30 40 50 0 n = 14 −40 20 −20 40 50 30 20 10 0 0 −40 −20 −30 −20 −40 10 20 −30 −10 0 −50 30 50 n = 19 −50 −30 −10 −50 30 −10 −20 −30 −40 10 50 40 30 20 10 0 −50 −30 −10 −50 20 −10 −20 −30 −40 10 50 40 30 20 10 0 −50 −30 −10 −50 30 −10 −20 −30 −40 0 50 50 40 30 20 10 0 −50 −30 −10 −50 30 −10 −20 −30 −40 10 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −20 −30 50 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −50 100 40 −40 10 20 −50 30 50 n = 24 40 50 n = 29 B 20 20 20 20 20 40 40 40 40 40 60 60 60 60 60 80 80 80 80 80 80 100 100 100 100 100 100 120 120 120 120 120 120 140 140 140 140 140 140 160 160 160 160 160 160 180 180 180 180 180 200 200 200 200 200 220 220 220 220 220 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 20 40 60 180 200 220 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 50 100 150 100 100 100 100 100 50 50 50 50 200 250 300 350 100 50 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 −50 −50 −50 −50 −50 −50 −100 −100 −100 −100 −100 −100 50 50 40 −40 −20 −50 −30 −10 0 −40 10 20 −50 30 40 −40 −20 −50 −30 −10 0 −40 10 20 −50 30 40 −40 −20 −50 −30 −10 0 −40 −20 30 40 50 0 −40 10 20 −50 30 40 50 40 30 30 20 20 10 10 0 −50 −30 −10 −50 20 0 −10 −20 −30 −40 10 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −20 −30 50 50 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −20 −30 50 50 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −20 −30 50 40 30 20 10 0 −10 −50 50 −40 −20 −30 −20 −30 −10 0 −40 10 20 −50 30 40 50 −10 −50 −40 −20 −30 −20 −30 −10 0 −40 10 20 −50 30 40 50 Figure 2: A: tracking of a video from [6] (turning & walking). We use 220 datapoints (3 full walking cycles) for training LELVM. Row 1: tracking in the 2D latent space. The contours are the estimated posterior probability. Row 2: tracking based on markers. The red dots are the 2D tracks and the green stick man is the 3D reconstruction obtained using our model. Row 3: our 3D reconstruction from a different viewpoint. B: tracking of a person running straight towards the camera. Notice the scale changes and possible forward-backward ambiguities in the 3D estimates. We train the LELVM using 180 datapoints (2.5 running cycles); 2D tracks were obtained by manually marking the video. In both A–B the mocap training data was for a person different from the video’s (with different body proportions and motions), and no ground-truth estimate was available for favourable initialisation.

PCA and GPLVM map consecutive walking cycles to spatially distinct latent space regions. Compounded by a data independent latent prior, the resulting tracker gets easily confused: it jumps across loops and/or remains put, trapped in local optima. In contrast, LELVM is stable and follows tightly a 1D manifold (see videos). crucial if locality constraints are correctly modeled (as in LELVM). We conclude that, compared to LELVM, GPLVM is signiﬁcantly less robust for tracking, has much higher training overhead and lacks some operations (e.g. computing latent conditionals based on partly missing ambient data). 7 5 Conclusion and future work We have proposed the use of priors based on the Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model (LELVM) for people tracking. LELVM is a probabilistic dim. red. method that combines the advantages of latent variable models and spectral manifold learning algorithms: a multimodal probability density over latent and ambient variables, globally differentiable nonlinear mappings for reconstruction and dimensionality reduction, no local optima, ability to unfold highly nonlinear manifolds, and good practical scaling to latent spaces of high dimension. LELVM is computationally efﬁcient, simple to learn from sparse training data, and compatible with standard probabilistic trackers such as particle ﬁlters. Our results using a LELVM-based probabilistic sigma point mixture tracker with several real and synthetic human motion sequences show that LELVM provides sufﬁcient constraints for robust operation in the presence of missing, noisy and ambiguous image measurements. Comparisons with PCA and GPLVM show LELVM is superior in terms of accuracy, robustness and computation time. The objective of this paper was to demonstrate the ability of the LELVM prior in a simple setting using 2D tracks obtained automatically or manually, and single-type motions (running, walking). Future work will explore more complex observation models such as silhouettes; the combination of different motion types in the same latent space (whose dimension will exceed 2); and the exploration of multimodal posterior distributions in latent space caused by ambiguities.

<p>Author: Peter Hoff</p><p>Abstract: This article discusses a latent variable model for inference and prediction of symmetric relational data. The model, based on the idea of the eigenvalue decomposition, represents the relationship between two nodes as the weighted inner-product of node-speciﬁc vectors of latent characteristics. This “eigenmodel” generalizes other popular latent variable models, such as latent class and distance models: It is shown mathematically that any latent class or distance model has a representation as an eigenmodel, but not vice-versa. The practical implications of this are examined in the context of three real datasets, for which the eigenmodel has as good or better out-of-sample predictive performance than the other two models. 1</p><p>5 0.39562011 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Anytime_Induction_of_Cost-sensitive_Trees.html">27 nips-2007-Anytime Induction of Cost-sensitive Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used to produce a wide-range of classiﬁers for complex real-world applications that involve nonuniform testing costs and misclassiﬁcation costs. As the complexity of these applications grows, the management of resources during the learning and classiﬁcation processes becomes a challenging task. In this work we introduce ACT (Anytime Cost-sensitive Trees), a novel framework for operating in such environments. ACT is an anytime algorithm that allows trading computation time for lower classiﬁcation costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different candidate splits. Using sampling techniques ACT approximates for each candidate split the cost of the subtree under it and favors the one with a minimal cost. Due to its stochastic nature ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to compare the performance of ACT to that of the state of the art cost-sensitive tree learners. The results show that for most domains ACT produces trees of signiﬁcantly lower costs. ACT is also shown to exhibit good anytime behavior with diminishing returns.</p><p>6 0.37236327 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_structure_of_manifolds_using_random_projections.html">116 nips-2007-Learning the structure of manifolds using random projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Slav Petrov, Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that log-linear grammars with latent variables can be practically trained using discriminative methods. Central to efﬁcient discriminative training is a hierarchical pruning procedure which allows feature expectations to be efﬁciently approximated in a gradient-based procedure. We compare L1 and L2 regularization and show that L1 regularization is superior, requiring fewer iterations to converge, and yielding sparser solutions. On full-scale treebank parsing experiments, the discriminative latent models outperform both the comparable generative latent models as well as the discriminative non-latent baselines.</p><p>2 0.36918402 <a title="72-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a new, convex relaxation of an expectation-maximization (EM) variant that approximates a standard objective while eliminating local minima. First, a cautionary result is presented, showing that any convex relaxation of EM over hidden variables must give trivial results if any dependence on the missing values is retained. Although this appears to be a strong negative outcome, we then demonstrate how the problem can be bypassed by using equivalence relations instead of value assignments over hidden variables. In particular, we develop new algorithms for estimating exponential conditional models that only require equivalence relation information over the variable values. This reformulation leads to an exact expression for EM variants in a wide range of problems. We then develop a semideﬁnite relaxation that yields global training by eliminating local minima. 1</p><p>3 0.36636719 <a title="72-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to model relational data on edges of networks. We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics. We develop an efﬁcient learning algorithm that can handle a large number of observations. The experimental results on several real-world data sets verify superior learning capacity. 1</p><p>4 0.36428544 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Expectation_Maximization_and_Posterior_Constraints.html">84 nips-2007-Expectation Maximization and Posterior Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, Ben Taskar, João Gama</p><p>Abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a widely used maximum likelihood estimation procedure for statistical models when the values of some of the variables in the model are not observed. Very often, however, our aim is primarily to ﬁnd a model that assigns values to the latent variables that have intended meaning for our data and maximizing expected likelihood only sometimes accomplishes this. Unfortunately, it is typically difﬁcult to add even simple a-priori information about latent variables in graphical models without making the models overly complex or intractable. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient, principled way to inject rich constraints on the posteriors of latent variables into the EM algorithm. Our method can be used to learn tractable graphical models that satisfy additional, otherwise intractable constraints. Focusing on clustering and the alignment problem for statistical machine translation, we show that simple, intuitive posterior constraints can greatly improve the performance over standard baselines and be competitive with more complex, intractable models. 1</p><p>5 0.36399785 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Convex_Relaxation_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">76 nips-2007-Efficient Convex Relaxation for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Support Vector Machine transduction, which involves a combinatorial problem with exponential computational complexity in the number of unlabeled examples. Although several studies are devoted to Transductive SVM, they suffer either from the high computation complexity or from the solutions of local optimum. To address this problem, we propose solving Transductive SVM via a convex relaxation, which converts the NP-hard problem to a semi-deﬁnite programming. Compared with the other SDP relaxation for Transductive SVM, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efﬁcient with the number of free parameters reduced from O(n2 ) to O(n) where n is the number of examples. Empirical study with several benchmark data sets shows the promising performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art implementations of Transductive SVM. 1</p><p>6 0.36360535 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Max Welling, Ian Porteous, Evgeniy Bart</p><p>Abstract: A general modeling framework is proposed that uniﬁes nonparametric-Bayesian models, topic-models and Bayesian networks. This class of inﬁnite state Bayes nets (ISBN) can be viewed as directed networks of ‘hierarchical Dirichlet processes’ (HDPs) where the domain of the variables can be structured (e.g. words in documents or features in images). We show that collapsed Gibbs sampling can be done efﬁciently in these models by leveraging the structure of the Bayes net and using the forward-ﬁltering-backward-sampling algorithm for junction trees. Existing models, such as nested-DP, Pachinko allocation, mixed membership stochastic block models as well as a number of new models are described as ISBNs. Two experiments have been performed to illustrate these ideas. 1</p><p>3 0.17382276 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Distributed_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">73 nips-2007-Distributed Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Newman, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a widely-used latent-variable model – the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or “topic” model – using distributed computation, where each of processors only sees of the total data set. We propose two distributed inference schemes that are motivated from different perspectives. The ﬁrst scheme uses local Gibbs sampling on each processor with periodic updates—it is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to a single processor implementation of Gibbs sampling. The second scheme relies on a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the standard LDA model to directly account for the fact that data are distributed across processors—it has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the approximate method. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works very well for LDA models, i.e., perplexity and precision-recall scores for distributed learning are indistinguishable from those obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include large-scale distributed computation on 1000 virtual processors; and speedup experiments of learning topics in a 100-million word corpus using 16 processors. ¢ ¤ ¦¥£ ¢ ¢</p><p>4 0.15744956 <a title="197-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Optimistic_Linear_Programming_gives_Logarithmic_Regret_for_Irreducible_MDPs.html">151 nips-2007-Optimistic Linear Programming gives Logarithmic Regret for Irreducible MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm called Optimistic Linear Programming (OLP) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown Markov decision process (MDP). OLP uses its experience so far to estimate the MDP. It chooses actions by optimistically maximizing estimated future rewards over a set of next-state transition probabilities that are close to the estimates, a computation that corresponds to solving linear programs. We show that the total expected reward obtained by OLP up to time T is within C(P ) log T of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where C(P ) is an explicit, MDP-dependent constant. OLP is closely related to an algorithm proposed by Burnetas and Katehakis with four key differences: OLP is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm. OLP is also similar in ﬂavor to an algorithm recently proposed by Auer and Ortner. But OLP is simpler and its regret bound has a better dependence on the size of the MDP. 1</p><p>5 0.14568439 <a title="197-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Incremental_Natural_Actor-Critic_Algorithms.html">102 nips-2007-Incremental Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shalabh Bhatnagar, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Mark Lee, Richard S. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: We present four new reinforcement learning algorithms based on actor-critic and natural-gradient ideas, and provide their convergence proofs. Actor-critic reinforcement learning methods are online approximations to policy iteration in which the value-function parameters are estimated using temporal difference learning and the policy parameters are updated by stochastic gradient descent. Methods based on policy gradients in this way are of special interest because of their compatibility with function approximation methods, which are needed to handle large or inﬁnite state spaces. The use of temporal difference learning in this way is of interest because in many applications it dramatically reduces the variance of the gradient estimates. The use of the natural gradient is of interest because it can produce better conditioned parameterizations and has been shown to further reduce variance in some cases. Our results extend prior two-timescale convergence results for actor-critic methods by Konda and Tsitsiklis by using temporal difference learning in the actor and by incorporating natural gradients, and they extend prior empirical studies of natural actor-critic methods by Peters, Vijayakumar and Schaal by providing the ﬁrst convergence proofs and the ﬁrst fully incremental algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.12411939 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Bayesian_Inference_for_Dynamically_Changing_Graphs.html">75 nips-2007-Efficient Bayesian Inference for Dynamically Changing Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.57915407 <a title="197-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Language_Change.html">9 nips-2007-A Probabilistic Approach to Language Change</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandre Bouchard-côté, Percy Liang, Dan Klein, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic approach to language change in which word forms are represented by phoneme sequences that undergo stochastic edits along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. This framework combines the advantages of the classical comparative method with the robustness of corpus-based probabilistic models. We use this framework to explore the consequences of two different schemes for deﬁning probabilistic models of phonological change, evaluating these schemes by reconstructing ancient word forms of Romance languages. The result is an efﬁcient inference procedure for automatically inferring ancient word forms from modern languages, which can be generalized to support inferences about linguistic phylogenies. 1</p><p>5 0.55171639 <a title="197-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Agglomerative_Clustering_with_Coalescents.html">31 nips-2007-Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Walder, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers kernels invariant to translation, rotation and dilation. We show that no non-trivial positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels exist which are radial and dilation invariant, only conditionally positive deﬁnite (c.p.d.) ones. Accordingly, we discuss the c.p.d. case and provide some novel analysis, including an elementary derivation of a c.p.d. representer theorem. On the practical side, we give a support vector machine (s.v.m.) algorithm for arbitrary c.p.d. kernels. For the thinplate kernel this leads to a classiﬁer with only one parameter (the amount of regularisation), which we demonstrate to be as effective as an s.v.m. with the Gaussian kernel, even though the Gaussian involves a second parameter (the length scale). 1</p><p>3 0.75791699 <a title="197-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-The_Epoch-Greedy_Algorithm_for_Multi-armed_Bandits_with_Side_Information.html">194 nips-2007-The Epoch-Greedy Algorithm for Multi-armed Bandits with Side Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Kenji Fukumizu, Choon H. Teo, Le Song, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Although kernel measures of independence have been widely applied in machine learning (notably in kernel ICA), there is as yet no method to determine whether they have detected statistically signiﬁcant dependence. We provide a novel test of the independence hypothesis for one particular kernel independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). The resulting test costs O(m2 ), where m is the sample size. We demonstrate that this test outperforms established contingency table and functional correlation-based tests, and that this advantage is greater for multivariate data. Finally, we show the HSIC test also applies to text (and to structured data more generally), for which no other independence test presently exists.</p><p>5 0.68865269 <a title="197-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>

Roux, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Marc Joliveau, Balázs Kégl</p><p>Abstract: We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a ﬁxed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes, but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.</p><p>6 0.68217921 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_structure_of_manifolds_using_random_projections.html">116 nips-2007-Learning the structure of manifolds using random projections</a></p>

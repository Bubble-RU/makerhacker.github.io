<p>Author: Ping Li, Qiang Wu, Christopher J. Burges</p><p>Abstract: We cast the ranking problem as (1) multiple classiﬁcation (“Mc”) (2) multiple ordinal classiﬁcation, which lead to computationally tractable learning algorithms for relevance ranking in Web search. We consider the DCG criterion (discounted cumulative gain), a standard quality measure in information retrieval. Our approach is motivated by the fact that perfect classiﬁcations result in perfect DCG scores and the DCG errors are bounded by classiﬁcation errors. We propose using the Expected Relevance to convert class probabilities into ranking scores. The class probabilities are learned using a gradient boosting tree algorithm. Evaluations on large-scale datasets show that our approach can improve LambdaRank [5] and the regressions-based ranker [6], in terms of the (normalized) DCG scores.

<p>Author: Eric K. Tsang, Bertram E. Shi</p><p>Abstract: The peak location in a population of phase-tuned neurons has been shown to be a more reliable estimator for disparity than the peak location in a population of position-tuned neurons. Unfortunately, the disparity range covered by a phasetuned population is limited by phase wraparound. Thus, a single population cannot cover the large range of disparities encountered in natural scenes unless the scale of the receptive fields is chosen to be very large, which results in very low resolution depth estimates. Here we describe a biologically plausible measure of the confidence that the stimulus disparity is inside the range covered by a population of phase-tuned neurons. Based upon this confidence measure, we propose an algorithm for disparity estimation that uses many populations of high-resolution phase-tuned neurons that are biased to different disparity ranges via position shifts between the left and right eye receptive fields. The population with the highest confidence is used to estimate the stimulus disparity. We show that this algorithm outperforms a previously proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm for disparity estimation, which uses disparity estimates from coarse scales to select the populations used at finer scales and can effectively detect occlusions.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73187065 <a title="83-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Evaluating_Search_Engines_by_Modeling_the_Relationship_Between_Relevance_and_Clicks.html">83 nips-2007-Evaluating Search Engines by Modeling the Relationship Between Relevance and Clicks</a></p>

<p>Author: Gwenn Englebienne, Tim Cootes, Magnus Rattray</p><p>Abstract: The present work aims to model the correspondence between facial motion and speech. The face and sound are modelled separately, with phonemes being the link between both. We propose a sequential model and evaluate its suitability for the generation of the facial animation from a sequence of phonemes, which we obtain from speech. We evaluate the results both by computing the error between generated sequences and real video, as well as with a rigorous double-blind test with human subjects. Experiments show that our model compares favourably to other existing methods and that the sequences generated are comparable to real video sequences. 1</p><p>4 0.55210727 <a title="83-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Bayesian_Inference_for_Dynamically_Changing_Graphs.html">75 nips-2007-Efficient Bayesian Inference for Dynamically Changing Graphs</a></p>

Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by stochastic systems in which observed evidence and conditional dependencies between states of the network change over time, and certain quantities of interest (marginal distributions, likelihood estimates etc.) must be updated, we study the problem of adaptive inference in tree-structured Bayesian networks. We describe an algorithm for adaptive inference that handles a broad range of changes to the network and is able to maintain marginal distributions, MAP estimates, and data likelihoods in all expected logarithmic time. We give an implementation of our algorithm and provide experiments that show that the algorithm can yield up to two orders of magnitude speedups on answering queries and responding to dynamic changes over the sum-product algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.55072445 <a title="83-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-What_makes_some_POMDP_problems_easy_to_approximate%3F.html">215 nips-2007-What makes some POMDP problems easy to approximate?</a></p>
<p>Author: Wee S. Lee, Nan Rong, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: Point-based algorithms have been surprisingly successful in computing approximately optimal solutions for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in high dimensional belief spaces. In this work, we seek to understand the belief-space properties that allow some POMDP problems to be approximated efﬁciently and thus help to explain the point-based algorithms’ success often observed in the experiments. We show that an approximately optimal POMDP solution can be computed in time polynomial in the covering number of a reachable belief space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable from a given belief point. We also show that under the weaker condition of having a small covering number for an optimal reachable space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable under an optimal policy, computing an approximately optimal solution is NP-hard. However, given a suitable set of points that “cover” an optimal reachable space well, an approximate solution can be computed in polynomial time. The covering number highlights several interesting properties that reduce the complexity of POMDP planning in practice, e.g., fully observed state variables, beliefs with sparse support, smooth beliefs, and circulant state-transition matrices. 1</p><p>6 0.54892969 <a title="83-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Discovering_Weakly-Interacting_Factors_in_a_Complex_Stochastic_Process.html">68 nips-2007-Discovering Weakly-Interacting Factors in a Complex Stochastic Process</a></p>

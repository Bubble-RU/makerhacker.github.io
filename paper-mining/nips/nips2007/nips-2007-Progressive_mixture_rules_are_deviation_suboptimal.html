<p>Author: Venkat Chandrasekaran, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation problem in Gaussian graphical models with arbitrary structure. We analyze the Embedded Trees algorithm, which solves a sequence of problems on tractable subgraphs thereby leading to the solution of the estimation problem on an intractable graph. Our analysis is based on the recently developed walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian estimation. We show that non-stationary iterations of the Embedded Trees algorithm using any sequence of subgraphs converge in walk-summable models. Based on walk-sum calculations, we develop adaptive methods that optimize the choice of subgraphs used at each iteration with a view to achieving maximum reduction in error. These adaptive procedures provide a signiﬁcant speedup in convergence over stationary iterative methods, and also appear to converge in a larger class of models. 1</p><p>3 0.094752006 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-A_Risk_Minimization_Principle_for_a_Class_of_Parzen_Estimators.html">11 nips-2007-A Risk Minimization Principle for a Class of Parzen Estimators</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristiaan Pelckmans, Johan Suykens, Bart D. Moor</p><p>Abstract: This paper1 explores the use of a Maximal Average Margin (MAM) optimality principle for the design of learning algorithms. It is shown that the application of this risk minimization principle results in a class of (computationally) simple learning machines similar to the classical Parzen window classiﬁer. A direct relation with the Rademacher complexities is established, as such facilitating analysis and providing a notion of certainty of prediction. This analysis is related to Support Vector Machines by means of a margin transformation. The power of the MAM principle is illustrated further by application to ordinal regression tasks, resulting in an O(n) algorithm able to process large datasets in reasonable time. 1</p><p>4 0.092012398 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Bounds_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">110 nips-2007-Learning Bounds for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: John Blitzer, Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza, Fernando Pereira, Jennifer Wortman</p><p>Abstract: Empirical risk minimization offers well-known learning guarantees when training and test data come from the same domain. In the real world, though, we often wish to adapt a classiﬁer from a source domain with a large amount of training data to different target domain with very little training data. In this work we give uniform convergence bounds for algorithms that minimize a convex combination of source and target empirical risk. The bounds explicitly model the inherent trade-off between training on a large but inaccurate source data set and a small but accurate target training set. Our theory also gives results when we have multiple source domains, each of which may have a different number of instances, and we exhibit cases in which minimizing a non-uniform combination of source risks can achieve much lower target error than standard empirical risk minimization. 1</p><p>5 0.089577541 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a new, convex relaxation of an expectation-maximization (EM) variant that approximates a standard objective while eliminating local minima. First, a cautionary result is presented, showing that any convex relaxation of EM over hidden variables must give trivial results if any dependence on the missing values is retained. Although this appears to be a strong negative outcome, we then demonstrate how the problem can be bypassed by using equivalence relations instead of value assignments over hidden variables. In particular, we develop new algorithms for estimating exponential conditional models that only require equivalence relation information over the variable values. This reformulation leads to an exact expression for EM variants in a wide range of problems. We then develop a semideﬁnite relaxation that yields global training by eliminating local minima. 1</p><p>6 0.086940698 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Simplified_Rules_and_Theoretical_Analysis_for_Information_Bottleneck_Optimization_and_PCA_with_Spiking_Neurons.html">177 nips-2007-Simplified Rules and Theoretical Analysis for Information Bottleneck Optimization and PCA with Spiking Neurons</a></p>

Our method is based on a variational characterization of f -divergences, which turns the estimation into a penalized convex risk minimization problem. We present a derivation of our kernel-based estimation algorithm and an analysis of convergence rates for the estimator. Our simulation results demonstrate the convergence behavior of the method, which compares favorably with existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>3 0.57896435 <a title="159-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-Catching_Up_Faster_in_Bayesian_Model_Selection_and_Model_Averaging.html">44 nips-2007-Catching Up Faster in Bayesian Model Selection and Model Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Steven D. Rooij, Peter Grünwald</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model averaging, model selection and their approximations such as BIC are generally statistically consistent, but sometimes achieve slower rates of convergence than other methods such as AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation. On the other hand, these other methods can be inconsistent. We identify the catch-up phenomenon as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of Bayesian methods. Based on this analysis we deﬁne the switch-distribution, a modiﬁcation of the Bayesian model averaging distribution. We prove that in many situations model selection and prediction based on the switch-distribution is both consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates, thereby resolving the AIC-BIC dilemma. The method is practical; we give an efﬁcient algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.57585055 <a title="159-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-How_SVMs_can_estimate_quantiles_and_the_median.html">101 nips-2007-How SVMs can estimate quantiles and the median</a></p>

For the pinball loss a condition on the data-generating distribution P is given that ensures that the conditional quantiles are approximated with respect to · 1 . This result is then used to derive an oracle inequality for an SVM based on the pinball loss. Moreover, we show that SVMs based on the ǫ-insensitive loss estimate the conditional median only under certain conditions on P . 1</p><p>5 0.52330023 <a title="159-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Bundle_Methods_for_Machine_Learning.html">40 nips-2007-Bundle Methods for Machine Learning</a></p>

Our method applies to Support Vector estimation, regression, Gaussian Processes, and any other regularized risk minimization setting which leads to a convex optimization problem. SVMPerf can be shown to be a special case of our approach. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ ) steps to precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ )) steps for continuously differentiable problems.

<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel noisy-logical distribution for representing the distribution of a binary output variable conditioned on multiple binary input variables. The distribution is represented in terms of noisy-or’s and noisy-and-not’s of causal features which are conjunctions of the binary inputs. The standard noisy-or and noisy-andnot models, used in causal reasoning and artiﬁcial intelligence, are special cases of the noisy-logical distribution. We prove that the noisy-logical distribution is complete in the sense that it can represent all conditional distributions provided a sufﬁcient number of causal factors are used. We illustrate the noisy-logical distribution by showing that it can account for new experimental ﬁndings on how humans perform causal reasoning in complex contexts. We speculate on the use of the noisy-logical distribution for causal reasoning and artiﬁcial intelligence.</p><p>2 0.93416107 <a title="159-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Competition_Adds_Complexity.html">52 nips-2007-Competition Adds Complexity</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Kulesza, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: In many structured prediction problems, the highest-scoring labeling is hard to compute exactly, leading to the use of approximate inference methods. However, when inference is used in a learning algorithm, a good approximation of the score may not be sufﬁcient. We show in particular that learning can fail even with an approximate inference method with rigorous approximation guarantees. There are two reasons for this. First, approximate methods can effectively reduce the expressivity of an underlying model by making it impossible to choose parameters that reliably give good predictions. Second, approximations can respond to parameter changes in such a way that standard learning algorithms are misled. In contrast, we give two positive results in the form of learning bounds for the use of LP-relaxed inference in structured perceptron and empirical risk minimization settings. We argue that without understanding combinations of inference and learning, such as these, that are appropriately compatible, learning performance under approximate inference cannot be guaranteed. 1</p><p>5 0.85829455 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Incomplete_Information.html">165 nips-2007-Regret Minimization in Games with Incomplete Information</a></p>

In particular, we introduce the notion of counterfactual regret, which exploits the degree of incomplete information in an extensive game. We show how minimizing counterfactual regret minimizes overall regret, and therefore in self-play can be used to compute a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate this technique in the domain of poker, showing we can solve abstractions of limit Texas Hold’em with as many as 1012 states, two orders of magnitude larger than previous methods. 1</p><p>6 0.82202762 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Computing_Robust_Counter-Strategies.html">55 nips-2007-Computing Robust Counter-Strategies</a></p>

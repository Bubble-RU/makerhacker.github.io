<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani, Byron M. Yu, John P. Cunningham, Krishna V. Shenoy</p><p>Abstract: Neural spike trains present challenges to analytical efforts due to their noisy, spiking nature. Many studies of neuroscientiﬁc and neural prosthetic importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of the spike train’s underlying ﬁring rate. Current techniques to ﬁnd time-varying ﬁring rates require ad hoc choices of parameters, offer no conﬁdence intervals on their estimates, and can obscure potentially important single trial variability. We present a new method, based on a Gaussian Process prior, for inferring probabilistically optimal estimates of ﬁring rate functions underlying single or multiple neural spike trains. We test the performance of the method on simulated data and experimentally gathered neural spike trains, and we demonstrate improvements over conventional estimators. 1</p><p>3 0.17968069 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>4 0.17775993 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Better_than_least_squares%3A_comparison_of_objective_functions_for_estimating_linear-nonlinear_models.html">36 nips-2007-Better than least squares: comparison of objective functions for estimating linear-nonlinear models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tatyana Sharpee</p><p>Abstract: This paper compares a family of methods for characterizing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli in the framework of the linear-nonlinear model. In this model, the neural ﬁring rate is a nonlinear function of a small number of relevant stimulus components. The relevant stimulus dimensions can be found by maximizing one of the family of objective functions, R´ nyi divergences of different e orders [1, 2]. We show that maximizing one of them, R´ nyi divergence of ore der 2, is equivalent to least-square ﬁtting of the linear-nonlinear model to neural data. Next, we derive reconstruction errors in relevant dimensions found by maximizing R´ nyi divergences of arbitrary order in the asymptotic limit of large spike e numbers. We ﬁnd that the smallest errors are obtained with R´ nyi divergence of e order 1, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence. This corresponds to ﬁnding relevant dimensions by maximizing mutual information [2]. We numerically test how these optimization schemes perform in the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio (small number of spikes and increasing neural noise) for model visual neurons. We ﬁnd that optimization schemes based on either least square ﬁtting or information maximization perform well even when number of spikes is small. Information maximization provides slightly, but signiﬁcantly, better reconstructions than least square ﬁtting. This makes the problem of ﬁnding relevant dimensions, together with the problem of lossy compression [3], one of examples where informationtheoretic measures are no more data limited than those derived from least squares. 1</p><p>5 0.14842415 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Inference_for_Spiking_Neuron_Models_with_a_Sparsity_Prior.html">33 nips-2007-Bayesian Inference for Spiking Neuron Models with a Sparsity Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Gerwinn, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Generalized linear models are the most commonly used tools to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of such models. Using the expectation propagation algorithm, we are able to approximate the full posterior distribution over all weights. In addition, we use a Laplacian prior to favor sparse solutions. Therefore, stimulus features that do not critically inﬂuence neural activity will be assigned zero weights and thus be effectively excluded by the model. This feature selection mechanism facilitates both the interpretation of the neuron model as well as its predictive abilities. The posterior distribution can be used to obtain conﬁdence intervals which makes it possible to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the solution. In neural data analysis, the available amount of experimental measurements is often limited whereas the parameter space is large. In such a situation, both regularization by a sparsity prior and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters are essential. We apply our method to multi-electrode recordings of retinal ganglion cells and use our uncertainty estimate to test the statistical signiﬁcance of functional couplings between neurons. Furthermore we used the sparsity of the Laplace prior to select those ﬁlters from a spike-triggered covariance analysis that are most informative about the neural response. 1</p><p>6 0.1305296 <a title="35-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Ben Williams, Marc Toussaint, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Biological movement is built up of sub-blocks or motion primitives. Such primitives provide a compact representation of movement which is also desirable in robotic control applications. We analyse handwriting data to gain a better understanding of primitives and their timings in biological movements. Inference of the shape and the timing of primitives can be done using a factorial HMM based model, allowing the handwriting to be represented in primitive timing space. This representation provides a distribution of spikes corresponding to the primitive activations, which can also be modelled using HMM architectures. We show how the coupling of the low level primitive model, and the higher level timing model during inference can produce good reconstructions of handwriting, with shared primitives for all characters modelled. This coupled model also captures the variance proﬁle of the dataset which is accounted for by spike timing jitter. The timing code provides a compact representation of the movement while generating a movement without an explicit timing model produces a scribbling style of output. 1</p><p>6 0.58520681 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Inference_for_Spiking_Neuron_Models_with_a_Sparsity_Prior.html">33 nips-2007-Bayesian Inference for Spiking Neuron Models with a Sparsity Prior</a></p>

Further advantages of our scheme include automatic complexity control and error bars on its predictions. 1</p><p>2 0.68705016 <a title="35-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Learning_with_Tree-Averaged_Densities_and_Distributions.html">119 nips-2007-Learning with Tree-Averaged Densities and Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Kirshner</p><p>Abstract: We utilize the ensemble of trees framework, a tractable mixture over superexponential number of tree-structured distributions [1], to develop a new model for multivariate density estimation. The model is based on a construction of treestructured copulas – multivariate distributions with uniform on [0, 1] marginals. By averaging over all possible tree structures, the new model can approximate distributions with complex variable dependencies. We propose an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters for these tree-averaged models for both the real-valued and the categorical case. Based on the tree-averaged framework, we propose a new model for joint precipitation amounts data on networks of rain stations. 1</p><p>3 0.59222722 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Cooled_and_Relaxed_Survey_Propagation_for_MRFs.html">64 nips-2007-Cooled and Relaxed Survey Propagation for MRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Hai L. Chieu, Wee S. Lee, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new algorithm, Relaxed Survey Propagation (RSP), for ﬁnding MAP conﬁgurations in Markov random ﬁelds. We compare its performance with state-of-the-art algorithms including the max-product belief propagation, its sequential tree-reweighted variant, residual (sum-product) belief propagation, and tree-structured expectation propagation. We show that it outperforms all approaches for Ising models with mixed couplings, as well as on a web person disambiguation task formulated as a supervised clustering problem. 1</p><p>4 0.50762445 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Exponential_Family_Predictive_Representations_of_State.html">86 nips-2007-Exponential Family Predictive Representations of State</a></p>
<p>Author: David Wingate, Satinder S. Baveja</p><p>Abstract: In order to represent state in controlled, partially observable, stochastic dynamical systems, some sort of sufﬁcient statistic for history is necessary. Predictive representations of state (PSRs) capture state as statistics of the future. We introduce a new model of such systems called the “Exponential family PSR,” which deﬁnes as state the time-varying parameters of an exponential family distribution which models n sequential observations in the future. This choice of state representation explicitly connects PSRs to state-of-the-art probabilistic modeling, which allows us to take advantage of current efforts in high-dimensional density estimation, and in particular, graphical models and maximum entropy models. We present a parameter learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood, and we show how a variety of current approximate inference methods apply. We evaluate the quality of our model with reinforcement learning by directly evaluating the control performance of the model. 1</p><p>5 0.44343433 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>6 0.44092813 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Mining_Internet-Scale_Software_Repositories.html">129 nips-2007-Mining Internet-Scale Software Repositories</a></p>

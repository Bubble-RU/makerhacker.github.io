<p>Author: David P. Wipf, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular update rules used for ARD are either difﬁcult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it remains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary functions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformulation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted 1 problems. The result is an efﬁcient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature- and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promoting sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the methodology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation. 1</p><p>3 0.10384224 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-On_Sparsity_and_Overcompleteness_in_Image_Models.html">145 nips-2007-On Sparsity and Overcompleteness in Image Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Pietro Berkes, Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Computational models of visual cortex, and in particular those based on sparse coding, have enjoyed much recent attention. Despite this currency, the question of how sparse or how over-complete a sparse representation should be, has gone without principled answer. Here, we use Bayesian model-selection methods to address these questions for a sparse-coding model based on a Student-t prior. Having validated our methods on toy data, we ﬁnd that natural images are indeed best modelled by extremely sparse distributions; although for the Student-t prior, the associated optimal basis size is only modestly over-complete. 1</p><p>4 0.089535281 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Predictive_Matrix-Variate_t_Models.html">156 nips-2007-Predictive Matrix-Variate t Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly important to learn from a partially-observed random matrix and predict its missing elements. We assume that the entire matrix is a single sample drawn from a matrix-variate t distribution and suggest a matrixvariate t model (MVTM) to predict those missing elements. We show that MVTM generalizes a range of known probabilistic models, and automatically performs model selection to encourage sparse predictive models. Due to the non-conjugacy of its prior, it is difﬁcult to make predictions by computing the mode or mean of the posterior distribution. We suggest an optimization method that sequentially minimizes a convex upper-bound of the log-likelihood, which is very efﬁcient and scalable. The experiments on a toy data and EachMovie dataset show a good predictive accuracy of the model. 1</p><p>5 0.063821532 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Prediction.html">135 nips-2007-Multi-task Gaussian Process Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Edwin V. Bonilla, Kian M. Chai, Christopher Williams</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate multi-task learning in the context of Gaussian Processes (GP). We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a “free-form” covariance matrix over tasks. This allows for good ﬂexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assumption of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task transfer occurs. We evaluate the beneﬁts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.059744436 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Horizontal_Connections_in_a_Sparse_Coding_Model_of_Natural_Images.html">111 nips-2007-Learning Horizontal Connections in a Sparse Coding Model of Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Many existing approaches to collaborative ﬁltering can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netﬂix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netﬂix’s own system.</p><p>4 0.54901117 <a title="96-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Predictive_Matrix-Variate_t_Models.html">156 nips-2007-Predictive Matrix-Variate t Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Chuan-sheng Foo, Chuong B. Do, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: In problems where input features have varying amounts of noise, using distinct regularization hyperparameters for different features provides an effective means of managing model complexity. While regularizers for neural networks and support vector machines often rely on multiple hyperparameters, regularizers for structured prediction models (used in tasks such as sequence labeling or parsing) typically rely only on a single shared hyperparameter for all features. In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing regularization hyperparameters for log-linear models, a class of structured prediction probabilistic models which includes conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs). Using an implicit differentiation trick, we derive an efﬁcient gradient-based method for learning Gaussian regularization priors with multiple hyperparameters. In both simulations and the real-world task of computational RNA secondary structure prediction, we ﬁnd that multiple hyperparameter learning can provide a signiﬁcant boost in accuracy compared to using only a single regularization hyperparameter. 1</p><p>6 0.51320028 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-On_Sparsity_and_Overcompleteness_in_Image_Models.html">145 nips-2007-On Sparsity and Overcompleteness in Image Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Burr Settles, Mark Craven, Soumya Ray</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for active learning in the multiple-instance (MI) setting. In an MI learning problem, instances are naturally organized into bags and it is the bags, instead of individual instances, that are labeled for training. MI learners assume that every instance in a bag labeled negative is actually negative, whereas at least one instance in a bag labeled positive is actually positive. We consider the particular case in which an MI learner is allowed to selectively query unlabeled instances from positive bags. This approach is well motivated in domains in which it is inexpensive to acquire bag labels and possible, but expensive, to acquire instance labels. We describe a method for learning from labels at mixed levels of granularity, and introduce two active query selection strategies motivated by the MI setting. Our experiments show that learning from instance labels can signiﬁcantly improve performance of a basic MI learning algorithm in two multiple-instance domains: content-based image retrieval and text classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>2 0.64303195 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Selecting_Observations_against_Adversarial_Objectives.html">174 nips-2007-Selecting Observations against Adversarial Objectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Brendan Mcmahan, Carlos Guestrin, Anupam Gupta</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, one has to actively select among a set of expensive observations before making an informed decision. Often, we want to select observations which perform well when evaluated with an objective function chosen by an adversary. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the Submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efﬁcient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for the case where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efﬁcient algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees. For robust experimental design, our algorithm performs favorably compared to SDP-based algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.64298165 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Heterogeneous_Component_Analysis.html">96 nips-2007-Heterogeneous Component Analysis</a></p>

HCA is a linear block-wise sparse Bayesian PCA based not only on a probabilistic model with block-wise residual variance terms but also on a Bayesian treatment of a block-wise sparse factor-loading matrix. We study various algorithms that implement our HCA concept extracting sparse heterogeneous structure by obtaining common components for the blocks and speciﬁc components within each block. Simulations on toy and bioinformatics data underline the usefulness of the proposed structured matrix factorization concept. 1</p><p>4 0.62793297 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Agreement-Based_Learning.html">22 nips-2007-Agreement-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Dan Klein, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The learning of probabilistic models with many hidden variables and nondecomposable dependencies is an important and challenging problem. In contrast to traditional approaches based on approximate inference in a single intractable model, our approach is to train a set of tractable submodels by encouraging them to agree on the hidden variables. This allows us to capture non-decomposable aspects of the data while still maintaining tractability. We propose an objective function for our approach, derive EM-style algorithms for parameter estimation, and demonstrate their effectiveness on three challenging real-world learning tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.49791631 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Receptive_Fields_without_Spike-Triggering.html">164 nips-2007-Receptive Fields without Spike-Triggering</a></p>
<p>Author: Guenther Zeck, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: S timulus selectivity of sensory neurons is often characterized by estimating their receptive ﬁeld properties such as orientation selectivity. Receptive ﬁelds are usually derived from the mean (or covariance) of the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble. This approach treats each spike as an independent message but does not take into account that information might be conveyed through patterns of neural activity that are distributed across space or time. Can we ﬁnd a concise description for the processing of a whole population of neurons analogous to the receptive ﬁeld for single neurons? Here, we present a generalization of the linear receptive ﬁeld which is not bound to be triggered on individual spikes but can be meaningfully linked to distributed response patterns. More precisely, we seek to identify those stimulus features and the corresponding patterns of neural activity that are most reliably coupled. We use an extension of reverse-correlation methods based on canonical correlation analysis. The resulting population receptive ﬁelds span the subspace of stimuli that is most informative about the population response. We evaluate our approach using both neuronal models and multi-electrode recordings from rabbit retinal ganglion cells. We show how the model can be extended to capture nonlinear stimulus-response relationships using kernel canonical correlation analysis, which makes it possible to test different coding mechanisms. Our technique can also be used to calculate receptive ﬁelds from multi-dimensional neural measurements such as those obtained from dynamic imaging methods. 1</p><p>6 0.49725419 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Inferring_Neural_Firing_Rates_from_Spike_Trains_Using_Gaussian_Processes.html">104 nips-2007-Inferring Neural Firing Rates from Spike Trains Using Gaussian Processes</a></p>

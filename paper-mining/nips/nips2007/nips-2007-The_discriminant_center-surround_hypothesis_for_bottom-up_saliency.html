<h1>202 nips-2007-The discriminant center-surround hypothesis for bottom-up saliency</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2007-202-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3264-the-discriminant-center-surround-hypothesis-for-bottom-up-saliency.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Dashan Gao, Vijay Mahadevan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The classical hypothesis, that bottom-up saliency is a center-surround process, is combined with a more recent hypothesis that all saliency decisions are optimal in a decision-theoretic sense. The combined hypothesis is denoted as discriminant center-surround saliency, and the corresponding optimal saliency architecture is derived. This architecture equates the saliency of each image location to the discriminant power of a set of features with respect to the classiﬁcation problem that opposes stimuli at center and surround, at that location. It is shown that the resulting saliency detector makes accurate quantitative predictions for various aspects of the psychophysics of human saliency, including non-linear properties beyond the reach of previous saliency models. Furthermore, it is shown that discriminant center-surround saliency can be easily generalized to various stimulus modalities (such as color, orientation and motion), and provides optimal solutions for many other saliency problems of interest for computer vision. Optimal solutions, under this hypothesis, are derived for a number of the former (including static natural images, dense motion ﬁelds, and even dynamic textures), and applied to a number of the latter (the prediction of human eye ﬁxations, motion-based saliency in the presence of ego-motion, and motion-based saliency in the presence of highly dynamic backgrounds). In result, discriminant saliency is shown to predict eye ﬁxations better than previous models, and produces background subtraction algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art in computer vision. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2007-202-reference" href="../nips2007_reference/nips-2007-The_discriminant_center-surround_hypothesis_for_bottom-up_saliency_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Moran Cerf, Jonathan Harel, Wolfgang Einhaeuser, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: Under natural viewing conditions, human observers shift their gaze to allocate processing resources to subsets of the visual input. Many computational models try to predict such voluntary eye and attentional shifts. Although the important role of high level stimulus properties (e.g., semantic information) in search stands undisputed, most models are based on low-level image properties. We here demonstrate that a combined model of face detection and low-level saliency signiﬁcantly outperforms a low-level model in predicting locations humans ﬁxate on, based on eye-movement recordings of humans observing photographs of natural scenes, most of which contained at least one person. Observers, even when not instructed to look for anything particular, ﬁxate on a face with a probability of over 80% within their ﬁrst two ﬁxations; furthermore, they exhibit more similar scanpaths when faces are present. Remarkably, our model’s predictive performance in images that do not contain faces is not impaired, and is even improved in some cases by spurious face detector responses. 1</p><p>3 0.24453561 <a title="202-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Experience-Guided_Search%3A_A_Theory_of_Attentional_Control.html">85 nips-2007-Experience-Guided Search: A Theory of Attentional Control</a></p>
<p>Author: David Baldwin, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: People perform a remarkable range of tasks that require search of the visual environment for a target item among distractors. The Guided Search model (Wolfe, 1994, 2007), or GS, is perhaps the best developed psychological account of human visual search. To prioritize search, GS assigns saliency to locations in the visual ﬁeld. Saliency is a linear combination of activations from retinotopic maps representing primitive visual features. GS includes heuristics for setting the gain coefﬁcient associated with each map. Variants of GS have formalized the notion of optimization as a principle of attentional control (e.g., Baldwin & Mozer, 2006; Cave, 1999; Navalpakkam & Itti, 2006; Rao et al., 2002), but every GS-like model must be ’dumbed down’ to match human data, e.g., by corrupting the saliency map with noise and by imposing arbitrary restrictions on gain modulation. We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of GS, called Experience-Guided Search (EGS), based on a generative model of the environment that makes three claims: (1) Feature detectors produce Poisson spike trains whose rates are conditioned on feature type and whether the feature belongs to a target or distractor; (2) the environment and/or task is nonstationary and can change over a sequence of trials; and (3) a prior speciﬁes that features are more likely to be present for target than for distractors. Through experience, EGS infers latent environment variables that determine the gains for guiding search. Control is thus cast as probabilistic inference, not optimization. We show that EGS can replicate a range of human data from visual search, including data that GS does not address. 1</p><p>4 0.13132201 <a title="202-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Congruence_between_model_and_human_attention_reveals_unique_signatures_of_critical_visual_events.html">57 nips-2007-Congruence between model and human attention reveals unique signatures of critical visual events</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Peters, Laurent Itti</p><p>Abstract: Current computational models of bottom-up and top-down components of attention are predictive of eye movements across a range of stimuli and of simple, ﬁxed visual tasks (such as visual search for a target among distractors). However, to date there exists no computational framework which can reliably mimic human gaze behavior in more complex environments and tasks, such as driving a vehicle through traﬃc. Here, we develop a hybrid computational/behavioral framework, combining simple models for bottom-up salience and top-down relevance, and looking for changes in the predictive power of these components at diﬀerent critical event times during 4.7 hours (500,000 video frames) of observers playing car racing and ﬂight combat video games. This approach is motivated by our observation that the predictive strengths of the salience and relevance models exhibit reliable temporal signatures during critical event windows in the task sequence—for example, when the game player directly engages an enemy plane in a ﬂight combat game, the predictive strength of the salience model increases signiﬁcantly, while that of the relevance model decreases signiﬁcantly. Our new framework combines these temporal signatures to implement several event detectors. Critically, we ﬁnd that an event detector based on fused behavioral and stimulus information (in the form of the model’s predictive strength) is much stronger than detectors based on behavioral information alone (eye position) or image information alone (model prediction maps). This approach to event detection, based on eye tracking combined with computational models applied to the visual input, may have useful applications as a less-invasive alternative to other event detection approaches based on neural signatures derived from EEG or fMRI recordings. 1</p><p>5 0.088884808 <a title="202-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Bayesian_Model_of_Conditioned_Perception.html">3 nips-2007-A Bayesian Model of Conditioned Perception</a></p>

Unlike previous methods, this algorithm does not model their performance with a single linear classiﬁer operating on raw image pixels. Instead, it represents classiﬁcation as the combination of multiple feature detectors. This approach extracts more information about human visual classiﬁcation than previous methods and provides a foundation for further exploration. 1</p><p>6 0.26933429 <a title="202-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Log-Linear_Grammars_with_Latent_Variables.html">72 nips-2007-Discriminative Log-Linear Grammars with Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Dashan Gao, Vijay Mahadevan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The classical hypothesis, that bottom-up saliency is a center-surround process, is combined with a more recent hypothesis that all saliency decisions are optimal in a decision-theoretic sense. The combined hypothesis is denoted as discriminant center-surround saliency, and the corresponding optimal saliency architecture is derived. This architecture equates the saliency of each image location to the discriminant power of a set of features with respect to the classiﬁcation problem that opposes stimuli at center and surround, at that location. It is shown that the resulting saliency detector makes accurate quantitative predictions for various aspects of the psychophysics of human saliency, including non-linear properties beyond the reach of previous saliency models. Furthermore, it is shown that discriminant center-surround saliency can be easily generalized to various stimulus modalities (such as color, orientation and motion), and provides optimal solutions for many other saliency problems of interest for computer vision. Optimal solutions, under this hypothesis, are derived for a number of the former (including static natural images, dense motion ﬁelds, and even dynamic textures), and applied to a number of the latter (the prediction of human eye ﬁxations, motion-based saliency in the presence of ego-motion, and motion-based saliency in the presence of highly dynamic backgrounds). In result, discriminant saliency is shown to predict eye ﬁxations better than previous models, and produces background subtraction algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art in computer vision. 1</p><p>2 0.67962831 <a title="202-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Near-Maximum_Entropy_Models_for_Binary_Neural_Representations_of_Natural_Images.html">138 nips-2007-Near-Maximum Entropy Models for Binary Neural Representations of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Bethge, Philipp Berens</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy analysis of binary variables provides an elegant way for studying the role of pairwise correlations in neural populations. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from their poor scalability to high dimensions. In sensory coding, however, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous. Here, we introduce a new approach using a near-maximum entropy model, that makes this type of analysis feasible for very high-dimensional data—the model parameters can be derived in closed form and sampling is easy. Therefore, our NearMaxEnt approach can serve as a tool for testing predictions from a pairwise maximum entropy model not only for low-dimensional marginals, but also for high dimensional measurements of more than thousand units. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying natural images with dichotomized pixel intensities. Our results indicate that the statistics of such higher-dimensional measurements exhibit additional structure that are not predicted by pairwise correlations, despite the fact that pairwise correlations explain the lower-dimensional marginal statistics surprisingly well up to the limit of dimensionality where estimation of the full joint distribution is feasible. 1</p><p>3 0.6689567 <a title="202-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Classification_via_Minimum_Incremental_Coding_Length_%28MICL%29.html">45 nips-2007-Classification via Minimum Incremental Coding Length (MICL)</a></p>
<p>Author: John Wright, Yangyu Tao, Zhouchen Lin, Yi Ma, Heung-yeung Shum</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple new criterion for classiﬁcation, based on principles from lossy data compression. The criterion assigns a test sample to the class that uses the minimum number of additional bits to code the test sample, subject to an allowable distortion. We prove asymptotic optimality of this criterion for Gaussian data and analyze its relationships to classical classiﬁers. Theoretical results provide new insights into relationships among popular classiﬁers such as MAP and RDA, as well as unsupervised clustering methods based on lossy compression [13]. Minimizing the lossy coding length induces a regularization effect which stabilizes the (implicit) density estimate in a small-sample setting. Compression also provides a uniform means of handling classes of varying dimension. This simple classiﬁcation criterion and its kernel and local versions perform competitively against existing classiﬁers on both synthetic examples and real imagery data such as handwritten digits and human faces, without requiring domain-speciﬁc information. 1</p><p>4 0.59854937 <a title="202-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_human_gaze_using_low-level_saliency_combined_with_face_detection.html">155 nips-2007-Predicting human gaze using low-level saliency combined with face detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Moran Cerf, Jonathan Harel, Wolfgang Einhaeuser, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: Under natural viewing conditions, human observers shift their gaze to allocate processing resources to subsets of the visual input. Many computational models try to predict such voluntary eye and attentional shifts. Although the important role of high level stimulus properties (e.g., semantic information) in search stands undisputed, most models are based on low-level image properties. We here demonstrate that a combined model of face detection and low-level saliency signiﬁcantly outperforms a low-level model in predicting locations humans ﬁxate on, based on eye-movement recordings of humans observing photographs of natural scenes, most of which contained at least one person. Observers, even when not instructed to look for anything particular, ﬁxate on a face with a probability of over 80% within their ﬁrst two ﬁxations; furthermore, they exhibit more similar scanpaths when faces are present. Remarkably, our model’s predictive performance in images that do not contain faces is not impaired, and is even improved in some cases by spurious face detector responses. 1</p><p>5 0.58644831 <a title="202-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Configuration_Estimates_Improve_Pedestrian_Finding.html">56 nips-2007-Configuration Estimates Improve Pedestrian Finding</a></p>
<p>Author: Duan Tran, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Fair discriminative pedestrian ﬁnders are now available. In fact, these pedestrian ﬁnders make most errors on pedestrians in conﬁgurations that are uncommon in the training data, for example, mounting a bicycle. This is undesirable. However, the human conﬁguration can itself be estimated discriminatively using structure learning. We demonstrate a pedestrian ﬁnder which ﬁrst ﬁnds the most likely human pose in the window using a discriminative procedure trained with structure learning on a small dataset. We then present features (local histogram of oriented gradient and local PCA of gradient) based on that conﬁguration to an SVM classiﬁer. We show, using the INRIA Person dataset, that estimates of conﬁguration signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of a discriminative pedestrian ﬁnder. 1</p><p>6 0.58443969 <a title="202-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>

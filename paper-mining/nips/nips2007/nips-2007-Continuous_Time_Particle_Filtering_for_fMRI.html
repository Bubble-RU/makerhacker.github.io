<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: Although theorists have interpreted classical conditioning as a laboratory model of Bayesian belief updating, a recent reanalysis showed that the key features that theoretical models capture about learning are artifacts of averaging over subjects. Rather than learning smoothly to asymptote (reﬂecting, according to Bayesian models, the gradual tradeoff from prior to posterior as data accumulate), subjects learn suddenly and their predictions ﬂuctuate perpetually. We suggest that abrupt and unstable learning can be modeled by assuming subjects are conducting inference using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with a small number of samples — one, in our simulations. Ensemble behavior resembles exact Bayesian models since, as in particle ﬁlters, it averages over many samples. Further, the model is capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviors like retrospective revaluation at the ensemble level, even given minimally sophisticated individuals that do not track uncertainty in their beliefs over trials. 1</p><p>4 0.16423203 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Omer Bobrowski, Ron Meir, Shy Shoham, Yonina Eldar</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly evident that organisms acting in uncertain dynamical environments often employ exact or approximate Bayesian statistical calculations in order to continuously estimate the environmental state, integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, form predictions and choose actions. What is less clear is how these putative computations are implemented by cortical neural networks. An additional level of complexity is introduced because these networks observe the world through spike trains received from primary sensory afferents, rather than directly. A recent line of research has described mechanisms by which such computations can be implemented using a network of neurons whose activity directly represents a probability distribution across the possible “world states”. Much of this work, however, uses various approximations, which severely restrict the domain of applicability of these implementations. Here we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process ﬁltering, and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using linear neural networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with several examples, and relate the required network properties to the statistical nature of the environment, thereby quantifying the compatibility of a given network with its environment. 1</p><p>5 0.14186186 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Locality_and_low-dimensions_in_the_prediction_of_natural_experience_from_fMRI.html">122 nips-2007-Locality and low-dimensions in the prediction of natural experience from fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Meyer, Greg Stephens</p><p>Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides dynamical access into the complex functioning of the human brain, detailing the hemodynamic activity of thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We ﬁnd that the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-deﬁned Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke’s area for verbal instructions, visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions, with the highest correlation (c ∼ 0.8) between the predicted and experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The interpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual basis upon which to build more sophisticated techniques for fMRI decoding and offers a window into cognitive function during dynamic, natural experience. 1</p><p>6 0.13592207 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Inferring_Elapsed_Time_from_Stochastic_Neural_Processes.html">103 nips-2007-Inferring Elapsed Time from Stochastic Neural Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Victoria Manfredi, Jim Kurose</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of adaptive sensor control in dynamic resourceconstrained sensor networks. We focus on a meteorological sensing network comprising radars that can perform sector scanning rather than always scanning 360◦ . We compare three sector scanning strategies. The sit-and-spin strategy always scans 360◦ . The limited lookahead strategy additionally uses the expected environmental state K decision epochs in the future, as predicted from Kalman ﬁlters, in its decision-making. The full lookahead strategy uses all expected future states by casting the problem as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to estimate the optimal scan strategy. We show that the main beneﬁts of using a lookahead strategy are when there are multiple meteorological phenomena in the environment, and when the maximum radius of any phenomenon is sufﬁciently smaller than the radius of the radars. We also show that there is a trade-off between the average quality with which a phenomenon is scanned and the number of decision epochs before which a phenomenon is rescanned. 1</p><p>4 0.50963223 <a title="59-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_Brain_States_from_fMRI_Data%3A_Incremental_Functional_Principal_Component_Regression.html">154 nips-2007-Predicting Brain States from fMRI Data: Incremental Functional Principal Component Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Misha Ahrens, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Many perceptual processes and neural computations, such as speech recognition, motor control and learning, depend on the ability to measure and mark the passage of time. However, the processes that make such temporal judgements possible are unknown. A number of different hypothetical mechanisms have been advanced, all of which depend on the known, temporally predictable evolution of a neural or psychological state, possibly through oscillations or the gradual decay of a memory trace. Alternatively, judgements of elapsed time might be based on observations of temporally structured, but stochastic processes. Such processes need not be speciﬁc to the sense of time; typical neural and sensory processes contain at least some statistical structure across a range of time scales. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of an estimator of elapsed time which is based on a simple family of stochastic process. 1</p><p>6 0.48365295 <a title="59-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas L. Roux, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Marc Joliveau, Balázs Kégl</p><p>Abstract: We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a ﬁxed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes, but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.</p><p>4 0.56242651 <a title="59-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Hippocampal_Contributions_to_Control%3A_The_Third_Way.html">100 nips-2007-Hippocampal Contributions to Control: The Third Way</a></p>
<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental studies have focused on the specialization of different neural structures for different types of instrumental behavior. Recent theoretical work has provided normative accounts for why there should be more than one control system, and how the output of different controllers can be integrated. Two particlar controllers have been identiﬁed, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis. 1</p><p>5 0.55964398 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Horizontal_Connections_in_a_Sparse_Coding_Model_of_Natural_Images.html">111 nips-2007-Learning Horizontal Connections in a Sparse Coding Model of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that adapting a dictionary of basis functions to the statistics of natural images so as to maximize sparsity in the coefﬁcients results in a set of dictionary elements whose spatial properties resemble those of V1 (primary visual cortex) receptive ﬁelds. However, the resulting sparse coefﬁcients still exhibit pronounced statistical dependencies, thus violating the independence assumption of the sparse coding model. Here, we propose a model that attempts to capture the dependencies among the basis function coefﬁcients by including a pairwise coupling term in the prior over the coefﬁcient activity states. When adapted to the statistics of natural images, the coupling terms learn a combination of facilitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring basis functions. These learned interactions may offer an explanation for the function of horizontal connections in V1 in terms of a prior over natural images.</p><p>6 0.55963409 <a title="59-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-The_rat_as_particle_filter.html">203 nips-2007-The rat as particle filter</a></p>

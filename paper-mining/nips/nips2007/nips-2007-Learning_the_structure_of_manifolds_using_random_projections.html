<p>Author: Chinmay Hegde, Michael Wakin, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for linear dimensionality reduction of manifold modeled data. First, we show that with a small number M of random projections of sample points in RN belonging to an unknown K-dimensional Euclidean manifold, the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the sample set can be estimated to high accuracy. Second, we rigorously prove that using only this set of random projections, we can estimate the structure of the underlying manifold. In both cases, the number of random projections required is linear in K and logarithmic in N , meaning that K < M ≪ N . To handle practical situations, we develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the smallest size of the projection space required to perform manifold learning. Our method is particularly relevant in distributed sensing systems and leads to signiﬁcant potential savings in data acquisition, storage and transmission costs.</p><p>3 0.18248264 <a title="116-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-A_learning_framework_for_nearest_neighbor_search.html">16 nips-2007-A learning framework for nearest neighbor search</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Gashler, Dan Ventura, Tony Martinez</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms have been recently developed for reducing dimensionality by projecting data onto an intrinsic non-linear manifold. Unfortunately, existing algorithms often lose signiﬁcant precision in this transformation. Manifold Sculpting is a new algorithm that iteratively reduces dimensionality by simulating surface tension in local neighborhoods. We present several experiments that show Manifold Sculpting yields more accurate results than existing algorithms with both generated and natural data-sets. Manifold Sculpting is also able to beneﬁt from both prior dimensionality reduction efforts. 1</p><p>5 0.11061894 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Omer Bobrowski, Ron Meir, Shy Shoham, Yonina Eldar</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly evident that organisms acting in uncertain dynamical environments often employ exact or approximate Bayesian statistical calculations in order to continuously estimate the environmental state, integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, form predictions and choose actions. What is less clear is how these putative computations are implemented by cortical neural networks. An additional level of complexity is introduced because these networks observe the world through spike trains received from primary sensory afferents, rather than directly. A recent line of research has described mechanisms by which such computations can be implemented using a network of neurons whose activity directly represents a probability distribution across the possible “world states”. Much of this work, however, uses various approximations, which severely restrict the domain of applicability of these implementations. Here we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process ﬁltering, and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using linear neural networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with several examples, and relate the required network properties to the statistical nature of the environment, thereby quantifying the compatibility of a given network with its environment. 1</p><p>6 0.10994788 <a title="116-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Subspace-Based_Face_Recognition_in_Analog_VLSI.html">188 nips-2007-Subspace-Based Face Recognition in Analog VLSI</a></p>

<p>Author: Anton Chechetka, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: We present the ﬁrst truly polynomial algorithm for PAC-learning the structure of bounded-treewidth junction trees – an attractive subclass of probabilistic graphical models that permits both the compact representation of probability distributions and efﬁcient exact inference. For a constant treewidth, our algorithm has polynomial time and sample complexity. If a junction tree with sufﬁciently strong intraclique dependencies exists, we provide strong theoretical guarantees in terms of KL divergence of the result from the true distribution. We also present a lazy extension of our approach that leads to very signiﬁcant speed ups in practice, and demonstrate the viability of our method empirically, on several real world datasets. One of our key new theoretical insights is a method for bounding the conditional mutual information of arbitrarily large sets of variables with only polynomially many mutual information computations on ﬁxed-size subsets of variables, if the underlying distribution can be approximated by a bounded-treewidth junction tree. 1</p><p>6 0.48458672 <a title="116-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Subspace-Based_Face_Recognition_in_Analog_VLSI.html">188 nips-2007-Subspace-Based Face Recognition in Analog VLSI</a></p>

<p>Author: Gertjan Burghouts, Arnold Smeulders, Jan-mark Geusebroek</p><p>Abstract: Assessing similarity between features is a key step in object recognition and scene categorization tasks. We argue that knowledge on the distribution of distances generated by similarity functions is crucial in deciding whether features are similar or not. Intuitively one would expect that similarities between features could arise from any distribution. In this paper, we will derive the contrary, and report the theoretical result that Lp -norms –a class of commonly applied distance metrics– from one feature vector to other vectors are Weibull-distributed if the feature values are correlated and non-identically distributed. Besides these assumptions being realistic for images, we experimentally show them to hold for various popular feature extraction algorithms, for a diverse range of images. This fundamental insight opens new directions in the assessment of feature similarity, with projected improvements in object and scene recognition algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87476784 <a title="116-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_structure_of_manifolds_using_random_projections.html">116 nips-2007-Learning the structure of manifolds using random projections</a></p>

This framework combines the advantages of the classical comparative method with the robustness of corpus-based probabilistic models. We use this framework to explore the consequences of two different schemes for deﬁning probabilistic models of phonological change, evaluating these schemes by reconstructing ancient word forms of Romance languages. The result is an efﬁcient inference procedure for automatically inferring ancient word forms from modern languages, which can be generalized to support inferences about linguistic phylogenies. 1</p><p>4 0.82605976 <a title="116-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-DIFFRAC%3A_a_discriminative_and_flexible_framework_for_clustering.html">65 nips-2007-DIFFRAC: a discriminative and flexible framework for clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>5 0.82441652 <a title="116-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-A_learning_framework_for_nearest_neighbor_search.html">16 nips-2007-A learning framework for nearest neighbor search</a></p>

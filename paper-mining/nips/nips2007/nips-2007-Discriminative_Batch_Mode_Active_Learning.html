<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, i.e. learning from both labeled and unlabeled data has received signiﬁcant attention in the machine learning literature in recent years. Still our understanding of the theoretical foundations of the usefulness of unlabeled data remains somewhat limited. The simplest and the best understood situation is when the data is described by an identiﬁable mixture model, and where each class comes from a pure component. This natural setup and its implications ware analyzed in [11, 5]. One important result was that in certain regimes, labeled data becomes exponentially more valuable than unlabeled data. However, in most realistic situations, one would not expect that the data comes from a parametric mixture distribution with identiﬁable components. There have been recent efforts to analyze the non-parametric situation, for example, “cluster” and “manifold” assumptions have been suggested as a basis for analysis. Still, a satisfactory and fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nonparametric problem, similar to that in [11, 5] has not yet been developed. In this paper we investigate an intermediate situation, when the data comes from a probability distribution, which can be modeled, but not perfectly, by an identiﬁable mixture distribution. This seems applicable to many situation, when, for example, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model the data. the contribution of this paper is an analysis of the role of labeled and unlabeled data depending on the amount of imperfection in the model.</p><p>3 0.19005311 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Regularized_Boost_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">166 nips-2007-Regularized Boost for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shihai Wang</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised inductive learning concerns how to learn a decision rule from a data set containing both labeled and unlabeled data. Several boosting algorithms have been extended to semi-supervised learning with various strategies. To our knowledge, however, none of them takes local smoothness constraints among data into account during ensemble learning. In this paper, we introduce a local smoothness regularizer to semi-supervised boosting algorithms based on the universal optimization framework of margin cost functionals. Our regularizer is applicable to existing semi-supervised boosting algorithms to improve their generalization and speed up their training. Comparative results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our local smoothness regularizer. We discuss relevant issues and relate our regularizer to previous work. 1</p><p>4 0.18508925 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Regression.html">186 nips-2007-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised methods use unlabeled data in addition to labeled data to construct predictors. While existing semi-supervised methods have shown some promising empirical performance, their development has been based largely based on heuristics. In this paper we study semi-supervised learning from the viewpoint of minimax theory. Our ﬁrst result shows that some common methods based on regularization using graph Laplacians do not lead to faster minimax rates of convergence. Thus, the estimators that use the unlabeled data do not have smaller risk than the estimators that use only labeled data. We then develop several new approaches that provably lead to improved performance. The statistical tools of minimax analysis are thus used to offer some new perspective on the problem of semi-supervised learning. 1</p><p>5 0.16835484 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes.html">212 nips-2007-Using Deep Belief Nets to Learn Covariance Kernels for Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We show how to use unlabeled data and a deep belief net (DBN) to learn a good covariance kernel for a Gaussian process. We ﬁrst learn a deep generative model of the unlabeled data using the fast, greedy algorithm introduced by [7]. If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classiﬁcation can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively ﬁne-tune the covariance kernel.</p><p>6 0.1680087 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Multiple-Instance_Active_Learning.html">136 nips-2007-Multiple-Instance Active Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Burr Settles, Mark Craven, Soumya Ray</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for active learning in the multiple-instance (MI) setting. In an MI learning problem, instances are naturally organized into bags and it is the bags, instead of individual instances, that are labeled for training. MI learners assume that every instance in a bag labeled negative is actually negative, whereas at least one instance in a bag labeled positive is actually positive. We consider the particular case in which an MI learner is allowed to selectively query unlabeled instances from positive bags. This approach is well motivated in domains in which it is inexpensive to acquire bag labels and possible, but expensive, to acquire instance labels. We describe a method for learning from labels at mixed levels of granularity, and introduce two active query selection strategies motivated by the MI setting. Our experiments show that learning from instance labels can signiﬁcantly improve performance of a basic MI learning algorithm in two multiple-instance domains: content-based image retrieval and text classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>4 0.66285384 <a title="69-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Regression.html">186 nips-2007-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Maryam Mahdaviani, Tanzeem Choudhury</p><p>Abstract: We present a new and efﬁcient semi-supervised training method for parameter estimation and feature selection in conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs). In real-world applications such as activity recognition, unlabeled sensor traces are relatively easy to obtain whereas labeled examples are expensive and tedious to collect. Furthermore, the ability to automatically select a small subset of discriminatory features from a large pool can be advantageous in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the semi-supervised virtual evidence boosting (sVEB) algorithm for training CRFs – a semi-supervised extension to the recently developed virtual evidence boosting (VEB) method for feature selection and parameter learning. The objective function of sVEB combines the unlabeled conditional entropy with labeled conditional pseudo-likelihood. It reduces the overall system cost as well as the human labeling cost required during training, which are both important considerations in building real-world inference systems. Experiments on synthetic data and real activity traces collected from wearable sensors, illustrate that sVEB beneﬁts from both the use of unlabeled data and automatic feature selection, and outperforms other semi-supervised approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.61906064 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Regularized_Boost_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">166 nips-2007-Regularized Boost for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Harald Steck, Balaji Krishnapuram, Cary Dehing-oberije, Philippe Lambin, Vikas C. Raykar</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that classical survival analysis involving censored data can naturally be cast as a ranking problem. The concordance index (CI), which quantiﬁes the quality of rankings, is the standard performance measure for model assessment in survival analysis. In contrast, the standard approach to learning the popular proportional hazard (PH) model is based on Cox’s partial likelihood. We devise two bounds on CI–one of which emerges directly from the properties of PH models–and optimize them directly. Our experimental results suggest that all three methods perform about equally well, with our new approach giving slightly better results. We also explain why a method designed to maximize the Cox’s partial likelihood also ends up (approximately) maximizing the CI. 1</p><p>2 0.86835951 <a title="69-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Collective_Inference_on_Markov_Models_for_Modeling_Bird_Migration.html">48 nips-2007-Collective Inference on Markov Models for Modeling Bird Migration</a></p>
<p>Author: M.a. S. Elmohamed, Dexter Kozen, Daniel R. Sheldon</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a family of inference problems on Markov models, where many sample paths are drawn from a Markov chain and partial information is revealed to an observer who attempts to reconstruct the sample paths. We present algorithms and hardness results for several variants of this problem which arise by revealing different information to the observer and imposing different requirements for the reconstruction of sample paths. Our algorithms are analogous to the classical Viterbi algorithm for Hidden Markov Models, which ﬁnds the single most probable sample path given a sequence of observations. Our work is motivated by an important application in ecology: inferring bird migration paths from a large database of observations. 1</p><p>3 0.81908005 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Random_Projections_for_Manifold_Learning.html">161 nips-2007-Random Projections for Manifold Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chinmay Hegde, Michael Wakin, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for linear dimensionality reduction of manifold modeled data. First, we show that with a small number M of random projections of sample points in RN belonging to an unknown K-dimensional Euclidean manifold, the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the sample set can be estimated to high accuracy. Second, we rigorously prove that using only this set of random projections, we can estimate the structure of the underlying manifold. In both cases, the number of random projections required is linear in K and logarithmic in N , meaning that K < M ≪ N . To handle practical situations, we develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the smallest size of the projection space required to perform manifold learning. Our method is particularly relevant in distributed sensing systems and leads to signiﬁcant potential savings in data acquisition, storage and transmission costs.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.79622757 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Batch_Mode_Active_Learning.html">69 nips-2007-Discriminative Batch Mode Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classiﬁer. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classiﬁcation performance of the target classiﬁer, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.71427977 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Iterative_Non-linear_Dimensionality_Reduction_with_Manifold_Sculpting.html">107 nips-2007-Iterative Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction with Manifold Sculpting</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Gashler, Dan Ventura, Tony Martinez</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms have been recently developed for reducing dimensionality by projecting data onto an intrinsic non-linear manifold. Unfortunately, existing algorithms often lose signiﬁcant precision in this transformation. Manifold Sculpting is a new algorithm that iteratively reduces dimensionality by simulating surface tension in local neighborhoods. We present several experiments that show Manifold Sculpting yields more accurate results than existing algorithms with both generated and natural data-sets. Manifold Sculpting is also able to beneﬁt from both prior dimensionality reduction efforts. 1</p><p>6 0.71280819 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-The_Value_of_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples_when_the_Model_is_Imperfect.html">201 nips-2007-The Value of Labeled and Unlabeled Examples when the Model is Imperfect</a></p>

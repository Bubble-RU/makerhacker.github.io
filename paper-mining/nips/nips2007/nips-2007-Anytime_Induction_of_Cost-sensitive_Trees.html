<p>Author: Vittorio Ferrari, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic generative model of visual attributes, together with an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as ‘red’, ‘striped’, or ‘spotted’. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images.</p><p>3 0.06925264 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-DIFFRAC%3A_a_discriminative_and_flexible_framework_for_clustering.html">65 nips-2007-DIFFRAC: a discriminative and flexible framework for clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>4 0.066892691 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Regularized_Boost_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">166 nips-2007-Regularized Boost for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephane Ross, Joelle Pineau, Brahim Chaib-draa</p><p>Abstract: Planning in partially observable environments remains a challenging problem, despite signiﬁcant recent advances in ofﬂine approximation techniques. A few online methods have also been proposed recently, and proven to be remarkably scalable, but without the theoretical guarantees of their ofﬂine counterparts. Thus it seems natural to try to unify ofﬂine and online techniques, preserving the theoretical properties of the former, and exploiting the scalability of the latter. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees on an anytime algorithm for POMDPs which aims to reduce the error made by approximate ofﬂine value iteration algorithms through the use of an efﬁcient online searching procedure. The algorithm uses search heuristics based on an error analysis of lookahead search, to guide the online search towards reachable beliefs with the most potential to reduce error. We provide a general theorem showing that these search heuristics are admissible, and lead to complete and ǫ-optimal algorithms. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest theoretical result available for online POMDP solution methods. We also provide empirical evidence showing that our approach is also practical, and can ﬁnd (provably) near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. 1</p><p>6 0.062587537 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Random_Sampling_of_States_in_Dynamic_Programming.html">162 nips-2007-Random Sampling of States in Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Brendan Mcmahan, Carlos Guestrin, Anupam Gupta</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, one has to actively select among a set of expensive observations before making an informed decision. Often, we want to select observations which perform well when evaluated with an objective function chosen by an adversary. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the Submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efﬁcient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for the case where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efﬁcient algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees. For robust experimental design, our algorithm performs favorably compared to SDP-based algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.47941813 <a title="27-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-Active_Preference_Learning_with_Discrete_Choice_Data.html">19 nips-2007-Active Preference Learning with Discrete Choice Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Brochu Eric, Nando D. Freitas, Abhijeet Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active learning algorithm that learns a continuous valuation model from discrete preferences. The algorithm automatically decides what items are best presented to an individual in order to ﬁnd the item that they value highly in as few trials as possible, and exploits quirks of human psychology to minimize time and cognitive burden. To do this, our algorithm maximizes the expected improvement at each query without accurately modelling the entire valuation surface, which would be needlessly expensive. The problem is particularly difﬁcult because the space of choices is inﬁnite. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to related active learning methods. We also embed the algorithm within a decision making tool for assisting digital artists in rendering materials. The tool ﬁnds the best parameters while minimizing the number of queries. 1</p><p>4 0.47724301 <a title="27-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Embedded_Subgraph_Algorithms_using_Walk-Sum_Analysis.html">20 nips-2007-Adaptive Embedded Subgraph Algorithms using Walk-Sum Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Venkat Chandrasekaran, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation problem in Gaussian graphical models with arbitrary structure. We analyze the Embedded Trees algorithm, which solves a sequence of problems on tractable subgraphs thereby leading to the solution of the estimation problem on an intractable graph. Our analysis is based on the recently developed walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian estimation. We show that non-stationary iterations of the Embedded Trees algorithm using any sequence of subgraphs converge in walk-summable models. Based on walk-sum calculations, we develop adaptive methods that optimize the choice of subgraphs used at each iteration with a view to achieving maximum reduction in error. These adaptive procedures provide a signiﬁcant speedup in convergence over stationary iterative methods, and also appear to converge in a larger class of models. 1</p><p>5 0.4612937 <a title="27-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-A_learning_framework_for_nearest_neighbor_search.html">16 nips-2007-A learning framework for nearest neighbor search</a></p>
<p>Author: Lawrence Cayton, Sanjoy Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: Can we leverage learning techniques to build a fast nearest-neighbor (ANN) retrieval data structure? We present a general learning framework for the NN problem in which sample queries are used to learn the parameters of a data structure that minimize the retrieval time and/or the miss rate. We explore the potential of this novel framework through two popular NN data structures: KD-trees and the rectilinear structures employed by locality sensitive hashing. We derive a generalization theory for these data structure classes and present simple learning algorithms for both. Experimental results reveal that learning often improves on the already strong performance of these data structures. 1</p><p>6 0.4488512 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Feature_Selection_Methods_for_Improving_Protein_Structure_Prediction_with_Rosetta.html">89 nips-2007-Feature Selection Methods for Improving Protein Structure Prediction with Rosetta</a></p>

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Kato, Hisashi Kashima, Masashi Sugiyama, Kiyoshi Asai</p><p>Abstract: When we have several related tasks, solving them simultaneously is shown to be more effective than solving them individually. This approach is called multi-task learning (MTL) and has been studied extensively. Existing approaches to MTL often treat all the tasks as uniformly related to each other and the relatedness of the tasks is controlled globally. For this reason, the existing methods can lead to undesired solutions when some tasks are not highly related to each other, and some pairs of related tasks can have signiﬁcantly different solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel MTL algorithm that can overcome these problems. Our method makes use of a task network, which describes the relation structure among tasks. This allows us to deal with intricate relation structures in a systematic way. Furthermore, we control the relatedness of the tasks locally, so all pairs of related tasks are guaranteed to have similar solutions. We apply the above idea to support vector machines (SVMs) and show that the optimization problem can be cast as a second order cone program, which is convex and can be solved efﬁciently. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations with protein super-family classiﬁcation and ordinal regression problems.</p><p>5 0.5634287 <a title="27-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Convex_Relaxation_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">76 nips-2007-Efficient Convex Relaxation for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Support Vector Machine transduction, which involves a combinatorial problem with exponential computational complexity in the number of unlabeled examples. Although several studies are devoted to Transductive SVM, they suffer either from the high computation complexity or from the solutions of local optimum. To address this problem, we propose solving Transductive SVM via a convex relaxation, which converts the NP-hard problem to a semi-deﬁnite programming. Compared with the other SDP relaxation for Transductive SVM, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efﬁcient with the number of free parameters reduced from O(n2 ) to O(n) where n is the number of examples. Empirical study with several benchmark data sets shows the promising performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art implementations of Transductive SVM. 1</p><p>6 0.5627436 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Sequential_Hypothesis_Testing_under_Stochastic_Deadlines.html">176 nips-2007-Sequential Hypothesis Testing under Stochastic Deadlines</a></p>

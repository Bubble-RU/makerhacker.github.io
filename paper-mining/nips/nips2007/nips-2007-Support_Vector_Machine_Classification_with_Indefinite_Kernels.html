<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>3 0.24290678 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Kernels_on_Attributed_Pointsets_with_Applications.html">109 nips-2007-Kernels on Attributed Pointsets with Applications</a></p>

We show that no non-trivial positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels exist which are radial and dilation invariant, only conditionally positive deﬁnite (c.p.d.) ones. Accordingly, we discuss the c.p.d. case and provide some novel analysis, including an elementary derivation of a c.p.d. representer theorem. On the practical side, we give a support vector machine (s.v.m.) algorithm for arbitrary c.p.d. kernels. For the thinplate kernel this leads to a classiﬁer with only one parameter (the amount of regularisation), which we demonstrate to be as effective as an s.v.m. with the Gaussian kernel, even though the Gaussian involves a second parameter (the length scale). 1</p><p>6 0.20197023 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Monotonic_Transformations_for_Classification.html">112 nips-2007-Learning Monotonic Transformations for Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Le Song, Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Maximum variance unfolding (MVU) is an effective heuristic for dimensionality reduction. It produces a low-dimensional representation of the data by maximizing the variance of their embeddings while preserving the local distances of the original data. We show that MVU also optimizes a statistical dependence measure which aims to retain the identity of individual observations under the distancepreserving constraints. This general view allows us to design “colored” variants of MVU, which produce low-dimensional representations for a given task, e.g. subject to class labels or other side information. 1</p><p>6 0.6940437 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Monotonic_Transformations_for_Classification.html">112 nips-2007-Learning Monotonic Transformations for Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Cha Zhang, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: Cascade detectors have been shown to operate extremely rapidly, with high accuracy, and have important applications such as face detection. Driven by this success, cascade learning has been an area of active research in recent years. Nevertheless, there are still challenging technical problems during the training process of cascade detectors. In particular, determining the optimal target detection rate for each stage of the cascade remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we propose the multiple instance pruning (MIP) algorithm for soft cascades. This algorithm computes a set of thresholds which aggressively terminate computation with no reduction in detection rate or increase in false positive rate on the training dataset. The algorithm is based on two key insights: i) examples that are destined to be rejected by the complete classiﬁer can be safely pruned early; ii) face detection is a multiple instance learning problem. The MIP process is fully automatic and requires no assumptions of probability distributions, statistical independence, or ad hoc intermediate rejection targets. Experimental results on the MIT+CMU dataset demonstrate signiﬁcant performance advantages. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86324161 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Support_Vector_Machine_Classification_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">190 nips-2007-Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We show that under suitable assumptions (primarily linearization) a simple and perspicuous online learning rule for Information Bottleneck optimization with spiking neurons can be derived. This rule performs on common benchmark tasks as well as a rather complex rule that has previously been proposed [1]. Furthermore, the transparency of this new learning rule makes a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties feasible. A variation of this learning rule (with sign changes) provides a theoretically founded method for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with spiking neurons. By applying this rule to an ensemble of neurons, different principal components of the input can be extracted. In addition, it is possible to preferentially extract those principal components from incoming signals X that are related or are not related to some additional target signal YT . In a biological interpretation, this target signal YT (also called relevance variable) could represent proprioceptive feedback, input from other sensory modalities, or top-down signals. 1</p><p>4 0.72552335 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Kernels_on_Attributed_Pointsets_with_Applications.html">109 nips-2007-Kernels on Attributed Pointsets with Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Frazier, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Most models of decision-making in neuroscience assume an inﬁnite horizon, which yields an optimal solution that integrates evidence up to a ﬁxed decision threshold; however, under most experimental as well as naturalistic behavioral settings, the decision has to be made before some ﬁnite deadline, which is often experienced as a stochastic quantity, either due to variable external constraints or internal timing uncertainty. In this work, we formulate this problem as sequential hypothesis testing under a stochastic horizon. We use dynamic programming tools to show that, for a large class of deadline distributions, the Bayes-optimal solution requires integrating evidence up to a threshold that declines monotonically over time. We use numerical simulations to illustrate the optimal policy in the special cases of a ﬁxed deadline and one that is drawn from a gamma distribution.</p><p>6 0.69769597 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_human_gaze_using_low-level_saliency_combined_with_face_detection.html">155 nips-2007-Predicting human gaze using low-level saliency combined with face detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule).

<p>Author: Sebastian Gerwinn, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Generalized linear models are the most commonly used tools to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of such models. Using the expectation propagation algorithm, we are able to approximate the full posterior distribution over all weights. In addition, we use a Laplacian prior to favor sparse solutions. Therefore, stimulus features that do not critically inﬂuence neural activity will be assigned zero weights and thus be effectively excluded by the model. This feature selection mechanism facilitates both the interpretation of the neuron model as well as its predictive abilities. The posterior distribution can be used to obtain conﬁdence intervals which makes it possible to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the solution. In neural data analysis, the available amount of experimental measurements is often limited whereas the parameter space is large. In such a situation, both regularization by a sparsity prior and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters are essential. We apply our method to multi-electrode recordings of retinal ganglion cells and use our uncertainty estimate to test the statistical signiﬁcance of functional couplings between neurons. Furthermore we used the sparsity of the Laplace prior to select those ﬁlters from a spike-triggered covariance analysis that are most informative about the neural response. 1</p><p>4 0.25408301 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>5 0.22774263 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>

However the potential and limitations of this learning rule could so far only be tested through computer simulations. This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allow us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will be able to achieve a desired learning effect.

<p>Author: Devarajan Sridharan, Brian Percival, John Arthur, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neurobiologically plausible model to implement dynamic routing using the concept of neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The model has a three-tier architecture: a raw input tier, a routing control tier, and an invariant output tier. The correct mapping between input and output tiers is realized by an appropriate alignment of the phases of their respective background oscillations by the routing control units. We present an example architecture, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, that is able to achieve circular-shift invariance. A simple extension to our model can accomplish circular-shift dynamic routing with only O(N ) connections, compared to O(N 2 ) connections required by traditional models. 1 Dynamic Routing Circuit Models for Circular-Shift Invariance Dynamic routing circuit models are among the most prominent neural models for invariant recognition [1] (also see [2] for review). These models implement shift invariance by dynamically changing spatial connectivity to transform an object to a standard position or orientation. The connectivity between the raw input and invariant output layers is controlled by routing units, which turn certain subsets of connections on or off (Figure 1A). An important feature of this model is the explicit representation of what and where information in the main network and the routing units, respectively; the routing units use the where information to create invariant representations. Traditional solutions for shift invariance are neurobiologically implausible for at least two reasons. First, there are too many synaptic connections: for N input neurons, N output neurons and N possible input-output mappings, the network requires O(N 2 ) connections in the routing layer— between each of the N routing units and each set of N connections that that routing unit gates (Figure 1A). Second, these connections must be extremely precise: each routing unit must activate an inputoutput mapping (N individual connections) corresponding to the desired shift (as highlighted in Figure 1A). Other approaches that have been proposed, including invariant feature networks [3,4], also suffer from signiﬁcant drawbacks, such as the inability to explicitly represent where information [2]. It remains an open question how biology could achieve shift invariance without proﬂigate and precise connections. In this article, we propose a simple solution for shift invariance for quantities that are circular or periodic in nature—circular-shift invariance (CSI)—orientation invariance in vision and key invariance in music. The visual system may create orientation-invariant representations to aid recognition under conditions of object rotation or head-tilt [5,6]; a similar mechanism could be employed by the auditory system to create key-invariant representations under conditions where the same melody 1 Figure 1: Dynamic routing. A In traditional dynamic routing, connections from the (raw) input layer to the (invariant) output layer are gated by routing units. For instance, the mapping from A to 5, B to 6, . . . , F to 4 is achieved by turning on the highlighted routing unit. B In time-division multiplexing (TDM), the encoder samples input channels periodically (using a rotating switch) while the decoder sends each sample to the appropriate output channel (based on its time bin). TDM can be extended to achieve a circular-shift transformation by altering the angle between encoder and decoder switches (θ), thereby creating a rotated mapping between input and output channels (adapted from [7]). is played in different keys. Similar to orientation, which is a periodic quantity, musical notes one octave apart sound alike, a phenomenon known as octave equivalence [8]. Thus, the problems of key invariance and orientation invariance admit similar solutions. Deriving inspiration from time-division multiplexing (TDM), we propose a neural network for CSI that uses phase to encode and decode information. We modulate the temporal window of communication between (raw) input and (invariant) output neurons to achieve the appropriate input–output mapping. Extending TDM, any particular circular-shift transformation can be accomplished by changing the relative angle, θ, between the rotating switches of the encoder (that encodes the raw input in time) and decoder (that decodes the invariant output in time) (Figure 1B). This obviates the need to hardwire routing control units that speciﬁcally modulate the strength of each possible inputoutput connection, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the complexity inherent in the traditional dynamic routing solution. Similarly, a remapping between the input and output neurons can be achieved by introducing a relative phase-shift in their background oscillations. 2 Dynamic Routing through Neuronal Coherence To modulate the temporal window of communication, the model uses a ring of neurons (the oscillation ring) to select the pool of neurons (in the projection ring) that encode or decode information at a particular time (Figure 2A). Each projection pool encodes a speciﬁc value of the feature (for example, one of twelve musical notes). Upon activation by external input, each pool is active only when background inhibition generated by the oscillation ring (outer ring of neurons) is at a minimum. In addition to exciting 12 inhibitory interneurons in the projection ring, each oscillation ring neuron excites its nearest 18 neighbors in the clockwise direction around the oscillation ring. As a result, a wave of inhibition travels around the projection ring that allows only one pool to be excitable at any point in time. These neurons become excitable at roughly the same time (numbered sectors, inner ring) by virtue of recurrent excitatory intra-pool connections. Decoding is accomplished by a second tier of rings (Figure 2B). The projection ring of the ﬁrst (input) tier connects all-to-all to the projection ring of the second (output) tier. The two oscillation rings create a window of excitability for the pools of neurons in their respective projection rings. Hence, the most effective communication occurs between input and output pools that become excitable at the same time (i.e. are oscillating in phase with one another [9]). The CSI problem is solved by introducing a phase-shift between the input and output tiers. If they are exactly in phase, then an input pool is simply mapped to the output pool directly above it. If their 2 Figure 2: Double-Ring Network for Encoding and Decoding. A The projection (inner) ring is divided into (numbered) pools. The oscillation (outer) ring modulates sub-threshold activity (waveforms) of the projection ring by exciting (black distribution) inhibitory neurons that inhibit neighboring projection neurons. A wave of activity travels around the oscillation ring due to asymmetric excitatory connections, creating a corresponding wave of inhibitory activity in the projection ring, such that only one pool of projection neurons is excitable (spikes) at a given time. B Two instances of the double-ring structure from A. The input projection ring connects all-to-all to the output projection ring (dashed lines). Because each input pool will spike only during a distinct time bin, and each output pool is excitable only in a certain time bin, communication occurs between input and output pools that are oscillating in phase with each other. Appropriate phase offset between input and output oscillation rings realizes the desired circular shift (input pool H to output pool 1, solid arrow). C Interactions among pools highlighted in B. phases are different, the input is dynamically routed to an appropriate circularly shifted position in the output tier. Such changes in phase are analogous to adjusting the angle of the rotating switch at either the encoder or the decoder in TDM (see Figure 1B). There is some evidence that neural systems could employ phase relationships of subthreshold oscillations to selectively target neural populations [9-11]. 3 Implementation in Silicon We implemented this solution to CSI on a neuromorphic silicon chip [12]. The neuromorphic chip has neurons whose properties resemble that of biological neurons; these neurons even have intrinsic differences, thereby mimicking heterogeneity in real neurobiological systems. The chip uses a conductance-based spiking model for both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons project to nearby excitatory and inhibitory neurons via a diffusor network that determines the spread of inhibition. A lookup table of excitatory synaptic connectivity is stored in a separate randomaccess memory (RAM) chip. Spikes occurring on-chip are converted to a neuron address, mapped to synapses (if any) via the lookup table, and routed to the targeted on-chip synapse. A universal serial bus (USB) interface chip communicates spikes to and from a computer, for external input and 3 Figure 3: Traveling-wave activity in the oscillation ring. A Population activity (5ms bins) of a pool of eighteen (adjacent) oscillation neurons. B Increasing the strength of feedforward excitation led to increasing frequencies of periodic ﬁring in the θ and α range (1-10 Hz). Strength of excitation is the amplitude change in post-synaptic conductance due to a single pre-synaptic spike (measured relative to minimum amplitude used). data analysis, respectively. Simulations on the chip occur in real-time, making it an attractive option for implementing the model. We conﬁgured the following parameters: • Magnitude of a potassium M-current: increasing this current’s magnitude increased the post-spike repolarization time of the membrane potential, thereby constraining spiking to a single time bin per cycle. • The strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses: a correct balance had to be established between excitation and inhibition to make only a small subset of neurons in the projection rings ﬁre at a time—too much excitation led to widespread ﬁring and too much inhibition led to neurons that were entirely silent or ﬁred sporadically. • The space constant of inhibitory spread: increasing the spread was effective in preventing runaway excitation, which could occur due to the recurrent excitatory connections. We were able to create a stable traveling wave of background activity within the oscillation ring. We transiently stimulated a small subset of the neurons, which initiated a wave of activity that propagated in a stable manner around the ring after the transient external stimulation had ceased (Figure 3A). The network frequency determined from a Fourier transform of the network activity smoothed with a non-causal Gaussian kernel (FDHM = 80ms) was 7.4Hz. The frequency varied with the strength of the neurons’ excitatory connections (Figure 3B), measured as the amplitude of the step increase in membrane conductivity due to the arrival of a pre-synaptic spike. Over much of the range of the synaptic strengths tested, we observed stable oscillations in the θ and α bands (1-10Hz); the frequency appeared to increase logarithmically with synaptic strength. 4 Phase-based Encoding and Decoding In order to assess the best-case performance of the model, the background activity in the input and output projection rings was derived from the input oscillation ring. Their spikes were delivered to the appropriately circularly-shifted output oscillation neurons. The asymmetric feedforward connections were disabled in the output oscillation ring. For instance, in order to achieve a circular shift by k pools (i.e. mapping input projection pool 1 to output projection pool k + 1, input pool 2 to output pool k + 2, and so on), activity from the input oscillation neurons closest to input pool 1 was fed into the output oscillation neurons closest to output pool k. By providing the appropriate phase difference between input and output oscillation, we were able to assess the performance of the model under ideal conditions. In the Discussion section, we discuss a biologically plausible mechanism to control the relative phases. 4 Figure 4: Phase-based encoding. Rasters indicating activity of projection pools in 1ms bins, and mean phase of ﬁring (×’s) for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time). The abscissa shows ﬁring time normalized by the period of oscillation (which may be converted to ﬁring phase by multiplication by 2π). Under constant input to the input projection ring, the input pools ﬁre approximately in sequence. Two cycles of pool activity normalized by maximum ﬁring rate for each pool are shown in left inset (for clarity, pools 1-6 are shown in the top panel and pools 7-12 are shown separately in the bottom panel); phase of background inhibition of pool 4 is shown (below) for reference. Phase-aligned average1 of activity (right inset) showed that the ﬁring times were relatively tight and uniform across pools: a standard deviation of 0.0945 periods, or equivalently, a spread of 1.135 pools at any instant of time. We veriﬁed that the input projection pools ﬁred in a phase-shifted fashion relative to one another, a property critical for accurate encoding (see Figure 2). We stimulated all pools in the input projection ring simultaneously while the input oscillation ring provided a periodic wave of background inhibition. The mean phase of ﬁring for each pool (relative to arbitrary zero time) increased nearly linearly with pool number, thereby providing evidence for accurate, phase-based encoding (Figure 4). The ﬁring times of all pools are shown for two cycles of background oscillatory activity (Figure 4 left inset). A phase-aligned average1 showed that the timing was relatively tight (standard deviation 1.135 pools) and uniform across pools of neurons (Figure 4 right inset). We then characterized the system’s ability to correctly decode this encoding under a given circular shift. The shift was set to seven pools, mapping input pool 1 to output pool 8, and so on. Each input pool was stimulated in turn. We expected to see only the appropriately shifted output pool become highly active. In fact, not only was this pool active, but other pools around it were also active, though to a lesser extent (Figure 5A). Thus, the phase-encoded input was decoded successfully, and circularly shifted, except that the output units were broadly tuned. To quantify the overall precision of encoding and decoding, we constructed an input-locked average of the tuning curves (Figure 5B): the curves were circularly shifted to the left by an amount corresponding to the stimulated input pool number, and the raw pool ﬁring rates were averaged. If the phase-based encoding and decoding were perfect, the peak should occur at a shift of 7 pools. 1 The phase-aligned average was constructed by shifting the pool-activity curves by the (# of the pool) × 1 ( 12 of the period) to align activity across pools, which was then averaged. 5 Figure 5: Decoding phase-encoded input. A In order to assess decoding performance under a given circular shift (here 7 pools) each input pool was stimulated in turn and activity in each output pool was recorded and averaged over 500ms. The pool’s response, normalized by its maximum ﬁring rate, is plotted for each stimulated input pool (arrows pointing to curves, color code as in Figure 4). Each input pool stimulation trial consistently resulted in peak activity in the appropriate output pool; however, adjacent pools were also active, but to a lesser extent, resulting in a broad tuning curve. B The best-ﬁt Gaussian (dot-dashed grey curve, σ = 2.30 pools) to the input-locked average of the raw pool ﬁring rates (see text for details) revealed a maximum between a shift of 7 and 8 pools (inverted grey triangle; expected peak at a shift of 7 pools). Indeed, the highest (average) ﬁring rate corresponded to a shift of 7 pools. However, the activity corresponding to a shift of 8 pools was nearly equal to that of 7 pools, and the best ﬁtting Gaussian curve to the activity histogram (grey dot-dashed line) peaked at a point between pools 7 and 8 (inverted grey triangle). The standard deviation (σ) was 2.30 pools, versus the expected ideal σ of 1.60, which corresponds to the encoding distribution (σ = 1.135 pools) convolved with itself. 5 Discussion We have demonstrated a biologically plausible mechanism for the dynamic routing of information in time that obviates the need for precise gating of connections. This mechanism requires that a wave of activity propagate around pools of neurons arranged in a ring. While previous work has described traveling waves in a ring of neurons [13], and a double ring architecture (for determining head-direction) [14], our work combines these two features (twin rings with phase-shifted traveling waves) to achieve dynamic routing. These features of the model are found in the cortex: Bonhoeffer and Grinwald [15] describe iso-orientation columns in the cat visual cortex that are arranged in ring-like pinwheel patterns, with orientation tuning changing gradually around the pinwheel center. Moreover, Rubino et al. [16] have shown that coherent oscillations can propagate as waves across the cortical surface in the motor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys performing a delayed reaching task. Our solution for CSI is also applicable to music perception. In the Western twelve-tone, equaltemperament tuning system (12-tone scale), each octave is divided into twelve logarithmicallyspaced notes. Human observers are known to construct mental representations for raw notes that are invariant of the (perceived) key of the music: a note of C heard in the key of C-Major is perceptually equivalent to the note C# heard in the key of C#-Major [8,17]. In previous dynamic routing models of key invariance, the tonic—the ﬁrst note of the key (e.g., C is the tonic of C-Major)— supplies the equivalent where information used by routing units that gate precise connections to map the raw note into a key-invariant output representation [17]. To achieve key invariance in our model, the bottom tier encodes raw note information while the top tier decodes key-invariant notes (Figure 6). The middle tier receives the tonic information and aligns the phase of the ﬁrst output pool (whose invariant representation corresponds to the tonic) with the appropriate input pool (whose raw note representation corresponds to the tonic of the perceived key). 6 Figure 6: Phase-based dynamic routing to achieve key-invariance. The input (bottom) tier encodes raw note information, and the output (top) tier decodes key-invariant information. The routing (middle) tier sets the phase of the background wave activity in the input and output oscillation rings (dashed arrows) such that the ﬁrst output pool is in phase with the input pool representing the note corresponding to the tonic. On the left, where G is the tonic, input pool G, output pool 1, and the routing tier are in phase with one another (black clocks), while input pool C and output pool 6 are in phase with one another (grey clocks). Thus, the raw note input, G, activates the invariant output 1, which corresponds to the perceived tonic invariant representation (heavy solid arrows). On the right, the same raw input note, G, is active, but the key is different and A is now the active tonic; thus the raw input, G, is now mapped to output pool 11. The tonic information is supplied to a speciﬁc pool in the routing ring according to the perceived key. This pool projects directly down to the input pool corresponding to the tonic. This ensures that the current tonic’s input pool is excitable in the same time bin as the ﬁrst output pool. Each of the remaining raw input notes of the octave is mapped by time binning to the corresponding key-invariant representation in the output tier, as the phases of input pools are all shifted by the same amount. Supporting evidence for phase-based encoding of note information comes from MEG recordings in humans: the phase of the MEG signal (predominantly over right hemispheric sensor locations) tracks the note of the heard note sequence with surprising accuracy [18]. The input and output tiers’ periods must be kept in lock-step, which can be accomplished through more plausible means than employed in the current implementation of this model. Here, we maintained a ﬁxed phase shift between the input and output oscillation rings by feeding activity from the input oscillation ring to the appropriately shifted pool in the output oscillation ring. This approach allowed us to avoid difﬁculties achieving coherent oscillations at identical frequencies in the input and output oscillation rings. Alternatively, entrainment could be achieved even when the frequencies are not identical—a more biologically plausible scenario—if the routing ring resets the phase of the input and output rings on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Lakatos et al. [19] have shown that somatosensory inputs can reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations in the primary auditory cortex (A1), which helps in the generation of a uniﬁed auditory-tactile percept (the so-called “Hearing-Hands Effect”). A simple extension to our model can reduce the number of connections below the requirements of traditional dynamic routing models. Instead of having all-to-all connections between the input and output layers, a relay layer of very few (M N ) neurons could be used to transmit the spikes form the input neurons to the output neurons (analogous to the single wire connecting encoder and decoder in Figure 1B). A small number of (or ideally even one) relay neurons sufﬁces because encoding and decoding occur in time. Hence, the connections between each input pool and the relay neurons require O(M N ) ≈ O(N ) connections (as long as M does not scale with N ) and those between the relay neurons and each output pool require O(M N) ≈ O(N ) connections as well. Thus, by removing all-to-all connectivity between the input and output units (a standard feature in traditional dynamic routing models), the number of required connections is reduced from O(N 2 ) 7 to O(N ). Further, by replacing the strict pool boundaries with nearest neighbor connectivity in the projection rings, the proposed model can accommodate a continuum of rotation angles. In summary, we propose that the mechanism of dynamic routing through neuronal coherence could be a general mechanism that could be used by multiple sensory and motor modalities in the neocortex: it is particularly suitable for placing raw information in an appropriate context (deﬁned by the routing tier).

<p>Author: Emre Neftci, Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Jean-jeacques Slotine, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: A non–linear dynamic system is called contracting if initial conditions are forgotten exponentially fast, so that all trajectories converge to a single trajectory. We use contraction theory to derive an upper bound for the strength of recurrent connections that guarantees contraction for complex neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we apply this theory to a special class of recurrent networks, often called Cooperative Competitive Networks (CCNs), which are an abstract representation of the cooperative-competitive connectivity observed in cortex. This speciﬁc type of network is believed to play a major role in shaping cortical responses and selecting the relevant signal among distractors and noise. In this paper, we analyze contraction of combined CCNs of linear threshold units and verify the results of our analysis in a hybrid analog/digital VLSI CCN comprising spiking neurons and dynamic synapses. 1</p><p>2 0.75187838 <a title="60-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Testing_for_Homogeneity_with_Kernel_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis.html">192 nips-2007-Testing for Homogeneity with Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Ricardo Silva, Wei Chu, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: When predicting class labels for objects within a relational database, it is often helpful to consider a model for relationships: this allows for information between class labels to be shared and to improve prediction performance. However, there are different ways by which objects can be related within a relational database. One traditional way corresponds to a Markov network structure: each existing relation is represented by an undirected edge. This encodes that, conditioned on input features, each object label is independent of other object labels given its neighbors in the graph. However, there is no reason why Markov networks should be the only representation of choice for symmetric dependence structures. Here we discuss the case when relationships are postulated to exist due to hidden common causes. We discuss how the resulting graphical model differs from Markov networks, and how it describes different types of real-world relational processes. A Bayesian nonparametric classiﬁcation model is built upon this graphical representation and evaluated with several empirical studies. 1 Contribution Prediction problems, such as classiﬁcation, can be easier when class labels share a sort of relational dependency that is not accounted by the input features [10]. If the variables to be predicted are attributes of objects in a relational database, such dependencies are often postulated from the relations that exist in the database. This paper proposes and evaluates a new method for building classiﬁers that uses information concerning the relational structure of the problem. Consider the following standard example, adapted from [3]. There are different webpages, each one labeled according to some class (e.g., “student page” or “not a student page”). Features such as the word distribution within the body of each page can be used to predict each webpage’s class. However, webpages do not exist in isolation: there are links connecting them. Two pages having a common set of links is evidence for similarity between such pages. For instance, if W1 and W3 both link to W2 , this is commonly considered to be evidence for W1 and W3 having the same class. One way of expressing this dependency is through the following Markov network [5]: ∗ Now at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge. E-mail: silva@statslab.cam.ac.uk F1 F2 F 3 C1 C2 C3 Here Fi are the features of page Wi , and Ci is its respective page label. Other edges linking F variables to C variables (e.g., F1 −C2 ) can be added without affecting the main arguments presented in this section. The semantics of the graph, for a ﬁxed input feature set {F1 , F2 , F3 }, are as follows: C1 is marginally dependent on C3 , but conditionally independent given C2 . Depending on the domain, this might be either a suitable or unsuitable representation of relations. For instance, in some domains it could be the case that the most sensible model would state that C1 is only informative about C3 once we know what C2 is: that is, C1 and C3 are marginally independent, but dependent given C2 . This can happen if the existence of a relation (Ci , Cj ) corresponds to the existence of hidden common causes generating this pair of random variables. Consider the following example, loosely based on a problem described by [12]. We have three objects, Microsoft (M ), Sony (S) and Philips (P ). The task is a regression task where we want to predict the stock market price of each company given its proﬁtability from last year. The given relationships are that M and S are direct competitors (due to the videogame console market), as well S and P (due to the TV set market). M.Profit S.Profit P.Profit M.Profit S.Profit P.Profit M.Profit S.Profit P.Profit M.Stock S.Stock P.Stock M.Stock S.Stock P.Stock M.Stock S.Stock P.Stock εm εs εp εm εs εp (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: (a) Assumptions that relate Microsoft, Sony and Philips stock prices through hidden common cause mechanisms, depicted as unlabeled gray vertices; (b) A graphical representation for generic hidden common causes relationships by using bi-directed edges; (c) A depiction of the same relationship skeleton by a Markov network model, which has different probabilistic semantics. It is expected that several market factors that affect stock prices are unaccounted by the predictor variable Past Year Proﬁt. For example, a shortage of Microsoft consoles is a hidden common factor for both Microsoft’s and Sony’s stock. Another hidden common cause would be a high price for Sony’s consoles. Assume here that these factors have no effect on Philips’ stock value. A depiction of several hidden common causes that correpond to the relations Competitor(M, S) and Competitor(S, P ) is given in Figure 1(a) as unlabeled gray vertices. Consider a linear regression model for this setup. We assume that for each object Oi ∈ {M, S, P }, the stock price Oi .Stock, centered at the mean, is given by Oi .Stock = β × Oi .P rof it + where each i i (1) is a Gaussian random variable. The fact that there are several hidden common causes between M and S can be modeled by the covariance of m and s , σms . That is, unlike in standard directed Gaussian models, σms is allowed to be non-zero. The same holds for σsp . Covariances of error terms of unrelated objects should be zero (σmp = 0). This setup is very closely related to the classic seemingly unrelated regression model popular in economics [12]. A graphical representation for this type of model is the directed mixed graph (DMG) [9, 11], with bi-directed edges representing the relationship of having hidden common causes between a pair of vertices. This is shown in Figure 1(b). Contrast this to the Markov network representation in Figure 1(c). The undirected representation encodes that m and p are marginally dependent, which does not correspond to our assumptions1 . Moreover, the model in Figure 1(b) states that once we observe Sony’s stock price, Philip’s stocks (and proﬁt) should have a non-zero association with Microsoft’s proﬁt: this follows from a extension of d-separation to DMGs [9]. This is expected from the assumptions (Philip’s stocks should tell us something about Microsoft’s once we know Sony’s, but not before it), but does not hold in the graphical model in Figure 1(c). While it is tempting to use Markov networks to represent relational models (free of concerns raised by cyclic directed representations), it is clear that there are problems for which they are not a sensible choice. This is not to say that Markov networks are not the best representation for large classes of relational problems. Conditional random ﬁelds [4] are well-motivated Markov network models for sequence learning. The temporal relationship is closed under marginalization: if we do not measure some steps in the sequence, we will still link the corresponding remaining vertices accordingly, as illustrated in Figure 2. Directed mixed graphs are not a good representation for this sequence structure.

To summarize, the decision between using a Markov network or a DMG reduces to the following modeling issue: if two unlinked object labels yi , yj are statistically associated when some chain of relationships exists between yi and yj , then the Markov network semantics should apply (as in the case for temporal relationships). However, if the association arises only given the values of the other objects in the chain, then this is accounted by the dependence semantics of the directed mixed graph representation. The DMG representation propagates training data information through other training points. The Markov network representation propagates training data information through test points. Propagation through training points is relevant in real problems. For instance, in a webpage domain where each webpage has links to pages of several kinds (e.g., [3]), a chain of intermediated points between two classes labels yi and yj is likely to be more informative if we know the values of the labels in this chain. The respective Markov network would ignore all training points in this chain besides the endpoints. In this paper, we introduce a non-parametric classiﬁcation model for relational data that factorizes according to a directed mixed graph. Sections 2 and 3 describes the model and contrasts it to a closely related approach which bears a strong analogy to the Markov network formulation. Experiments in text classiﬁcation are described in Section 4. 2 Model Chu et al. [2] describe an approach for Gaussian process classiﬁcation using relational information, which we review and compare to our proposed model. Previous approach: relational Gaussian processes through indicators − For each point x in the input space X , there is a corresponding function value fx . Given observed input points x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , a Gaussian process prior over f = [f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ]T has the shape P(f ) = 1 (2π)n/2 |Σ|1/2 1 exp − f T Σ−1 f 2 (2) 1 For Gaussian models, the absence of an edge in the undirected representation (i.e., Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds) corresponds to a zero entry in the inverse covariance matrix, where in the DMG it corresponds to a zero in the covariance matrix [9].

The idea is to start from a standard Gaussian process prior, and add relational information by conditioning on relational indicators. Let ξij be an indicator that assumes different values, e.g., 1 or 0. The indicator values are observed for each pair of data points (xi , xj ): they are an encoding of the given relational structure. A model for P (ξij = 1|fi , fj ) is deﬁned. This evidence is incorporated into the Gaussian process by conditioning on all indicators ξij that are positive. Essentially, the idea boils down to using P(f |ξ = 1) as the prior for a Gaussian process classiﬁer. Figure 3(a) illustrates a problem with datapoints {(x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), (x3 , y3 )}. Gray vertices represent unobserved variables. Each yi is a binary random variable, with conditional probability given by P(yi = 1|fi ) = Φ(fi /σ) (3) where Φ(·) is the standard normal cumulative function and σ is a hyperparameter. This can be interpreted as the cumulative distribution of fi + i , where fi is given and i is a normal random variable with zero mean and variance σ 2 . In the example of Figure 3(a), one has two relations: (x1 , x2 ), (x2 , x3 ). This information is incorporated by conditioning on the evidence (ξ12 = 1, ξ23 = 1). Observed points (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ) form the training set. The prediction task is to estimate y3 . Notice that ξ12 is not used to predict y3 : the Markov blanket for f3 includes (f1 , f2 , ξ23 , y3 , 3 ) and the input features. Essentially, conditioning on ξ = 1 corresponds to a pairwise Markov network structure, as depicted in Figure 3(b) [9]2 . Our approach: mixed graph relational model − Figure 3(c) illustrates our proposed setup. For reasons that will become clear in the sequel, we parameterize the conditional probability of yi as √ (4) P(yi = 1|gi , vi ) = Φ(gi / vi ) where gi = fi + ζi . As before, Equation (4) can be interpreted as the cumulative distribution of 2 gi + i , with i as a normal random variable with zero mean and variance vi = σ 2 − σζi , the last term being the variance of ζi . That is, we break the original error term as i = ζi + i , where i and j are independent for all i = j. Random vector ζ is a multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance matrix Σζ . The key aspect in our model is that the covariance of ζi and ζj is non-zero only if objects i and j are related (that is, bi-directed edge yi ↔ yj is in the relational graph). Parameterizing Σζ for relational problems is non-trivial and discussed in the next section. In the example of Figure 3, one noticeable difference of our model 3(c) to a standard Markov network models 3(b) is that now the Markov blanket for f3 includes error terms for all variables (both and ζ terms), following the motivation presented in Section 1. 2 In the ﬁgure, we are not representing explicitly that f1 , f2 and f3 are not independent (the prior covariance matrix Σ is complete). The ﬁgure is meant as a representation of the extra associations that arise when conditioning on ξ = 1, and the way such associations factorize. As before, the prior for f in our setup is the Gaussian process prior (2). This means that g has the following Gaussian process prior (implicitly conditioned on x): P(g) = 1 (2π)n/2 |R|1/2 1 exp − g R−1 g 2 (5) where R = K + Σζ is the covariance matrix of g = f + ζ, with Kij = K(xi , xj ). 3 Parametrizing a mixed graph model for relational classiﬁcation For simplicity, in this paper we will consider only relationships that induce positive associations between labels. Ideally, the parameterization of Σζ has to fulﬁll two desiderata: (i). it should respect the marginal independence constraints as encoded by the graphical model (i.e., zero covariance for vertices that are not adjacent), and be positive deﬁnite; (ii). it has to be parsimonious in order to facilitate hyperparameter selection, both computationally and statistically. Unlike the multivariate analysis problems in [11], the size of our covariance matrix grows with the number of data points. As shown by [11], exact inference in models with covariance matrices with zero-entry constraints is computationally demanding. We provide two alternative parameterizations that are not as ﬂexible, but which lead to covariance matrices that are simple to compute and easy to implement. We will work under the transductive scenario, where training and all test points are given in advance. The corresponding graph thus contain unobserved and observed label nodes. 3.1 Method I The ﬁrst method is an automated method to relax some of the independence constraints, while guaranteeing positive-deﬁniteness, and a parameterization that depends on a single scalar ρ. This allows for more efﬁcient inference and is done as follows: 1. Let Gζ be the corresponding bi-directed subgraph of our original mixed graph, and let U0 be a matrix with n × n entries, n being the number of nodes in Gζ 2. Set U0 to be the number of cliques in Gζ where yi and yj appear together; ij 3. Set U0 to be the number of cliques containing yi , plus a small constant ∆; ii 4. Set U to be the corresponding correlation matrix obtained by intepreting U0 as a covariance matrix and rescaling it; Finally, set Σζ = ρU, where ρ ∈ [0, 1] is a given hyperparameter. Matrix U is always guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite: it is equivalent to obtaining the covariance matrix of y from a linear latent variable model, where there is an independent standard Gaussian latent variable as a common parent to every clique, and every observed node yi is given by the sum of its parents plus an independent error term of variance ∆. Marginal independencies are respected, since independent random variables will never be in a same clique in Gζ . In practice, this method cannot be used as is since the number of cliques will in general grow at an exponential rate as a function of n. Instead, we ﬁrst triangulate the graph: in this case, extracting cliques can be done in polynomial time. This is a relaxation of the original goal, since some of the original marginal independence constraints will not be enforced due to the triangulation3. 3.2 Method II The method suggested in the previous section is appealing under the assumption that vertices that appear in many common cliques are more likely to have more hidden common causes, and hence should have stronger associations. However, sometimes the triangulation introduces bad artifacts, with lots of marginal independence constraints being violated. In this case, this will often result in a poor prediction performance. A cheap alternative approach is not generating cliques, and instead 3 The need for an approximation is not a shortcoming only of the DMG approach. Notice that the relational Gaussian process of [2] also requires an approximation of its relational kernel. 10 10 10 20 20 20 30 30 30 40 40 40 50 50 50 60 60 60 70 70 70 80 80 80 90 90 90 100 100 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 (a) 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 (b) 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 (c) Figure 4: (a) The link matrix for the political books dataset. (b) The relational kernel matrix obtained with the approximated Method I. (c) The kernel matrix obtained with Method II, which tends to produce much weaker associations but does not introduce spurious relations. getting a marginal covariance matrix from a different latent variable model. In this model, we create an independent standard Gaussian variable for each edge yi ↔ yj instead of each clique. No triangulation will be necessary, and all marginal independence constraints will be respected. This, however, has shortcomings of its own: for all pairs (yi , yj ) connected by an edge, it will be the case that U0 = 1, while U0 can be as large as n. This means that the resulting correlation in Uij can be ij ii close to zero even if yi and yj are always in the same cliques. In Section 4, we will choose between Methods I and II according to the marginal likelihood of the model. 3.3 Algorithm Recall that our model is a Gaussian process classiﬁer with error terms i of variance σ such that i = ζi + i . Without loss of generality, we will assume that σ = 1. This results in the following parameterization of the full error covariance matrix: Σ = (1 − ρ)I + ρU (6) where I is an n × n identity matrix. Matrix (1 − ρ)I corresponds to the covariance matrix Σ . The usefulness of separating as and ζ becomes evident when we use an expectation-propagation (EP) algorithm [7] to perform inference in our relational classiﬁer. Instead of approximating the posterior of f , we approximate the posterior density P(g|D), D = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )} being ˜ the given training data. The approximate posterior has the form Q(g) ∝ P(g) i ti (gi ) where P(g) is the Gaussian process prior with kernel matrix R = K + Σζ as deﬁned in the previous section. Since the covariance matrix Σ is diagonal, the true likelihood of y given g factorizes n over each datapoint: P(y|g) = i=1 P(yi |gi ), and standard EP algorithms for Gaussian process classiﬁcation can be used [8] (with the variance given by Σ instead of Σ , and kernel matrix R instead of K). The ﬁnal algorithm deﬁnes a whole new class of relational models, depends on a single hyperparameter ρ which can be optimized by grid search in [0, 1], and requires virtually no modiﬁcation of code written for EP-based Gaussian process classiﬁers4 . 4 Results We now compare three different methods in relational classiﬁcation tasks. We will compare a standard Gaussian process classiﬁer (GPC), the relational Gaussian process (RGP) of [2] and our method, the mixed graph Gaussian process (XGP). A linear kernel K(x, z) = x · z is used, as described by [2]. We set ∆ = 10−4 and the hyperparameter ρ is found by a grid search in the space {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0} maximizing the approximate EP marginal likelihood5. 4 We provide MATLAB/Octave code for our method in http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/∼silva. For triangulation, we used the MATLAB implementation of the Reverse Cuthill McKee vertex ordering available at http://people.scs.fsu.edu/∼burkardt/m src/rcm/rcm.html 5 Table 1: The averaged AUC scores of citation prediction on test cases of the Cora database are recorded along with standard deviation over 100 trials. “n” denotes the number of papers in one class. “Citations” denotes the citation count within the two paper classes.

The features of each book are given by the words in the Amazon.com front page for that particular book. The choice of books, labels, and relationships are given in the data collected by Valdis Krebs and available at http://www-personal.umich.edu/ mejn/netdata. The data containing book features can be found at http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/∼silva. There are 105 books, 43 of which are labeled as liberal books. The relationships are pairs of books which are frequently purchased together by a same customer. Notice this is an easy problem, where labels are strongly associated if they share a relationship. We performed evaluation by sampling 100 times from the original pool of books, assigning half of them as trainining data. The evaluation criterion was the area under the curve (AUC) for this binary problem. This is a problem where Method I is suboptimal. Figure 4(a) shows the original binary link matrix. Figure 4(b) depicts the corresponding U0 matrix obtained with Method I, where entries closer to red correspond to stronger correlations. Method II gives a better performance here (Method I was better in the next two experiments). The AUC result for GPC was of 0.92, while both RGP and XGP achieved 0.98 (the difference between XGP and GPC having a std. deviation of 0.02). 4.2 Cora The Cora collection [6] contains over 50,000 computer science research papers including bibliographic citations. We used a subset in our experiment. The subset consists of 4,285 machine learning papers categorized into 7 classes. The second column of Table 1 shows the class sizes. Each paper was preprocessed as a bag-of-words, a vector of “term frequency” components scaled by “inverse document frequency”, and then normalized to unity length. This follows the pre-processing used in [2]. There is a total of 20,082 features. For each class, we randomly selected 1% of the labelled samples for training and tested on the remainder. The partition was repeated 100 times. We used the fact that the database is composed of fairly specialized papers as an illustration of when XGP might not be as optimal as RGP (whose AUC curves are very close to 1), since the population of links tends to be better separated between different classes (but this is also means that the task is fairly easy, and differences disappear very rapidly with increasing sample sizes). The fact there is very little training data also favors RGP, since XGP propagates information through training points. Still, XGP does better than the non-relational GPC. Notice that adding the citation adjacency matrix as a binary input feature for each paper does not improve the performance of the GPC, as shown in Table 1. Results for other classes are of similar qualitative nature and not displayed here. 4.3 WebKB The WebKB dataset consists of homepages from 4 different universities: Cornell, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin [3]. Each webpage belongs to one out of 7 categories: student, professor, course, project, staff, department and “other”. The relations come from actual links in the webpages. There is relatively high heterogeneity of types of links in each page: in terms of mixed graph modeling, this linkage mechanism is explained by a hidden common cause (e.g., a student and a course page are associated because that person’s interest in enrolling as a student also creates demand for a course). The heterogeneity also suggests that two unlinked pages should not, on average, have an association if they link to a common page W . However, observing the type of page W might create Table 2: Comparison of the three algorithms on the task “other” vs. “not-other” in the WebKB domain. Results for GPC and RGP taken from [2]. The same partitions for training and test are used to generate the results for XGP. Mean and standard deviation of AUC results are reported. University Numbers Other or Not Other All Link GPC RGP XGP Cornell 617 865 13177 0.708 ± 0.021 0.884 ± 0.025 0.917 ± 0.022 Texas 571 827 16090 0.799 ± 0.021 0.906 ± 0.026 0.949 ± 0.015 Washington 939 1205 15388 0.782 ± 0.023 0.877 ± 0.024 0.923 ± 0.016 Wisconsin 942 1263 21594 0.839 ± 0.014 0.899 ± 0.015 0.941 ± 0.018 the association. We compare how the three algorithms perform when trying to predict if a webpage is of class “other” or not (the other classiﬁcations are easier, with smaller differences. Results are omitted for space purposes). The proportion of “other” to non-“other” is about 4:1, which makes the area under the curve (AUC) a more suitable measure of success. We used the same 100 subsamples from [2], where 10% of the whole data is sampled from the pool for a speciﬁc university, and the remaining is used for test. We also used the same features as in [2], pre-processed as described in the previous section. The results are shown in Table 2. Both relational Gaussian processes are far better than the non-relational GPC. XGP gives signiﬁcant improvements over RGP in all four universities. 5 Conclusion We introduced a new family of relational classiﬁers by extending a classical statistical model [12] to non-parametric relational classiﬁcation. This is inspired by recent advances in relational Gaussian processes [2] and Bayesian inference for mixed graph models [11]. We showed empirically that modeling the type of latent phenomena that our approach postulates can sometimes improve prediction performance in problems traditionally approached by Markov network structures. Several interesting problems can be treated in the future. It is clear that there are many different ways by which the relational covariance matrix can be parameterized. Intermediate solutions between Methods I and II, approximations through matrix factorizations and graph cuts are only a few among many alternatives that can be explored. Moreover, there is a relationship between our model and multiple kernel learning [1], where one of the kernels comes from error covariances. This might provide alternative ways of learning our models, including multiple types of relationships. Acknowledgements: We thank Vikas Sindhwani for the preprocessed Cora database. References [1] F.

<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>5 0.63271594 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Variational_inference_for_Markov_jump_processes.html">214 nips-2007-Variational inference for Markov jump processes</a></p>

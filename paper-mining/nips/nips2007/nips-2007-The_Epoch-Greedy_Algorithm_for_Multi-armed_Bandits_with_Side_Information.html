<p>Author: Varsha Dani, Sham M. Kakade, Thomas P. Hayes</p><p>Abstract: In the online linear optimization problem, a learner must choose, in each round, a decision from a set D ⊂ Rn in order to minimize an (unknown and changing) linear cost function. We present sharp rates of convergence (with respect to additive regret) for both the full information setting (where the cost function is revealed at the end of each round) and the bandit setting (where only the scalar cost incurred is revealed). In particular, this paper is concerned with the price of bandit information, by which we mean the ratio of the best achievable regret in the bandit setting to that in the full-information setting. For the full informa√ tion case, the upper bound on the regret is O∗ ( nT ), where n is the ambient dimension and T is the time horizon. For the bandit case, we present an algorithm √ which achieves O∗ (n3/2 T ) regret — all previous (nontrivial) bounds here were O(poly(n)T 2/3 ) or worse. It is striking that the convergence rate for the bandit setting is only a factor of n worse than in the full information case — in stark contrast to the K-arm bandit setting, where the gap in the dependence on K is √ √ exponential ( T K√ vs. T log K). We also present lower bounds showing that this gap is at least n, which we conjecture to be the correct order. The bandit algorithm we present can be implemented efﬁciently in special cases of particular interest, such as path planning and Markov Decision Problems. 1</p><p>3 0.33489069 <a title="194-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Computational_Equivalence_of_Fixed_Points_and_No_Regret_Algorithms%2C_and_Convergence_to_Equilibria.html">54 nips-2007-Computational Equivalence of Fixed Points and No Regret Algorithms, and Convergence to Equilibria</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We study the relation between notions of game-theoretic equilibria which are based on stability under a set of deviations, and empirical equilibria which are reached by rational players. Rational players are modeled by players using no regret algorithms, which guarantee that their payoff in the long run is close to the maximum they could hope to achieve by consistently deviating from the algorithm’s suggested action. We show that for a given set of deviations over the strategy set of a player, it is possible to efﬁciently approximate ﬁxed points of a given deviation if and only if there exist efﬁcient no regret algorithms resistant to the deviations. Further, we show that if all players use a no regret algorithm, then the empirical distribution of their plays converges to an equilibrium. 1</p><p>4 0.24443395 <a title="194-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Incomplete_Information.html">165 nips-2007-Regret Minimization in Games with Incomplete Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Michael Johanson, Michael Bowling, Carmelo Piccione</p><p>Abstract: Extensive games are a powerful model of multiagent decision-making scenarios with incomplete information. Finding a Nash equilibrium for very large instances of these games has received a great deal of recent attention. In this paper, we describe a new technique for solving large games based on regret minimization. In particular, we introduce the notion of counterfactual regret, which exploits the degree of incomplete information in an extensive game. We show how minimizing counterfactual regret minimizes overall regret, and therefore in self-play can be used to compute a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate this technique in the domain of poker, showing we can solve abstractions of limit Texas Hold’em with as many as 1012 states, two orders of magnitude larger than previous methods. 1</p><p>5 0.20851547 <a title="194-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Online_Gradient_Descent.html">21 nips-2007-Adaptive Online Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Alexander Rakhlin, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We study the rates of growth of the regret in online convex optimization. First, we show that a simple extension of the algorithm of Hazan et al eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the lower bound on the second derivatives of the observed functions. We then provide an algorithm, Adaptive Online Gradient Descent, which interpolates between the results of Zinkevich for linear functions and of Hazan et al for strongly convex functions, achieving intermediate rates √ between T and log T . Furthermore, we show strong optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we provide an extension of our results to general norms. 1</p><p>6 0.1909965 <a title="194-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Optimistic_Linear_Programming_gives_Logarithmic_Regret_for_Irreducible_MDPs.html">151 nips-2007-Optimistic Linear Programming gives Logarithmic Regret for Irreducible MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm called Optimistic Linear Programming (OLP) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown Markov decision process (MDP). OLP uses its experience so far to estimate the MDP. It chooses actions by optimistically maximizing estimated future rewards over a set of next-state transition probabilities that are close to the estimates, a computation that corresponds to solving linear programs. We show that the total expected reward obtained by OLP up to time T is within C(P ) log T of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where C(P ) is an explicit, MDP-dependent constant. OLP is closely related to an algorithm proposed by Burnetas and Katehakis with four key differences: OLP is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm. OLP is also similar in ﬂavor to an algorithm recently proposed by Auer and Ortner. But OLP is simpler and its regret bound has a better dependence on the size of the MDP. 1</p><p>5 0.51336205 <a title="194-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Online_Gradient_Descent.html">21 nips-2007-Adaptive Online Gradient Descent</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Walder, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers kernels invariant to translation, rotation and dilation. We show that no non-trivial positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels exist which are radial and dilation invariant, only conditionally positive deﬁnite (c.p.d.) ones. Accordingly, we discuss the c.p.d. case and provide some novel analysis, including an elementary derivation of a c.p.d. representer theorem. On the practical side, we give a support vector machine (s.v.m.) algorithm for arbitrary c.p.d. kernels. For the thinplate kernel this leads to a classiﬁer with only one parameter (the amount of regularisation), which we demonstrate to be as effective as an s.v.m. with the Gaussian kernel, even though the Gaussian involves a second parameter (the length scale). 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7880587 <a title="194-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-The_Epoch-Greedy_Algorithm_for_Multi-armed_Bandits_with_Side_Information.html">194 nips-2007-The Epoch-Greedy Algorithm for Multi-armed Bandits with Side Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Daichi Mochihashi, Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method of estimating variable order Markov processes up to a theoretically inﬁnite order. By extending a stick-breaking prior, which is usually deﬁned on a unit interval, “vertically” to the trees of inﬁnite depth associated with a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process, our model directly infers the hidden orders of Markov dependencies from which each symbol originated. Experiments on character and word sequences in natural language showed that the model has a comparative performance with an exponentially large full-order model, while computationally much efﬁcient in both time and space. We expect that this basic model will also extend to the variable order hierarchical clustering of general data. 1</p><p>4 0.7087692 <a title="194-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Estimating_divergence_functionals_and_the_likelihood_ratio_by_penalized_convex_risk_minimization.html">82 nips-2007-Estimating divergence functionals and the likelihood ratio by penalized convex risk minimization</a></p>

We present a derivation of our kernel-based estimation algorithm and an analysis of convergence rates for the estimator. Our simulation results demonstrate the convergence behavior of the method, which compares favorably with existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>5 0.70480633 <a title="194-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Online_Gradient_Descent.html">21 nips-2007-Adaptive Online Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Alexander Rakhlin, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We study the rates of growth of the regret in online convex optimization. First, we show that a simple extension of the algorithm of Hazan et al eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the lower bound on the second derivatives of the observed functions. We then provide an algorithm, Adaptive Online Gradient Descent, which interpolates between the results of Zinkevich for linear functions and of Hazan et al for strongly convex functions, achieving intermediate rates √ between T and log T . Furthermore, we show strong optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we provide an extension of our results to general norms. 1</p><p>6 0.70335174 <a title="194-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Multi-Task_Learning_via_Conic_Programming.html">134 nips-2007-Multi-Task Learning via Conic Programming</a></p>

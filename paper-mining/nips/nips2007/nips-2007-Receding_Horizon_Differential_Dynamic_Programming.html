<p>Author: Chris Atkeson, Benjamin Stephens</p><p>Abstract: We combine three threads of research on approximate dynamic programming: sparse random sampling of states, value function and policy approximation using local models, and using local trajectory optimizers to globally optimize a policy and associated value function. Our focus is on ﬁnding steady state policies for deterministic time invariant discrete time control problems with continuous states and actions often found in robotics.

<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Arnaud Doucet, Nando D. Freitas, Ajay Jasra</p><p>Abstract: A recently proposed formulation of the stochastic planning and control problem as one of parameter estimation for suitable artiﬁcial statistical models has led to the adoption of inference algorithms for this notoriously hard problem. At the algorithmic level, the focus has been on developing Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms. In this paper, we begin by making the crucial observation that the stochastic control problem can be reinterpreted as one of trans-dimensional inference. With this new interpretation, we are able to propose a novel reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is more efﬁcient than its EM counterparts. Moreover, it enables us to implement full Bayesian policy search, without the need for gradients and with one single Markov chain. The new approach involves sampling directly from a distribution that is proportional to the reward and, consequently, performs better than classic simulations methods in situations where the reward is a rare event.</p><p>4 0.098397925 <a title="163-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Hierarchical_Apprenticeship_Learning_with_Application_to_Quadruped_Locomotion.html">98 nips-2007-Hierarchical Apprenticeship Learning with Application to Quadruped Locomotion</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Z. Kolter, Pieter Abbeel, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider apprenticeship learning—learning from expert demonstrations—in the setting of large, complex domains. Past work in apprenticeship learning requires that the expert demonstrate complete trajectories through the domain. However, in many problems even an expert has difﬁculty controlling the system, which makes this approach infeasible. For example, consider the task of teaching a quadruped robot to navigate over extreme terrain; demonstrating an optimal policy (i.e., an optimal set of foot locations over the entire terrain) is a highly non-trivial task, even for an expert. In this paper we propose a method for hierarchical apprenticeship learning, which allows the algorithm to accept isolated advice at different hierarchical levels of the control task. This type of advice is often feasible for experts to give, even if the expert is unable to demonstrate complete trajectories. This allows us to extend the apprenticeship learning paradigm to much larger, more challenging domains. In particular, in this paper we apply the hierarchical apprenticeship learning algorithm to the task of quadruped locomotion over extreme terrain, and achieve, to the best of our knowledge, results superior to any previously published work. 1</p><p>5 0.088521741 <a title="163-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Apprenticeship_Learning.html">5 nips-2007-A Game-Theoretic Approach to Apprenticeship Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Umar Syed, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of an apprentice learning to behave in an environment with an unknown reward function by observing the behavior of an expert. We follow on the work of Abbeel and Ng [1] who considered a framework in which the true reward function is assumed to be a linear combination of a set of known and observable features. We give a new algorithm that, like theirs, is guaranteed to learn a policy that is nearly as good as the expert’s, given enough examples. However, unlike their algorithm, we show that ours may produce a policy that is substantially better than the expert’s. Moreover, our algorithm is computationally faster, is easier to implement, and can be applied even in the absence of an expert. The method is based on a game-theoretic view of the problem, which leads naturally to a direct application of the multiplicative-weights algorithm of Freund and Schapire [2] for playing repeated matrix games. In addition to our formal presentation and analysis of the new algorithm, we sketch how the method can be applied when the transition function itself is unknown, and we provide an experimental demonstration of the algorithm on a toy video-game environment. 1</p><p>6 0.087379441 <a title="163-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Fitted_Q-iteration_in_continuous_action-space_MDPs.html">91 nips-2007-Fitted Q-iteration in continuous action-space MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>3 0.5376848 <a title="163-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Temporal_Difference_Updating_without_a_Learning_Rate.html">191 nips-2007-Temporal Difference Updating without a Learning Rate</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcus Hutter, Shane Legg</p><p>Abstract: We derive an equation for temporal difference learning from statistical principles. Speciﬁcally, we start with the variational principle and then bootstrap to produce an updating rule for discounted state value estimates. The resulting equation is similar to the standard equation for temporal difference learning with eligibility traces, so called TD(λ), however it lacks the parameter α that speciﬁes the learning rate. In the place of this free parameter there is now an equation for the learning rate that is speciﬁc to each state transition. We experimentally test this new learning rule against TD(λ) and ﬁnd that it offers superior performance in various settings. Finally, we make some preliminary investigations into how to extend our new temporal difference algorithm to reinforcement learning. To do this we combine our update equation with both Watkins’ Q(λ) and Sarsa(λ) and ﬁnd that it again offers superior performance without a learning rate parameter. 1</p><p>4 0.5375582 <a title="163-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-A_learning_framework_for_nearest_neighbor_search.html">16 nips-2007-A learning framework for nearest neighbor search</a></p>
<p>Author: Lawrence Cayton, Sanjoy Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: Can we leverage learning techniques to build a fast nearest-neighbor (ANN) retrieval data structure? We present a general learning framework for the NN problem in which sample queries are used to learn the parameters of a data structure that minimize the retrieval time and/or the miss rate. We explore the potential of this novel framework through two popular NN data structures: KD-trees and the rectilinear structures employed by locality sensitive hashing. We derive a generalization theory for these data structure classes and present simple learning algorithms for both. Experimental results reveal that learning often improves on the already strong performance of these data structures. 1</p><p>5 0.53327632 <a title="163-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_structure_of_manifolds_using_random_projections.html">116 nips-2007-Learning the structure of manifolds using random projections</a></p>

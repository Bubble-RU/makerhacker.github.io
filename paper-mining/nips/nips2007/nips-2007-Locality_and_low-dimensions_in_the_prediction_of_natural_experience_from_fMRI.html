<p>Author: Sennay Ghebreab, Arnold Smeulders, Pieter Adriaans</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for reconstruction of human brain states directly from functional neuroimaging data. The method extends the traditional multivariate regression analysis of discretized fMRI data to the domain of stochastic functional measurements, facilitating evaluation of brain responses to complex stimuli and boosting the power of functional imaging. The method searches for sets of voxel time courses that optimize a multivariate functional linear model in terms of R2 statistic. Population based incremental learning is used to identify spatially distributed brain responses to complex stimuli without attempting to localize function ﬁrst. Variation in hemodynamic lag across brain areas and among subjects is taken into account by voxel-wise non-linear registration of stimulus pattern to fMRI data. Application of the method on an international test benchmark for prediction of naturalistic stimuli from new and unknown fMRI data shows that the method successfully uncovers spatially distributed parts of the brain that are highly predictive of a given stimulus. 1</p><p>3 0.14186186 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Continuous_Time_Particle_Filtering_for_fMRI.html">59 nips-2007-Continuous Time Particle Filtering for fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Lawrence Murray, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: We construct a biologically motivated stochastic differential model of the neural and hemodynamic activity underlying the observed Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The model poses a difﬁcult parameter estimation problem, both theoretically due to the nonlinearity and divergence of the differential system, and computationally due to its time and space complexity. We adapt a particle ﬁlter and smoother to the task, and discuss some of the practical approaches used to tackle the difﬁculties, including use of sparse matrices and parallelisation. Results demonstrate the tractability of the approach in its application to an effective connectivity study. 1</p><p>4 0.12181282 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Measuring_Neural_Synchrony_by_Message_Passing.html">127 nips-2007-Measuring Neural Synchrony by Message Passing</a></p>
<p>Author: Justin Dauwels, François Vialatte, Tomasz Rutkowski, Andrzej S. Cichocki</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach to measure the interdependence of two time series is proposed, referred to as “stochastic event synchrony” (SES); it quantiﬁes the alignment of two point processes by means of the following parameters: time delay, variance of the timing jitter, fraction of “spurious” events, and average similarity of events. SES may be applied to generic one-dimensional and multi-dimensional point processes, however, the paper mainly focusses on point processes in time-frequency domain. The average event similarity is in that case described by two parameters: the average frequency offset between events in the time-frequency plane, and the variance of the frequency offset (“frequency jitter”); SES then consists of ﬁve parameters in total. Those parameters quantify the synchrony of oscillatory events, and hence, they provide an alternative to existing synchrony measures that quantify amplitude or phase synchrony. The pairwise alignment of point processes is cast as a statistical inference problem, which is solved by applying the maxproduct algorithm on a graphical model. The SES parameters are determined from the resulting pairwise alignment by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The proposed interdependence measure is applied to the problem of detecting anomalies in EEG synchrony of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients; the results indicate that SES signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity of EEG in detecting MCI.</p><p>5 0.11811198 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Consistent_Minimization_of_Clustering_Objective_Functions.html">58 nips-2007-Consistent Minimization of Clustering Objective Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike V. Luxburg, Stefanie Jegelka, Michael Kaufmann, Sébastien Bubeck</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is often formulated as a discrete optimization problem. The objective is to ﬁnd, among all partitions of the data set, the best one according to some quality measure. However, in the statistical setting where we assume that the ﬁnite data set has been sampled from some underlying space, the goal is not to ﬁnd the best partition of the given sample, but to approximate the true partition of the underlying space. We argue that the discrete optimization approach usually does not achieve this goal. As an alternative, we suggest the paradigm of “nearest neighbor clustering”. Instead of selecting the best out of all partitions of the sample, it only considers partitions in some restricted function class. Using tools from statistical learning theory we prove that nearest neighbor clustering is statistically consistent. Moreover, its worst case complexity is polynomial by construction, and it can be implemented with small average case complexity using branch and bound. 1</p><p>6 0.099673524 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Inference_for_Spiking_Neuron_Models_with_a_Sparsity_Prior.html">33 nips-2007-Bayesian Inference for Spiking Neuron Models with a Sparsity Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Victoria Manfredi, Jim Kurose</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of adaptive sensor control in dynamic resourceconstrained sensor networks. We focus on a meteorological sensing network comprising radars that can perform sector scanning rather than always scanning 360◦ . We compare three sector scanning strategies. The sit-and-spin strategy always scans 360◦ . The limited lookahead strategy additionally uses the expected environmental state K decision epochs in the future, as predicted from Kalman ﬁlters, in its decision-making. The full lookahead strategy uses all expected future states by casting the problem as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to estimate the optimal scan strategy. We show that the main beneﬁts of using a lookahead strategy are when there are multiple meteorological phenomena in the environment, and when the maximum radius of any phenomenon is sufﬁciently smaller than the radius of the radars. We also show that there is a trade-off between the average quality with which a phenomenon is scanned and the number of decision epochs before which a phenomenon is rescanned. 1</p><p>4 0.398146 <a title="122-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Continuous_Time_Particle_Filtering_for_fMRI.html">59 nips-2007-Continuous Time Particle Filtering for fMRI</a></p>

<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Many existing approaches to collaborative ﬁltering can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netﬂix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netﬂix’s own system.</p><p>6 0.3800289 <a title="122-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Measuring_Neural_Synchrony_by_Message_Passing.html">127 nips-2007-Measuring Neural Synchrony by Message Passing</a></p>

<p>Author: Pawan Mudigonda, Vladimir Kolmogorov, Philip Torr</p><p>Abstract: The problem of obtaining the maximum a posteriori estimate of a general discrete random ﬁeld (i.e. a random ﬁeld deﬁned using a ﬁnite and discrete set of labels) is known to be NP-hard. However, due to its central importance in many applications, several approximate algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an analysis of three such algorithms based on convex relaxations: (i) LP - S: the linear programming (LP) relaxation proposed by Schlesinger [20] for a special case and independently in [4, 12, 23] for the general case; (ii) QP - RL: the quadratic programming (QP) relaxation by Ravikumar and Lafferty [18]; and (iii) SOCP - MS: the second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation ﬁrst proposed by Muramatsu and Suzuki [16] for two label problems and later extended in [14] for a general label set. We show that the SOCP - MS and the QP - RL relaxations are equivalent. Furthermore, we prove that despite the ﬂexibility in the form of the constraints/objective function offered by QP and SOCP, the LP - S relaxation strictly dominates (i.e. provides a better approximation than) QP - RL and SOCP - MS. We generalize these results by deﬁning a large class of SOCP (and equivalent QP) relaxations which is dominated by the LP - S relaxation. Based on these results we propose some novel SOCP relaxations which strictly dominate the previous approaches.</p><p>2 0.80305678 <a title="122-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Learning_and_using_relational_theories.html">114 nips-2007-Learning and using relational theories</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Noah Goodman, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Much of human knowledge is organized into sophisticated systems that are often called intuitive theories. We propose that intuitive theories are mentally represented in a logical language, and that the subjective complexity of a theory is determined by the length of its representation in this language. This complexity measure helps to explain how theories are learned from relational data, and how they support inductive inferences about unobserved relations. We describe two experiments that test our approach, and show that it provides a better account of human learning and reasoning than an approach developed by Goodman [1]. What is a theory, and what makes one theory better than another? Questions like these are of obvious interest to philosophers of science but are also discussed by psychologists, who have argued that everyday knowledge is organized into rich and complex systems that are similar in many respects to scientiﬁc theories. Even young children, for instance, have systematic beliefs about domains including folk physics, folk biology, and folk psychology [2]. Intuitive theories like these play many of the same roles as scientiﬁc theories: in particular, both kinds of theories are used to explain and encode observations of the world, and to predict future observations. This paper explores the nature, use and acquisition of simple theories. Consider, for instance, an anthropologist who has just begun to study the social structure of a remote tribe, and observes that certain words are used to indicate relationships between selected pairs of individuals. Suppose that term T1(·, ·) can be glossed as ancestor(·, ·), and that T2(·, ·) can be glossed as friend(·, ·). The anthropologist might discover that the ﬁrst term is transitive, and that the second term is symmetric with a few exceptions. Suppose that term T3(·, ·) can be glossed as defers to(·, ·), and that the tribe divides into two castes such that members of the second caste defer to members of the ﬁrst caste. In this case the anthropologist might discover two latent concepts (caste 1(·) and caste 2(·)) along with the relationship between these concepts. As these examples suggest, a theory can be deﬁned as a system of laws and concepts that specify the relationships between the elements in some domain [2]. We will consider how these theories are learned, how they are used to encode relational data, and how they support predictions about unobserved relations. Our approach to all three problems relies on the notion of subjective complexity. We propose that theory learners prefer simple theories, that people remember relational data in terms of the simplest underlying theory, and that people extend a partially observed data set according to the simplest theory that is consistent with their observations. There is no guarantee that a single measure of subjective complexity can do all of the work that we require [3]. This paper, however, explores the strong hypothesis that a single measure will sufﬁce. Our formal treatment of subjective complexity begins with the question of how theories are mentally represented. We suggest that theories are represented in some logical language, and propose a speciﬁc ﬁrst-order language that serves as a hypothesis about the “language of thought.” We then pursue the idea that the subjective complexity of a theory corresponds to the length of its representation in this language. Our approach therefore builds on the work of Feldman [4], and is related to other psychological applications of the notion of Kolmogorov complexity [5]. The complexity measure we describe can be used to deﬁne a probability distribution over a space of theories, and we develop a model of theory acquisition by using this distribution as the prior for a Bayesian learner.

Figure 1: Six possible extensions for a binary predicate R(·, ·). In each case, the objects in the domain are represented as digits, and a pair such as 16 indicates that R(1, 6) is true. Below each set of pairs, the simplest theory according to our complexity measure is shown. show how the same Bayesian approach helps to explain how theories support inductive generalization: given a set of observations, future observations (e.g. whether one individual defers to another) can be predicted using the posterior distribution over the space of theories. We test our approach by developing two experiments where people learn and make predictions about binary and ternary relations. As far as we know, the approach of Goodman [1] is the only other measure of theory complexity that has previously been tested as a psychological model [6]. We show that our experiments support our approach and raise challenges for this alternative model. 1 Theory complexity: a representation length approach Intuitive theories correspond to mental representations of some sort, and our ﬁrst task is to characterize the elements used to build these representations. We explore the idea that a theory is a system of statements in a logical language, and six examples are shown in Fig. 1. The theory in Fig. 1b is related to the defers to(·, ·) example already described. Here we are interested in a domain including 9 elements, and a two place predicate R(·, ·) that is true of all and only the 15 pairs shown. R is deﬁned using a unary predicate T which is true of only three elements: 6, 7, and 8. The theory includes a clause which states that R(X, Y) is true for all pairs XY such that T(X) is false and T(Y) is true. The theory in Fig. 1c is very similar, but includes an additional clause which speciﬁes that R(1, 1) is true, and an exception which speciﬁes that R(1, 6) is false. Formally, each theory we consider is a collection of function-free deﬁnite clauses. All variables are universally quantiﬁed: for instance, the clause R(X, Z) ← R(X, Y), R(Y, Z) is equivalent to the logical formula ∀x ∀y ∀z (R(x, z) ← R(x, y) ∧ R(y, z)). For readability, the theories in Fig. 1 include parentheses and arrows, but note that these symbols are unnecessary and can be removed. Our proposed language includes only predicate symbols, variable symbols, constant symbols, and a period that indicates when one clause ﬁnishes and another begins. Each theory in Fig. 1 speciﬁes the extension of one or more predicates. The extension of predicate P is deﬁned in terms of predicate P+ (which captures the basic rules that lead to membership in P) and predicate P− (which captures exceptions to these rules). The resulting extension of P is deﬁned 2 as P+ \ P− , or the set difference of P+ and P− .1 Once P has been deﬁned, later clauses in the theory may refer to P or its negation ¯. To ensure that our semantics is well-deﬁned, the predicates P in any valid theory must permit an ordering so that the deﬁnition of any predicate does not refer to predicates that follow it in the order. Formally, the deﬁnition of each predicate P+ or P− can refer only to itself (recursive deﬁnitions are allowed) and to any predicate M or ¯ where M < P. M Once we have committed to a speciﬁc language, the subjective complexity of a theory is assumed to correspond to the number of symbols in its representation. We have chosen a language where there is one symbol for each position in a theory where a predicate, variable or constant appears, and one symbol to indicate when each clause ends. Given this language, the subjective complexity c(T ) of theory T is equal to the sum of the number of clauses in the theory and the number of positions in the theory where a predicate, variable or constant appears: c(T ) = #clauses(T ) + #pred slots(T ) + #var slots(T ) + #const slots(T ). (1) For instance, the clause R(X, Z) ← R(X, Y), R(Y, Z). contributes ten symbols towards the complexity of a theory (three predicate symbols, six variable symbols, and one period). Other languages might be considered: for instance, we could use a language which uses ﬁve symbols (e.g. ﬁve bits) to represent each predicate, variable and constant, and one symbol (e.g. one bit) to indicate the end of a clause. Our approach to subjective complexity depends critically on the representation language, but once a language has been chosen the complexity measure is uniquely speciﬁed. Although our approach is closely related to the notion of Kolmogorov complexity and to Minimum Message Length (MML) and Minimum Description Length (MDL) approaches, we refer to it as a Representation Length (RL) approach. A RL approach includes a commitment to a speciﬁc language that is proposed as a psychological hypothesis, but these other approaches aspire towards results that do not depend on the language chosen.2 It is sometimes suggested that the notion of Kolmogorov complexity provides a more suitable framework for psychological research than the RL approach, precisely because it allows for results that do not depend on a speciﬁc description language [8]. We subscribe to the opposite view. Mental representations presumably rely on some particular language, and identifying this language is a central challenge for psychological research. The language we described should be considered as a tentative approximation of the language of thought. Other languages can and should be explored, but our language has several appealing properties. Feldman [4] has argued that deﬁnite clauses are psychologically natural, and working with these representations allows our approach to account for several classic results from the concept learning literature. For instance, our language leads to the prediction that conjunctive concepts are easier to learn than disjunctive concepts [9].3 Working with deﬁnite clauses also ensures that each of our theories has a unique minimal model, which means that the extension of a theory can be deﬁned in a particularly simple way. Finally, human learners deal gracefully with noise and exceptions, and our language provides a simple way to handle exceptions. Any concrete proposal about the language of thought should make predictions about memory, learning and reasoning. Suppose that data set D lists the extensions of one or more predicates, and that a theory is a “candidate theory” for D if it correctly deﬁnes the extensions of all predicates in D. Note that a candidate theory may well include latent predicates—predicates that do not appear in D, but are useful for deﬁning the predicates that have been observed. We will assume that humans encode D in terms of the simplest candidate theory for D, and that the difﬁculty of memorizing D is determined by the subjective complexity of this theory. Our approach can and should be tested against classic results from the memory literature. Unlike some other approaches to complexity [10], for instance, our model predicts that a sequence of k items is about equally easy to remember regardless of whether the items are drawn from a set of size 2, a set of size 10, or a set of size 1000 [11]. 1 The extension of P+ is the smallest set that satisﬁes all of the clauses that deﬁne P+ , and the extension of P is deﬁned similarly. To simplify our notation, Fig. 1 uses P to refer to both P and P+ , and ¯ to refer to ¯ and P P P− . Any instance of P that appears in a clause deﬁning P is really an instance of P+ , and any instance of ¯ that P appears in a clause deﬁning ¯ is really an instance of P− . P 2 MDL approaches also commit to a speciﬁc language, but this language is often intended to be as general as possible. See, for instance, the discussion of universal codes in Gr¨ nwald et al. [7]. u 3 A conjunctive concept C(·) can be deﬁned using a single clause: C(X) ← A(X), B(X). The shortest deﬁnition of a disjunctive concept requires two clauses: D(X) ← A(X). D(X) ← B(X). − 3 To develop a model of inductive learning and reasoning, we take a Bayesian approach, and use our complexity measure to deﬁne a prior distribution over a hypothesis space of theories: P (T ) ∝ 2−c(T ) .4 Given this prior distribution, we can use Bayesian inference to make predictions about unobserved relations and to discover the theory T that best accounts for the observations in data set D [12, 13]. Suppose that we have a likelihood function P (D|T ) which speciﬁes how the examples in D were generated from some underlying theory T . The best explanation for the data D is the theory that maximizes the posterior distribution P (T |D) ∝ P (D|T )P (T ). If we need to predict whether ground term g is likely to be true, 5 we can sum over the space of theories: P (g|D) = P (g|T )P (T |D) = T 1 P (D) P (D|T )P (T ) (2) T :g∈T where the ﬁnal sum is over all theories T that make ground term g true. 1.1 Related work The theories we consider are closely related to logic programs, and methods for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) explore how these programs can be learned from examples [14]. ILP algorithms are often inspired by the idea of searching for the shortest theory that accounts for the available data, and ILP is occasionally cast as the problem of minimizing an explicit MDL criterion [10]. Although ILP algorithms are rarely considered as cognitive models, the RL approach has a long psychological history, and is proposed by Chomsky [15] and Leeuwenberg [16] among others. Formal measures of complexity have been developed in many ﬁelds [17], and there is at least one other psychological account of theory complexity. Goodman [1] developed a complexity measure that was originally a philosophical proposal about scientiﬁc theories, but was later tested as a model of subjective complexity [6]. A detailed description of this measure is not possible here, but we attempt to give a ﬂavor of the approach. Suppose that a basis is a set of predicates. The starting point for Goodman’s model is the intuition that basis B1 is at least as complex as basis B2 if B1 can be used to deﬁne B2. Goodman argues that this intuition is ﬂawed, but his model is founded on a reﬁnement of this intuition. For instance, since the binary predicate in Fig. 1b can be deﬁned in terms of two unary predicates, Goodman’s approach requires that the complexity of the binary predicate is no more than the sum of the complexities of the two unary predicates. We will use Goodman’s model as a baseline for evaluating our own approach, and a comparison between these two models should be informed by both theoretical and empirical considerations. On the theoretical side, our approach relies on a simple principle for deciding which structural properties are relevant to the measurement of complexity: the relevant properties are those with short logical representations. Goodman’s approach incorporates no such principle, and he proposes somewhat arbitrarily that reﬂexivity and symmetry are among the relevant structural properties but that transitivity is not. A second reason for preferring our model is that it makes contact with a general principle—the idea that simplicity is related to representation length—that has found many applications across psychology, machine learning, and philosophy. 2 Experimental results We designed two experiments to explore settings where people learn, remember, and make inductive inferences about relational data. Although theories often consist of systems of many interlocking relations, we keep our experiments simple by asking subjects to learn and reason about a single relation at a time. Despite this restriction, our experiments still make contact with several issues raised by systems of relations. As the defers to(·, ·) example suggests, a single relation may be best explained as the observable tip of a system involving several latent predicates (e.g. caste 1(·) and caste 2(·)). 4 To ensure that this distribution can be normalized, we assume that there is some upper bound on the number of predicate symbols, variable symbols, and constants, and on the length of the theories we will consider. There will therefore be a ﬁnite number of possible theories, and our prior will be a valid probability distribution. 5 A ground term is a term such as R(8, 9) that does not include any variables. 4 Learning time Complexity (RL) Complexity (Human) 6 300 Complexity (Goodman) 4 20 0 0 0 star bprt excp sym trans rand 2 0 star bprt excp sym trans rand 2 star bprt excp sym trans rand 100 200 star bprt excp sym trans rand 4 40 Figure 2: (a) Average time in seconds to learn the six sets in Fig. 1.

Materials and Methods. 18 adults participated in this experiment. Subjects were required to learn the 6 sets shown in Fig. 1, and to make inductive inferences about each set. Although Fig. 1 shows pairs of digits, the experiment used letter pairs, and the letters for each condition and the order in which these conditions were presented were randomized across subjects. The pairs for each condition were initially laid out randomly on screen, and subjects could drag them around and organize them to help them understand the structure of the set. At any stage, subjects could enter a test phase where they were asked to list the 15 pairs belonging to the current set. Subjects who made an error on the test were returned to the learning phase. After 9 minutes had elapsed, subjects were allowed to pass the test regardless of how many errors they made. After passing the test, subjects were asked to rate the complexity of the set compared to other sets with 15 pairs. Ratings were provided on a 7 point scale. Subjects were then asked to imagine that a new letter (e.g. letter 9) had belonged to the current alphabet, and were given two inductive tasks. First they were asked to enter between 1 and 10 novel pairs that they might have expected to see (each novel pair was required to include the new letter). Next they were told about a novel pair that belonged to the set (e.g. pair 91), and were again asked to enter up to 10 additional pairs that they might have expected to see. Results. The average time needed to learn each set is shown in Fig. 2a, and ratings of set complexity are shown in Fig. 2b. It is encouraging that these measures yield converging results, but they may be confounded since subjects rated the complexity of a set immediately after learning it. The complexities plotted in Fig. 2c are the complexities of the theories shown in Fig. 1, which we believe to be the simplest theories according to our complexity measure. The ﬁnal plot in Fig. 2 shows complexities according to Goodman’s model, which assigns each binary relation an integer between 0 and 4. There are several differences between these models: for instance, Goodman’s account incorrectly predicts that the exception case is the hardest of the six, but our model acknowledges that a simple theory remains simple if a handful of exceptions are added. Goodman’s account also predicts that transitivity is not an important structural regularity, but our model correctly predicts that the transitive set is simpler than the same set with some of the pairs reversed (the random set). Results for the inductive task are shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst two columns show the number of subjects who listed each novel pair. The remaining two columns show the probability of set membership predicted by our model. To generate these predictions, we applied Equation 2 and summed over a set of theories created by systematically extending the theories shown in Fig. 1. Each extended theory includes up to one additional clause for each predicate in the base theory, and each additional clause includes at most two predicate slots. For instance, each extended theory for the bipartite case is created by choosing whether or not to add the clause T(9), and adding up to one clause for predicate R.6 For the ﬁrst inductive task, the likelihood term P (D|T ) (see Equation 2) is set to 0 for all theories that are not consistent with the pairs observed during training, and to a constant for all remaining theories. For the second task we assumed in addition that the novel pair observed is 6 R(9, X), ¯(2, 9), and R(X, 9) ← R(X, 2) are three possible additions.

Columns 2 and 4 show predictions after a single novel pair (marked with a gray bar) is observed to belong to the set. The model plots for each condition include correlations with the human data. sampled at random from all pairs involving the new letter.7 All model predictions were computed using Mace4 [18] to generate the extension of each theory considered. The supporting material includes predictions for a model based on the Goodman complexity measure and an exemplar model which assumes that the new letter will be just like one of the old letters.8 The exemplar model outperforms our model in the random condition, and makes accurate predictions about three other conditions. Overall, however, our model performs better than the two baselines. Here we focus on two important predictions that are not well handled by the exemplar model. In the symmetry condition, almost all subjects predict that 78 belongs to the set after learning that 87 belongs to the set, suggesting that they have learned an abstract rule. In the transitive condition, most subjects predict that pairs 72 through 76 belong to the set after learning that 71 belongs to the set. Our model accounts for this result, but the exemplar model has no basis for making predictions about letter 7, since this letter is now known to be unlike any of the others. 2.2 Experiment 2: learning from positive examples During the learning phase of our ﬁrst experiment, subjects learned a theory based on positive examples (the theory included all pairs they had seen) and negative examples (the theory ruled out all pairs they had not seen). Often, however, humans learn theories based on positive examples alone. Suppose, for instance, that our anthropologist has spent only a few hours with a new tribe. She may have observed several pairs who are obviously friends, but should realize that many other pairs of friends have not yet interacted in her presence. 7 For the second task, P (D|T ) is set to 0 for theories that are inconsistent with the training pairs and theories 1 which do not include the observed novel pair. For all remaining theories, P (D|T ) is set to n , where n is the total number of novel pairs that are consistent with T . 8 Supporting material is available at www.charleskemp.com 6 1 221 331 441 551 c) 7 1 R(X, X, Y). 221 443 552 663 d) 7 1 R(X, Y, Z). 231 456 615 344 e) 7 1 −10 −5 −0.1 −10 −20 −20 −10 −0.2 −20 777 771 778 789 237 777 771 778 789 237 −10 231 234 235 236 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 RL 0 R(2, 3, X). 777 771 778 789 237 7 R(X, X, 1). 777 771 778 789 237 b) 777 771 778 789 237 1 111 222 333 444 777 771 778 789 237 7 R(X, X, X). 777 771 778 789 237 Human a) Figure 4: Data and model predictions for Experiment 2. The four triples observed for each set are shown at the top of the ﬁgure. The ﬁrst row of plots shows average ratings on a scale from 1 (very unlikely to belong to the set) to 7 (very likely). Model predictions are plotted as log probabilities. Our framework can handle cases like these if we assume that the data D in Equation 2 are sampled from the ground terms that are true according to the underlying theory. We follow [10] and [13] and use a distribution P (D|T ) which assumes that the examples in D are randomly sampled with replacement from the ground terms that are true. This sampling assumption encourages our model to identify the theory with the smallest extension that is compatible with all of the training examples. We tested this approach by designing an experiment where learners were given sets of examples that were compatible with several underlying theories. Materials and Methods. 15 adults participated in this experiment immediately after taking Experiment 1. In each of ﬁve conditions, subjects were told about a set of triples built from an alphabet of 9 letters. They were shown four triples that belonged to the set (Fig. 4), and told that the set might include triples that they had not seen. Subjects then gave ratings on a seven point scale to indicate whether ﬁve additional triples (see Fig. 4) were likely to belong to the set. Results. Average ratings and model predictions are shown in Fig. 4. Model predictions for each condition were computed using Equation 2 and summing over a space of theories that included the ﬁve theories shown at the top of Fig. 4, variants of these ﬁve theories which stated that certain pairs of slots could not be occupied by the same constant,9 and theories that included no variables but merely enumerated up to 5 triples.10 Although there are general theories like R(X, Y, Z) that are compatible with the triples observed in all ﬁve conditions, Fig. 4 shows that people were sensitive to different regularities in each case.11 We focus on one condition (Fig. 4b) that exposes the strengths and weaknesses of our model. According to our model, the two most probable theories given the triples for this condition are R(X, X, 1) and the closely related variant that rules out R(1, 1, 1). The next most probable theory is R(X, X, Y). These predictions are consistent with people’s judgments that 771 is very likely to belong to the set, and that 778 is the next most likely option. Unlike our model, however, people consider 777 to be substantially less likely than 778 to belong to the set. This result may suggest that the variant of R(X, X, Y) that rules out R(X, X, X) deserves a higher prior probability than our model recognizes. To better account for cases like this, it may be worth considering languages where any two variables that belong to the same clause but have different names must refer to different entities. 3 Discussion and Conclusion There are many psychological models of concept learning [4, 12, 13], but few that use representations rich enough to capture the content of intuitive theories. We suggested that intuitive theories are mentally represented in a ﬁrst-order logical language, and proposed a speciﬁc hypothesis about 9 ¯ One such theory includes two clauses: R(X, X, Y). R(X, X, X). One such theory is the following list of clauses: R(2, 2, 1). R(3, 3, 1). R(4, 4, 1). R(5, 5, 1). R(7, 7, 7). 11 Similar results have been found with 9-month old infants. Cases like Figs. 4b and 4c have been tested in an infant language-learning study where the stimuli were three-syllable strings [19]. 9-month old infants exposed to strings like the four in Fig. 4c generalized to other strings consistent with the theory R(X, X, Y), but infants in the condition corresponding to Fig. 4b generalized only to strings consistent with the theory R(X, X, 1). 10 7 this “language of thought.” We assumed that the subjective complexity of a theory depends on the length of its representation in this language, and described experiments which suggest that the resulting complexity measure helps to explain how theories are learned and used for inductive inference. Our experiments deliberately used stimuli that minimize the inﬂuence of prior knowledge. Theories, however, are cumulative, and the theory that seems simplest to a learner will often depend on her background knowledge. Our approach provides a natural place for background knowledge to be inserted. A learner can be supplied with a stock of background predicates, and the shortest representation for a data set will depend on which background predicates are available. Since different sets of predicates will lead to different predictions about subjective complexity, empirical results can help to determine the background knowledge that people bring to a given class of problems. Future work should aim to reﬁne the representation language and complexity measure we proposed. We expect that something like our approach will be suitable for modeling a broad class of intuitive theories, but the speciﬁc framework presented here can almost certainly be improved. Future work should also consider different strategies for searching the space of theories. Some of the strategies developed in the ILP literature should be relevant [14], but a detailed investigation of search algorithms seems premature until our approach has held up to additional empirical tests. It is comparatively easy to establish whether the theories that are simple according to our approach are also considered simple by people, and our experiments have made a start in this direction. It is much harder to establish that our approach captures most of the theories that are subjectively simple, and more exhaustive experiments are needed before this conclusion can be drawn. Boolean concept learning has been studied for more than ﬁfty years [4, 9], and many psychologists have made empirical and theoretical contributions to this ﬁeld. An even greater effort will be needed to crack the problem of theory learning, since the space of intuitive theories is much richer than the space of Boolean concepts. The difﬁculty of this problem should not be underestimated, but computational approaches can contribute part of the solution.

<p>Author: Francois Meyer, Greg Stephens</p><p>Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides dynamical access into the complex functioning of the human brain, detailing the hemodynamic activity of thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We ﬁnd that the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-deﬁned Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke’s area for verbal instructions, visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions, with the highest correlation (c ∼ 0.8) between the predicted and experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The interpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual basis upon which to build more sophisticated techniques for fMRI decoding and offers a window into cognitive function during dynamic, natural experience. 1</p><p>4 0.76813447 <a title="122-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_deep_belief_net_model_for_visual_area_V2.html">182 nips-2007-Sparse deep belief net model for visual area V2</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Chaitanya Ekanadham, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the cortex, a number of algorithms have recently been proposed that try to learn hierarchical, or “deep,” structure from unlabeled data. While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their ﬁdelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Speciﬁcally, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the ﬁrst layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge ﬁlters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive ﬁelds. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the ﬁrst layer responses in the data. Speciﬁcally, it picks up both colinear (“contour”) features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex “corner” features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu’s study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features. 1</p><p>5 0.63778603 <a title="122-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Modeling_image_patches_with_a_directed_hierarchy_of_Markov_random_fields.html">132 nips-2007-Modeling image patches with a directed hierarchy of Markov random fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Osindero, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe an efﬁcient learning procedure for multilayer generative models that combine the best aspects of Markov random ﬁelds and deep, directed belief nets. The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images. 1</p><p>6 0.5668776 <a title="122-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Visual_Attributes.html">113 nips-2007-Learning Visual Attributes</a></p>

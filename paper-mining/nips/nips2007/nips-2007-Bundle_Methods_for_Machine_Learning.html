<p>Author: Kristiaan Pelckmans, Johan Suykens, Bart D. Moor</p><p>Abstract: This paper1 explores the use of a Maximal Average Margin (MAM) optimality principle for the design of learning algorithms. It is shown that the application of this risk minimization principle results in a class of (computationally) simple learning machines similar to the classical Parzen window classiﬁer. A direct relation with the Rademacher complexities is established, as such facilitating analysis and providing a notion of certainty of prediction. This analysis is related to Support Vector Machines by means of a margin transformation. The power of the MAM principle is illustrated further by application to ordinal regression tasks, resulting in an O(n) algorithm able to process large datasets in reasonable time. 1</p><p>3 0.12995408 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Incremental_Natural_Actor-Critic_Algorithms.html">102 nips-2007-Incremental Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shalabh Bhatnagar, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Mark Lee, Richard S. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: We present four new reinforcement learning algorithms based on actor-critic and natural-gradient ideas, and provide their convergence proofs. Actor-critic reinforcement learning methods are online approximations to policy iteration in which the value-function parameters are estimated using temporal difference learning and the policy parameters are updated by stochastic gradient descent. Methods based on policy gradients in this way are of special interest because of their compatibility with function approximation methods, which are needed to handle large or inﬁnite state spaces. The use of temporal difference learning in this way is of interest because in many applications it dramatically reduces the variance of the gradient estimates. The use of the natural gradient is of interest because it can produce better conditioned parameterizations and has been shown to further reduce variance in some cases. Our results extend prior two-timescale convergence results for actor-critic methods by Konda and Tsitsiklis by using temporal difference learning in the actor and by incorporating natural gradients, and they extend prior empirical studies of natural actor-critic methods by Peters, Vijayakumar and Schaal by providing the ﬁrst convergence proofs and the ﬁrst fully incremental algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.11716329 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Stable_Dual_Dynamic_Programming.html">185 nips-2007-Stable Dual Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>6 0.10764451 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Learning_with_Invariances.html">62 nips-2007-Convex Learning with Invariances</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying, Charles A. Micchelli</p><p>Abstract: Learning the common structure shared by a set of supervised tasks is an important practical and theoretical problem. Knowledge of this structure may lead to better generalization performance on the tasks and may also facilitate learning new tasks. We propose a framework for solving this problem, which is based on regularization with spectral functions of matrices. This class of regularization problems exhibits appealing computational properties and can be optimized efﬁciently by an alternating minimization algorithm. In addition, we provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for convexity of the regularizer. We analyze concrete examples of the framework, which are equivalent to regularization with Lp matrix norms. Experiments on two real data sets indicate that the algorithm scales well with the number of tasks and improves on state of the art statistical performance. 1</p><p>4 0.45052537 <a title="40-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Parallelizing_Support_Vector_Machines_on_Distributed_Computers.html">152 nips-2007-Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaihua Zhu, Hao Wang, Hongjie Bai, Jian Li, Zhihuan Qiu, Hang Cui, Edward Y. Chang</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) suffer from a widely recognized scalability problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability, we have developed a parallel SVM algorithm (PSVM), which reduces memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization, and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is signiﬁcantly smaller than n), and m the number of machines. PSVM reduces the memory requirement from O(n2 ) to O(np/m), and improves computation time to O(np2 /m). Empirical study shows PSVM to be effective.

<p>Author: Sebastian Gerwinn, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Generalized linear models are the most commonly used tools to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of such models. Using the expectation propagation algorithm, we are able to approximate the full posterior distribution over all weights. In addition, we use a Laplacian prior to favor sparse solutions. Therefore, stimulus features that do not critically inﬂuence neural activity will be assigned zero weights and thus be effectively excluded by the model. This feature selection mechanism facilitates both the interpretation of the neuron model as well as its predictive abilities. The posterior distribution can be used to obtain conﬁdence intervals which makes it possible to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the solution. In neural data analysis, the available amount of experimental measurements is often limited whereas the parameter space is large. In such a situation, both regularization by a sparsity prior and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters are essential. We apply our method to multi-electrode recordings of retinal ganglion cells and use our uncertainty estimate to test the statistical signiﬁcance of functional couplings between neurons. Furthermore we used the sparsity of the Laplace prior to select those ﬁlters from a spike-triggered covariance analysis that are most informative about the neural response. 1</p><p>2 0.99706984 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Fast_Variational_Inference_for_Large-scale_Internet_Diagnosis.html">87 nips-2007-Fast Variational Inference for Large-scale Internet Diagnosis</a></p>
<p>Author: Emre Kiciman, David Maltz, John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: Web servers on the Internet need to maintain high reliability, but the cause of intermittent failures of web transactions is non-obvious. We use approximate Bayesian inference to diagnose problems with web services. This diagnosis problem is far larger than any previously attempted: it requires inference of 104 possible faults from 105 observations. Further, such inference must be performed in less than a second. Inference can be done at this speed by combining a mean-ﬁeld variational approximation and the use of stochastic gradient descent to optimize a variational cost function. We use this fast inference to diagnose a time series of anomalous HTTP requests taken from a real web service. The inference is fast enough to analyze network logs with billions of entries in a matter of hours. 1</p><p>3 0.99691105 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-One-Pass_Boosting.html">147 nips-2007-One-Pass Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Zafer Barutcuoglu, Phil Long, Rocco Servedio</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies boosting algorithms that make a single pass over a set of base classiﬁers. We ﬁrst analyze a one-pass algorithm in the setting of boosting with diverse base classiﬁers. Our guarantee is the same as the best proved for any boosting algorithm, but our one-pass algorithm is much faster than previous approaches. We next exhibit a random source of examples for which a “picky” variant of AdaBoost that skips poor base classiﬁers can outperform the standard AdaBoost algorithm, which uses every base classiﬁer, by an exponential factor. Experiments with Reuters and synthetic data show that one-pass boosting can substantially improve on the accuracy of Naive Bayes, and that picky boosting can sometimes lead to a further improvement in accuracy.</p><p>4 0.99654597 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-A_Constraint_Generation_Approach_to_Learning_Stable_Linear_Dynamical_Systems.html">4 nips-2007-A Constraint Generation Approach to Learning Stable Linear Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Byron Boots, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sajid M. Siddiqi</p><p>Abstract: Stability is a desirable characteristic for linear dynamical systems, but it is often ignored by algorithms that learn these systems from data. We propose a novel method for learning stable linear dynamical systems: we formulate an approximation of the problem as a convex program, start with a solution to a relaxed version of the program, and incrementally add constraints to improve stability. Rather than continuing to generate constraints until we reach a feasible solution, we test stability at each step; because the convex program is only an approximation of the desired problem, this early stopping rule can yield a higher-quality solution. We apply our algorithm to the task of learning dynamic textures from image sequences as well as to modeling biosurveillance drug-sales data. The constraint generation approach leads to noticeable improvement in the quality of simulated sequences. We compare our method to those of Lacy and Bernstein [1, 2], with positive results in terms of accuracy, quality of simulated sequences, and efﬁciency. 1</p><p>5 0.99296987 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Discriminative_Log-Linear_Grammars_with_Latent_Variables.html">72 nips-2007-Discriminative Log-Linear Grammars with Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Slav Petrov, Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that log-linear grammars with latent variables can be practically trained using discriminative methods. Central to efﬁcient discriminative training is a hierarchical pruning procedure which allows feature expectations to be efﬁciently approximated in a gradient-based procedure. We compare L1 and L2 regularization and show that L1 regularization is superior, requiring fewer iterations to converge, and yielding sparser solutions. On full-scale treebank parsing experiments, the discriminative latent models outperform both the comparable generative latent models as well as the discriminative non-latent baselines.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.98476928 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Bundle_Methods_for_Machine_Learning.html">40 nips-2007-Bundle Methods for Machine Learning</a></p>

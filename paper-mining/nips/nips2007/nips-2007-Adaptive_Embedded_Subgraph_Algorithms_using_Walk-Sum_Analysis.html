<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, Yi Mao</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models on full and partial rankings of n items are often of limited practical use for large n due to computational consideration. We explore the use of non-parametric models for partially ranked data and derive efﬁcient procedures for their use for large n.

In this paper we investigate the use of the max-product form of belief propagation for weighted matching problems on general graphs.

This provides an exact characterization of max-product performance and reveals connections to the widely used optimization technique of LP relaxation.

<p>Author: Ozgur Sumer, Umut Acar, Alexander T. Ihler, Ramgopal R. Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by stochastic systems in which observed evidence and conditional dependencies between states of the network change over time, and certain quantities of interest (marginal distributions, likelihood estimates etc.) must be updated, we study the problem of adaptive inference in tree-structured Bayesian networks. We describe an algorithm for adaptive inference that handles a broad range of changes to the network and is able to maintain marginal distributions, MAP estimates, and data likelihoods in all expected logarithmic time. We give an implementation of our algorithm and provide experiments that show that the algorithm can yield up to two orders of magnitude speedups on answering queries and responding to dynamic changes over the sum-product algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.10081007 <a title="20-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Progressive_mixture_rules_are_deviation_suboptimal.html">159 nips-2007-Progressive mixture rules are deviation suboptimal</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean-yves Audibert</p><p>Abstract: We consider the learning task consisting in predicting as well as the best function in a ﬁnite reference set G up to the smallest possible additive term. If R(g) denotes the generalization error of a prediction function g, under reasonable assumptions on the loss function (typically satisﬁed by the least square loss when the output is bounded), it is known that the progressive mixture rule g satisﬁes ˆ log |G| (1) ER(ˆ) ≤ ming∈G R(g) + Cst g , n where n denotes the size of the training set, and E denotes the expectation w.r.t. the training set distribution.This work shows that, surprisingly, for appropriate reference sets G, the deviation convergence rate of the progressive mixture rule is √ no better than Cst / n: it fails to achieve the expected Cst /n. We also provide an algorithm which does not suffer from this drawback, and which is optimal in both deviation and expectation convergence rates. 1</p><p>6 0.08518555 <a title="20-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Local_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Inference_in_Minor-Excluded_Graphs.html">121 nips-2007-Local Algorithms for Approximate Inference in Minor-Excluded Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real world problems, such as voting, rankings and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact representations such as graphical models cannot efﬁciently capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the “low-frequency” terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent such distributions compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a general and efﬁcient approach for maintaining these distributions directly in the Fourier domain. Low order Fourier-based approximations can lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present an efﬁcient quadratic program deﬁned directly in the Fourier domain to project the approximation onto a relaxed form of the marginal polytope. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-people tracking setting. 1</p><p>4 0.49185044 <a title="20-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Local_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Inference_in_Minor-Excluded_Graphs.html">121 nips-2007-Local Algorithms for Approximate Inference in Minor-Excluded Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyomin Jung, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: We present a new local approximation algorithm for computing MAP and logpartition function for arbitrary exponential family distribution represented by a ﬁnite-valued pair-wise Markov random ﬁeld (MRF), say G. Our algorithm is based on decomposing G into appropriately chosen small components; computing estimates locally in each of these components and then producing a good global solution. We prove that the algorithm can provide approximate solution within arbitrary accuracy when G excludes some ﬁnite sized graph as its minor and G has bounded degree: all Planar graphs with bounded degree are examples of such graphs. The running time of the algorithm is Θ(n) (n is the number of nodes in G), with constant dependent on accuracy, degree of graph and size of the graph that is excluded as a minor (constant for Planar graphs). Our algorithm for minor-excluded graphs uses the decomposition scheme of Klein, Plotkin and Rao (1993). In general, our algorithm works with any decomposition scheme and provides quantiﬁable approximation guarantee that depends on the decomposition scheme.</p><p>5 0.47477841 <a title="20-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Principled_Learning_of_Thin_Junction_Trees.html">78 nips-2007-Efficient Principled Learning of Thin Junction Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Anton Chechetka, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: We present the ﬁrst truly polynomial algorithm for PAC-learning the structure of bounded-treewidth junction trees – an attractive subclass of probabilistic graphical models that permits both the compact representation of probability distributions and efﬁcient exact inference. For a constant treewidth, our algorithm has polynomial time and sample complexity. If a junction tree with sufﬁciently strong intraclique dependencies exists, we provide strong theoretical guarantees in terms of KL divergence of the result from the true distribution. We also present a lazy extension of our approach that leads to very signiﬁcant speed ups in practice, and demonstrate the viability of our method empirically, on several real world datasets. One of our key new theoretical insights is a method for bounding the conditional mutual information of arbitrarily large sets of variables with only polynomially many mutual information computations on ﬁxed-size subsets of variables, if the underlying distribution can be approximated by a bounded-treewidth junction tree. 1</p><p>6 0.46780434 <a title="20-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Collective_Inference_on_Markov_Models_for_Modeling_Bird_Migration.html">48 nips-2007-Collective Inference on Markov Models for Modeling Bird Migration</a></p>

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, Ben Taskar, João Gama</p><p>Abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a widely used maximum likelihood estimation procedure for statistical models when the values of some of the variables in the model are not observed. Very often, however, our aim is primarily to ﬁnd a model that assigns values to the latent variables that have intended meaning for our data and maximizing expected likelihood only sometimes accomplishes this. Unfortunately, it is typically difﬁcult to add even simple a-priori information about latent variables in graphical models without making the models overly complex or intractable. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient, principled way to inject rich constraints on the posteriors of latent variables into the EM algorithm. Our method can be used to learn tractable graphical models that satisfy additional, otherwise intractable constraints. Focusing on clustering and the alignment problem for statistical machine translation, we show that simple, intuitive posterior constraints can greatly improve the performance over standard baselines and be competitive with more complex, intractable models. 1</p><p>2 0.89419591 <a title="20-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Object_Recognition_by_Scene_Alignment.html">143 nips-2007-Object Recognition by Scene Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba, Ce Liu, Rob Fergus, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Current object recognition systems can only recognize a limited number of object categories; scaling up to many categories is the next challenge. We seek to build a system to recognize and localize many different object categories in complex scenes. We achieve this through a simple approach: by matching the input image, in an appropriate representation, to images in a large training set of labeled images. Due to regularities in object identities across similar scenes, the retrieved matches provide hypotheses for object identities and locations. We build a probabilistic model to transfer the labels from the retrieval set to the input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and study algorithm component contributions using held-out test sets from the LabelMe database. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.88799578 <a title="20-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Adaptive_Embedded_Subgraph_Algorithms_using_Walk-Sum_Analysis.html">20 nips-2007-Adaptive Embedded Subgraph Algorithms using Walk-Sum Analysis</a></p>

Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the use of message-passing algorithms for the problem of ﬁnding the max-weight independent set (MWIS) in a graph. First, we study the performance of loopy max-product belief propagation. We show that, if it converges, the quality of the estimate is closely related to the tightness of an LP relaxation of the MWIS problem. We use this relationship to obtain sufﬁcient conditions for correctness of the estimate. We then develop a modiﬁcation of max-product – one that converges to an optimal solution of the dual of the MWIS problem. We also develop a simple iterative algorithm for estimating the max-weight independent set from this dual solution. We show that the MWIS estimate obtained using these two algorithms in conjunction is correct when the graph is bipartite and the MWIS is unique. Finally, we show that any problem of MAP estimation for probability distributions over ﬁnite domains can be reduced to an MWIS problem. We believe this reduction will yield new insights and algorithms for MAP estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.8644526 <a title="20-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>

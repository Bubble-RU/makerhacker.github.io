<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>3 0.16144449 <a title="3-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Comparing_Bayesian_models_for_multisensory_cue_combination_without_mandatory_integration.html">51 nips-2007-Comparing Bayesian models for multisensory cue combination without mandatory integration</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrik Beierholm, Ladan Shams, Wei J. Ma, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian models of multisensory perception traditionally address the problem of estimating an underlying variable that is assumed to be the cause of the two sensory signals. The brain, however, has to solve a more general problem: it also has to establish which signals come from the same source and should be integrated, and which ones do not and should be segregated. In the last couple of years, a few models have been proposed to solve this problem in a Bayesian fashion. One of these has the strength that it formalizes the causal structure of sensory signals. We ﬁrst compare these models on a formal level. Furthermore, we conduct a psychophysics experiment to test human performance in an auditory-visual spatial localization task in which integration is not mandatory. We ﬁnd that the causal Bayesian inference model accounts for the data better than other models. Keywords: causal inference, Bayesian methods, visual perception. 1 Multisensory perception In the ventriloquist illusion, a performer speaks without moving his/her mouth while moving a puppet’s mouth in synchrony with his/her speech. This makes the puppet appear to be speaking. This illusion was ﬁrst conceptualized as ”visual capture”, occurring when visual and auditory stimuli exhibit a small conﬂict ([1, 2]). Only recently has it been demonstrated that the phenomenon may be seen as a byproduct of a much more ﬂexible and nearly Bayes-optimal strategy ([3]), and therefore is part of a large collection of cue combination experiments showing such statistical near-optimality [4, 5]. In fact, cue combination has become the poster child for Bayesian inference in the nervous system. In previous studies of multisensory integration, two sensory stimuli are presented which act as cues about a single underlying source. For instance, in the auditory-visual localization experiment by Alais and Burr [3], observers were asked to envisage each presentation of a light blob and a sound click as a single event, like a ball hitting the screen. In many cases, however, the brain is not only posed with the problem of identifying the position of a common source, but also of determining whether there was a common source at all. In the on-stage ventriloquist illusion, it is indeed primarily the causal inference process that is being fooled, because veridical perception would attribute independent causes to the auditory and the visual stimulus. 1 To extend our understanding of multisensory perception to this more general problem, it is necessary to manipulate the degree of belief assigned to there being a common cause within a multisensory task. Intuitively, we expect that when two signals are very different, they are less likely to be perceived as having a common source. It is well-known that increasing the discrepancy or inconsistency between stimuli reduces the inﬂuence that they have on each other [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In auditoryvisual spatial localization, one variable that controls stimulus similarity is spatial disparity (another would be temporal disparity). Indeed, it has been reported that increasing spatial disparity leads to a decrease in auditory localization bias [1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 2, 18, 19, 20, 21]. This decrease also correlates with a decrease in the reports of unity [19, 21]. Despite the abundance of experimental data on this issue, no general theory exists that can explain multisensory perception across a wide range of cue conﬂicts. 2 Models The success of Bayesian models for cue integration has motivated attempts to extend them to situations of large sensory conﬂict and a consequent low degree of integration. In one of recent studies taking this approach, subjects were presented with concurrent visual ﬂashes and auditory beeps and asked to count both the number of ﬂashes and the number of beeps [11]. The advantage of the experimental paradigm adopted here was that it probed the joint response distribution by requiring a dual report. Human data were accounted for well by a Bayesian model in which the joint prior distribution over visual and auditory number was approximated from the data. In a similar study, subjects were presented with concurrent ﬂashes and taps and asked to count either the ﬂashes or the taps [9, 22]. The Bayesian model proposed by these authors assumed a joint prior distribution with a near-diagonal form. The corresponding generative model assumes that the sensory sources somehow interact with one another. A third experiment modulated the rates of ﬂashes and beeps. The task was to judge either the visual or the auditory modulation rate relative to a standard [23]. The data from this experiment were modeled using a joint prior distribution which is the sum of a near-diagonal prior and a ﬂat background. While all these models are Bayesian in a formal sense, their underlying generative model does not formalize the model selection process that underlies the combination of cues. This makes it necessary to either estimate an empirical prior [11] by ﬁtting it to human behavior or to assume an ad hoc form [22, 23]. However, we believe that such assumptions are not needed. It was shown recently that human judgments of spatial unity in an auditory-visual spatial localization task can be described using a Bayesian inference model that infers causal structure [24, 25]. In this model, the brain does not only estimate a stimulus variable, but also infers the probability that the two stimuli have a common cause. In this paper we compare these different models on a large data set of human position estimates in an auditory-visual task. In this section we ﬁrst describe the traditional cue integration model, then the recent models based on joint stimulus priors, and ﬁnally the causal inference model. To relate to the experiment in the next section, we will use the terminology of auditory-visual spatial localization, but the formalism is very general. 2.1 Traditional cue integration The traditional generative model of cue integration [26] has a single source location s which produces on each trial an internal representation (cue) of visual location, xV and one of auditory location, xA . We assume that the noise processes by which these internal representations are generated are conditionally independent from each other and follow Gaussian distributions. That is, p (xV |s) ∼ N (xV ; s, σV )and p (xA |s) ∼ N (xA ; s, σA ), where N (x; µ, σ) stands for the normal distribution over x with mean µ and standard deviation σ. If on a given trial the internal representations are xV and xA , the probability that their source was s is given by Bayes’ rule, p (s|xV , xA ) ∝ p (xV |s) p (xA |s) . If a subject performs maximum-likelihood estimation, then the estimate will be xV +wA s = wV wV +wA xA , where wV = σ1 and wA = σ1 . It is important to keep in mind that this is the ˆ 2 2 V A estimate on a single trial. A psychophysical experimenter can never have access to xV and xA , which 2 are the noisy internal representations. Instead, an experimenter will want to collect estimates over many trials and is interested in the distribution of s given sV and sA , which are the sources generated ˆ by the experimenter. In a typical cue combination experiment, xV and xA are not actually generated by the same source, but by different sources, a visual one sV and an auditory one sA . These sources are chosen close to each other so that the subject can imagine that the resulting cues originate from a single source and thus implicitly have a common cause. The experimentally observed distribution is then p (ˆ|sV , sA ) = s p (ˆ|xV , xA ) p (xV |sV ) p (xA |sA ) dxV dxA s Given that s is a linear combination of two normally distributed variables, it will itself follow a ˆ sV +wA 1 2 normal distribution, with mean s = wVwV +wA sA and variance σs = wV +wA . The reason that we ˆ ˆ emphasize this point is because many authors identify the estimate distribution p (ˆ|sV , sA ) with s the posterior distribution p (s|xV , xA ). This is justiﬁed in this case because all distributions are Gaussian and the estimate is a linear combination of cues. However, in the case of causal inference, these conditions are violated and the estimate distribution will in general not be the same as the posterior distribution. 2.2 Models with bisensory stimulus priors Models with bisensory stimulus priors propose the posterior over source positions to be proportional to the product of unimodal likelihoods and a two-dimensional prior: p (sV , sA |xV , xA ) = p (sV , sA ) p (xV |sV ) p (xA |sA ) The traditional cue combination model has p (sV , sA ) = p (sV ) δ (sV − sA ), usually (as above) even with p (sV ) uniform. The question arises what bisensory stimulus prior is appropriate. In [11], the prior is estimated from data, has a large number of parameters, and is therefore limited in its predictive power. In [23], it has the form − (sV −sA )2 p (sV , sA ) ∝ ω + e 2σ 2 coupling while in [22] the additional assumption ω = 0 is made1 . In all three models, the response distribution p (ˆV , sA |sV , sA ) is obtained by idens ˆ tifying it with the posterior distribution p (sV , sA |xV , xA ). This procedure thus implicitly assumes that marginalizing over the latent variables xV and xA is not necessary, which leads to a signiﬁcant error for non-Gaussian priors. In this paper we correctly deal with these issues and in all cases marginalize over the latent variables. The parametric models used for the coupling between the cues lead to an elegant low-dimensional model of cue integration that allows for estimates of single cues that differ from one another. C C=1 SA S XA 2.3 C=2 XV SV XA XV Causal inference model In the causal inference model [24, 25], we start from the traditional cue integration model but remove the assumption that two signals are caused by the same source. Instead, the number of sources can be one or two and is itself a variable that needs to be inferred from the cues. Figure 1: Generative model of causal inference. 1 This family of Bayesian posterior distributions also includes one used to successfully model cue combination in depth perception [27, 28]. In depth perception, however, there is no notion of segregation as always a single surface is assumed. 3 If there are two sources, they are assumed to be independent. Thus, we use the graphical model depicted in Fig. 1. We denote the number of sources by C. The probability distribution over C given internal representations xV and xA is given by Bayes’ rule: p (C|xV , xA ) ∝ p (xV , xA |C) p (C) . In this equation, p (C) is the a priori probability of C. We will denote the probability of a common cause by pcommon , so that p (C = 1) = pcommon and p (C = 2) = 1 − pcommon . The probability of generating xV and xA given C is obtained by inserting a summation over the sources: p (xV , xA |C = 1) = p (xV , xA |s)p (s) ds = p (xV |s) p (xA |s)p (s) ds Here p (s) is a prior for spatial location, which we assume to be distributed as N (s; 0, σP ). Then all three factors in this integral are Gaussians, allowing for an analytic solution: p (xV , xA |C = 1) = 2 2 2 2 2 −xA )2 σP σA √ 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 exp − 1 (xV σ2 σ2 +σ2+xV+σ2+xA σV . 2 σ2 σ2 2π σV σA +σV σP +σA σP V A V P A P For p (xV , xA |C = 2) we realize that xV and xA are independent of each other and thus obtain p (xV , xA |C = 2) = p (xV |sV )p (sV ) dsV p (xA |sA )p (sA ) dsA Again, as all these distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, we obtain an analytic solution, x2 x2 1 1 V A p (xV , xA |C = 2) = exp − 2 σ2 +σ2 + σ2 +σ2 . Now that we have com2 +σ 2 2 +σ 2 p p V A 2π (σV p )(σA p) puted p (C|xV , xA ), the posterior distribution over sources is given by p (si |xV , xA ) = p (si |xV , xA , C) p (C|xV , xA ) C=1,2 where i can be V or A and the posteriors conditioned on C are well-known: p (si |xA , xV , C = 1) = p (xA |si ) p (xV |si ) p (si ) , p (xA |s) p (xV |s) p (s) ds p (si |xA , xV , C = 2) = p (xi |si ) p (si ) p (xi |si ) p (si ) dsi The former is the same as in the case of mandatory integration with a prior, the latter is simply the unimodal posterior in the presence of a prior. Based on the posterior distribution on a given trial, p (si |xV , xA ), an estimate has to be created. For this, we use a sum-squared-error cost func2 2 tion, Cost = p (C = 1|xV , xA ) (ˆ − s) + p (C = 2|xV , xA ) (ˆ − sV or A ) . Then the best s s estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution, for instance for the visual estimation: sV = p (C = 1|xA , xV ) sV,C=1 + p (C = 2|xA , xV ) sV,C=2 ˆ ˆ ˆ where sV,C=1 = ˆ −2 −2 −2 xV σV +xA σA +xP σP −2 −2 −2 σV +σA +σP and sV,C=2 = ˆ −2 −2 xV σV +xP σP . −2 −2 σV +σP If pcommon equals 0 or 1, this estimate reduces to one of the conditioned estimates and is linear in xV and xA . If 0 < pcommon < 1, the estimate is a nonlinear combination of xV and xA , because of the functional form of p (C|xV , xA ). The response distributions, that is the distributions of sV and sA given ˆ ˆ sV and sA over many trials, now cannot be identiﬁed with the posterior distribution on a single trial and cannot be computed analytically either. The correct way to obtain the response distribution is to simulate an experiment numerically. Note that the causal inference model above can also be cast in the form of a bisensory stimulus prior by integrating out the latent variable C, with: p (sA , sV ) = p (C = 1) δ (sA − sV ) p (sA ) + p (sA ) p (sV ) p (C = 2) However, in addition to justifying the form of the interaction between the cues, the causal inference model has the advantage of being based on a generative model that well formalizes salient properties of the world, and it thereby also allows to predict judgments of unity. 4 3 Model performance and comparison To examine the performance of the causal inference model and to compare it to previous models, we performed a human psychophysics experiment in which we adopted the same dual-report paradigm as was used in [11]. Observers were simultaneously presented with a brief visual and also an auditory stimulus, each of which could originate from one of ﬁve locations on an imaginary horizontal line (-10◦ , -5◦ , 0◦ , 5◦ , or 10◦ with respect to the ﬁxation point). Auditory stimuli were 32 ms of white noise ﬁltered through an individually calibrated head related transfer function (HRTF) and presented through a pair of headphones, whereas the visual stimuli were high contrast Gabors on a noisy background presented on a 21-inch CRT monitor. Observers had to report by means of a key press (1-5) the perceived positions of both the visual and the auditory stimulus. Each combination of locations was presented with the same frequency over the course of the experiment. In this way, for each condition, visual and auditory response histograms were obtained. We obtained response distributions for each the three models described above by numeral simulation. On each trial, estimation is followed by a step in which, the key is selected which corresponds to the position closed to the best estimate. The simulated histograms obtained in this way were compared to the measured response frequencies of all subjects by computing the R2 statistic. Auditory response Auditory model Visual response Visual model no vision The parameters in the causal inference model were optimized using fminsearch in MATLAB to maximize R2 . The best combination of parameters yielded an R2 of 0.97. The response frequencies are depicted in Fig. 2. The bisensory prior models also explain most of the variance, with R2 = 0.96 for the Roach model and R2 = 0.91 for the Bresciani model. This shows that it is possible to model cue combination for large disparities well using such models. no audio 1 0 Figure 2: A comparison between subjects’ performance and the causal inference model.

Model predictions is indicated by the red and blue dotted line. 5 3.1 Model comparison To facilitate quantitative comparison with other models, we now ﬁt the parameters of each model2 to individual subject data, maximizing the likelihood of the model, i.e., the probability of the response frequencies under the model. The causal inference model ﬁts human data better than the other models. Compared to the best ﬁt of the causal inference model, the Bresciani model has a maximal log likelihood ratio (base e) of the data of −22 ± 6 (mean ± s.e.m. over subjects), and the Roach model has a maximal log likelihood ratio of the data of −18 ± 6. A causal inference model that maximizes the probability of being correct instead of minimizing the mean squared error has a maximal log likelihood ratio of −18 ± 3. These values are considered decisive evidence in favor of the causal inference model that minimizes the mean squared error (for details, see [25]). The parameter values found in the likelihood optimization of the causal model are as follows: pcommon = 0.28 ± 0.05, σV = 2.14 ± 0.22◦ , σA = 9.2 ± 1.1◦ , σP = 12.3 ± 1.1◦ (mean ± s.e.m. over subjects). We see that there is a relatively low prior probability of a common cause. In this paradigm, auditory localization is considerably less precise than visual localization. Also, there is a weak prior for central locations. 3.2 Localization bias A useful quantity to gain more insight into the structure of multisensory data is the cross-modal bias. In our experiment, relative auditory bias is deﬁned as the difference between the mean auditory estimate in a given condition and the real auditory position, divided by the difference between the real visual position and the real auditory position in this condition. If the inﬂuence of vision on the auditory estimate is strong, then the relative auditory bias will be high (close to one). It is well-known that bias decreases with spatial disparity and our experiment is no exception (solid line in Fig. 3; data were combined between positive and negative disparities). It can easily be shown that a traditional cue integration model would predict a bias equal to σ2 −1 , which would be close to 1 and 1 + σV 2 A independent of disparity, unlike the data. This shows that a mandatory integration model is an insufﬁcient model of multisensory interactions. 45 % Auditory Bias We used the individual subject ﬁttings from above and and averaged the auditory bias values obtained from those ﬁts (i.e. we did not ﬁt the bias data themselves). Fits are shown in Fig. 3 (dashed lines). We applied a paired t-test to the differences between the 5◦ and 20◦ disparity conditions (model-subject comparison). Using a double-sided test, the null hypothesis that the difference between the bias in the 5◦ and 20◦ conditions is correctly predicted by each model is rejected for the Bresciani model (p < 0.002) and the Roach model (p < 0.042) and accepted for the causal inference model (p > 0.17). Alternatively, with a single-sided test, the hypothesis is rejected for the Bresciani model (p < 0.001) and the Roach model (p < 0.021) and accepted for the causal inference model (> 0.9). 50 40 35 30 25 20 5 10 15 Spatial Disparity (deg.) 20 Figure 3: Auditory bias as a function of spatial disparity. Solid blue line: data. Red: Causal inference model. Green: Model by Roach et al. [23]. Purple: Model by Bresciani et al. [22]. Models were optimized on response frequencies (as in Fig. 2), not on the bias data. The reason that the Bresciani model fares worst is that its prior distribution does not include a component that corresponds to independent causes. On 2 The Roach et al. model has four free parameters (ω,σV , σA , σcoupling ), the Bresciani et al. model has three (σV , σA , σcoupling ), and the causal inference model has four (pcommon ,σV , σA , σP ). We do not consider the Shams et al. model here, since it has many more parameters and it is not immediately clear how in this model the erroneous identiﬁcation of posterior with response distribution can be corrected. 6 the contrary, the prior used in the Roach model contains two terms, one term that is independent of the disparity and one term that decreases with increasing disparity. It is thus functionally somewhat similar to the causal inference model. 4 Discussion We have argued that any model of multisensory perception should account not only for situations of small, but also of large conﬂict. In these situations, segregation is more likely, in which the two stimuli are not perceived to have the same cause. Even when segregation occurs, the two stimuli can still inﬂuence each other. We compared three Bayesian models designed to account for situations of large conﬂict by applying them to auditory-visual spatial localization data. We pointed out a common mistake: for nonGaussian bisensory priors without mandatory integration, the response distribution can no longer be identiﬁed with the posterior distribution. After correct implementation of the three models, we found that the causal inference model is superior to the models with ad hoc bisensory priors. This is expected, as the nervous system actually needs to solve the problem of deciding which stimuli have a common cause and which stimuli are unrelated. We have seen that multisensory perception is a suitable tool for studying causal inference. However, the causal inference model also has the potential to quantitatively explain a number of other perceptual phenomena, including perceptual grouping and binding, as well as within-modality cue combination [27, 28]. Causal inference is a universal problem: whenever the brain has multiple pieces of information it must decide if they relate to one another or are independent. As the causal inference model describes how the brain processes probabilistic sensory information, the question arises about the neural basis of these processes. Neural populations encode probability distributions over stimuli through Bayes’ rule, a type of coding known as probabilistic population coding. Recent work has shown how the optimal cue combination assuming a common cause can be implemented in probabilistic population codes through simple linear operations on neural activities [29]. This framework makes essential use of the structure of neural variability and leads to physiological predictions for activity in areas that combine multisensory input, such as the superior colliculus. Computational mechanisms for causal inference are expected have a neural substrate that generalizes these linear operations on population activities. A neural implementation of the causal inference model will open the door to a complete neural theory of multisensory perception. References [1] H.L. Pick, D.H. Warren, and J.C. Hay.

<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: Although theorists have interpreted classical conditioning as a laboratory model of Bayesian belief updating, a recent reanalysis showed that the key features that theoretical models capture about learning are artifacts of averaging over subjects. Rather than learning smoothly to asymptote (reﬂecting, according to Bayesian models, the gradual tradeoff from prior to posterior as data accumulate), subjects learn suddenly and their predictions ﬂuctuate perpetually. We suggest that abrupt and unstable learning can be modeled by assuming subjects are conducting inference using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with a small number of samples — one, in our simulations. Ensemble behavior resembles exact Bayesian models since, as in particle ﬁlters, it averages over many samples. Further, the model is capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviors like retrospective revaluation at the ensemble level, even given minimally sophisticated individuals that do not track uncertainty in their beliefs over trials. 1</p><p>5 0.1106744 <a title="3-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Inferring_Elapsed_Time_from_Stochastic_Neural_Processes.html">103 nips-2007-Inferring Elapsed Time from Stochastic Neural Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Misha Ahrens, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Many perceptual processes and neural computations, such as speech recognition, motor control and learning, depend on the ability to measure and mark the passage of time. However, the processes that make such temporal judgements possible are unknown. A number of different hypothetical mechanisms have been advanced, all of which depend on the known, temporally predictable evolution of a neural or psychological state, possibly through oscillations or the gradual decay of a memory trace. Alternatively, judgements of elapsed time might be based on observations of temporally structured, but stochastic processes. Such processes need not be speciﬁc to the sense of time; typical neural and sensory processes contain at least some statistical structure across a range of time scales. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of an estimator of elapsed time which is based on a simple family of stochastic process. 1</p><p>6 0.1077805 <a title="3-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Learning_and_using_relational_theories.html">114 nips-2007-Learning and using relational theories</a></p>

<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel noisy-logical distribution for representing the distribution of a binary output variable conditioned on multiple binary input variables. The distribution is represented in terms of noisy-or’s and noisy-and-not’s of causal features which are conjunctions of the binary inputs. The standard noisy-or and noisy-andnot models, used in causal reasoning and artiﬁcial intelligence, are special cases of the noisy-logical distribution. We prove that the noisy-logical distribution is complete in the sense that it can represent all conditional distributions provided a sufﬁcient number of causal factors are used. We illustrate the noisy-logical distribution by showing that it can account for new experimental ﬁndings on how humans perform causal reasoning in complex contexts. We speculate on the use of the noisy-logical distribution for causal reasoning and artiﬁcial intelligence.</p><p>3 0.69209284 <a title="3-lsi-3" href="./nips-2007-Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_People.html">125 nips-2007-Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>4 0.67094344 <a title="3-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Comparing_Bayesian_models_for_multisensory_cue_combination_without_mandatory_integration.html">51 nips-2007-Comparing Bayesian models for multisensory cue combination without mandatory integration</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrik Beierholm, Ladan Shams, Wei J. Ma, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian models of multisensory perception traditionally address the problem of estimating an underlying variable that is assumed to be the cause of the two sensory signals. The brain, however, has to solve a more general problem: it also has to establish which signals come from the same source and should be integrated, and which ones do not and should be segregated. In the last couple of years, a few models have been proposed to solve this problem in a Bayesian fashion. One of these has the strength that it formalizes the causal structure of sensory signals. We ﬁrst compare these models on a formal level. Furthermore, we conduct a psychophysics experiment to test human performance in an auditory-visual spatial localization task in which integration is not mandatory. We ﬁnd that the causal Bayesian inference model accounts for the data better than other models. Keywords: causal inference, Bayesian methods, visual perception. 1 Multisensory perception In the ventriloquist illusion, a performer speaks without moving his/her mouth while moving a puppet’s mouth in synchrony with his/her speech. This makes the puppet appear to be speaking. This illusion was ﬁrst conceptualized as ”visual capture”, occurring when visual and auditory stimuli exhibit a small conﬂict ([1, 2]). Only recently has it been demonstrated that the phenomenon may be seen as a byproduct of a much more ﬂexible and nearly Bayes-optimal strategy ([3]), and therefore is part of a large collection of cue combination experiments showing such statistical near-optimality [4, 5]. In fact, cue combination has become the poster child for Bayesian inference in the nervous system. In previous studies of multisensory integration, two sensory stimuli are presented which act as cues about a single underlying source. For instance, in the auditory-visual localization experiment by Alais and Burr [3], observers were asked to envisage each presentation of a light blob and a sound click as a single event, like a ball hitting the screen. In many cases, however, the brain is not only posed with the problem of identifying the position of a common source, but also of determining whether there was a common source at all. In the on-stage ventriloquist illusion, it is indeed primarily the causal inference process that is being fooled, because veridical perception would attribute independent causes to the auditory and the visual stimulus. 1 To extend our understanding of multisensory perception to this more general problem, it is necessary to manipulate the degree of belief assigned to there being a common cause within a multisensory task. Intuitively, we expect that when two signals are very different, they are less likely to be perceived as having a common source. It is well-known that increasing the discrepancy or inconsistency between stimuli reduces the inﬂuence that they have on each other [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In auditoryvisual spatial localization, one variable that controls stimulus similarity is spatial disparity (another would be temporal disparity). Indeed, it has been reported that increasing spatial disparity leads to a decrease in auditory localization bias [1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 2, 18, 19, 20, 21]. This decrease also correlates with a decrease in the reports of unity [19, 21]. Despite the abundance of experimental data on this issue, no general theory exists that can explain multisensory perception across a wide range of cue conﬂicts. 2 Models The success of Bayesian models for cue integration has motivated attempts to extend them to situations of large sensory conﬂict and a consequent low degree of integration. In one of recent studies taking this approach, subjects were presented with concurrent visual ﬂashes and auditory beeps and asked to count both the number of ﬂashes and the number of beeps [11]. The advantage of the experimental paradigm adopted here was that it probed the joint response distribution by requiring a dual report. Human data were accounted for well by a Bayesian model in which the joint prior distribution over visual and auditory number was approximated from the data. In a similar study, subjects were presented with concurrent ﬂashes and taps and asked to count either the ﬂashes or the taps [9, 22]. The Bayesian model proposed by these authors assumed a joint prior distribution with a near-diagonal form. The corresponding generative model assumes that the sensory sources somehow interact with one another. A third experiment modulated the rates of ﬂashes and beeps. The task was to judge either the visual or the auditory modulation rate relative to a standard [23]. The data from this experiment were modeled using a joint prior distribution which is the sum of a near-diagonal prior and a ﬂat background. While all these models are Bayesian in a formal sense, their underlying generative model does not formalize the model selection process that underlies the combination of cues. This makes it necessary to either estimate an empirical prior [11] by ﬁtting it to human behavior or to assume an ad hoc form [22, 23]. However, we believe that such assumptions are not needed. It was shown recently that human judgments of spatial unity in an auditory-visual spatial localization task can be described using a Bayesian inference model that infers causal structure [24, 25]. In this model, the brain does not only estimate a stimulus variable, but also infers the probability that the two stimuli have a common cause. In this paper we compare these different models on a large data set of human position estimates in an auditory-visual task. In this section we ﬁrst describe the traditional cue integration model, then the recent models based on joint stimulus priors, and ﬁnally the causal inference model. To relate to the experiment in the next section, we will use the terminology of auditory-visual spatial localization, but the formalism is very general. 2.1 Traditional cue integration The traditional generative model of cue integration [26] has a single source location s which produces on each trial an internal representation (cue) of visual location, xV and one of auditory location, xA . We assume that the noise processes by which these internal representations are generated are conditionally independent from each other and follow Gaussian distributions. That is, p (xV |s) ∼ N (xV ; s, σV )and p (xA |s) ∼ N (xA ; s, σA ), where N (x; µ, σ) stands for the normal distribution over x with mean µ and standard deviation σ. If on a given trial the internal representations are xV and xA , the probability that their source was s is given by Bayes’ rule, p (s|xV , xA ) ∝ p (xV |s) p (xA |s) . If a subject performs maximum-likelihood estimation, then the estimate will be xV +wA s = wV wV +wA xA , where wV = σ1 and wA = σ1 . It is important to keep in mind that this is the ˆ 2 2 V A estimate on a single trial. A psychophysical experimenter can never have access to xV and xA , which 2 are the noisy internal representations. Instead, an experimenter will want to collect estimates over many trials and is interested in the distribution of s given sV and sA , which are the sources generated ˆ by the experimenter. In a typical cue combination experiment, xV and xA are not actually generated by the same source, but by different sources, a visual one sV and an auditory one sA . These sources are chosen close to each other so that the subject can imagine that the resulting cues originate from a single source and thus implicitly have a common cause. The experimentally observed distribution is then p (ˆ|sV , sA ) = s p (ˆ|xV , xA ) p (xV |sV ) p (xA |sA ) dxV dxA s Given that s is a linear combination of two normally distributed variables, it will itself follow a ˆ sV +wA 1 2 normal distribution, with mean s = wVwV +wA sA and variance σs = wV +wA . The reason that we ˆ ˆ emphasize this point is because many authors identify the estimate distribution p (ˆ|sV , sA ) with s the posterior distribution p (s|xV , xA ). This is justiﬁed in this case because all distributions are Gaussian and the estimate is a linear combination of cues. However, in the case of causal inference, these conditions are violated and the estimate distribution will in general not be the same as the posterior distribution. 2.2 Models with bisensory stimulus priors Models with bisensory stimulus priors propose the posterior over source positions to be proportional to the product of unimodal likelihoods and a two-dimensional prior: p (sV , sA |xV , xA ) = p (sV , sA ) p (xV |sV ) p (xA |sA ) The traditional cue combination model has p (sV , sA ) = p (sV ) δ (sV − sA ), usually (as above) even with p (sV ) uniform. The question arises what bisensory stimulus prior is appropriate. In [11], the prior is estimated from data, has a large number of parameters, and is therefore limited in its predictive power. In [23], it has the form − (sV −sA )2 p (sV , sA ) ∝ ω + e 2σ 2 coupling while in [22] the additional assumption ω = 0 is made1 . In all three models, the response distribution p (ˆV , sA |sV , sA ) is obtained by idens ˆ tifying it with the posterior distribution p (sV , sA |xV , xA ). This procedure thus implicitly assumes that marginalizing over the latent variables xV and xA is not necessary, which leads to a signiﬁcant error for non-Gaussian priors. In this paper we correctly deal with these issues and in all cases marginalize over the latent variables. The parametric models used for the coupling between the cues lead to an elegant low-dimensional model of cue integration that allows for estimates of single cues that differ from one another. C C=1 SA S XA 2.3 C=2 XV SV XA XV Causal inference model In the causal inference model [24, 25], we start from the traditional cue integration model but remove the assumption that two signals are caused by the same source. Instead, the number of sources can be one or two and is itself a variable that needs to be inferred from the cues. Figure 1: Generative model of causal inference. 1 This family of Bayesian posterior distributions also includes one used to successfully model cue combination in depth perception [27, 28]. In depth perception, however, there is no notion of segregation as always a single surface is assumed. 3 If there are two sources, they are assumed to be independent. Thus, we use the graphical model depicted in Fig. 1. We denote the number of sources by C. The probability distribution over C given internal representations xV and xA is given by Bayes’ rule: p (C|xV , xA ) ∝ p (xV , xA |C) p (C) . In this equation, p (C) is the a priori probability of C. We will denote the probability of a common cause by pcommon , so that p (C = 1) = pcommon and p (C = 2) = 1 − pcommon . The probability of generating xV and xA given C is obtained by inserting a summation over the sources: p (xV , xA |C = 1) = p (xV , xA |s)p (s) ds = p (xV |s) p (xA |s)p (s) ds Here p (s) is a prior for spatial location, which we assume to be distributed as N (s; 0, σP ). Then all three factors in this integral are Gaussians, allowing for an analytic solution: p (xV , xA |C = 1) = 2 2 2 2 2 −xA )2 σP σA √ 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 exp − 1 (xV σ2 σ2 +σ2+xV+σ2+xA σV . 2 σ2 σ2 2π σV σA +σV σP +σA σP V A V P A P For p (xV , xA |C = 2) we realize that xV and xA are independent of each other and thus obtain p (xV , xA |C = 2) = p (xV |sV )p (sV ) dsV p (xA |sA )p (sA ) dsA Again, as all these distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, we obtain an analytic solution, x2 x2 1 1 V A p (xV , xA |C = 2) = exp − 2 σ2 +σ2 + σ2 +σ2 . Now that we have com2 +σ 2 2 +σ 2 p p V A 2π (σV p )(σA p) puted p (C|xV , xA ), the posterior distribution over sources is given by p (si |xV , xA ) = p (si |xV , xA , C) p (C|xV , xA ) C=1,2 where i can be V or A and the posteriors conditioned on C are well-known: p (si |xA , xV , C = 1) = p (xA |si ) p (xV |si ) p (si ) , p (xA |s) p (xV |s) p (s) ds p (si |xA , xV , C = 2) = p (xi |si ) p (si ) p (xi |si ) p (si ) dsi The former is the same as in the case of mandatory integration with a prior, the latter is simply the unimodal posterior in the presence of a prior. Based on the posterior distribution on a given trial, p (si |xV , xA ), an estimate has to be created. For this, we use a sum-squared-error cost func2 2 tion, Cost = p (C = 1|xV , xA ) (ˆ − s) + p (C = 2|xV , xA ) (ˆ − sV or A ) . Then the best s s estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution, for instance for the visual estimation: sV = p (C = 1|xA , xV ) sV,C=1 + p (C = 2|xA , xV ) sV,C=2 ˆ ˆ ˆ where sV,C=1 = ˆ −2 −2 −2 xV σV +xA σA +xP σP −2 −2 −2 σV +σA +σP and sV,C=2 = ˆ −2 −2 xV σV +xP σP . −2 −2 σV +σP If pcommon equals 0 or 1, this estimate reduces to one of the conditioned estimates and is linear in xV and xA . If 0 < pcommon < 1, the estimate is a nonlinear combination of xV and xA , because of the functional form of p (C|xV , xA ). The response distributions, that is the distributions of sV and sA given ˆ ˆ sV and sA over many trials, now cannot be identiﬁed with the posterior distribution on a single trial and cannot be computed analytically either. The correct way to obtain the response distribution is to simulate an experiment numerically. Note that the causal inference model above can also be cast in the form of a bisensory stimulus prior by integrating out the latent variable C, with: p (sA , sV ) = p (C = 1) δ (sA − sV ) p (sA ) + p (sA ) p (sV ) p (C = 2) However, in addition to justifying the form of the interaction between the cues, the causal inference model has the advantage of being based on a generative model that well formalizes salient properties of the world, and it thereby also allows to predict judgments of unity. 4 3 Model performance and comparison To examine the performance of the causal inference model and to compare it to previous models, we performed a human psychophysics experiment in which we adopted the same dual-report paradigm as was used in [11]. Observers were simultaneously presented with a brief visual and also an auditory stimulus, each of which could originate from one of ﬁve locations on an imaginary horizontal line (-10◦ , -5◦ , 0◦ , 5◦ , or 10◦ with respect to the ﬁxation point). Auditory stimuli were 32 ms of white noise ﬁltered through an individually calibrated head related transfer function (HRTF) and presented through a pair of headphones, whereas the visual stimuli were high contrast Gabors on a noisy background presented on a 21-inch CRT monitor. Observers had to report by means of a key press (1-5) the perceived positions of both the visual and the auditory stimulus. Each combination of locations was presented with the same frequency over the course of the experiment. In this way, for each condition, visual and auditory response histograms were obtained. We obtained response distributions for each the three models described above by numeral simulation. On each trial, estimation is followed by a step in which, the key is selected which corresponds to the position closed to the best estimate. The simulated histograms obtained in this way were compared to the measured response frequencies of all subjects by computing the R2 statistic. Auditory response Auditory model Visual response Visual model no vision The parameters in the causal inference model were optimized using fminsearch in MATLAB to maximize R2 . The best combination of parameters yielded an R2 of 0.97. The response frequencies are depicted in Fig. 2. The bisensory prior models also explain most of the variance, with R2 = 0.96 for the Roach model and R2 = 0.91 for the Bresciani model. This shows that it is possible to model cue combination for large disparities well using such models. no audio 1 0 Figure 2: A comparison between subjects’ performance and the causal inference model.

The causal inference model ﬁts human data better than the other models. Compared to the best ﬁt of the causal inference model, the Bresciani model has a maximal log likelihood ratio (base e) of the data of −22 ± 6 (mean ± s.e.m. over subjects), and the Roach model has a maximal log likelihood ratio of the data of −18 ± 6. A causal inference model that maximizes the probability of being correct instead of minimizing the mean squared error has a maximal log likelihood ratio of −18 ± 3. These values are considered decisive evidence in favor of the causal inference model that minimizes the mean squared error (for details, see [25]). The parameter values found in the likelihood optimization of the causal model are as follows: pcommon = 0.28 ± 0.05, σV = 2.14 ± 0.22◦ , σA = 9.2 ± 1.1◦ , σP = 12.3 ± 1.1◦ (mean ± s.e.m. over subjects). We see that there is a relatively low prior probability of a common cause. In this paradigm, auditory localization is considerably less precise than visual localization. Also, there is a weak prior for central locations. 3.2 Localization bias A useful quantity to gain more insight into the structure of multisensory data is the cross-modal bias. In our experiment, relative auditory bias is deﬁned as the difference between the mean auditory estimate in a given condition and the real auditory position, divided by the difference between the real visual position and the real auditory position in this condition. If the inﬂuence of vision on the auditory estimate is strong, then the relative auditory bias will be high (close to one). It is well-known that bias decreases with spatial disparity and our experiment is no exception (solid line in Fig. 3; data were combined between positive and negative disparities). It can easily be shown that a traditional cue integration model would predict a bias equal to σ2 −1 , which would be close to 1 and 1 + σV 2 A independent of disparity, unlike the data. This shows that a mandatory integration model is an insufﬁcient model of multisensory interactions. 45 % Auditory Bias We used the individual subject ﬁttings from above and and averaged the auditory bias values obtained from those ﬁts (i.e. we did not ﬁt the bias data themselves). Fits are shown in Fig. 3 (dashed lines). We applied a paired t-test to the differences between the 5◦ and 20◦ disparity conditions (model-subject comparison). Using a double-sided test, the null hypothesis that the difference between the bias in the 5◦ and 20◦ conditions is correctly predicted by each model is rejected for the Bresciani model (p < 0.002) and the Roach model (p < 0.042) and accepted for the causal inference model (p > 0.17). Alternatively, with a single-sided test, the hypothesis is rejected for the Bresciani model (p < 0.001) and the Roach model (p < 0.021) and accepted for the causal inference model (> 0.9). 50 40 35 30 25 20 5 10 15 Spatial Disparity (deg.) 20 Figure 3: Auditory bias as a function of spatial disparity. Solid blue line: data. Red: Causal inference model. Green: Model by Roach et al. [23]. Purple: Model by Bresciani et al. [22]. Models were optimized on response frequencies (as in Fig. 2), not on the bias data. The reason that the Bresciani model fares worst is that its prior distribution does not include a component that corresponds to independent causes. On 2 The Roach et al. model has four free parameters (ω,σV , σA , σcoupling ), the Bresciani et al. model has three (σV , σA , σcoupling ), and the causal inference model has four (pcommon ,σV , σA , σP ). We do not consider the Shams et al. model here, since it has many more parameters and it is not immediately clear how in this model the erroneous identiﬁcation of posterior with response distribution can be corrected. 6 the contrary, the prior used in the Roach model contains two terms, one term that is independent of the disparity and one term that decreases with increasing disparity. It is thus functionally somewhat similar to the causal inference model. 4 Discussion We have argued that any model of multisensory perception should account not only for situations of small, but also of large conﬂict. In these situations, segregation is more likely, in which the two stimuli are not perceived to have the same cause. Even when segregation occurs, the two stimuli can still inﬂuence each other. We compared three Bayesian models designed to account for situations of large conﬂict by applying them to auditory-visual spatial localization data. We pointed out a common mistake: for nonGaussian bisensory priors without mandatory integration, the response distribution can no longer be identiﬁed with the posterior distribution. After correct implementation of the three models, we found that the causal inference model is superior to the models with ad hoc bisensory priors. This is expected, as the nervous system actually needs to solve the problem of deciding which stimuli have a common cause and which stimuli are unrelated. We have seen that multisensory perception is a suitable tool for studying causal inference. However, the causal inference model also has the potential to quantitatively explain a number of other perceptual phenomena, including perceptual grouping and binding, as well as within-modality cue combination [27, 28]. Causal inference is a universal problem: whenever the brain has multiple pieces of information it must decide if they relate to one another or are independent. As the causal inference model describes how the brain processes probabilistic sensory information, the question arises about the neural basis of these processes. Neural populations encode probability distributions over stimuli through Bayes’ rule, a type of coding known as probabilistic population coding. Recent work has shown how the optimal cue combination assuming a common cause can be implemented in probabilistic population codes through simple linear operations on neural activities [29]. This framework makes essential use of the structure of neural variability and leads to physiological predictions for activity in areas that combine multisensory input, such as the superior colliculus. Computational mechanisms for causal inference are expected have a neural substrate that generalizes these linear operations on population activities. A neural implementation of the causal inference model will open the door to a complete neural theory of multisensory perception. References [1] H.L. Pick, D.H. Warren, and J.C. Hay.

<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: Although theorists have interpreted classical conditioning as a laboratory model of Bayesian belief updating, a recent reanalysis showed that the key features that theoretical models capture about learning are artifacts of averaging over subjects. Rather than learning smoothly to asymptote (reﬂecting, according to Bayesian models, the gradual tradeoff from prior to posterior as data accumulate), subjects learn suddenly and their predictions ﬂuctuate perpetually. We suggest that abrupt and unstable learning can be modeled by assuming subjects are conducting inference using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with a small number of samples — one, in our simulations. Ensemble behavior resembles exact Bayesian models since, as in particle ﬁlters, it averages over many samples. Further, the model is capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviors like retrospective revaluation at the ensemble level, even given minimally sophisticated individuals that do not track uncertainty in their beliefs over trials. 1</p><p>6 0.60711813 <a title="3-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Optimal_models_of_sound_localization_by_barn_owls.html">150 nips-2007-Optimal models of sound localization by barn owls</a></p>

<p>Author: Varsha Dani, Sham M. Kakade, Thomas P. Hayes</p><p>Abstract: In the online linear optimization problem, a learner must choose, in each round, a decision from a set D ⊂ Rn in order to minimize an (unknown and changing) linear cost function. We present sharp rates of convergence (with respect to additive regret) for both the full information setting (where the cost function is revealed at the end of each round) and the bandit setting (where only the scalar cost incurred is revealed). In particular, this paper is concerned with the price of bandit information, by which we mean the ratio of the best achievable regret in the bandit setting to that in the full-information setting. For the full informa√ tion case, the upper bound on the regret is O∗ ( nT ), where n is the ambient dimension and T is the time horizon. For the bandit case, we present an algorithm √ which achieves O∗ (n3/2 T ) regret — all previous (nontrivial) bounds here were O(poly(n)T 2/3 ) or worse. It is striking that the convergence rate for the bandit setting is only a factor of n worse than in the full information case — in stark contrast to the K-arm bandit setting, where the gap in the dependence on K is √ √ exponential ( T K√ vs. T log K). We also present lower bounds showing that this gap is at least n, which we conjecture to be the correct order. The bandit algorithm we present can be implemented efﬁciently in special cases of particular interest, such as path planning and Markov Decision Problems. 1</p><p>3 0.91263241 <a title="3-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Learning_with_Invariances.html">62 nips-2007-Convex Learning with Invariances</a></p>

We provide a convex formulation which can deal with arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary losses.

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2007-74-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3377-eeg-based-brain-computer-interaction-improved-accuracy-by-automatic-single-trial-error-detection.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Pierre Ferrez, José Millán</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.g., muscular activity, speech and gestures), are prone to errors in the recognition of subject’s intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in a veriﬁcation procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Six healthy volunteer subjects with no prior BCI experience participated in a new human-robot interaction experiment where they were asked to mentally move a cursor towards a target that can be reached within a few steps using motor imagination. This experiment conﬁrms the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. These “Interaction ErrP” exhibit a ﬁrst sharp negative peak followed by a positive peak and a second broader negative peak (∼290, ∼350 and ∼470 ms after the feedback, respectively). But in order to exploit these ErrP we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the classiﬁer embedded in the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 81.8% and 76.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we have achieved an average recognition rate of the subject’s intent while trying to mentally drive the cursor of 73.1%. These results show that it’s possible to simultaneously extract useful information for mental control to operate a brain-actuated device as well as cognitive states such as error potentials to improve the quality of the braincomputer interaction. Finally, using a well-known inverse model (sLORETA), we show that the main focus of activity at the occurrence of the ErrP are, as expected, in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the anterior cingulate cortex. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2007-74-reference" href="../nips2007_reference/nips-2007-EEG-Based_Brain-Computer_Interaction%3A_Improved_Accuracy_by_Automatic_Single-Trial_Error_Detection_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 ch ∗  Abstract Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.

</p><p>5 We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 81. [sent-17, score-0.312]
</p><p>6 Furthermore, we have achieved an average recognition rate of the subject’s intent while trying to mentally drive the cursor of 73. [sent-20, score-0.333]
</p><p>7 These results show that it’s possible to simultaneously extract useful information for mental control to operate a brain-actuated device as well as cognitive states such as error potentials to improve the quality of the braincomputer interaction. [sent-22, score-0.316]
</p><p>8 Finally, using a well-known inverse model (sLORETA), we show that the main focus of activity at the occurrence of the ErrP are, as expected, in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the anterior cingulate cortex. [sent-23, score-0.601]
</p><p>9 In particular, [6] recently reported the presence of a new kind of error potentials (ErrP) elicited by erroneous feedback provided by a BCI during the recognition of the subject’s intent. [sent-36, score-0.527]
</p><p>10 In this study subjects were asked to reach a target by sending repetitive manual commands to pass over several steps. [sent-37, score-0.385]
</p><p>11 The system was executing commands with an 80% accuracy, so that at each step there was a 20% probability that the system delivered an erroneous feedback. [sent-38, score-0.264]
</p><p>12 The main components of these “Interaction ErrP” are a negative peak 250 ms after the feedback, a positive peak 320 ms after the feedback and a second broader negative peak 450 ms after the feedback. [sent-39, score-0.901]
</p><p>13 To exploit these ErrP for BCIs, it is mandatory to detect them no more in grand averages but in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the BCI. [sent-40, score-0.292]
</p><p>14 The reported average recognition rates of correct and erroneous single trials are 83. [sent-41, score-0.312]
</p><p>15 However, it is to note that in order to isolate the issue of the recognition of ErrP out of the more difﬁcult and general problem of a whole BCI where erroneous feedback can be due to nonoptimal performance of both the interface (i. [sent-45, score-0.37]
</p><p>16 , the classiﬁer embedded into the interface) and the user himself, the subject delivered commands manually. [sent-47, score-0.252]
</p><p>17 The key issue now is to investigate whether subjects also show ErrP while already engaged in tasks that require a high level of concentration such as motor imagination, and no more in easy tasks such as pressing a key. [sent-48, score-0.373]
</p><p>18 Subjects don’t deliver manual commands anymore, but are focussing on motor imagination tasks to reach targets randomly selected by the system. [sent-50, score-0.406]
</p><p>19 1% accuracy in the recognition of the subject’s intent during mental control of the BCI. [sent-53, score-0.244]
</p><p>20 This conﬁrms the fact that EEG conveys simultaneously information from which we can derive mental commands as well as information about cognitive states and shows that both can be sufﬁciently well recognized in each single trials to provide the subject with an improved brain-computer interaction. [sent-54, score-0.52]
</p><p>21 (1) The target (blue) appears 2 steps on the left side of the cursor (green). [sent-57, score-0.359]
</p><p>22 (2) The subject is imagining a movement of his/her left hand and the cursor moves 1 step to the left. [sent-58, score-0.46]
</p><p>23 (3) The subject still focuses on his/her left hand, but the system moves the cursor in the wrong direction. [sent-59, score-0.426]
</p><p>24 (6) A new target (red) appears 3 steps on the right side of the cursor, the subject will now imagine a movement of his/her right foot. [sent-62, score-0.311]
</p><p>25 The system moved the cursor with an error rate of 20%; i. [sent-63, score-0.278]
</p><p>26 2  Experimental setup  The ﬁrst step to integrate ErrP detection in a BCI is to design a protocol where the subject is focussing on a mental task for device control and on the feedback delivered by the BCI for ErrP 2  detection. [sent-66, score-0.588]
</p><p>27 To test the ability of BCI users to concentrate simultaneously on a mental task and to be aware of the BCI feedback at each single trial, we have simulated a human-robot interaction task where the subject has to bring the robot to targets 2 or 3 steps either to the left or to the right. [sent-67, score-0.561]
</p><p>28 This virtual interaction is implemented by means of a green square cursor that can appear on any of 20 positions along an horizontal line. [sent-68, score-0.366]
</p><p>29 The goal with this protocol is to bring the cursor to a target that randomly appears either on the left (blue square) or on the right(red square) of the cursor. [sent-69, score-0.359]
</p><p>30 The target is no further away than 3 positions from the cursor (symbolizing the current position of the robot). [sent-70, score-0.328]
</p><p>31 This prevents the subject from habituation to one of the stimuli since the cursor reaches the target within a small number of steps. [sent-71, score-0.44]
</p><p>32 Figure 1 illustrates the protocol with the target (blue) initially positioned 2 steps away on the left side of the cursor (green). [sent-72, score-0.359]
</p><p>33 An error occurred at step 3) so that the cursor reaches the target in 5 steps. [sent-73, score-0.364]
</p><p>34 The subjects were asked to imagine a movement of their left hand for the left target and to imagine a movement of their right foot for the right target (note that subject n◦ 1 selected left foot for the left target and right hand for the right target). [sent-75, score-1.083]
</p><p>35 However, since the subjects had no prior BCI experience, the system was not moving the cursor following the mental commands of the subject, but with an error rate of 20%, to avoid random or totally biased behavior of the cursor. [sent-76, score-0.699]
</p><p>36 Six healthy volunteer subjects with no prior BCI experience participated in these experiments. [sent-77, score-0.267]
</p><p>37 After the presentation of the target, the subject focuses on the corresponding mental task until the cursor reached the target. [sent-78, score-0.548]
</p><p>38 The system moved the cursor with an error rate of 20%; i. [sent-79, score-0.278]
</p><p>39 , at each step, there was a 20% probability that the cursor moved in the opposite direction. [sent-81, score-0.242]
</p><p>40 When the cursor reached a target, it brieﬂy turned from green to light green and then a new target was randomly selected by the system. [sent-82, score-0.414]
</p><p>41 If the cursor didn’t reach the target after 10 steps, a new target was selected. [sent-83, score-0.414]
</p><p>42 As shown in ﬁgure 2, while the subject focuses on a speciﬁc mental task, the system delivers a feedback about every 2 seconds. [sent-84, score-0.457]
</p><p>43 This provides a window just before the feedback for BCI classiﬁcation and a window just after the feedback for ErrP detection for every single trial. [sent-85, score-0.498]
</p><p>44 The system delivers a feedback about every 2 seconds, this provides a window just before the feedback for BCI classiﬁcation and a window just after the feedback for ErrP detection for every single trial. [sent-91, score-0.649]
</p><p>45 As a new target is presented, the subject focuses on the corresponding mental task until the target is reached. [sent-92, score-0.478]
</p><p>46 EEG potentials were acquired with a portable system (Biosemi ActiveTwo) by means of a cap with 64 integrated electrodes covering the whole scalp uniformly. [sent-93, score-0.261]
</p><p>47 Then for off-line mental tasks classiﬁcation, the power spectrum density (PSD) of EEG channels was estimated over a window of one second just before the feedback. [sent-97, score-0.314]
</p><p>48 Indeed the actual input vector for the statistical classiﬁer described below is a 150 ms window starting 250 ms after the feedback for channels FCz and Cz. [sent-104, score-0.558]
</p><p>49 For both mental tasks and ErrP classiﬁcation, the two different classes (left or right for mental tasks and error or correct for ErrP) are recognized by a Gaussian classiﬁer. [sent-106, score-0.502]
</p><p>50 Sensory motor rhythm (12-16 Hz) and some beta components are discriminant for all subjects. [sent-116, score-0.273]
</p><p>51 The most relevant electrodes are in the central area (C3, C4 and Cz) according to the ERD/ERD location for hand and foot movement or imagination. [sent-118, score-0.29]

</p><p>53 For all 6 subjects, the 12-16 Hz band (sensory motor rhythm (SMR)) appears to be relevant for classiﬁcation. [sent-125, score-0.226]
</p><p>54 For subject 2 this peak in the beta band is centered at 20 Hz and for subject 6 it is centered at 30 Hz. [sent-127, score-0.426]
</p><p>55 Finally subject 4 shows no particular discriminant power in the beta band. [sent-128, score-0.202]
</p><p>56 During periods of inactivity, brain areas are in a kind of idling state with large populations of neurons ﬁring in synchrony resulting in an increase of amplitude of speciﬁc alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-26 Hz) bands. [sent-132, score-0.235]
</p><p>57 In our case, the most relevant electrodes for all subjects are in the C3, C4 or Cz area. [sent-135, score-0.259]
</p><p>58 These locations conﬁrm previous studies since C3 and C4 areas usually show ERD/ERS during hands movement or imagination whereas foot movement or imagination are focused in the Cz area [12]. [sent-136, score-0.516]

</p><p>64 A ﬁrst small positive peak shows up about ∼230 ms after the feedback (t=0). [sent-190, score-0.401]
</p><p>65 A negative peak clearly appears ∼290 ms after the feedback for 5 subjects. [sent-191, score-0.401]
</p><p>66 This negative peak is followed by a positive peak ∼350 ms after the feedback. [sent-192, score-0.36]
</p><p>67 Finally a second broader negative peak occurs about ∼470 ms after the feedback. [sent-193, score-0.25]
</p><p>68 All six subjects show similar ErrP time courses whose amplitudes slightly differ from one subject to the other. [sent-195, score-0.39]
</p><p>69 Furthermore, the fronto-central 5  focus at the occurrence of the different peaks tends to conﬁrm the hypothesis that ErrP are generated in a deep brain region called anterior cingulate cortex [8][9] (see also Section 3. [sent-197, score-0.476]

</p><p>83 As expected, the areas involved in error processing, namely the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA, Brodmann area 6) and the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ, Brodmann areas 24 & 32) are systematically activated [8][9]. [sent-279, score-0.491]
</p><p>84 For the second positive peak (350 ms) and mainly for the late positive component (650 ms), parietal areas are also activated. [sent-280, score-0.265]

<p>Author: Pierre Ferrez, José Millán</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.g., muscular activity, speech and gestures), are prone to errors in the recognition of subject’s intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in a veriﬁcation procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Six healthy volunteer subjects with no prior BCI experience participated in a new human-robot interaction experiment where they were asked to mentally move a cursor towards a target that can be reached within a few steps using motor imagination. This experiment conﬁrms the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. These “Interaction ErrP” exhibit a ﬁrst sharp negative peak followed by a positive peak and a second broader negative peak (∼290, ∼350 and ∼470 ms after the feedback, respectively). But in order to exploit these ErrP we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the classiﬁer embedded in the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 81.8% and 76.2%, respectively.

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electroencephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, e.g. event related potentials; and second order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, e.g. event related (de)synchronization. The procedure for deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is typically driven by knowledge of the underlying neurophysiology. Here we propose a principled method, based on a bilinear model, in which the algorithm simultaneously learns the best ﬁrst and second order spatial and temporal features for classiﬁcation of EEG. The method is demonstrated on simulated data as well as on EEG taken from a benchmark data used to test classiﬁcation algorithms for brain computer interfaces. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.097794712 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Blind_channel_identification_for_speech_dereverberation_using_l1-norm_sparse_learning.html">37 nips-2007-Blind channel identification for speech dereverberation using l1-norm sparse learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Jingdong Chen, Youngmoo Kim, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Speech dereverberation remains an open problem after more than three decades of research. The most challenging step in speech dereverberation is blind channel identiﬁcation (BCI). Although many BCI approaches have been developed, their performance is still far from satisfactory for practical applications. The main difﬁculty in BCI lies in ﬁnding an appropriate acoustic model, which not only can effectively resolve solution degeneracies due to the lack of knowledge of the source, but also robustly models real acoustic environments. This paper proposes a sparse acoustic room impulse response (RIR) model for BCI, that is, an acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse FIR ﬁlter. Under this model, we show how to formulate the BCI of a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system into a l1 norm regularized least squares (LS) problem, which is convex and can be solved efﬁciently with guaranteed global convergence. The sparseness of solutions is controlled by l1 -norm regularization parameters. We propose a sparse learning scheme that infers the optimal l1 -norm regularization parameters directly from microphone observations under a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the proposed approach is effective and robust, and it yields source estimates in real acoustic environments with high ﬁdelity to anechoic chamber measurements.</p><p>5 0.082941987 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_People.html">125 nips-2007-Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>6 0.082145005 <a title="74-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Locality_and_low-dimensions_in_the_prediction_of_natural_experience_from_fMRI.html">122 nips-2007-Locality and low-dimensions in the prediction of natural experience from fMRI</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Ferrez, José Millán</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.g., muscular activity, speech and gestures), are prone to errors in the recognition of subject’s intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in a veriﬁcation procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Six healthy volunteer subjects with no prior BCI experience participated in a new human-robot interaction experiment where they were asked to mentally move a cursor towards a target that can be reached within a few steps using motor imagination. This experiment conﬁrms the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. These “Interaction ErrP” exhibit a ﬁrst sharp negative peak followed by a positive peak and a second broader negative peak (∼290, ∼350 and ∼470 ms after the feedback, respectively). But in order to exploit these ErrP we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the classiﬁer embedded in the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 81.8% and 76.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we have achieved an average recognition rate of the subject’s intent while trying to mentally drive the cursor of 73.1%. These results show that it’s possible to simultaneously extract useful information for mental control to operate a brain-actuated device as well as cognitive states such as error potentials to improve the quality of the braincomputer interaction.

Our methods combine ideas from sparse linear modeling and additive nonparametric regression. We derive a method for ﬁtting the models that is effective even when the number of covariates is larger than the sample size. A statistical analysis of the properties of SpAM is given together with empirical results on synthetic and real data, showing that SpAM can be effective in ﬁtting sparse nonparametric models in high dimensional data. 1</p><p>3 0.63086629 <a title="74-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Boosting_the_Area_under_the_ROC_Curve.html">39 nips-2007-Boosting the Area under the ROC Curve</a></p>

Here we propose a principled method, based on a bilinear model, in which the algorithm simultaneously learns the best ﬁrst and second order spatial and temporal features for classiﬁcation of EEG. The method is demonstrated on simulated data as well as on EEG taken from a benchmark data used to test classiﬁcation algorithms for brain computer interfaces. 1 1.1</p><p>6 0.54974222 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-A_Unified_Near-Optimal_Estimator_For_Dimension_Reduction_in_%24l_%5Calpha%24_%28%240%3C%5Calpha%5Cleq_2%24%29_Using_Stable_Random_Projections.html">13 nips-2007-A Unified Near-Optimal Estimator For Dimension Reduction in $l \alpha$ ($0<\alpha\leq 2$) Using Stable Random Projections</a></p>

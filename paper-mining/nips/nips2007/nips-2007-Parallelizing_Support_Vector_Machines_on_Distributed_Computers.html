<p>Author: Charles L. Isbell, Michael P. Holmes, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning contains many computational bottlenecks in the form of nested summations over datasets. Kernel estimators and other methods are burdened by these expensive computations. Exact evaluation is typically O(n2 ) or higher, which severely limits application to large datasets. We present a multi-stage stratiﬁed Monte Carlo method for approximating such summations with probabilistic relative error control. The essential idea is fast approximation by sampling in trees. This method differs from many previous scalability techniques (such as standard multi-tree methods) in that its error is stochastic, but we derive conditions for error control and demonstrate that they work. Further, we give a theoretical sample complexity for the method that is independent of dataset size, and show that this appears to hold in experiments, where speedups reach as high as 1014 , many orders of magnitude beyond the previous state of the art. 1</p><p>3 0.085248336 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Distributed_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">73 nips-2007-Distributed Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Newman, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a widely-used latent-variable model – the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or “topic” model – using distributed computation, where each of processors only sees of the total data set. We propose two distributed inference schemes that are motivated from different perspectives. The ﬁrst scheme uses local Gibbs sampling on each processor with periodic updates—it is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to a single processor implementation of Gibbs sampling. The second scheme relies on a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the standard LDA model to directly account for the fact that data are distributed across processors—it has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the approximate method. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works very well for LDA models, i.e., perplexity and precision-recall scores for distributed learning are indistinguishable from those obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include large-scale distributed computation on 1000 virtual processors; and speedup experiments of learning topics in a 100-million word corpus using 16 processors. ¢ ¤ ¦¥£ ¢ ¢</p><p>4 0.076934613 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Support_Vector_Machine_Classification_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">190 nips-2007-Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.063448943 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_Randomized_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Support_Vector_Learning.html">10 nips-2007-A Randomized Algorithm for Large Scale Support Vector Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Krishnan Kumar, Chiru Bhattacharya, Ramesh Hariharan</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of randomized algorithms for large scale SVM learning. The key contribution of the paper is to show that, by using ideas random projections, the minimal number of support vectors required to solve almost separable classiﬁcation problems, such that the solution obtained is near optimal with a very high probability, is given by O(log n); if on removal of properly chosen O(log n) points the data becomes linearly separable then it is called almost separable. The second contribution is a sampling based algorithm, motivated from randomized algorithms, which solves a SVM problem by considering subsets of the dataset which are greater in size than the number of support vectors for the problem. These two ideas are combined to obtain an algorithm for SVM classiﬁcation problems which performs the learning by considering only O(log n) points at a time. Experiments done on synthetic and real life datasets show that the algorithm does scale up state of the art SVM solvers in terms of memory required and execution time without loss in accuracy. It is to be noted that the algorithm presented here nicely complements existing large scale SVM learning approaches as it can be used to scale up any SVM solver. 1</p><p>6 0.059370555 <a title="152-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Random_Features_for_Large-Scale_Kernel_Machines.html">160 nips-2007-Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Benjamin Recht</p><p>Abstract: To accelerate the training of kernel machines, we propose to map the input data to a randomized low-dimensional feature space and then apply existing fast linear methods. The features are designed so that the inner products of the transformed data are approximately equal to those in the feature space of a user speciﬁed shiftinvariant kernel. We explore two sets of random features, provide convergence bounds on their ability to approximate various radial basis kernels, and show that in large-scale classiﬁcation and regression tasks linear machine learning algorithms applied to these features outperform state-of-the-art large-scale kernel machines. 1</p><p>5 0.50849009 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Support_Vector_Machine_Classification_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">190 nips-2007-Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian J. Fischer</p><p>Abstract: Sound localization by barn owls is commonly modeled as a matching procedure where localization cues derived from auditory inputs are compared to stored templates. While the matching models can explain properties of neural responses, no model explains how the owl resolves spatial ambiguity in the localization cues to produce accurate localization for sources near the center of gaze. Here, I examine two models for the barn owl’s sound localization behavior. First, I consider a maximum likelihood estimator in order to further evaluate the cue matching model. Second, I consider a maximum a posteriori estimator to test whether a Bayesian model with a prior that emphasizes directions near the center of gaze can reproduce the owl’s localization behavior. I show that the maximum likelihood estimator can not reproduce the owl’s behavior, while the maximum a posteriori estimator is able to match the behavior. This result suggests that the standard cue matching model will not be sufﬁcient to explain sound localization behavior in the barn owl. The Bayesian model provides a new framework for analyzing sound localization in the barn owl and leads to predictions about the owl’s localization behavior.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.67939788 <a title="152-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Parallelizing_Support_Vector_Machines_on_Distributed_Computers.html">152 nips-2007-Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers</a></p>

The main difﬁculty in BCI lies in ﬁnding an appropriate acoustic model, which not only can effectively resolve solution degeneracies due to the lack of knowledge of the source, but also robustly models real acoustic environments. This paper proposes a sparse acoustic room impulse response (RIR) model for BCI, that is, an acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse FIR ﬁlter. Under this model, we show how to formulate the BCI of a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system into a l1 norm regularized least squares (LS) problem, which is convex and can be solved efﬁciently with guaranteed global convergence. The sparseness of solutions is controlled by l1 -norm regularization parameters. We propose a sparse learning scheme that infers the optimal l1 -norm regularization parameters directly from microphone observations under a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the proposed approach is effective and robust, and it yields source estimates in real acoustic environments with high ﬁdelity to anechoic chamber measurements.</p><p>4 0.51805907 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_People.html">125 nips-2007-Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>5 0.43398845 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sequential_Hypothesis_Testing_under_Stochastic_Deadlines.html">176 nips-2007-Sequential Hypothesis Testing under Stochastic Deadlines</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Frazier, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Most models of decision-making in neuroscience assume an inﬁnite horizon, which yields an optimal solution that integrates evidence up to a ﬁxed decision threshold; however, under most experimental as well as naturalistic behavioral settings, the decision has to be made before some ﬁnite deadline, which is often experienced as a stochastic quantity, either due to variable external constraints or internal timing uncertainty. In this work, we formulate this problem as sequential hypothesis testing under a stochastic horizon. We use dynamic programming tools to show that, for a large class of deadline distributions, the Bayes-optimal solution requires integrating evidence up to a threshold that declines monotonically over time. We use numerical simulations to illustrate the optimal policy in the special cases of a ﬁxed deadline and one that is drawn from a gamma distribution.</p><p>6 0.4294638 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Catching_Change-points_with_Lasso.html">43 nips-2007-Catching Change-points with Lasso</a></p>

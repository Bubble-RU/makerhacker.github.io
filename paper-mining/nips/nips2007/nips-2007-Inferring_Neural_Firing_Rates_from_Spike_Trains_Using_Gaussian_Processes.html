<p>Author: Tatyana Sharpee</p><p>Abstract: This paper compares a family of methods for characterizing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli in the framework of the linear-nonlinear model. In this model, the neural ﬁring rate is a nonlinear function of a small number of relevant stimulus components. The relevant stimulus dimensions can be found by maximizing one of the family of objective functions, R´ nyi divergences of different e orders [1, 2]. We show that maximizing one of them, R´ nyi divergence of ore der 2, is equivalent to least-square ﬁtting of the linear-nonlinear model to neural data. Next, we derive reconstruction errors in relevant dimensions found by maximizing R´ nyi divergences of arbitrary order in the asymptotic limit of large spike e numbers. We ﬁnd that the smallest errors are obtained with R´ nyi divergence of e order 1, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence. This corresponds to ﬁnding relevant dimensions by maximizing mutual information [2]. We numerically test how these optimization schemes perform in the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio (small number of spikes and increasing neural noise) for model visual neurons. We ﬁnd that optimization schemes based on either least square ﬁtting or information maximization perform well even when number of spikes is small. Information maximization provides slightly, but signiﬁcantly, better reconstructions than least square ﬁtting. This makes the problem of ﬁnding relevant dimensions, together with the problem of lossy compression [3], one of examples where informationtheoretic measures are no more data limited than those derived from least squares. 1</p><p>3 0.3291927 <a title="104-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>4 0.32901728 <a title="104-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to model relational data on edges of networks. We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics. We develop an efﬁcient learning algorithm that can handle a large number of observations. The experimental results on several real-world data sets verify superior learning capacity. 1</p><p>5 0.27112833 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-A_neural_network_implementing_optimal_state_estimation_based_on_dynamic_spike_train_decoding.html">17 nips-2007-A neural network implementing optimal state estimation based on dynamic spike train decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Omer Bobrowski, Ron Meir, Shy Shoham, Yonina Eldar</p><p>Abstract: It is becoming increasingly evident that organisms acting in uncertain dynamical environments often employ exact or approximate Bayesian statistical calculations in order to continuously estimate the environmental state, integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, form predictions and choose actions. What is less clear is how these putative computations are implemented by cortical neural networks. An additional level of complexity is introduced because these networks observe the world through spike trains received from primary sensory afferents, rather than directly. A recent line of research has described mechanisms by which such computations can be implemented using a network of neurons whose activity directly represents a probability distribution across the possible “world states”. Much of this work, however, uses various approximations, which severely restrict the domain of applicability of these implementations. Here we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process ﬁltering, and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using linear neural networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with several examples, and relate the required network properties to the statistical nature of the environment, thereby quantifying the compatibility of a given network with its environment. 1</p><p>6 0.26717317 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Inference_for_Spiking_Neuron_Models_with_a_Sparsity_Prior.html">33 nips-2007-Bayesian Inference for Spiking Neuron Models with a Sparsity Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominik Endres, Mike Oram, Johannes Schindelin, Peter Foldiak</p><p>Abstract: The peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) and its more continuous cousin, the spike density function (SDF) are staples in the analytic toolkit of neurophysiologists. The former is usually obtained by binning spike trains, whereas the standard method for the latter is smoothing with a Gaussian kernel. Selection of a bin width or a kernel size is often done in an relatively arbitrary fashion, even though there have been recent attempts to remedy this situation [1, 2]. We develop an exact Bayesian, generative model approach to estimating PSTHs and demonstate its superiority to competing methods. Further advantages of our scheme include automatic complexity control and error bars on its predictions. 1</p><p>4 0.60717285 <a title="104-lsi-4" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Gerwinn, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Generalized linear models are the most commonly used tools to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of such models. Using the expectation propagation algorithm, we are able to approximate the full posterior distribution over all weights. In addition, we use a Laplacian prior to favor sparse solutions. Therefore, stimulus features that do not critically inﬂuence neural activity will be assigned zero weights and thus be effectively excluded by the model. This feature selection mechanism facilitates both the interpretation of the neuron model as well as its predictive abilities. The posterior distribution can be used to obtain conﬁdence intervals which makes it possible to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the solution. In neural data analysis, the available amount of experimental measurements is often limited whereas the parameter space is large. In such a situation, both regularization by a sparsity prior and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters are essential. We apply our method to multi-electrode recordings of retinal ganglion cells and use our uncertainty estimate to test the statistical signiﬁcance of functional couplings between neurons. Furthermore we used the sparsity of the Laplace prior to select those ﬁlters from a spike-triggered covariance analysis that are most informative about the neural response. 1</p><p>6 0.54696846 <a title="104-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: David Baldwin, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: People perform a remarkable range of tasks that require search of the visual environment for a target item among distractors. The Guided Search model (Wolfe, 1994, 2007), or GS, is perhaps the best developed psychological account of human visual search. To prioritize search, GS assigns saliency to locations in the visual ﬁeld. Saliency is a linear combination of activations from retinotopic maps representing primitive visual features. GS includes heuristics for setting the gain coefﬁcient associated with each map. Variants of GS have formalized the notion of optimization as a principle of attentional control (e.g., Baldwin & Mozer, 2006; Cave, 1999; Navalpakkam & Itti, 2006; Rao et al., 2002), but every GS-like model must be ’dumbed down’ to match human data, e.g., by corrupting the saliency map with noise and by imposing arbitrary restrictions on gain modulation. We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of GS, called Experience-Guided Search (EGS), based on a generative model of the environment that makes three claims: (1) Feature detectors produce Poisson spike trains whose rates are conditioned on feature type and whether the feature belongs to a target or distractor; (2) the environment and/or task is nonstationary and can change over a sequence of trials; and (3) a prior speciﬁes that features are more likely to be present for target than for distractors. Through experience, EGS infers latent environment variables that determine the gains for guiding search. Control is thus cast as probabilistic inference, not optimization. We show that EGS can replicate a range of human data from visual search, including data that GS does not address. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86517882 <a title="104-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Inferring_Neural_Firing_Rates_from_Spike_Trains_Using_Gaussian_Processes.html">104 nips-2007-Inferring Neural Firing Rates from Spike Trains Using Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani, Byron M. Yu, John P. Cunningham, Krishna V. Shenoy</p><p>Abstract: Neural spike trains present challenges to analytical efforts due to their noisy, spiking nature. Many studies of neuroscientiﬁc and neural prosthetic importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of the spike train’s underlying ﬁring rate. Current techniques to ﬁnd time-varying ﬁring rates require ad hoc choices of parameters, offer no conﬁdence intervals on their estimates, and can obscure potentially important single trial variability. We present a new method, based on a Gaussian Process prior, for inferring probabilistically optimal estimates of ﬁring rate functions underlying single or multiple neural spike trains. We test the performance of the method on simulated data and experimentally gathered neural spike trains, and we demonstrate improvements over conventional estimators. 1</p><p>3 0.8637737 <a title="104-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Loop_Series_and_Bethe_Variational_Bounds_in_Attractive_Graphical_Models.html">123 nips-2007-Loop Series and Bethe Variational Bounds in Attractive Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Variational methods are frequently used to approximate or bound the partition or likelihood function of a Markov random ﬁeld. Methods based on mean ﬁeld theory are guaranteed to provide lower bounds, whereas certain types of convex relaxations provide upper bounds. In general, loopy belief propagation (BP) provides often accurate approximations, but not bounds. We prove that for a class of attractive binary models, the so–called Bethe approximation associated with any ﬁxed point of loopy BP always lower bounds the true likelihood. Empirically, this bound is much tighter than the naive mean ﬁeld bound, and requires no further work than running BP. We establish these lower bounds using a loop series expansion due to Chertkov and Chernyak, which we show can be derived as a consequence of the tree reparameterization characterization of BP ﬁxed points. 1</p><p>4 0.8455441 <a title="104-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Local_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Inference_in_Minor-Excluded_Graphs.html">121 nips-2007-Local Algorithms for Approximate Inference in Minor-Excluded Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyomin Jung, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: We present a new local approximation algorithm for computing MAP and logpartition function for arbitrary exponential family distribution represented by a ﬁnite-valued pair-wise Markov random ﬁeld (MRF), say G. Our algorithm is based on decomposing G into appropriately chosen small components; computing estimates locally in each of these components and then producing a good global solution. We prove that the algorithm can provide approximate solution within arbitrary accuracy when G excludes some ﬁnite sized graph as its minor and G has bounded degree: all Planar graphs with bounded degree are examples of such graphs. The running time of the algorithm is Θ(n) (n is the number of nodes in G), with constant dependent on accuracy, degree of graph and size of the graph that is excluded as a minor (constant for Planar graphs). Our algorithm for minor-excluded graphs uses the decomposition scheme of Klein, Plotkin and Rao (1993). In general, our algorithm works with any decomposition scheme and provides quantiﬁable approximation guarantee that depends on the decomposition scheme.</p><p>5 0.83439046 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>6 0.82050645 <a title="104-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Collapsed_Variational_Inference_for_HDP.html">47 nips-2007-Collapsed Variational Inference for HDP</a></p>

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, Ben Taskar, João Gama</p><p>Abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a widely used maximum likelihood estimation procedure for statistical models when the values of some of the variables in the model are not observed. Very often, however, our aim is primarily to ﬁnd a model that assigns values to the latent variables that have intended meaning for our data and maximizing expected likelihood only sometimes accomplishes this. Unfortunately, it is typically difﬁcult to add even simple a-priori information about latent variables in graphical models without making the models overly complex or intractable. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient, principled way to inject rich constraints on the posteriors of latent variables into the EM algorithm. Our method can be used to learn tractable graphical models that satisfy additional, otherwise intractable constraints. Focusing on clustering and the alignment problem for statistical machine translation, we show that simple, intuitive posterior constraints can greatly improve the performance over standard baselines and be competitive with more complex, intractable models. 1</p><p>3 0.14300939 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Monotonic_Transformations_for_Classification.html">112 nips-2007-Learning Monotonic Transformations for Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Howard, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: A discriminative method is proposed for learning monotonic transformations of the training data while jointly estimating a large-margin classiﬁer. In many domains such as document classiﬁcation, image histogram classiﬁcation and gene microarray experiments, ﬁxed monotonic transformations can be useful as a preprocessing step. However, most classiﬁers only explore these transformations through manual trial and error or via prior domain knowledge. The proposed method learns monotonic transformations automatically while training a large-margin classiﬁer without any prior knowledge of the domain. A monotonic piecewise linear function is learned which transforms data for subsequent processing by a linear hyperplane classiﬁer. Two algorithmic implementations of the method are formalized. The ﬁrst solves a convergent alternating sequence of quadratic and linear programs until it obtains a locally optimal solution. An improved algorithm is then derived using a convex semideﬁnite relaxation that overcomes initialization issues in the greedy optimization problem. The eﬀectiveness of these learned transformations on synthetic problems, text data and image data is demonstrated. 1</p><p>4 0.14209417 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Agreement-Based_Learning.html">22 nips-2007-Agreement-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Dan Klein, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The learning of probabilistic models with many hidden variables and nondecomposable dependencies is an important and challenging problem. In contrast to traditional approaches based on approximate inference in a single intractable model, our approach is to train a set of tractable submodels by encouraging them to agree on the hidden variables. This allows us to capture non-decomposable aspects of the data while still maintaining tractability. We propose an objective function for our approach, derive EM-style algorithms for parameter estimation, and demonstrate their effectiveness on three challenging real-world learning tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.13276735 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-DIFFRAC%3A_a_discriminative_and_flexible_framework_for_clustering.html">65 nips-2007-DIFFRAC: a discriminative and flexible framework for clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Zaïd Harchaoui</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel linear clustering framework (D IFFRAC) which relies on a linear discriminative cost function and a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem. The large convex optimization problem is solved through a sequence of lower dimensional singular value decompositions. This framework has several attractive properties: (1) although apparently similar to K-means, it exhibits superior clustering performance than K-means, in particular in terms of robustness to noise. (2) It can be readily extended to non linear clustering if the discriminative cost function is based on positive deﬁnite kernels, and can then be seen as an alternative to spectral clustering. (3) Prior information on the partition is easily incorporated, leading to state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning, for clustering or classiﬁcation. We present empirical evaluations of our algorithms on synthetic and real medium-scale datasets.</p><p>6 0.12955633 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Convex_Relaxation_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">76 nips-2007-Efficient Convex Relaxation for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Pawan Mudigonda, Vladimir Kolmogorov, Philip Torr</p><p>Abstract: The problem of obtaining the maximum a posteriori estimate of a general discrete random ﬁeld (i.e. a random ﬁeld deﬁned using a ﬁnite and discrete set of labels) is known to be NP-hard. However, due to its central importance in many applications, several approximate algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an analysis of three such algorithms based on convex relaxations: (i) LP - S: the linear programming (LP) relaxation proposed by Schlesinger [20] for a special case and independently in [4, 12, 23] for the general case; (ii) QP - RL: the quadratic programming (QP) relaxation by Ravikumar and Lafferty [18]; and (iii) SOCP - MS: the second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation ﬁrst proposed by Muramatsu and Suzuki [16] for two label problems and later extended in [14] for a general label set. We show that the SOCP - MS and the QP - RL relaxations are equivalent. Furthermore, we prove that despite the ﬂexibility in the form of the constraints/objective function offered by QP and SOCP, the LP - S relaxation strictly dominates (i.e. provides a better approximation than) QP - RL and SOCP - MS. We generalize these results by deﬁning a large class of SOCP (and equivalent QP) relaxations which is dominated by the LP - S relaxation. Based on these results we propose some novel SOCP relaxations which strictly dominate the previous approaches.</p><p>5 0.63235694 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Efficient_Convex_Relaxation_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">76 nips-2007-Efficient Convex Relaxation for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Support Vector Machine transduction, which involves a combinatorial problem with exponential computational complexity in the number of unlabeled examples. Although several studies are devoted to Transductive SVM, they suffer either from the high computation complexity or from the solutions of local optimum. To address this problem, we propose solving Transductive SVM via a convex relaxation, which converts the NP-hard problem to a semi-deﬁnite programming. Compared with the other SDP relaxation for Transductive SVM, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efﬁcient with the number of free parameters reduced from O(n2 ) to O(n) where n is the number of examples. Empirical study with several benchmark data sets shows the promising performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art implementations of Transductive SVM. 1</p><p>6 0.62265408 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Expectation_Maximization_and_Posterior_Constraints.html">84 nips-2007-Expectation Maximization and Posterior Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Maryam Mahdaviani, Tanzeem Choudhury</p><p>Abstract: We present a new and efﬁcient semi-supervised training method for parameter estimation and feature selection in conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs). In real-world applications such as activity recognition, unlabeled sensor traces are relatively easy to obtain whereas labeled examples are expensive and tedious to collect. Furthermore, the ability to automatically select a small subset of discriminatory features from a large pool can be advantageous in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the semi-supervised virtual evidence boosting (sVEB) algorithm for training CRFs – a semi-supervised extension to the recently developed virtual evidence boosting (VEB) method for feature selection and parameter learning. The objective function of sVEB combines the unlabeled conditional entropy with labeled conditional pseudo-likelihood. It reduces the overall system cost as well as the human labeling cost required during training, which are both important considerations in building real-world inference systems. Experiments on synthetic data and real activity traces collected from wearable sensors, illustrate that sVEB beneﬁts from both the use of unlabeled data and automatic feature selection, and outperforms other semi-supervised approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87175357 <a title="63-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electroencephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, e.g. event related potentials; and second order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, e.g. event related (de)synchronization. The procedure for deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is typically driven by knowledge of the underlying neurophysiology. Here we propose a principled method, based on a bilinear model, in which the algorithm simultaneously learns the best ﬁrst and second order spatial and temporal features for classiﬁcation of EEG. The method is demonstrated on simulated data as well as on EEG taken from a benchmark data used to test classiﬁcation algorithms for brain computer interfaces. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.84140027 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-New_Outer_Bounds_on_the_Marginal_Polytope.html">141 nips-2007-New Outer Bounds on the Marginal Polytope</a></p>

Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We give a new class of outer bounds on the marginal polytope, and propose a cutting-plane algorithm for efﬁciently optimizing over these constraints. When combined with a concave upper bound on the entropy, this gives a new variational inference algorithm for probabilistic inference in discrete Markov Random Fields (MRFs). Valid constraints on the marginal polytope are derived through a series of projections onto the cut polytope. As a result, we obtain tighter upper bounds on the log-partition function. We also show empirically that the approximations of the marginals are signiﬁcantly more accurate when using the tighter outer bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of the new constraints for ﬁnding the MAP assignment in protein structure prediction. 1</p><p>5 0.84112352 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-The_Value_of_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples_when_the_Model_is_Imperfect.html">201 nips-2007-The Value of Labeled and Unlabeled Examples when the Model is Imperfect</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, i.e. learning from both labeled and unlabeled data has received signiﬁcant attention in the machine learning literature in recent years. Still our understanding of the theoretical foundations of the usefulness of unlabeled data remains somewhat limited. The simplest and the best understood situation is when the data is described by an identiﬁable mixture model, and where each class comes from a pure component. This natural setup and its implications ware analyzed in [11, 5]. One important result was that in certain regimes, labeled data becomes exponentially more valuable than unlabeled data. However, in most realistic situations, one would not expect that the data comes from a parametric mixture distribution with identiﬁable components. There have been recent efforts to analyze the non-parametric situation, for example, “cluster” and “manifold” assumptions have been suggested as a basis for analysis. Still, a satisfactory and fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nonparametric problem, similar to that in [11, 5] has not yet been developed. In this paper we investigate an intermediate situation, when the data comes from a probability distribution, which can be modeled, but not perfectly, by an identiﬁable mixture distribution. This seems applicable to many situation, when, for example, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model the data. the contribution of this paper is an analysis of the role of labeled and unlabeled data depending on the amount of imperfection in the model.</p><p>6 0.83805734 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_People.html">125 nips-2007-Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaogang Wang, Eric Grimson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely applied in the computer vision ﬁeld. However, many of these applications have difﬁculty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since LDA assumes that a document is a “bag-of-words”. It is also critical to properly design “words” and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA), which better encodes spatial structures among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the values of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents a priori, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in SLDA. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be ﬂexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use SLDA to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than LDA. 1</p><p>3 0.28190875 <a title="73-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Supervised_Topic_Models.html">189 nips-2007-Supervised Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jon D. Mcauliffe, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive a maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational approximations to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the ﬁtted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and web page popularity predicted from text descriptions. We illustrate the beneﬁts of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression. 1</p><p>4 0.19889571 <a title="73-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Subspace-Based_Face_Recognition_in_Analog_VLSI.html">188 nips-2007-Subspace-Based Face Recognition in Analog VLSI</a></p>
<p>Author: Gonzalo Carvajal, Waldo Valenzuela, Miguel Figueroa</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analog-VLSI neural network for face recognition based on subspace methods. The system uses a dimensionality-reduction network whose coeﬃcients can be either programmed or learned on-chip to perform PCA, or programmed to perform LDA. A second network with userprogrammed coeﬃcients performs classiﬁcation with Manhattan distances. The system uses on-chip compensation techniques to reduce the eﬀects of device mismatch. Using the ORL database with 12x12-pixel images, our circuit achieves up to 85% classiﬁcation performance (98% of an equivalent software implementation). 1</p><p>5 0.18346384 <a title="73-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Collapsed_Variational_Inference_for_HDP.html">47 nips-2007-Collapsed Variational Inference for HDP</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Kenichi Kurihara, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of Dirichlet-multinomial ‘topic’ models have found interesting applications in recent years. While Gibbs sampling remains an important method of inference in such models, variational techniques have certain advantages such as easy assessment of convergence, easy optimization without the need to maintain detailed balance, a bound on the marginal likelihood, and side-stepping of issues with topic-identiﬁability. The most accurate variational technique thus far, namely collapsed variational latent Dirichlet allocation, did not deal with model selection nor did it include inference for hyperparameters. We address both issues by generalizing the technique, obtaining the ﬁrst variational algorithm to deal with the hierarchical Dirichlet process and to deal with hyperparameters of Dirichlet variables. Experiments show a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.17382276 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-The_Infinite_Markov_Model.html">197 nips-2007-The Infinite Markov Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Max Welling, Ian Porteous, Evgeniy Bart</p><p>Abstract: A general modeling framework is proposed that uniﬁes nonparametric-Bayesian models, topic-models and Bayesian networks. This class of inﬁnite state Bayes nets (ISBN) can be viewed as directed networks of ‘hierarchical Dirichlet processes’ (HDPs) where the domain of the variables can be structured (e.g. words in documents or features in images). We show that collapsed Gibbs sampling can be done efﬁciently in these models by leveraging the structure of the Bayes net and using the forward-ﬁltering-backward-sampling algorithm for junction trees. Existing models, such as nested-DP, Pachinko allocation, mixed membership stochastic block models as well as a number of new models are described as ISBNs. Two experiments have been performed to illustrate these ideas. 1</p><p>6 0.43804002 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Subspace-Based_Face_Recognition_in_Analog_VLSI.html">188 nips-2007-Subspace-Based Face Recognition in Analog VLSI</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephane Ross, Joelle Pineau, Brahim Chaib-draa</p><p>Abstract: Planning in partially observable environments remains a challenging problem, despite signiﬁcant recent advances in ofﬂine approximation techniques. A few online methods have also been proposed recently, and proven to be remarkably scalable, but without the theoretical guarantees of their ofﬂine counterparts. Thus it seems natural to try to unify ofﬂine and online techniques, preserving the theoretical properties of the former, and exploiting the scalability of the latter. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees on an anytime algorithm for POMDPs which aims to reduce the error made by approximate ofﬂine value iteration algorithms through the use of an efﬁcient online searching procedure. The algorithm uses search heuristics based on an error analysis of lookahead search, to guide the online search towards reachable beliefs with the most potential to reduce error. We provide a general theorem showing that these search heuristics are admissible, and lead to complete and ǫ-optimal algorithms. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest theoretical result available for online POMDP solution methods. We also provide empirical evidence showing that our approach is also practical, and can ﬁnd (provably) near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. 1</p><p>3 0.69728893 <a title="73-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Semi-Supervised_Multitask_Learning.html">175 nips-2007-Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiuhua Liu, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A semi-supervised multitask learning (MTL) framework is presented, in which M parameterized semi-supervised classiﬁers, each associated with one of M partially labeled data manifolds, are learned jointly under the constraint of a softsharing prior imposed over the parameters of the classiﬁers. The unlabeled data are utilized by basing classiﬁer learning on neighborhoods, induced by a Markov random walk over a graph representation of each manifold. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that semi-supervised MTL yields signiﬁcant improvements in generalization performance over either semi-supervised single-task learning (STL) or supervised MTL. 1</p><p>4 0.69680566 <a title="73-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Sparse_Feature_Learning_for_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">180 nips-2007-Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Y-lan Boureau, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efﬁcient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured. 1</p><p>5 0.69465607 <a title="73-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Gaussian_Process_Models_for_Link_Analysis_and_Transfer_Learning.html">94 nips-2007-Gaussian Process Models for Link Analysis and Transfer Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to model relational data on edges of networks. We describe appropriate Gaussian Processes (GPs) for directed, undirected, and bipartite networks. The inter-dependencies of edges can be effectively modeled by adapting the GP hyper-parameters. The framework suggests an intimate connection between link prediction and transfer learning, which were traditionally two separate research topics. We develop an efﬁcient learning algorithm that can handle a large number of observations. The experimental results on several real-world data sets verify superior learning capacity. 1</p><p>6 0.6934585 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Collapsed_Variational_Inference_for_HDP.html">47 nips-2007-Collapsed Variational Inference for HDP</a></p>

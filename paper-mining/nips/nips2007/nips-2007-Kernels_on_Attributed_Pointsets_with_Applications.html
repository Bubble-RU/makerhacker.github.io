<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>3 0.15006083 <a title="109-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Predicting_human_gaze_using_low-level_saliency_combined_with_face_detection.html">155 nips-2007-Predicting human gaze using low-level saliency combined with face detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Moran Cerf, Jonathan Harel, Wolfgang Einhaeuser, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: Under natural viewing conditions, human observers shift their gaze to allocate processing resources to subsets of the visual input. Many computational models try to predict such voluntary eye and attentional shifts. Although the important role of high level stimulus properties (e.g., semantic information) in search stands undisputed, most models are based on low-level image properties. We here demonstrate that a combined model of face detection and low-level saliency signiﬁcantly outperforms a low-level model in predicting locations humans ﬁxate on, based on eye-movement recordings of humans observing photographs of natural scenes, most of which contained at least one person. Observers, even when not instructed to look for anything particular, ﬁxate on a face with a probability of over 80% within their ﬁrst two ﬁxations; furthermore, they exhibit more similar scanpaths when faces are present. Remarkably, our model’s predictive performance in images that do not contain faces is not impaired, and is even improved in some cases by spurious face detector responses. 1</p><p>4 0.13247789 <a title="109-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Learning_with_Transformation_Invariant_Kernels.html">118 nips-2007-Learning with Transformation Invariant Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Walder, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers kernels invariant to translation, rotation and dilation. We show that no non-trivial positive deﬁnite (p.d.) kernels exist which are radial and dilation invariant, only conditionally positive deﬁnite (c.p.d.) ones. Accordingly, we discuss the c.p.d. case and provide some novel analysis, including an elementary derivation of a c.p.d. representer theorem. On the practical side, we give a support vector machine (s.v.m.) algorithm for arbitrary c.p.d. kernels. For the thinplate kernel this leads to a classiﬁer with only one parameter (the amount of regularisation), which we demonstrate to be as effective as an s.v.m. with the Gaussian kernel, even though the Gaussian involves a second parameter (the length scale). 1</p><p>5 0.12942496 <a title="109-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Random_Features_for_Large-Scale_Kernel_Machines.html">160 nips-2007-Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Kenji Fukumizu, Choon H. Teo, Le Song, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Although kernel measures of independence have been widely applied in machine learning (notably in kernel ICA), there is as yet no method to determine whether they have detected statistically signiﬁcant dependence. We provide a novel test of the independence hypothesis for one particular kernel independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). The resulting test costs O(m2 ), where m is the sample size. We demonstrate that this test outperforms established contingency table and functional correlation-based tests, and that this advantage is greater for multivariate data. Finally, we show the HSIC test also applies to text (and to structured data more generally), for which no other independence test presently exists.</p><p>5 0.55082119 <a title="109-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Colored_Maximum_Variance_Unfolding.html">49 nips-2007-Colored Maximum Variance Unfolding</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Maximum variance unfolding (MVU) is an effective heuristic for dimensionality reduction. It produces a low-dimensional representation of the data by maximizing the variance of their embeddings while preserving the local distances of the original data. We show that MVU also optimizes a statistical dependence measure which aims to retain the identity of individual observations under the distancepreserving constraints. This general view allows us to design “colored” variants of MVU, which produce low-dimensional representations for a given task, e.g. subject to class labels or other side information. 1</p><p>6 0.52806813 <a title="109-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Kernel_Measures_of_Conditional_Dependence.html">108 nips-2007-Kernel Measures of Conditional Dependence</a></p>

<p>Author: M. M. Mahmud, Sylvian Ray</p><p>Abstract: In transfer learning we aim to solve new problems using fewer examples using information gained from solving related problems. Transfer learning has been successful in practice, and extensive PAC analysis of these methods has been developed. However it is not yet clear how to deﬁne relatedness between tasks. This is considered as a major problem as it is conceptually troubling and it makes it unclear how much information to transfer and when and how to transfer it. In this paper we propose to measure the amount of information one task contains about another using conditional Kolmogorov complexity between the tasks. We show how existing theory neatly solves the problem of measuring relatedness and transferring the ‘right’ amount of information in sequential transfer learning in a Bayesian setting. The theory also suggests that, in a very formal and precise sense, no other reasonable transfer method can do much better than our Kolmogorov Complexity theoretic transfer method, and that sequential transfer is always justiﬁed. We also develop a practical approximation to the method and use it to transfer information between 8 arbitrarily chosen databases from the UCI ML repository. 1</p><p>3 0.57156682 <a title="109-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-The_Generalized_FITC_Approximation.html">195 nips-2007-The Generalized FITC Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Naish-guzman, Sean Holden</p><p>Abstract: We present an efﬁcient generalization of the sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) model developed by Snelson and Ghahramani [1], applying it to binary classiﬁcation problems. By taking advantage of the SPGP prior covariance structure, we derive a numerically stable algorithm with O(N M 2 ) training complexity—asymptotically the same as related sparse methods such as the informative vector machine [2], but which more faithfully represents the posterior. We present experimental results for several benchmark problems showing that in many cases this allows an exceptional degree of sparsity without compromising accuracy. Following [1], we locate pseudo-inputs by gradient ascent on the marginal likelihood, but exhibit occasions when this is likely to fail, for which we suggest alternative solutions.</p><p>4 0.4912276 <a title="109-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Neural_characterization_in_partially_observed_populations_of_spiking_neurons.html">140 nips-2007-Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>5 0.48690692 <a title="109-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Support_Vector_Machine_Classification_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">190 nips-2007-Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>

We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>6 0.48456073 <a title="109-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Simplified_Rules_and_Theoretical_Analysis_for_Information_Bottleneck_Optimization_and_PCA_with_Spiking_Neurons.html">177 nips-2007-Simplified Rules and Theoretical Analysis for Information Bottleneck Optimization and PCA with Spiking Neurons</a></p>

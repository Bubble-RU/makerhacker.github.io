<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Arnaud Doucet, Nando D. Freitas, Ajay Jasra</p><p>Abstract: A recently proposed formulation of the stochastic planning and control problem as one of parameter estimation for suitable artiﬁcial statistical models has led to the adoption of inference algorithms for this notoriously hard problem. At the algorithmic level, the focus has been on developing Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms. In this paper, we begin by making the crucial observation that the stochastic control problem can be reinterpreted as one of trans-dimensional inference. With this new interpretation, we are able to propose a novel reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is more efﬁcient than its EM counterparts. Moreover, it enables us to implement full Bayesian policy search, without the need for gradients and with one single Markov chain. The new approach involves sampling directly from a distribution that is proportional to the reward and, consequently, performs better than classic simulations methods in situations where the reward is a rare event.</p><p>3 0.16301611 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-A_Bayesian_Model_of_Conditioned_Perception.html">3 nips-2007-A Bayesian Model of Conditioned Perception</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Noah Goodman, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Much of human knowledge is organized into sophisticated systems that are often called intuitive theories. We propose that intuitive theories are mentally represented in a logical language, and that the subjective complexity of a theory is determined by the length of its representation in this language. This complexity measure helps to explain how theories are learned from relational data, and how they support inductive inferences about unobserved relations. We describe two experiments that test our approach, and show that it provides a better account of human learning and reasoning than an approach developed by Goodman [1]. What is a theory, and what makes one theory better than another? Questions like these are of obvious interest to philosophers of science but are also discussed by psychologists, who have argued that everyday knowledge is organized into rich and complex systems that are similar in many respects to scientiﬁc theories. Even young children, for instance, have systematic beliefs about domains including folk physics, folk biology, and folk psychology [2]. Intuitive theories like these play many of the same roles as scientiﬁc theories: in particular, both kinds of theories are used to explain and encode observations of the world, and to predict future observations. This paper explores the nature, use and acquisition of simple theories. Consider, for instance, an anthropologist who has just begun to study the social structure of a remote tribe, and observes that certain words are used to indicate relationships between selected pairs of individuals. Suppose that term T1(·, ·) can be glossed as ancestor(·, ·), and that T2(·, ·) can be glossed as friend(·, ·). The anthropologist might discover that the ﬁrst term is transitive, and that the second term is symmetric with a few exceptions. Suppose that term T3(·, ·) can be glossed as defers to(·, ·), and that the tribe divides into two castes such that members of the second caste defer to members of the ﬁrst caste. In this case the anthropologist might discover two latent concepts (caste 1(·) and caste 2(·)) along with the relationship between these concepts. As these examples suggest, a theory can be deﬁned as a system of laws and concepts that specify the relationships between the elements in some domain [2]. We will consider how these theories are learned, how they are used to encode relational data, and how they support predictions about unobserved relations. Our approach to all three problems relies on the notion of subjective complexity. We propose that theory learners prefer simple theories, that people remember relational data in terms of the simplest underlying theory, and that people extend a partially observed data set according to the simplest theory that is consistent with their observations. There is no guarantee that a single measure of subjective complexity can do all of the work that we require [3]. This paper, however, explores the strong hypothesis that a single measure will sufﬁce. Our formal treatment of subjective complexity begins with the question of how theories are mentally represented. We suggest that theories are represented in some logical language, and propose a speciﬁc ﬁrst-order language that serves as a hypothesis about the “language of thought.” We then pursue the idea that the subjective complexity of a theory corresponds to the length of its representation in this language. Our approach therefore builds on the work of Feldman [4], and is related to other psychological applications of the notion of Kolmogorov complexity [5]. The complexity measure we describe can be used to deﬁne a probability distribution over a space of theories, and we develop a model of theory acquisition by using this distribution as the prior for a Bayesian learner.

Figure 1: Six possible extensions for a binary predicate R(·, ·). In each case, the objects in the domain are represented as digits, and a pair such as 16 indicates that R(1, 6) is true. Below each set of pairs, the simplest theory according to our complexity measure is shown. show how the same Bayesian approach helps to explain how theories support inductive generalization: given a set of observations, future observations (e.g. whether one individual defers to another) can be predicted using the posterior distribution over the space of theories. We test our approach by developing two experiments where people learn and make predictions about binary and ternary relations. As far as we know, the approach of Goodman [1] is the only other measure of theory complexity that has previously been tested as a psychological model [6]. We show that our experiments support our approach and raise challenges for this alternative model. 1 Theory complexity: a representation length approach Intuitive theories correspond to mental representations of some sort, and our ﬁrst task is to characterize the elements used to build these representations. We explore the idea that a theory is a system of statements in a logical language, and six examples are shown in Fig. 1. The theory in Fig. 1b is related to the defers to(·, ·) example already described. Here we are interested in a domain including 9 elements, and a two place predicate R(·, ·) that is true of all and only the 15 pairs shown. R is deﬁned using a unary predicate T which is true of only three elements: 6, 7, and 8. The theory includes a clause which states that R(X, Y) is true for all pairs XY such that T(X) is false and T(Y) is true. The theory in Fig. 1c is very similar, but includes an additional clause which speciﬁes that R(1, 1) is true, and an exception which speciﬁes that R(1, 6) is false. Formally, each theory we consider is a collection of function-free deﬁnite clauses. All variables are universally quantiﬁed: for instance, the clause R(X, Z) ← R(X, Y), R(Y, Z) is equivalent to the logical formula ∀x ∀y ∀z (R(x, z) ← R(x, y) ∧ R(y, z)). For readability, the theories in Fig. 1 include parentheses and arrows, but note that these symbols are unnecessary and can be removed. Our proposed language includes only predicate symbols, variable symbols, constant symbols, and a period that indicates when one clause ﬁnishes and another begins. Each theory in Fig. 1 speciﬁes the extension of one or more predicates. The extension of predicate P is deﬁned in terms of predicate P+ (which captures the basic rules that lead to membership in P) and predicate P− (which captures exceptions to these rules). The resulting extension of P is deﬁned 2 as P+ \ P− , or the set difference of P+ and P− .1 Once P has been deﬁned, later clauses in the theory may refer to P or its negation ¯. To ensure that our semantics is well-deﬁned, the predicates P in any valid theory must permit an ordering so that the deﬁnition of any predicate does not refer to predicates that follow it in the order. Formally, the deﬁnition of each predicate P+ or P− can refer only to itself (recursive deﬁnitions are allowed) and to any predicate M or ¯ where M < P. M Once we have committed to a speciﬁc language, the subjective complexity of a theory is assumed to correspond to the number of symbols in its representation. We have chosen a language where there is one symbol for each position in a theory where a predicate, variable or constant appears, and one symbol to indicate when each clause ends. Given this language, the subjective complexity c(T ) of theory T is equal to the sum of the number of clauses in the theory and the number of positions in the theory where a predicate, variable or constant appears: c(T ) = #clauses(T ) + #pred slots(T ) + #var slots(T ) + #const slots(T ). (1) For instance, the clause R(X, Z) ← R(X, Y), R(Y, Z). contributes ten symbols towards the complexity of a theory (three predicate symbols, six variable symbols, and one period). Other languages might be considered: for instance, we could use a language which uses ﬁve symbols (e.g. ﬁve bits) to represent each predicate, variable and constant, and one symbol (e.g. one bit) to indicate the end of a clause. Our approach to subjective complexity depends critically on the representation language, but once a language has been chosen the complexity measure is uniquely speciﬁed. Although our approach is closely related to the notion of Kolmogorov complexity and to Minimum Message Length (MML) and Minimum Description Length (MDL) approaches, we refer to it as a Representation Length (RL) approach. A RL approach includes a commitment to a speciﬁc language that is proposed as a psychological hypothesis, but these other approaches aspire towards results that do not depend on the language chosen.2 It is sometimes suggested that the notion of Kolmogorov complexity provides a more suitable framework for psychological research than the RL approach, precisely because it allows for results that do not depend on a speciﬁc description language [8]. We subscribe to the opposite view. Mental representations presumably rely on some particular language, and identifying this language is a central challenge for psychological research. The language we described should be considered as a tentative approximation of the language of thought. Other languages can and should be explored, but our language has several appealing properties. Feldman [4] has argued that deﬁnite clauses are psychologically natural, and working with these representations allows our approach to account for several classic results from the concept learning literature. For instance, our language leads to the prediction that conjunctive concepts are easier to learn than disjunctive concepts [9].3 Working with deﬁnite clauses also ensures that each of our theories has a unique minimal model, which means that the extension of a theory can be deﬁned in a particularly simple way. Finally, human learners deal gracefully with noise and exceptions, and our language provides a simple way to handle exceptions. Any concrete proposal about the language of thought should make predictions about memory, learning and reasoning. Suppose that data set D lists the extensions of one or more predicates, and that a theory is a “candidate theory” for D if it correctly deﬁnes the extensions of all predicates in D. Note that a candidate theory may well include latent predicates—predicates that do not appear in D, but are useful for deﬁning the predicates that have been observed. We will assume that humans encode D in terms of the simplest candidate theory for D, and that the difﬁculty of memorizing D is determined by the subjective complexity of this theory. Our approach can and should be tested against classic results from the memory literature. Unlike some other approaches to complexity [10], for instance, our model predicts that a sequence of k items is about equally easy to remember regardless of whether the items are drawn from a set of size 2, a set of size 10, or a set of size 1000 [11]. 1 The extension of P+ is the smallest set that satisﬁes all of the clauses that deﬁne P+ , and the extension of P is deﬁned similarly. To simplify our notation, Fig. 1 uses P to refer to both P and P+ , and ¯ to refer to ¯ and P P P− . Any instance of P that appears in a clause deﬁning P is really an instance of P+ , and any instance of ¯ that P appears in a clause deﬁning ¯ is really an instance of P− . P 2 MDL approaches also commit to a speciﬁc language, but this language is often intended to be as general as possible. See, for instance, the discussion of universal codes in Gr¨ nwald et al. [7]. u 3 A conjunctive concept C(·) can be deﬁned using a single clause: C(X) ← A(X), B(X). The shortest deﬁnition of a disjunctive concept requires two clauses: D(X) ← A(X). D(X) ← B(X). − 3 To develop a model of inductive learning and reasoning, we take a Bayesian approach, and use our complexity measure to deﬁne a prior distribution over a hypothesis space of theories: P (T ) ∝ 2−c(T ) .4 Given this prior distribution, we can use Bayesian inference to make predictions about unobserved relations and to discover the theory T that best accounts for the observations in data set D [12, 13]. Suppose that we have a likelihood function P (D|T ) which speciﬁes how the examples in D were generated from some underlying theory T . The best explanation for the data D is the theory that maximizes the posterior distribution P (T |D) ∝ P (D|T )P (T ). If we need to predict whether ground term g is likely to be true, 5 we can sum over the space of theories: P (g|D) = P (g|T )P (T |D) = T 1 P (D) P (D|T )P (T ) (2) T :g∈T where the ﬁnal sum is over all theories T that make ground term g true. 1.1 Related work The theories we consider are closely related to logic programs, and methods for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) explore how these programs can be learned from examples [14]. ILP algorithms are often inspired by the idea of searching for the shortest theory that accounts for the available data, and ILP is occasionally cast as the problem of minimizing an explicit MDL criterion [10]. Although ILP algorithms are rarely considered as cognitive models, the RL approach has a long psychological history, and is proposed by Chomsky [15] and Leeuwenberg [16] among others. Formal measures of complexity have been developed in many ﬁelds [17], and there is at least one other psychological account of theory complexity. Goodman [1] developed a complexity measure that was originally a philosophical proposal about scientiﬁc theories, but was later tested as a model of subjective complexity [6]. A detailed description of this measure is not possible here, but we attempt to give a ﬂavor of the approach. Suppose that a basis is a set of predicates. The starting point for Goodman’s model is the intuition that basis B1 is at least as complex as basis B2 if B1 can be used to deﬁne B2. Goodman argues that this intuition is ﬂawed, but his model is founded on a reﬁnement of this intuition. For instance, since the binary predicate in Fig. 1b can be deﬁned in terms of two unary predicates, Goodman’s approach requires that the complexity of the binary predicate is no more than the sum of the complexities of the two unary predicates. We will use Goodman’s model as a baseline for evaluating our own approach, and a comparison between these two models should be informed by both theoretical and empirical considerations. On the theoretical side, our approach relies on a simple principle for deciding which structural properties are relevant to the measurement of complexity: the relevant properties are those with short logical representations. Goodman’s approach incorporates no such principle, and he proposes somewhat arbitrarily that reﬂexivity and symmetry are among the relevant structural properties but that transitivity is not. A second reason for preferring our model is that it makes contact with a general principle—the idea that simplicity is related to representation length—that has found many applications across psychology, machine learning, and philosophy. 2 Experimental results We designed two experiments to explore settings where people learn, remember, and make inductive inferences about relational data. Although theories often consist of systems of many interlocking relations, we keep our experiments simple by asking subjects to learn and reason about a single relation at a time. Despite this restriction, our experiments still make contact with several issues raised by systems of relations. As the defers to(·, ·) example suggests, a single relation may be best explained as the observable tip of a system involving several latent predicates (e.g. caste 1(·) and caste 2(·)). 4 To ensure that this distribution can be normalized, we assume that there is some upper bound on the number of predicate symbols, variable symbols, and constants, and on the length of the theories we will consider. There will therefore be a ﬁnite number of possible theories, and our prior will be a valid probability distribution. 5 A ground term is a term such as R(8, 9) that does not include any variables. 4 Learning time Complexity (RL) Complexity (Human) 6 300 Complexity (Goodman) 4 20 0 0 0 star bprt excp sym trans rand 2 0 star bprt excp sym trans rand 2 star bprt excp sym trans rand 100 200 star bprt excp sym trans rand 4 40 Figure 2: (a) Average time in seconds to learn the six sets in Fig. 1.

Materials and Methods. 18 adults participated in this experiment. Subjects were required to learn the 6 sets shown in Fig. 1, and to make inductive inferences about each set. Although Fig. 1 shows pairs of digits, the experiment used letter pairs, and the letters for each condition and the order in which these conditions were presented were randomized across subjects. The pairs for each condition were initially laid out randomly on screen, and subjects could drag them around and organize them to help them understand the structure of the set. At any stage, subjects could enter a test phase where they were asked to list the 15 pairs belonging to the current set. Subjects who made an error on the test were returned to the learning phase. After 9 minutes had elapsed, subjects were allowed to pass the test regardless of how many errors they made. After passing the test, subjects were asked to rate the complexity of the set compared to other sets with 15 pairs. Ratings were provided on a 7 point scale. Subjects were then asked to imagine that a new letter (e.g. letter 9) had belonged to the current alphabet, and were given two inductive tasks. First they were asked to enter between 1 and 10 novel pairs that they might have expected to see (each novel pair was required to include the new letter). Next they were told about a novel pair that belonged to the set (e.g. pair 91), and were again asked to enter up to 10 additional pairs that they might have expected to see. Results. The average time needed to learn each set is shown in Fig. 2a, and ratings of set complexity are shown in Fig. 2b. It is encouraging that these measures yield converging results, but they may be confounded since subjects rated the complexity of a set immediately after learning it. The complexities plotted in Fig. 2c are the complexities of the theories shown in Fig. 1, which we believe to be the simplest theories according to our complexity measure. The ﬁnal plot in Fig. 2 shows complexities according to Goodman’s model, which assigns each binary relation an integer between 0 and 4. There are several differences between these models: for instance, Goodman’s account incorrectly predicts that the exception case is the hardest of the six, but our model acknowledges that a simple theory remains simple if a handful of exceptions are added. Goodman’s account also predicts that transitivity is not an important structural regularity, but our model correctly predicts that the transitive set is simpler than the same set with some of the pairs reversed (the random set). Results for the inductive task are shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst two columns show the number of subjects who listed each novel pair. The remaining two columns show the probability of set membership predicted by our model. To generate these predictions, we applied Equation 2 and summed over a set of theories created by systematically extending the theories shown in Fig. 1. Each extended theory includes up to one additional clause for each predicate in the base theory, and each additional clause includes at most two predicate slots. For instance, each extended theory for the bipartite case is created by choosing whether or not to add the clause T(9), and adding up to one clause for predicate R.6 For the ﬁrst inductive task, the likelihood term P (D|T ) (see Equation 2) is set to 0 for all theories that are not consistent with the pairs observed during training, and to a constant for all remaining theories. For the second task we assumed in addition that the novel pair observed is 6 R(9, X), ¯(2, 9), and R(X, 9) ← R(X, 2) are three possible additions.

Columns 1 and 3 show predictions before any pairs involving the new letter are observed. Columns 2 and 4 show predictions after a single novel pair (marked with a gray bar) is observed to belong to the set. The model plots for each condition include correlations with the human data. sampled at random from all pairs involving the new letter.7 All model predictions were computed using Mace4 [18] to generate the extension of each theory considered. The supporting material includes predictions for a model based on the Goodman complexity measure and an exemplar model which assumes that the new letter will be just like one of the old letters.8 The exemplar model outperforms our model in the random condition, and makes accurate predictions about three other conditions. Overall, however, our model performs better than the two baselines. Here we focus on two important predictions that are not well handled by the exemplar model. In the symmetry condition, almost all subjects predict that 78 belongs to the set after learning that 87 belongs to the set, suggesting that they have learned an abstract rule. In the transitive condition, most subjects predict that pairs 72 through 76 belong to the set after learning that 71 belongs to the set. Our model accounts for this result, but the exemplar model has no basis for making predictions about letter 7, since this letter is now known to be unlike any of the others. 2.2 Experiment 2: learning from positive examples During the learning phase of our ﬁrst experiment, subjects learned a theory based on positive examples (the theory included all pairs they had seen) and negative examples (the theory ruled out all pairs they had not seen). Often, however, humans learn theories based on positive examples alone. Suppose, for instance, that our anthropologist has spent only a few hours with a new tribe. She may have observed several pairs who are obviously friends, but should realize that many other pairs of friends have not yet interacted in her presence. 7 For the second task, P (D|T ) is set to 0 for theories that are inconsistent with the training pairs and theories 1 which do not include the observed novel pair. For all remaining theories, P (D|T ) is set to n , where n is the total number of novel pairs that are consistent with T . 8 Supporting material is available at www.charleskemp.com 6 1 221 331 441 551 c) 7 1 R(X, X, Y). 221 443 552 663 d) 7 1 R(X, Y, Z). 231 456 615 344 e) 7 1 −10 −5 −0.1 −10 −20 −20 −10 −0.2 −20 777 771 778 789 237 777 771 778 789 237 −10 231 234 235 236 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 777 771 778 789 237 0 RL 0 R(2, 3, X). 777 771 778 789 237 7 R(X, X, 1). 777 771 778 789 237 b) 777 771 778 789 237 1 111 222 333 444 777 771 778 789 237 7 R(X, X, X). 777 771 778 789 237 Human a) Figure 4: Data and model predictions for Experiment 2. The four triples observed for each set are shown at the top of the ﬁgure. The ﬁrst row of plots shows average ratings on a scale from 1 (very unlikely to belong to the set) to 7 (very likely). Model predictions are plotted as log probabilities. Our framework can handle cases like these if we assume that the data D in Equation 2 are sampled from the ground terms that are true according to the underlying theory. We follow [10] and [13] and use a distribution P (D|T ) which assumes that the examples in D are randomly sampled with replacement from the ground terms that are true. This sampling assumption encourages our model to identify the theory with the smallest extension that is compatible with all of the training examples. We tested this approach by designing an experiment where learners were given sets of examples that were compatible with several underlying theories. Materials and Methods. 15 adults participated in this experiment immediately after taking Experiment 1. In each of ﬁve conditions, subjects were told about a set of triples built from an alphabet of 9 letters. They were shown four triples that belonged to the set (Fig. 4), and told that the set might include triples that they had not seen. Subjects then gave ratings on a seven point scale to indicate whether ﬁve additional triples (see Fig. 4) were likely to belong to the set. Results. Average ratings and model predictions are shown in Fig. 4. Model predictions for each condition were computed using Equation 2 and summing over a space of theories that included the ﬁve theories shown at the top of Fig. 4, variants of these ﬁve theories which stated that certain pairs of slots could not be occupied by the same constant,9 and theories that included no variables but merely enumerated up to 5 triples.10 Although there are general theories like R(X, Y, Z) that are compatible with the triples observed in all ﬁve conditions, Fig. 4 shows that people were sensitive to different regularities in each case.11 We focus on one condition (Fig. 4b) that exposes the strengths and weaknesses of our model. According to our model, the two most probable theories given the triples for this condition are R(X, X, 1) and the closely related variant that rules out R(1, 1, 1). The next most probable theory is R(X, X, Y). These predictions are consistent with people’s judgments that 771 is very likely to belong to the set, and that 778 is the next most likely option. Unlike our model, however, people consider 777 to be substantially less likely than 778 to belong to the set. This result may suggest that the variant of R(X, X, Y) that rules out R(X, X, X) deserves a higher prior probability than our model recognizes. To better account for cases like this, it may be worth considering languages where any two variables that belong to the same clause but have different names must refer to different entities. 3 Discussion and Conclusion There are many psychological models of concept learning [4, 12, 13], but few that use representations rich enough to capture the content of intuitive theories. We suggested that intuitive theories are mentally represented in a ﬁrst-order logical language, and proposed a speciﬁc hypothesis about 9 ¯ One such theory includes two clauses: R(X, X, Y). R(X, X, X). One such theory is the following list of clauses: R(2, 2, 1). R(3, 3, 1). R(4, 4, 1). R(5, 5, 1). R(7, 7, 7). 11 Similar results have been found with 9-month old infants. Cases like Figs. 4b and 4c have been tested in an infant language-learning study where the stimuli were three-syllable strings [19]. 9-month old infants exposed to strings like the four in Fig. 4c generalized to other strings consistent with the theory R(X, X, Y), but infants in the condition corresponding to Fig. 4b generalized only to strings consistent with the theory R(X, X, 1). 10 7 this “language of thought.” We assumed that the subjective complexity of a theory depends on the length of its representation in this language, and described experiments which suggest that the resulting complexity measure helps to explain how theories are learned and used for inductive inference. Our experiments deliberately used stimuli that minimize the inﬂuence of prior knowledge. Theories, however, are cumulative, and the theory that seems simplest to a learner will often depend on her background knowledge. Our approach provides a natural place for background knowledge to be inserted. A learner can be supplied with a stock of background predicates, and the shortest representation for a data set will depend on which background predicates are available. Since different sets of predicates will lead to different predictions about subjective complexity, empirical results can help to determine the background knowledge that people bring to a given class of problems. Future work should aim to reﬁne the representation language and complexity measure we proposed. We expect that something like our approach will be suitable for modeling a broad class of intuitive theories, but the speciﬁc framework presented here can almost certainly be improved. Future work should also consider different strategies for searching the space of theories. Some of the strategies developed in the ILP literature should be relevant [14], but a detailed investigation of search algorithms seems premature until our approach has held up to additional empirical tests. It is comparatively easy to establish whether the theories that are simple according to our approach are also considered simple by people, and our experiments have made a start in this direction. It is much harder to establish that our approach captures most of the theories that are subjectively simple, and more exhaustive experiments are needed before this conclusion can be drawn. Boolean concept learning has been studied for more than ﬁfty years [4, 9], and many psychologists have made empirical and theoretical contributions to this ﬁeld. An even greater effort will be needed to crack the problem of theory learning, since the space of intuitive theories is much richer than the space of Boolean concepts. The difﬁculty of this problem should not be underestimated, but computational approaches can contribute part of the solution.

<p>Author: Andrea Lecchini-visintini, John Lygeros, Jan Maciejowski</p><p>Abstract: Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a ﬁnite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee ﬁnite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of ﬁnite-time learning with known accuracy and conﬁdence developed in statistical learning theory. Optimization is the general problem of ﬁnding a value of a vector of variables θ that maximizes (or minimizes) some scalar criterion U (θ). The set of all possible values of the vector θ is called the optimization domain. The elements of θ can be discrete or continuous variables. In the ﬁrst case the optimization domain is usually ﬁnite, such as in the well-known traveling salesman problem; in the second case the optimization domain is a continuous set. An important example of a continuous optimization domain is the set of 3-D conﬁgurations of a sequence of amino-acids in the problem of ﬁnding the minimum energy folding of the corresponding protein [1]. In principle, any optimization problem on a ﬁnite domain can be solved by an exhaustive search. However, this is often beyond computational capacity: the optimization domain of the traveling salesman problem with 100 cities contains more than 10155 possible tours. An efﬁcient algorithm to solve the traveling salesman and many similar problems has not yet been found and such problems remain reliably solvable only in principle [2]. Statistical mechanics has inspired widely used methods for ﬁnding good approximate solutions in hard discrete optimization problems which defy efﬁcient exact solutions [3, 4, 5, 6]. Here a key idea has been that of simulated annealing [3]: a random search based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, such that the distribution of the elements of the domain visited during the search converges to an equilibrium distribution concentrated around the global optimizers. Convergence and ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing on ﬁnite domains has been evaluated in many works, e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10]. On continuous domains, most popular optimization methods perform a local gradient-based search and in general converge to local optimizers; with the notable exception of convex criteria where convergence to the unique global optimizer occurs [11]. Simulated annealing performs a global search and can be easily implemented on continuous domains. Hence it can be considered a powerful complement to local methods. In this paper, we introduce for the ﬁrst time rigorous guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing on continuous domains. We will show that it is possible to derive simulated annealing algorithms which, with an arbitrarily high level of conﬁdence, ﬁnd an approximate solution to the problem of optimizing a function of continuous variables, within a speciﬁed tolerance to the global optimal solution after a known ﬁnite number of steps. Rigorous guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing in the optimization of functions of continuous variables have never been obtained before; the only results available state that simulated annealing converges to a global optimizer as the number of steps grows to inﬁnity, e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15]. The background of our work is twofold. On the one hand, our notion of approximate solution to a global optimization problem is inspired by the concept of ﬁnite-time learning with known accuracy and conﬁdence developed in statistical learning theory [16, 17]. We actually maintain an important aspect of statistical learning theory which is that we do not introduce any particular assumption on the optimization criterion, i.e. our results hold regardless of what U is. On the other hand, we ground our results on the theory of convergence, with quantitative bounds on the distance to the target distribution, of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which has been one of the main achievements of recent research in statistics [18, 19, 20, 21]. In this paper, we will not develop any ready-to-use optimization algorithm. We will instead introduce a general formulation of the simulated annealing method which allows one to derive new simulated annealing algorithms with rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees on the basis of existing theory. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the general family of MCMC methods have many degrees of freedom. The choice and comparison of speciﬁc algorithms goes beyond the scope of the paper. The paper is organized in the following sections. In Simulated annealing we introduce the method and ﬁx the notation. In Convergence we recall the reasons why ﬁnite-time guarantees for simulated annealing on continuous domains have not been obtained before. In Finite-time guarantees we present the main result of the paper. In Conclusions we state our ﬁndings and conclude the paper. 1 Simulated annealing The original formulation of simulated annealing was inspired by the analogy between the stochastic evolution of the thermodynamic state of an annealing material towards the conﬁgurations of minimal energy and the search for the global minimum of an optimization criterion [3]. In the procedure, the optimization criterion plays the role of the energy and the state of the annealed material is simulated by the evolution of the state of an inhomogeneous Markov chain. The state of the chain evolves according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in order to simulate the Boltzmann distribution of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Boltzmann distribution is simulated for a decreasing sequence of temperatures (“cooling”). The target distribution of the cooling procedure is the limiting Boltzmann distribution, for the temperature that tends to zero, which takes non-zero values only on the set of global minimizers [7]. The original formulation of the method was for a ﬁnite domain. However, simulated annealing can be generalized straightforwardly to a continuous domain because the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used with almost no differences on discrete and continuous domains The main difference is that on a continuous domain the equilibrium distributions are speciﬁed by probability densities. On a continuous domain, Markov transition kernels in which the distribution of the elements visited by the chain converges to an equilibrium distribution with the desired density can be constructed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the general family of MCMC methods [22]. We point out that Boltzmann distributions are not the only distributions which can be adopted as equilibrium distributions in simulated annealing [7]. In this paper it is convenient for us to adopt a different type of equilibrium distribution in place of Boltzmann distributions. 1.1 Our setting The optimization criterion is U : Θ → [0, 1], with Θ ⊂ RN . The assumption that U takes values in the interval [0, 1] is a technical one. It does not imply any serious loss of generality. In general, any bounded optimization criterion can be scaled to take values in [0, 1]. We assume that the optimization task is to ﬁnd a global maximizer; this can be done without loss of generality. We also assume that Θ is a bounded set. We consider equilibrium distributions deﬁned by probability density functions proportional to [U (θ) + δ]J where J and δ are two strictly positive parameters. We use π (J) to denote an equilibrium distribution, i.e. π (J) (dθ) ∝ [U (θ) + δ]J πLeb (dθ) where πLeb is the standard Lebesgue measure. Here, J −1 plays the role of the temperature: if the function U (θ) plus δ is taken to a positive power J then as J increases (i.e. as J −1 decreases) [U (θ) + δ]J becomes increasingly peaked around the global maximizers. The parameter δ is an offset which guarantees that the equilibrium densities are always strictly positive, even if U takes zero values on some elements of the domain. The offset δ is chosen by the user and we show later that our results allow one to make an optimal selection of δ. The zero-temperature distribution is the limiting distribution, for J → ∞, which takes non-zero values only on the set of global maximizers. It is denoted by π (∞) . In the generic formulation of the method, the Markov transition kernel of the k-th step of the inhomogeneous chain has equilibrium distribution π (Jk ) where {Jk }k=1,2,... is the “cooling schedule”. The cooling schedule is a non-decreasing sequence of positive numbers according to which the equilibrium distribution become increasingly sharpened during the evolution of the chain. We use θk to denote the state of the chain and Pθk to denote its probability distribution. The distribution Pθk obviously depends on the initial condition θ0 . However, in this work, we don’t need to make this dependence explicit in the notation. Remark 1: If, given an element θ in Θ, the value U (θ) can be computed directly, we say that U is a deterministic criterion, e.g. the energy landscape in protein structure prediction [1]. In problems involving random variables, the value U (θ) may be the expected value U (θ) = g(x, θ)px (x; θ)dx of some function g which depends on both the optimization variable θ, and on some random variable x which has probability density px (x; θ) (which may itself depend on θ). In such problems it is usually not possible to compute U (θ) directly, either because evaluation of the integral requires too much computation, or because no analytical expression for px (x; θ) is available. Typically one must perform stochastic simulations in order to obtain samples of x for a given θ, hence obtain sample values of g(x, θ), and thus construct a Monte Carlo estimate of U (θ). The Bayesian design of clinical trials is an important application area where such expected-value criteria arise [23]. The authors of this paper investigate the optimization of expected-value criteria motivated by problems of aircraft routing [24]. In the particular case that px (x; θ) does not depend on θ, the optimization task is often called “empirical risk minimization”, and is studied extensively in statistical learning theory [16, 17]. The results of this paper apply in the same way to the optimization of both deterministic and expected-value criteria. The MCMC method developed by M¨ ller [25, 26] allows one u to construct simulated annealing algorithms for the optimization of expected-value criteria. M¨ ller u [25, 26] employs the same equilibrium distributions as those described in our setting; in his context J is restricted to integer values. 2 Convergence The rationale of simulated annealing is as follows: if the temperature is kept constant, say Jk = J, then the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk tends to the equilibrium distribution π (J) ; if J → ∞ then the equilibrium distribution π (J) tends to the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) ; as a result, if the cooling schedule Jk tends to inﬁnity, one obtains that Pθk “follows” π (Jk ) and that π (Jk ) tends to π (∞) and eventually that the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk tends to π (∞) . The theory shows that, under conditions on the cooling schedule and the Markov transition kernels, the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk actually converges to the target zero-temperature distribution π (∞) as k → ∞ [12, 13, 14, 15]. Convergence to the zero-temperature distribution implies that asymptotically the state of the chain eventually coincides with a global optimizer with probability one. The difﬁculty which must be overcome in order to obtain ﬁnite step results on simulated annealing algorithms on a continuous domain is that usually, in an optimization problem deﬁned over continuous variables, the set of global optimizers has zero Lebesgue measure (e.g. a set of isolated points). If the set of global optimizers has zero measure then the set of global optimizers has null probability according to the equilibrium distributions π (J) for any ﬁnite J and, as a consequence, according to the distributions Pθk for any ﬁnite k. Put another way, the probability that the state of the chain visits the set of global optimizers is constantly zero after any ﬁnite number of steps. Hence the conﬁdence of the fact that the solution provided by the algorithm in ﬁnite time coincides with a global optimizer is also constantly zero. Notice that this is not the case for a ﬁnite domain, where the set of global optimizers is of non-null measure with respect to the reference counting measure [7, 8, 9, 10]. It is instructive to look at the issue also in terms of the rate of convergence to the target zerotemperature distribution. On a discrete domain, the distribution of the state of the chain at each step and the zero-temperature distribution are both standard discrete distributions. It is then possible to deﬁne a distance between them and study the rate of convergence of this distance to zero. This analysis allows one to obtain results on the ﬁnite-time behavior of simulated annealing [7, 8]. On a continuous domain and for a set of global optimizers of measure zero, the target zero-temperature distribution π (∞) ends up being a mixture of probability masses on the set of global optimizers. In this situation, although the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk still converges asymptotically to π (∞) , it is not possible to introduce a sensible distance between the two distributions and a rate of convergence to the target distribution cannot even be deﬁned (weak convergence), see [12, Theorem 3.3]. This is the reason that until now there have been no guarantees on the performance of simulated annealing on a continuous domain after a ﬁnite number of computations: by adopting the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) as the target distribution it is only possible to prove asymptotic convergence in inﬁnite time to a global optimizer. Remark 2: The standard distance between two distributions, say µ1 and µ2 , on a continuous support is the total variation norm µ1 − µ2 T V = supA |µ1 (A) − µ2 (A)|, see e.g. [21]. In simulated annealing on a continuous domain the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure (i.e. πLeb (A) = 0 ⇒ Pθk (A) = 0), by construction for any ﬁnite k. Hence if the set of global optimizers has zero Lebesgue measure then it has zero measure also according to Pθk . The set of global optimizers has however measure 1 according to π (∞) . The distance Pθk − π (∞) T V is then constantly 1 for any ﬁnite k. It is also worth mentioning that if the set of global optimizers has zero measure then asymptotic convergence to the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) can be proven only under the additional assumptions of continuity and differentiability of U [12, 13, 14, 15]. 3 Finite-time guarantees In general, optimization algorithms for problems deﬁned on continuous variables can only ﬁnd approximate solutions in ﬁnite time [27]. Given an element θ of a continuous domain how can we assess how good it is as an approximate solution to an optimization problem? Here we introduce the concept of approximate global optimizer to answer this question. The deﬁnition is given for a maximization problem in a continuous but bounded domain. We use two parameters: the value imprecision ǫ (greater than or equal to 0) and the residual domain α (between 0 and 1) which together determine the level of approximation. We say that θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α if the function U takes values strictly greater than U (θ) + ǫ only on a subset of values of θ no larger than an α portion of the optimization domain. The formal deﬁnition is as follows. Deﬁnition 1 Let U : Θ → R be an optimization criterion where Θ ⊂ RN is bounded. Let πLeb denote the standard Lebesgue measure. Let ǫ ≥ 0 and α ∈ [0, 1] be given numbers. Then θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α if πLeb {θ′ ∈ Θ : U (θ′ ) > U (θ) + ǫ} ≤ α πLeb (Θ) . In other words, the value U (θ) is within ǫ of a value which is greater than the values that U takes on at least a 1 − α portion of the domain. The smaller ǫ and α are, the better is the approximation of a true global optimizer. If both α and ǫ are equal to zero then U (θ) coincides with the essential supremum of U . Our deﬁnition of approximate global optimizer carries an important property, which holds regardless of what the criterion U is: if ǫ and α have non-zero values then the set of approximate global optimizers always has non-zero Lebesgue measure. It follows that the probability that the chain visits the set of approximate global optimizers can be non-zero. Hence, it is sensible to study the conﬁdence of the fact that the solution found by simulated annealing in ﬁnite time is an approximate global optimizer. Remark 3: The intuition that our notion of approximate global optimizer can be used to obtain formal guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of optimization methods based on a stochastic search of the domain is already apparent in the work of Vidyasagar [17, 28]. Vidyasagar [17, 28] introduces a similar deﬁnition and obtains rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees in the optimization of ex- pected value criteria based on uniform independent sampling of the domain. Notably, the number of independent samples required to guarantee some desired accuracy and conﬁdence turns out to be polynomial in the values of the desired imprecision, residual domain and conﬁdence. Although the method of Vidyasagar is not highly sophisticated, it has had considerable success in solving difﬁcult control system design applications [28, 29]. Its appeal stems from its rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees which exist without the need for any particular assumption on the optimization criterion. Here we show that ﬁnite-time guarantees for simulated annealing can be obtained by selecting a distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J as the target distribution in place of the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) . The fundamental result is the following theorem which allows one to select in a rigorous way δ and J in the target distribution π (J) . It is important to stress that the result holds universally for any optimization criterion U on a bounded domain. The only minor requirement is that U takes values in [0, 1]. Theorem 1 Let U : Θ → [0, 1] be an optimization criterion where Θ ⊂ RN is bounded. Let J ≥ 1 and δ > 0 be given numbers. Let θ be a multivariate random variable with distribution π (J) (dθ) ∝ [U (θ) + δ]J πLeb (dθ). Let α ∈ (0, 1] and ǫ ∈ [0, 1] be given numbers and deﬁne σ= 1 1+δ 1+ ǫ+1+δ J 1 1+δ 1+δ −1 α ǫ+δ δ . (1) Then the statement “θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α” holds with probability at least σ. Proof. See Appendix A. The importance of the choice of a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J is that π (J) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Hence, the distance Pθk − π (J) TV between the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk and the target distribution π (J) is a meaningful quantity. Convergence of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and MCMC methods in total variation norm is a well studied problem. The theory provides simple conditions under which one derives upper bounds on the distance to the target distribution which are known at each step of the chain and decrease monotonically to zero as the number of steps of the chain grows. The theory has been developed mainly for homogeneous chains [18, 19, 20, 21]. In the case of simulated annealing, the factor that enables us to employ these results is the absolute continuity of the target distribution π (J) with respect to the Lebesgue measure. However, simulated annealing involves the simulation of inhomogeneous chains. In this respect, another important fact is that the choice of a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J implies that the inhomogeneous Markov chain can in fact be formed by a ﬁnite sequence of homogeneous chains (i.e. the cooling schedule {Jk }k=1,2,... can be chosen to be a sequence that takes only a ﬁnite set of values). In turn, this allows one to apply the theory of homogeneous MCMC methods to study the convergence of Pθk to π (J) in total variation norm. On a bounded domain, simple conditions on the ‘proposal distribution’ in the iteration of the simulated annealing algorithm allows one to obtain upper bounds on Pθk − π (J) TV that decrease geometrically to zero as k → ∞, without the need for any additional assumption on U [18, 19, 20, 21]. It is then appropriate to introduce the following ﬁnite-time result. Theorem 2 Let the notation and assumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Let θk , with distribution Pθk , be the state of the inhomogeneous chain of a simulated annealing algorithm with target distribution π (J) . Then the statement “θk is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α” holds with probability at least σ − Pθk − π (J) TV . The proof of the theorem follows directly from the deﬁnition of the total variation norm. It follows that if simulated annealing is implemented with an algorithm which converges in total variation distance to a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J, then one can state with conﬁdence arbitrarily close to 1 that the solution found by the algorithm after the known appropriate ﬁnite number of steps is an approximate global optimizer with the desired approximation level. For given non-zero values of ǫ, α the value of σ given by (1) can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by choice of J; while the distance Pθk − π (J) TV can be made arbitrarily small by taking the known sufﬁcient number of steps. It can be shown that there exists the possibility of making an optimal choice of δ and J in the target distribution π (J) . In fact, for given ǫ and α and a given value of J there exists an optimal choice of δ which maximizes the value of σ given by (1). Hence, it is possible to obtain a desired σ with the smallest possible J. The advantage of choosing the smallest J, consistent with the required approximation and conﬁdence, is that it will decrease the number of steps required to achieve the desired reduction of Pθk − π (J) TV . 4 Conclusions We have introduced a new formulation of simulated annealing which admits rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. First, we have introduced the notion of approximate global optimizer. Then, we have shown that simulated annealing is guaranteed to ﬁnd approximate global optimizers, with the desired conﬁdence and the desired level of accuracy, in a known ﬁnite number of steps, if a proper choice of the target distribution is made and conditions for convergence in total variation norm are met. The results hold for any optimization criterion on a bounded domain with the only minor requirement that it takes values between 0 and 1. In this framework, simulated annealing algorithms with rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees can be derived by studying the choice of the proposal distribution and of the cooling schedule, in the generic iteration of simulated annealing, in order to ensure convergence to the target distribution in total variation norm. To do this, existing theory of convergence of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and MCMC methods on continuous domains can be used [18, 19, 20, 21]. Vidyasagar [17, 28] has introduced a similar deﬁnition of approximate global optimizer and has shown that approximate optimizers with desired accuracy and conﬁdence can be obtained with a number of uniform independent samples of the domain which is polynomial in the accuracy and conﬁdence parameters. In general, algorithms developed with the MCMC methodology can be expected to be equally or more efﬁcient than uniform independent sampling.

Let πδ be a normalized ¯ measure such that πδ (dθ) ∝ Uδ (θ)πLeb (dθ). In the ﬁrst part of the proof we ﬁnd a lower bound on the probability that θ belongs to the set {θ ∈ Θ : πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > Uδ (θ)} ≤ α} . ¯ Let yα := inf{y : πδ {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≤ y} ≥ 1 − α}. To start with we show that the set ¯ ¯ {θ ∈ Θ : πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > Uδ (θ)} ≤ α} coincides with {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≥ ρ yα }. Notice ¯ ¯ that the quantity πδ {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≤ y} is a right-continuous non-decreasing function of y because it has the form of a distribution function (see e.g. [30, p.162] and [17, Lemma 11.1]). Therefore we have πδ {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≤ yα } ≥ 1 − α and ¯ ¯ y ≥ ρ yα ⇒ πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) ≤ y} ≥ 1 − α ⇒ πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > y} ≤ α . ¯ ¯ ¯ Moreover, y < ρ yα ⇒ πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) ≤ y} < 1 − α ⇒ πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > y} > α ¯ ¯ ¯ and taking the contrapositive one obtains πδ {θ′ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > y} ≤ α ⇒ y ≥ ρ yα . ¯ ¯ ′ Therefore {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≥ ρ yα } ≡ {θ ∈ Θ : πδ {θ ∈ Θ : ρ Uδ (θ′ ) > Uδ (θ)} ≤ α}. ¯ ¯ We now derive a lower bound on π (J) {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≥ ρ yα }. Let us introduce the notation ¯ ¯¯ Aα := {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) < yα }, Aα := {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≥ yα }, Bα,ρ := {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) < ρ yα } ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯α,ρ := {θ ∈ Θ : Uδ (θ) ≥ ρ yα }.

Hence, the deﬁnition of yα implies πδ (Aα ) ≤ 1 − α and πδ (Aα ) ≥ α.

<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>2 0.64356047 <a title="125-lsi-2" href="./nips-2007-A_Bayesian_Model_of_Conditioned_Perception.html">3 nips-2007-A Bayesian Model of Conditioned Perception</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrea Lecchini-visintini, John Lygeros, Jan Maciejowski</p><p>Abstract: Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a ﬁnite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee ﬁnite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of ﬁnite-time learning with known accuracy and conﬁdence developed in statistical learning theory. Optimization is the general problem of ﬁnding a value of a vector of variables θ that maximizes (or minimizes) some scalar criterion U (θ). The set of all possible values of the vector θ is called the optimization domain. The elements of θ can be discrete or continuous variables. In the ﬁrst case the optimization domain is usually ﬁnite, such as in the well-known traveling salesman problem; in the second case the optimization domain is a continuous set. An important example of a continuous optimization domain is the set of 3-D conﬁgurations of a sequence of amino-acids in the problem of ﬁnding the minimum energy folding of the corresponding protein [1]. In principle, any optimization problem on a ﬁnite domain can be solved by an exhaustive search. However, this is often beyond computational capacity: the optimization domain of the traveling salesman problem with 100 cities contains more than 10155 possible tours. An efﬁcient algorithm to solve the traveling salesman and many similar problems has not yet been found and such problems remain reliably solvable only in principle [2]. Statistical mechanics has inspired widely used methods for ﬁnding good approximate solutions in hard discrete optimization problems which defy efﬁcient exact solutions [3, 4, 5, 6]. Here a key idea has been that of simulated annealing [3]: a random search based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, such that the distribution of the elements of the domain visited during the search converges to an equilibrium distribution concentrated around the global optimizers. Convergence and ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing on ﬁnite domains has been evaluated in many works, e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10]. On continuous domains, most popular optimization methods perform a local gradient-based search and in general converge to local optimizers; with the notable exception of convex criteria where convergence to the unique global optimizer occurs [11]. Simulated annealing performs a global search and can be easily implemented on continuous domains. Hence it can be considered a powerful complement to local methods. In this paper, we introduce for the ﬁrst time rigorous guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing on continuous domains. We will show that it is possible to derive simulated annealing algorithms which, with an arbitrarily high level of conﬁdence, ﬁnd an approximate solution to the problem of optimizing a function of continuous variables, within a speciﬁed tolerance to the global optimal solution after a known ﬁnite number of steps. Rigorous guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of simulated annealing in the optimization of functions of continuous variables have never been obtained before; the only results available state that simulated annealing converges to a global optimizer as the number of steps grows to inﬁnity, e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15]. The background of our work is twofold. On the one hand, our notion of approximate solution to a global optimization problem is inspired by the concept of ﬁnite-time learning with known accuracy and conﬁdence developed in statistical learning theory [16, 17]. We actually maintain an important aspect of statistical learning theory which is that we do not introduce any particular assumption on the optimization criterion, i.e. our results hold regardless of what U is. On the other hand, we ground our results on the theory of convergence, with quantitative bounds on the distance to the target distribution, of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which has been one of the main achievements of recent research in statistics [18, 19, 20, 21]. In this paper, we will not develop any ready-to-use optimization algorithm. We will instead introduce a general formulation of the simulated annealing method which allows one to derive new simulated annealing algorithms with rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees on the basis of existing theory. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the general family of MCMC methods have many degrees of freedom. The choice and comparison of speciﬁc algorithms goes beyond the scope of the paper. The paper is organized in the following sections. In Simulated annealing we introduce the method and ﬁx the notation. In Convergence we recall the reasons why ﬁnite-time guarantees for simulated annealing on continuous domains have not been obtained before. In Finite-time guarantees we present the main result of the paper. In Conclusions we state our ﬁndings and conclude the paper. 1 Simulated annealing The original formulation of simulated annealing was inspired by the analogy between the stochastic evolution of the thermodynamic state of an annealing material towards the conﬁgurations of minimal energy and the search for the global minimum of an optimization criterion [3]. In the procedure, the optimization criterion plays the role of the energy and the state of the annealed material is simulated by the evolution of the state of an inhomogeneous Markov chain. The state of the chain evolves according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in order to simulate the Boltzmann distribution of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Boltzmann distribution is simulated for a decreasing sequence of temperatures (“cooling”). The target distribution of the cooling procedure is the limiting Boltzmann distribution, for the temperature that tends to zero, which takes non-zero values only on the set of global minimizers [7]. The original formulation of the method was for a ﬁnite domain. However, simulated annealing can be generalized straightforwardly to a continuous domain because the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used with almost no differences on discrete and continuous domains The main difference is that on a continuous domain the equilibrium distributions are speciﬁed by probability densities. On a continuous domain, Markov transition kernels in which the distribution of the elements visited by the chain converges to an equilibrium distribution with the desired density can be constructed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the general family of MCMC methods [22]. We point out that Boltzmann distributions are not the only distributions which can be adopted as equilibrium distributions in simulated annealing [7]. In this paper it is convenient for us to adopt a different type of equilibrium distribution in place of Boltzmann distributions. 1.1 Our setting The optimization criterion is U : Θ → [0, 1], with Θ ⊂ RN . The assumption that U takes values in the interval [0, 1] is a technical one. It does not imply any serious loss of generality. In general, any bounded optimization criterion can be scaled to take values in [0, 1]. We assume that the optimization task is to ﬁnd a global maximizer; this can be done without loss of generality. We also assume that Θ is a bounded set. We consider equilibrium distributions deﬁned by probability density functions proportional to [U (θ) + δ]J where J and δ are two strictly positive parameters. We use π (J) to denote an equilibrium distribution, i.e. π (J) (dθ) ∝ [U (θ) + δ]J πLeb (dθ) where πLeb is the standard Lebesgue measure. Here, J −1 plays the role of the temperature: if the function U (θ) plus δ is taken to a positive power J then as J increases (i.e. as J −1 decreases) [U (θ) + δ]J becomes increasingly peaked around the global maximizers. The parameter δ is an offset which guarantees that the equilibrium densities are always strictly positive, even if U takes zero values on some elements of the domain. The offset δ is chosen by the user and we show later that our results allow one to make an optimal selection of δ. The zero-temperature distribution is the limiting distribution, for J → ∞, which takes non-zero values only on the set of global maximizers. It is denoted by π (∞) . In the generic formulation of the method, the Markov transition kernel of the k-th step of the inhomogeneous chain has equilibrium distribution π (Jk ) where {Jk }k=1,2,... is the “cooling schedule”. The cooling schedule is a non-decreasing sequence of positive numbers according to which the equilibrium distribution become increasingly sharpened during the evolution of the chain. We use θk to denote the state of the chain and Pθk to denote its probability distribution. The distribution Pθk obviously depends on the initial condition θ0 . However, in this work, we don’t need to make this dependence explicit in the notation. Remark 1: If, given an element θ in Θ, the value U (θ) can be computed directly, we say that U is a deterministic criterion, e.g. the energy landscape in protein structure prediction [1]. In problems involving random variables, the value U (θ) may be the expected value U (θ) = g(x, θ)px (x; θ)dx of some function g which depends on both the optimization variable θ, and on some random variable x which has probability density px (x; θ) (which may itself depend on θ). In such problems it is usually not possible to compute U (θ) directly, either because evaluation of the integral requires too much computation, or because no analytical expression for px (x; θ) is available. Typically one must perform stochastic simulations in order to obtain samples of x for a given θ, hence obtain sample values of g(x, θ), and thus construct a Monte Carlo estimate of U (θ). The Bayesian design of clinical trials is an important application area where such expected-value criteria arise [23]. The authors of this paper investigate the optimization of expected-value criteria motivated by problems of aircraft routing [24]. In the particular case that px (x; θ) does not depend on θ, the optimization task is often called “empirical risk minimization”, and is studied extensively in statistical learning theory [16, 17]. The results of this paper apply in the same way to the optimization of both deterministic and expected-value criteria. The MCMC method developed by M¨ ller [25, 26] allows one u to construct simulated annealing algorithms for the optimization of expected-value criteria. M¨ ller u [25, 26] employs the same equilibrium distributions as those described in our setting; in his context J is restricted to integer values. 2 Convergence The rationale of simulated annealing is as follows: if the temperature is kept constant, say Jk = J, then the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk tends to the equilibrium distribution π (J) ; if J → ∞ then the equilibrium distribution π (J) tends to the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) ; as a result, if the cooling schedule Jk tends to inﬁnity, one obtains that Pθk “follows” π (Jk ) and that π (Jk ) tends to π (∞) and eventually that the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk tends to π (∞) . The theory shows that, under conditions on the cooling schedule and the Markov transition kernels, the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk actually converges to the target zero-temperature distribution π (∞) as k → ∞ [12, 13, 14, 15]. Convergence to the zero-temperature distribution implies that asymptotically the state of the chain eventually coincides with a global optimizer with probability one. The difﬁculty which must be overcome in order to obtain ﬁnite step results on simulated annealing algorithms on a continuous domain is that usually, in an optimization problem deﬁned over continuous variables, the set of global optimizers has zero Lebesgue measure (e.g. a set of isolated points). If the set of global optimizers has zero measure then the set of global optimizers has null probability according to the equilibrium distributions π (J) for any ﬁnite J and, as a consequence, according to the distributions Pθk for any ﬁnite k. Put another way, the probability that the state of the chain visits the set of global optimizers is constantly zero after any ﬁnite number of steps. Hence the conﬁdence of the fact that the solution provided by the algorithm in ﬁnite time coincides with a global optimizer is also constantly zero. Notice that this is not the case for a ﬁnite domain, where the set of global optimizers is of non-null measure with respect to the reference counting measure [7, 8, 9, 10]. It is instructive to look at the issue also in terms of the rate of convergence to the target zerotemperature distribution. On a discrete domain, the distribution of the state of the chain at each step and the zero-temperature distribution are both standard discrete distributions. It is then possible to deﬁne a distance between them and study the rate of convergence of this distance to zero. This analysis allows one to obtain results on the ﬁnite-time behavior of simulated annealing [7, 8]. On a continuous domain and for a set of global optimizers of measure zero, the target zero-temperature distribution π (∞) ends up being a mixture of probability masses on the set of global optimizers. In this situation, although the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk still converges asymptotically to π (∞) , it is not possible to introduce a sensible distance between the two distributions and a rate of convergence to the target distribution cannot even be deﬁned (weak convergence), see [12, Theorem 3.3]. This is the reason that until now there have been no guarantees on the performance of simulated annealing on a continuous domain after a ﬁnite number of computations: by adopting the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) as the target distribution it is only possible to prove asymptotic convergence in inﬁnite time to a global optimizer. Remark 2: The standard distance between two distributions, say µ1 and µ2 , on a continuous support is the total variation norm µ1 − µ2 T V = supA |µ1 (A) − µ2 (A)|, see e.g. [21]. In simulated annealing on a continuous domain the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure (i.e. πLeb (A) = 0 ⇒ Pθk (A) = 0), by construction for any ﬁnite k. Hence if the set of global optimizers has zero Lebesgue measure then it has zero measure also according to Pθk . The set of global optimizers has however measure 1 according to π (∞) . The distance Pθk − π (∞) T V is then constantly 1 for any ﬁnite k. It is also worth mentioning that if the set of global optimizers has zero measure then asymptotic convergence to the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) can be proven only under the additional assumptions of continuity and differentiability of U [12, 13, 14, 15]. 3 Finite-time guarantees In general, optimization algorithms for problems deﬁned on continuous variables can only ﬁnd approximate solutions in ﬁnite time [27]. Given an element θ of a continuous domain how can we assess how good it is as an approximate solution to an optimization problem? Here we introduce the concept of approximate global optimizer to answer this question. The deﬁnition is given for a maximization problem in a continuous but bounded domain. We use two parameters: the value imprecision ǫ (greater than or equal to 0) and the residual domain α (between 0 and 1) which together determine the level of approximation. We say that θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α if the function U takes values strictly greater than U (θ) + ǫ only on a subset of values of θ no larger than an α portion of the optimization domain. The formal deﬁnition is as follows. Deﬁnition 1 Let U : Θ → R be an optimization criterion where Θ ⊂ RN is bounded. Let πLeb denote the standard Lebesgue measure. Let ǫ ≥ 0 and α ∈ [0, 1] be given numbers. Then θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α if πLeb {θ′ ∈ Θ : U (θ′ ) > U (θ) + ǫ} ≤ α πLeb (Θ) . In other words, the value U (θ) is within ǫ of a value which is greater than the values that U takes on at least a 1 − α portion of the domain. The smaller ǫ and α are, the better is the approximation of a true global optimizer. If both α and ǫ are equal to zero then U (θ) coincides with the essential supremum of U . Our deﬁnition of approximate global optimizer carries an important property, which holds regardless of what the criterion U is: if ǫ and α have non-zero values then the set of approximate global optimizers always has non-zero Lebesgue measure. It follows that the probability that the chain visits the set of approximate global optimizers can be non-zero. Hence, it is sensible to study the conﬁdence of the fact that the solution found by simulated annealing in ﬁnite time is an approximate global optimizer. Remark 3: The intuition that our notion of approximate global optimizer can be used to obtain formal guarantees on the ﬁnite-time performance of optimization methods based on a stochastic search of the domain is already apparent in the work of Vidyasagar [17, 28]. Vidyasagar [17, 28] introduces a similar deﬁnition and obtains rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees in the optimization of ex- pected value criteria based on uniform independent sampling of the domain. Notably, the number of independent samples required to guarantee some desired accuracy and conﬁdence turns out to be polynomial in the values of the desired imprecision, residual domain and conﬁdence. Although the method of Vidyasagar is not highly sophisticated, it has had considerable success in solving difﬁcult control system design applications [28, 29]. Its appeal stems from its rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees which exist without the need for any particular assumption on the optimization criterion. Here we show that ﬁnite-time guarantees for simulated annealing can be obtained by selecting a distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J as the target distribution in place of the zero-temperature distribution π (∞) . The fundamental result is the following theorem which allows one to select in a rigorous way δ and J in the target distribution π (J) . It is important to stress that the result holds universally for any optimization criterion U on a bounded domain. The only minor requirement is that U takes values in [0, 1]. Theorem 1 Let U : Θ → [0, 1] be an optimization criterion where Θ ⊂ RN is bounded. Let J ≥ 1 and δ > 0 be given numbers. Let θ be a multivariate random variable with distribution π (J) (dθ) ∝ [U (θ) + δ]J πLeb (dθ). Let α ∈ (0, 1] and ǫ ∈ [0, 1] be given numbers and deﬁne σ= 1 1+δ 1+ ǫ+1+δ J 1 1+δ 1+δ −1 α ǫ+δ δ . (1) Then the statement “θ is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α” holds with probability at least σ. Proof. See Appendix A. The importance of the choice of a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J is that π (J) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Hence, the distance Pθk − π (J) TV between the distribution of the state of the chain Pθk and the target distribution π (J) is a meaningful quantity. Convergence of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and MCMC methods in total variation norm is a well studied problem. The theory provides simple conditions under which one derives upper bounds on the distance to the target distribution which are known at each step of the chain and decrease monotonically to zero as the number of steps of the chain grows. The theory has been developed mainly for homogeneous chains [18, 19, 20, 21]. In the case of simulated annealing, the factor that enables us to employ these results is the absolute continuity of the target distribution π (J) with respect to the Lebesgue measure. However, simulated annealing involves the simulation of inhomogeneous chains. In this respect, another important fact is that the choice of a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J implies that the inhomogeneous Markov chain can in fact be formed by a ﬁnite sequence of homogeneous chains (i.e. the cooling schedule {Jk }k=1,2,... can be chosen to be a sequence that takes only a ﬁnite set of values). In turn, this allows one to apply the theory of homogeneous MCMC methods to study the convergence of Pθk to π (J) in total variation norm. On a bounded domain, simple conditions on the ‘proposal distribution’ in the iteration of the simulated annealing algorithm allows one to obtain upper bounds on Pθk − π (J) TV that decrease geometrically to zero as k → ∞, without the need for any additional assumption on U [18, 19, 20, 21]. It is then appropriate to introduce the following ﬁnite-time result. Theorem 2 Let the notation and assumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Let θk , with distribution Pθk , be the state of the inhomogeneous chain of a simulated annealing algorithm with target distribution π (J) . Then the statement “θk is an approximate global optimizer of U with value imprecision ǫ and residual domain α” holds with probability at least σ − Pθk − π (J) TV . The proof of the theorem follows directly from the deﬁnition of the total variation norm. It follows that if simulated annealing is implemented with an algorithm which converges in total variation distance to a target distribution π (J) with a ﬁnite J, then one can state with conﬁdence arbitrarily close to 1 that the solution found by the algorithm after the known appropriate ﬁnite number of steps is an approximate global optimizer with the desired approximation level. For given non-zero values of ǫ, α the value of σ given by (1) can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by choice of J; while the distance Pθk − π (J) TV can be made arbitrarily small by taking the known sufﬁcient number of steps. It can be shown that there exists the possibility of making an optimal choice of δ and J in the target distribution π (J) . In fact, for given ǫ and α and a given value of J there exists an optimal choice of δ which maximizes the value of σ given by (1). Hence, it is possible to obtain a desired σ with the smallest possible J. The advantage of choosing the smallest J, consistent with the required approximation and conﬁdence, is that it will decrease the number of steps required to achieve the desired reduction of Pθk − π (J) TV . 4 Conclusions We have introduced a new formulation of simulated annealing which admits rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. First, we have introduced the notion of approximate global optimizer. Then, we have shown that simulated annealing is guaranteed to ﬁnd approximate global optimizers, with the desired conﬁdence and the desired level of accuracy, in a known ﬁnite number of steps, if a proper choice of the target distribution is made and conditions for convergence in total variation norm are met. The results hold for any optimization criterion on a bounded domain with the only minor requirement that it takes values between 0 and 1. In this framework, simulated annealing algorithms with rigorous ﬁnite-time guarantees can be derived by studying the choice of the proposal distribution and of the cooling schedule, in the generic iteration of simulated annealing, in order to ensure convergence to the target distribution in total variation norm. To do this, existing theory of convergence of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and MCMC methods on continuous domains can be used [18, 19, 20, 21]. Vidyasagar [17, 28] has introduced a similar deﬁnition of approximate global optimizer and has shown that approximate optimizers with desired accuracy and conﬁdence can be obtained with a number of uniform independent samples of the domain which is polynomial in the accuracy and conﬁdence parameters. In general, algorithms developed with the MCMC methodology can be expected to be equally or more efﬁcient than uniform independent sampling.

<p>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Arnaud Doucet, Nando D. Freitas, Ajay Jasra</p><p>Abstract: A recently proposed formulation of the stochastic planning and control problem as one of parameter estimation for suitable artiﬁcial statistical models has led to the adoption of inference algorithms for this notoriously hard problem. At the algorithmic level, the focus has been on developing Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms. In this paper, we begin by making the crucial observation that the stochastic control problem can be reinterpreted as one of trans-dimensional inference. With this new interpretation, we are able to propose a novel reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is more efﬁcient than its EM counterparts. Moreover, it enables us to implement full Bayesian policy search, without the need for gradients and with one single Markov chain. The new approach involves sampling directly from a distribution that is proportional to the reward and, consequently, performs better than classic simulations methods in situations where the reward is a rare event.</p><p>5 0.54586238 <a title="125-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-Active_Preference_Learning_with_Discrete_Choice_Data.html">19 nips-2007-Active Preference Learning with Discrete Choice Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Brochu Eric, Nando D. Freitas, Abhijeet Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active learning algorithm that learns a continuous valuation model from discrete preferences. The algorithm automatically decides what items are best presented to an individual in order to ﬁnd the item that they value highly in as few trials as possible, and exploits quirks of human psychology to minimize time and cognitive burden. To do this, our algorithm maximizes the expected improvement at each query without accurately modelling the entire valuation surface, which would be needlessly expensive. The problem is particularly difﬁcult because the space of choices is inﬁnite. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to related active learning methods. We also embed the algorithm within a decision making tool for assisting digital artists in rendering materials.

<p>Author: Brian J. Fischer</p><p>Abstract: Sound localization by barn owls is commonly modeled as a matching procedure where localization cues derived from auditory inputs are compared to stored templates. While the matching models can explain properties of neural responses, no model explains how the owl resolves spatial ambiguity in the localization cues to produce accurate localization for sources near the center of gaze. Here, I examine two models for the barn owl’s sound localization behavior. First, I consider a maximum likelihood estimator in order to further evaluate the cue matching model. Second, I consider a maximum a posteriori estimator to test whether a Bayesian model with a prior that emphasizes directions near the center of gaze can reproduce the owl’s localization behavior. I show that the maximum likelihood estimator can not reproduce the owl’s behavior, while the maximum a posteriori estimator is able to match the behavior. This result suggests that the standard cue matching model will not be sufﬁcient to explain sound localization behavior in the barn owl. The Bayesian model provides a new framework for analyzing sound localization in the barn owl and leads to predictions about the owl’s localization behavior.</p><p>2 0.84557205 <a title="125-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Parallelizing_Support_Vector_Machines_on_Distributed_Computers.html">152 nips-2007-Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaihua Zhu, Hao Wang, Hongjie Bai, Jian Li, Zhihuan Qiu, Hang Cui, Edward Y. Chang</p><p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) suffer from a widely recognized scalability problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability, we have developed a parallel SVM algorithm (PSVM), which reduces memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization, and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is signiﬁcantly smaller than n), and m the number of machines. PSVM reduces the memory requirement from O(n2 ) to O(np/m), and improves computation time to O(np2 /m). Empirical study shows PSVM to be effective. PSVM Open Source is available for download at http://code.google.com/p/psvm/.</p><p>3 0.81822956 <a title="125-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Blind_channel_identification_for_speech_dereverberation_using_l1-norm_sparse_learning.html">37 nips-2007-Blind channel identification for speech dereverberation using l1-norm sparse learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Lin, Jingdong Chen, Youngmoo Kim, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Speech dereverberation remains an open problem after more than three decades of research. The most challenging step in speech dereverberation is blind channel identiﬁcation (BCI). Although many BCI approaches have been developed, their performance is still far from satisfactory for practical applications. The main difﬁculty in BCI lies in ﬁnding an appropriate acoustic model, which not only can effectively resolve solution degeneracies due to the lack of knowledge of the source, but also robustly models real acoustic environments. This paper proposes a sparse acoustic room impulse response (RIR) model for BCI, that is, an acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse FIR ﬁlter. Under this model, we show how to formulate the BCI of a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system into a l1 norm regularized least squares (LS) problem, which is convex and can be solved efﬁciently with guaranteed global convergence. The sparseness of solutions is controlled by l1 -norm regularization parameters. We propose a sparse learning scheme that infers the optimal l1 -norm regularization parameters directly from microphone observations under a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the proposed approach is effective and robust, and it yields source estimates in real acoustic environments with high ﬁdelity to anechoic chamber measurements.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.7704829 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_People.html">125 nips-2007-Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many formal models of cognition implicitly use subjective probability distributions to capture the assumptions of human learners. Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective probability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC acceptance rule, deﬁning a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artiﬁcial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience. 1</p><p>5 0.69520557 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Learning_the_2-D_Topology_of_Images.html">115 nips-2007-Learning the 2-D Topology of Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas L. Roux, Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Marc Joliveau, Balázs Kégl</p><p>Abstract: We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a ﬁxed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes, but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.</p><p>6 0.68471879 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Convex_Relaxations_of_Latent_Variable_Training.html">63 nips-2007-Convex Relaxations of Latent Variable Training</a></p>

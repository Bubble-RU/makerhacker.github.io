<p>Author: Xiaogang Wang, Eric Grimson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely applied in the computer vision ﬁeld. However, many of these applications have difﬁculty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since LDA assumes that a document is a “bag-of-words”. It is also critical to properly design “words” and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA), which better encodes spatial structures among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the values of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents a priori, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in SLDA. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be ﬂexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use SLDA to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than LDA. 1</p><p>3 0.11956854 <a title="113-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Scene_Segmentation_with_CRFs_Learned_from_Partially_Labeled_Images.html">172 nips-2007-Scene Segmentation with CRFs Learned from Partially Labeled Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Bill Triggs, Jakob J. Verbeek</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are an effective tool for a variety of different data segmentation and labeling tasks including visual scene interpretation, which seeks to partition images into their constituent semantic-level regions and assign appropriate class labels to each region. For accurate labeling it is important to capture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size. Our experimental results show that effective models can be learned from fragmentary labelings and that incorporating top-down aggregate features signiﬁcantly improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art on three different image datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.11436895 <a title="113-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Configuration_Estimates_Improve_Pedestrian_Finding.html">56 nips-2007-Configuration Estimates Improve Pedestrian Finding</a></p>
<p>Author: Duan Tran, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Fair discriminative pedestrian ﬁnders are now available. In fact, these pedestrian ﬁnders make most errors on pedestrians in conﬁgurations that are uncommon in the training data, for example, mounting a bicycle. This is undesirable. However, the human conﬁguration can itself be estimated discriminatively using structure learning. We demonstrate a pedestrian ﬁnder which ﬁrst ﬁnds the most likely human pose in the window using a discriminative procedure trained with structure learning on a small dataset. We then present features (local histogram of oriented gradient and local PCA of gradient) based on that conﬁguration to an SVM classiﬁer. We show, using the INRIA Person dataset, that estimates of conﬁguration signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of a discriminative pedestrian ﬁnder. 1</p><p>5 0.1067652 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Object_Recognition_by_Scene_Alignment.html">143 nips-2007-Object Recognition by Scene Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba, Ce Liu, Rob Fergus, William T.

We seek to build a system to recognize and localize many different object categories in complex scenes. We achieve this through a simple approach: by matching the input image, in an appropriate representation, to images in a large training set of labeled images. Due to regularities in object identities across similar scenes, the retrieved matches provide hypotheses for object identities and locations. We build a probabilistic model to transfer the labels from the retrieval set to the input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and study algorithm component contributions using held-out test sets from the LabelMe database. 1</p><p>6 0.095505901 <a title="113-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Kernels_on_Attributed_Pointsets_with_Applications.html">109 nips-2007-Kernels on Attributed Pointsets with Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Alexandru Balan, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Estimation of three-dimensional articulated human pose and motion from images is a central problem in computer vision. Much of the previous work has been limited by the use of crude generative models of humans represented as articulated collections of simple parts such as cylinders. Automatic initialization of such models has proved difﬁcult and most approaches assume that the size and shape of the body parts are known a priori. In this paper we propose a method for automatically recovering a detailed parametric model of non-rigid body shape and pose from monocular imagery. Speciﬁcally, we represent the body using a parameterized triangulated mesh model that is learned from a database of human range scans. We demonstrate a discriminative method to directly recover the model parameters from monocular images using a conditional mixture of kernel regressors. This predicted pose and shape are used to initialize a generative model for more detailed pose and shape estimation. The resulting approach allows fully automatic pose and shape recovery from monocular and multi-camera imagery. Experimental results show that our method is capable of robustly recovering articulated pose, shape and biometric measurements (e.g. height, weight, etc.) in both calibrated and uncalibrated camera environments. 1</p><p>6 0.51223838 <a title="113-lsi-6" href="./nips-2007-Spatial_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">183 nips-2007-Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Victoria Manfredi, Jim Kurose</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of adaptive sensor control in dynamic resourceconstrained sensor networks. We focus on a meteorological sensing network comprising radars that can perform sector scanning rather than always scanning 360◦ . We compare three sector scanning strategies. The sit-and-spin strategy always scans 360◦ . The limited lookahead strategy additionally uses the expected environmental state K decision epochs in the future, as predicted from Kalman ﬁlters, in its decision-making. The full lookahead strategy uses all expected future states by casting the problem as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to estimate the optimal scan strategy. We show that the main beneﬁts of using a lookahead strategy are when there are multiple meteorological phenomena in the environment, and when the maximum radius of any phenomenon is sufﬁciently smaller than the radius of the radars. We also show that there is a trade-off between the average quality with which a phenomenon is scanned and the number of decision epochs before which a phenomenon is rescanned. 1</p><p>2 0.81181771 <a title="113-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Learning_to_classify_complex_patterns_using_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">117 nips-2007-Learning to classify complex patterns using a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.73826438 <a title="113-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Learning_Visual_Attributes.html">113 nips-2007-Learning Visual Attributes</a></p>

These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images.</p><p>4 0.71800238 <a title="113-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Variational_inference_for_Markov_jump_processes.html">214 nips-2007-Variational inference for Markov jump processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: Markov jump processes play an important role in a large number of application domains. However, realistic systems are analytically intractable and they have traditionally been analysed using simulation based techniques, which do not provide a framework for statistical inference. We propose a mean ﬁeld approximation to perform posterior inference and parameter estimation. The approximation allows a practical solution to the inference problem, while still retaining a good degree of accuracy. We illustrate our approach on two biologically motivated systems.</p><p>5 0.71108204 <a title="113-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Compressed_Regression.html">53 nips-2007-Compressed Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou, Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has studied the role of sparsity in high dimensional regression and signal reconstruction, establishing theoretical limits for recovering sparse models from sparse data. In this paper we study a variant of this problem where the original n input variables are compressed by a random linear transformation to m n examples in p dimensions, and establish conditions under which a sparse linear model can be successfully recovered from the compressed data. A primary motivation for this compression procedure is to anonymize the data and preserve privacy by revealing little information about the original data. We characterize the number of random projections that are required for 1 -regularized compressed regression to identify the nonzero coefﬁcients in the true model with probability approaching one, a property called “sparsistence.” In addition, we show that 1 -regularized compressed regression asymptotically predicts as well as an oracle linear model, a property called “persistence.” Finally, we characterize the privacy properties of the compression procedure in information-theoretic terms, establishing upper bounds on the rate of information communicated between the compressed and uncompressed data that decay to zero. 1</p><p>6 0.69583452 <a title="113-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>

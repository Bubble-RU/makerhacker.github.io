<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Point process encoding models provide powerful statistical methods for understanding the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Although these models have been successfully applied to neurons in the early sensory pathway, they have fared less well capturing the response properties of neurons in deeper brain areas, owing in part to the fact that they do not take into account multiple stages of processing. Here we introduce a new twist on the point-process modeling approach: we include unobserved as well as observed spiking neurons in a joint encoding model. The resulting model exhibits richer dynamics and more highly nonlinear response properties, making it more powerful and more ﬂexible for ﬁtting neural data. More importantly, it allows us to estimate connectivity patterns among neurons (both observed and unobserved), and may provide insight into how networks process sensory input. We formulate the estimation procedure using variational EM and the wake-sleep algorithm, and illustrate the model’s performance using a simulated example network consisting of two coupled neurons.</p><p>3 0.34464851 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2007-Learning_to_classify_complex_patterns_using_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">117 nips-2007-Learning to classify complex patterns using a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinjoy Mitra, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Fusi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compact, low power VLSI network of spiking neurons which can learn to classify complex patterns of mean ﬁring rates on–line and in real–time. The network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons is connected by bistable synapses that can change their weight using a local spike–based plasticity mechanism. Learning is supervised by a teacher which provides an extra input to the output neurons during training. The synaptic weights are updated only if the current generated by the plastic synapses does not match the output desired by the teacher (as in the perceptron learning rule). We present experimental results that demonstrate how this VLSI network is able to robustly classify uncorrelated linearly separable spatial patterns of mean ﬁring rates.</p><p>4 0.32511243 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2007-Theoretical_Analysis_of_Learning_with_Reward-Modulated_Spike-Timing-Dependent_Plasticity.html">205 nips-2007-Theoretical Analysis of Learning with Reward-Modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Dejan Pecevski, Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: Reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has recently emerged as a candidate for a learning rule that could explain how local learning rules at single synapses support behaviorally relevant adaptive changes in complex networks of spiking neurons. However the potential and limitations of this learning rule could so far only be tested through computer simulations. This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allow us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will be able to achieve a desired learning effect. In particular, we can produce in this way a theoretical explanation and a computer model for a fundamental experimental ﬁnding on biofeedback in monkeys (reported in [1]).</p><p>5 0.30988184 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2007-Bayesian_Inference_for_Spiking_Neuron_Models_with_a_Sparsity_Prior.html">33 nips-2007-Bayesian Inference for Spiking Neuron Models with a Sparsity Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Gerwinn, Matthias Bethge, Jakob H. Macke, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Generalized linear models are the most commonly used tools to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of such models. Using the expectation propagation algorithm, we are able to approximate the full posterior distribution over all weights. In addition, we use a Laplacian prior to favor sparse solutions. Therefore, stimulus features that do not critically inﬂuence neural activity will be assigned zero weights and thus be effectively excluded by the model. This feature selection mechanism facilitates both the interpretation of the neuron model as well as its predictive abilities. The posterior distribution can be used to obtain conﬁdence intervals which makes it possible to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the solution. In neural data analysis, the available amount of experimental measurements is often limited whereas the parameter space is large. In such a situation, both regularization by a sparsity prior and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters are essential. We apply our method to multi-electrode recordings of retinal ganglion cells and use our uncertainty estimate to test the statistical signiﬁcance of functional couplings between neurons. Furthermore we used the sparsity of the Laplace prior to select those ﬁlters from a spike-triggered covariance analysis that are most informative about the neural response. 1</p><p>6 0.28342947 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2007-Better_than_least_squares%3A_comparison_of_objective_functions_for_estimating_linear-nonlinear_models.html">36 nips-2007-Better than least squares: comparison of objective functions for estimating linear-nonlinear models</a></p>

<p>Author: Emre Neftci, Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Jean-jeacques Slotine, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: A non–linear dynamic system is called contracting if initial conditions are forgotten exponentially fast, so that all trajectories converge to a single trajectory. We use contraction theory to derive an upper bound for the strength of recurrent connections that guarantees contraction for complex neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we apply this theory to a special class of recurrent networks, often called Cooperative Competitive Networks (CCNs), which are an abstract representation of the cooperative-competitive connectivity observed in cortex. This speciﬁc type of network is believed to play a major role in shaping cortical responses and selecting the relevant signal among distractors and noise. In this paper, we analyze contraction of combined CCNs of linear threshold units and verify the results of our analysis in a hybrid analog/digital VLSI CCN comprising spiking neurons and dynamic synapses. 1</p><p>5 0.7481668 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./nips-2007-A_configurable_analog_VLSI_neural_network_with_spiking_neurons_and_self-regulating_plastic_synapses.html">14 nips-2007-A configurable analog VLSI neural network with spiking neurons and self-regulating plastic synapses</a></p>

<p>Author: Cha Zhang, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: Cascade detectors have been shown to operate extremely rapidly, with high accuracy, and have important applications such as face detection. Driven by this success, cascade learning has been an area of active research in recent years. Nevertheless, there are still challenging technical problems during the training process of cascade detectors. In particular, determining the optimal target detection rate for each stage of the cascade remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we propose the multiple instance pruning (MIP) algorithm for soft cascades. This algorithm computes a set of thresholds which aggressively terminate computation with no reduction in detection rate or increase in false positive rate on the training dataset. The algorithm is based on two key insights: i) examples that are destined to be rejected by the complete classiﬁer can be safely pruned early; ii) face detection is a multiple instance learning problem. The MIP process is fully automatic and requires no assumptions of probability distributions, statistical independence, or ad hoc intermediate rejection targets. Experimental results on the MIT+CMU dataset demonstrate signiﬁcant performance advantages. 1</p><p>2 0.87981021 <a title="177-lda-2" href="./nips-2007-Support_Vector_Machine_Classification_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">190 nips-2007-Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronny Luss, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for support vector machine classiﬁcation using indeﬁnite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our method simultaneously ﬁnds the support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in computing the loss. This can be interpreted as a robust classiﬁcation problem where the indeﬁnite kernel matrix is treated as a noisy observation of the true positive semideﬁnite kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efﬁciently using the analytic center cutting plane method. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several data sets.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85543281 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./nips-2007-Simplified_Rules_and_Theoretical_Analysis_for_Information_Bottleneck_Optimization_and_PCA_with_Spiking_Neurons.html">177 nips-2007-Simplified Rules and Theoretical Analysis for Information Bottleneck Optimization and PCA with Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We show that under suitable assumptions (primarily linearization) a simple and perspicuous online learning rule for Information Bottleneck optimization with spiking neurons can be derived. This rule performs on common benchmark tasks as well as a rather complex rule that has previously been proposed [1]. Furthermore, the transparency of this new learning rule makes a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties feasible. A variation of this learning rule (with sign changes) provides a theoretically founded method for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with spiking neurons. By applying this rule to an ensemble of neurons, different principal components of the input can be extracted. In addition, it is possible to preferentially extract those principal components from incoming signals X that are related or are not related to some additional target signal YT . In a biological interpretation, this target signal YT (also called relevance variable) could represent proprioceptive feedback, input from other sensory modalities, or top-down signals. 1</p><p>4 0.75241369 <a title="177-lda-4" href="./nips-2007-Kernels_on_Attributed_Pointsets_with_Applications.html">109 nips-2007-Kernels on Attributed Pointsets with Applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehul Parsana, Sourangshu Bhattacharya, Chiru Bhattacharya, K. Ramakrishnan</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces kernels on attributed pointsets, which are sets of vectors embedded in an euclidean space. The embedding gives the notion of neighborhood, which is used to deﬁne positive semideﬁnite kernels on pointsets. Two novel kernels on neighborhoods are proposed, one evaluating the attribute similarity and the other evaluating shape similarity. Shape similarity function is motivated from spectral graph matching techniques. The kernels are tested on three real life applications: face recognition, photo album tagging, and shot annotation in video sequences, with encouraging results. 1</p><p>5 0.7383669 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./nips-2007-Sequential_Hypothesis_Testing_under_Stochastic_Deadlines.html">176 nips-2007-Sequential Hypothesis Testing under Stochastic Deadlines</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Frazier, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Most models of decision-making in neuroscience assume an inﬁnite horizon, which yields an optimal solution that integrates evidence up to a ﬁxed decision threshold; however, under most experimental as well as naturalistic behavioral settings, the decision has to be made before some ﬁnite deadline, which is often experienced as a stochastic quantity, either due to variable external constraints or internal timing uncertainty. In this work, we formulate this problem as sequential hypothesis testing under a stochastic horizon. We use dynamic programming tools to show that, for a large class of deadline distributions, the Bayes-optimal solution requires integrating evidence up to a threshold that declines monotonically over time. We use numerical simulations to illustrate the optimal policy in the special cases of a ﬁxed deadline and one that is drawn from a gamma distribution.</p><p>6 0.73629737 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./nips-2007-Configuration_Estimates_Improve_Pedestrian_Finding.html">56 nips-2007-Configuration Estimates Improve Pedestrian Finding</a></p>

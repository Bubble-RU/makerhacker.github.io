<h1>235 nips-2009-Structural inference affects depth perception in the context of potential occlusion</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2009-235-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3663-structural-inference-affects-depth-perception-in-the-context-of-potential-occlusion.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ian Stevenson, Konrad Koerding</p><p>Abstract: In many domains, humans appear to combine perceptual cues in a near-optimal, probabilistic fashion: two noisy pieces of information tend to be combined linearly with weights proportional to the precision of each cue. Here we present a case where structural information plays an important role. The presence of a background cue gives rise to the possibility of occlusion, and places a soft constraint on the location of a target - in effect propelling it forward. We present an ideal observer model of depth estimation for this situation where structural or ordinal information is important and then ﬁt the model to human data from a stereo-matching task. To test whether subjects are truly using ordinal cues in a probabilistic manner we then vary the uncertainty of the task. We ﬁnd that the model accurately predicts shifts in subject’s behavior. Our results indicate that the nervous system estimates depth ordering in a probabilistic fashion and estimates the structure of the visual scene during depth perception. 1</p><br/>

(2007) model presented here  Figure 5: Models of cue combination. (A) Given the observations (y1 and y2 ) from two sources, how should we estimate the hidden sources x1 and x2 ? (B) Classical cue combination models assume x1 = x2 . This results in a linear weighting of the cues. Non-linear cue combination can be explained by causal inference models where x1 and x2 are probabilistically equal. (C) In the model presented here, ordinal information introduces an asymmetry into cue combination. x1 and x2 are related here by a probabilistic inequality. (D) A summary of the relation between x1 and x2 for each model class. 7  A number of studies have proposed probabilistic accounts of depth perception [1, 4, 12, 14], and a variety of cues, such as disparity, shading, and texture, can all be combined to estimate depth [4, 12]. However, accounting for structure in the visual scene and use of occlusion constraints is typically qualitative or limited to hard constraints where certain depth arrangements are strictly ruled out [6, 14]. The model presented here accounts for a range of depth perception effects including perception of both paired and unpaired image points. Importantly, this model of perception explains the effects of ordinal cues in a cohesive structural inference framework. More generally, ordinal information introduces asymmetry into cue combination. Classically, cue combination models assume a generative model in which two observations arise from the same hidden source. That is, the hidden source for observation 1 is equal to the hidden source for observation 2 (Fig 5A). More recently, causal inference or cue conﬂict models have been developed that allow for the possibility of probabilistic equality [9, 11, 12]. That is, there is some probability that the two sources are equal and some probability that they are unequal. This addition explains a number of nonlinear perceptual effects [9, 10] (Fig 5B). The model presented here extends these previous models by introducing ordinal information and allowing the relationship between the two sources to be an inequality - where the value from one source is greater than or less than the other. As with causal inference models, relevance terms allow the model to capture probabilistic inequality, and this type of mixture model allows descriptions of asymmetric and nonlinear behavior (Fig 5C). The ordinal cue combination model thus increases the class of behaviors that can be modeled by cue combination and causal inference and should have applications for other modalities where ordinal and structural information is important.</p>

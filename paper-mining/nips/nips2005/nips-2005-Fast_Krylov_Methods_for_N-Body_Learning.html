<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>3 0.10722747 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees.html">69 nips-2005-Fast Gaussian Process Regression using KD-Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Stephane Lafon, Ioannis Kevrekidis, Ronald R. Coifman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion based probabilistic interpretation of spectral clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms that use the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. Given the pairwise adjacency matrix of all points, we deﬁne a diffusion distance between any two data points and show that the low dimensional representation of the data by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the corresponding Markov matrix is optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, assuming that data points are random samples from a density p(x) = e−U (x) we identify these eigenvectors as discrete approximations of eigenfunctions of a Fokker-Planck operator in a potential 2U (x) with reﬂecting boundary conditions. Finally, applying known results regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the continuous Fokker-Planck operator, we provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the success of spectral clustering and dimensional reduction algorithms based on these ﬁrst few eigenvectors. This analysis elucidates, in terms of the characteristics of diffusion processes, many empirical ﬁndings regarding spectral clustering algorithms.

<p>Author: David Barber, Felix V. Agakov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple information-theoretic approach to soft clustering based on maximizing the mutual information I(x, y) between the unknown cluster labels y and the training patterns x with respect to parameters of speciﬁcally constrained encoding distributions. The constraints are chosen such that patterns are likely to be clustered similarly if they lie close to speciﬁc unknown vectors in the feature space. The method may be conveniently applied to learning the optimal aﬃnity matrix, which corresponds to learning parameters of the kernelized encoder. The procedure does not require computations of eigenvalues of the Gram matrices, which makes it potentially attractive for clustering large data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.071299568 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Conditional_Visual_Tracking_in_Kernel_Space.html">45 nips-2005-Conditional Visual Tracking in Kernel Space</a></p>

<p>Author: Baback Moghaddam, Yair Weiss, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA seeks approximate sparse “eigenvectors” whose projections capture the maximal variance of data. As a cardinality-constrained and non-convex optimization problem, it is NP-hard and is encountered in a wide range of applied ﬁelds, from bio-informatics to ﬁnance. Recent progress has focused mainly on continuous approximation and convex relaxation of the hard cardinality constraint. In contrast, we consider an alternative discrete spectral formulation based on variational eigenvalue bounds and provide an effective greedy strategy as well as provably optimal solutions using branch-and-bound search. Moreover, the exact methodology used reveals a simple renormalization step that improves approximate solutions obtained by any continuous method. The resulting performance gain of discrete algorithms is demonstrated on real-world benchmark data and in extensive Monte Carlo evaluation trials. 1</p><p>6 0.53631043 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Preconditioner_Approximations_for_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models.html">154 nips-2005-Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Training a learning algorithm is a costly task. A major goal of active learning is to reduce this cost. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, KQBC, which is capable of actively learning large scale problems by using selective sampling. The algorithm overcomes the costly sampling step of the well known Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm by projecting onto a low dimensional space. KQBC also enables the use of kernels, providing a simple way of extending QBC to the non-linear scenario. Sampling the low dimension space is done using the hit and run random walk. We demonstrate the success of this novel algorithm by applying it to both artiﬁcial and a real world problems.</p><p>3 0.61653376 <a title="71-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees.html">69 nips-2005-Fast Gaussian Process Regression using KD-Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Gergő Orbán, Jozsef Fiser, Richard N. Aslin, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Humans make optimal perceptual decisions in noisy and ambiguous conditions. Computations underlying such optimal behavior have been shown to rely on probabilistic inference according to generative models whose structure is usually taken to be known a priori. We argue that Bayesian model selection is ideal for inferring similar and even more complex model structures from experience. We ﬁnd in experiments that humans learn subtle statistical properties of visual scenes in a completely unsupervised manner. We show that these ﬁndings are well captured by Bayesian model learning within a class of models that seek to explain observed variables by independent hidden causes. 1</p><p>5 0.60907066 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-A_Domain_Decomposition_Method_for_Fast_Manifold_Learning.html">9 nips-2005-A Domain Decomposition Method for Fast Manifold Learning</a></p>

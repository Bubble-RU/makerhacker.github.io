<p>Author: Bhaskar D. Rao, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: Given a redundant dictionary of basis vectors (or atoms), our goal is to ﬁnd maximally sparse representations of signals. Previously, we have argued that a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework is particularly well-suited for this task, showing that it has far fewer local minima than other Bayesian-inspired strategies. In this paper, we provide further evidence for this claim by proving a restricted equivalence condition, based on the distribution of the nonzero generating model weights, whereby the SBL solution will equal the maximally sparse representation. We also prove that if these nonzero weights are drawn from an approximate Jeffreys prior, then with probability approaching one, our equivalence condition is satisﬁed. Finally, we motivate the worst-case scenario for SBL and demonstrate that it is still better than the most widely used sparse representation algorithms. These include Basis Pursuit (BP), which is based on a convex relaxation of the ℓ0 (quasi)-norm, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), a simple greedy strategy that iteratively selects basis vectors most aligned with the current residual. 1</p><p>3 0.097438231 <a title="163-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Is_Early_Vision_Optimized_for_Extracting_Higher-order_Dependencies%3F.html">101 nips-2005-Is Early Vision Optimized for Extracting Higher-order Dependencies?</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Linear implementations of the efﬁcient coding hypothesis, such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding models, have provided functional explanations for properties of simple cells in V1 [1, 2]. These models, however, ignore the non-linear behavior of neurons and fail to match individual and population properties of neural receptive ﬁelds in subtle but important ways. Hierarchical models, including Gaussian Scale Mixtures [3, 4] and other generative statistical models [5, 6], can capture higher-order regularities in natural images and explain nonlinear aspects of neural processing such as normalization and context effects [6,7]. Previously, it had been assumed that the lower level representation is independent of the hierarchy, and had been ﬁxed when training these models. Here we examine the optimal lower-level representations derived in the context of a hierarchical model and ﬁnd that the resulting representations are strikingly different from those based on linear models. Unlike the the basis functions and ﬁlters learned by ICA or sparse coding, these functions individually more closely resemble simple cell receptive ﬁelds and collectively span a broad range of spatial scales. Our work uniﬁes several related approaches and observations about natural image structure and suggests that hierarchical models might yield better representations of image structure throughout the hierarchy.</p><p>4 0.095758952 <a title="163-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-A_Theoretical_Analysis_of_Robust_Coding_over_Noisy_Overcomplete_Channels.html">15 nips-2005-A Theoretical Analysis of Robust Coding over Noisy Overcomplete Channels</a></p>
<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Doru C. Balcan, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Biological sensory systems are faced with the problem of encoding a high-ﬁdelity sensory signal with a population of noisy, low-ﬁdelity neurons. This problem can be expressed in information theoretic terms as coding and transmitting a multi-dimensional, analog signal over a set of noisy channels. Previously, we have shown that robust, overcomplete codes can be learned by minimizing the reconstruction error with a constraint on the channel capacity. Here, we present a theoretical analysis that characterizes the optimal linear coder and decoder for one- and twodimensional data. The analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides a number of important insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions to achieve robustness. We also report numerical solutions for robust coding of highdimensional image data and show that these codes are substantially more robust compared against other image codes such as ICA and wavelets. 1</p><p>5 0.084713221 <a title="163-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Rodeo%3A_Sparse_Nonparametric_Regression_in_High_Dimensions.html">168 nips-2005-Rodeo: Sparse Nonparametric Regression in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for nonparametric regression that performs bandwidth selection and variable selection simultaneously. The approach is based on the technique of incrementally decreasing the bandwidth in directions where the gradient of the estimator with respect to bandwidth is large. When the unknown function satisﬁes a sparsity condition, our approach avoids the curse of dimensionality, achieving the optimal minimax rate of convergence, up to logarithmic factors, as if the relevant variables were known in advance. The method—called rodeo (regularization of derivative expectation operator)—conducts a sequence of hypothesis tests, and is easy to implement. A modiﬁed version that replaces hard with soft thresholding effectively solves a sequence of lasso problems. 1</p><p>6 0.080362029 <a title="163-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Structured_Prediction_via_the_Extragradient_Method.html">184 nips-2005-Structured Prediction via the Extragradient Method</a></p>

<p>Author: Baback Moghaddam, Yair Weiss, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA seeks approximate sparse “eigenvectors” whose projections capture the maximal variance of data. As a cardinality-constrained and non-convex optimization problem, it is NP-hard and is encountered in a wide range of applied ﬁelds, from bio-informatics to ﬁnance. Recent progress has focused mainly on continuous approximation and convex relaxation of the hard cardinality constraint. In contrast, we consider an alternative discrete spectral formulation based on variational eigenvalue bounds and provide an effective greedy strategy as well as provably optimal solutions using branch-and-bound search. Moreover, the exact methodology used reveals a simple renormalization step that improves approximate solutions obtained by any continuous method. The resulting performance gain of discrete algorithms is demonstrated on real-world benchmark data and in extensive Monte Carlo evaluation trials. 1</p><p>4 0.49670458 <a title="163-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-A_Theoretical_Analysis_of_Robust_Coding_over_Noisy_Overcomplete_Channels.html">15 nips-2005-A Theoretical Analysis of Robust Coding over Noisy Overcomplete Channels</a></p>

<p>Author: Tatsuto Murayama, Peter Davis</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a system-level analysis of a scalable distributed sensing model for networked sensors. In our system model, a data center acquires data from a bunch of L sensors which each independently encode their noisy observations of an original binary sequence, and transmit their encoded data sequences to the data center at a combined rate R, which is limited. Supposing that the sensors use independent LDGM rate distortion codes, we show that the system performance can be evaluated for any given ﬁnite R when the number of sensors L goes to inﬁnity. The analysis shows how the optimal strategy for the distributed sensing problem changes at critical values of the data rate R or the noise level. 1</p><p>2 0.99503839 <a title="163-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Is_Early_Vision_Optimized_for_Extracting_Higher-order_Dependencies%3F.html">101 nips-2005-Is Early Vision Optimized for Extracting Higher-order Dependencies?</a></p>

Previously, it had been assumed that the lower level representation is independent of the hierarchy, and had been ﬁxed when training these models. Here we examine the optimal lower-level representations derived in the context of a hierarchical model and ﬁnd that the resulting representations are strikingly different from those based on linear models. Unlike the the basis functions and ﬁlters learned by ICA or sparse coding, these functions individually more closely resemble simple cell receptive ﬁelds and collectively span a broad range of spatial scales. Our work uniﬁes several related approaches and observations about natural image structure and suggests that hierarchical models might yield better representations of image structure throughout the hierarchy.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.99276739 <a title="163-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Recovery_of_Jointly_Sparse_Signals_from_Few_Random_Projections.html">163 nips-2005-Recovery of Jointly Sparse Signals from Few Random Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael B. Wakin, Marco F. Duarte, Shriram Sarvotham, Dror Baron, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Compressed sensing is an emerging ﬁeld based on the revelation that a small group of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressed sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. We study three simple models for jointly sparse signals, propose algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections, and characterize theoretically and empirically the number of measurements per sensor required for accurate reconstruction. In some sense DCS is a framework for distributed compression of sources with memory, which has remained a challenging problem in information theory for some time. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor networks and arrays. 1</p><p>4 0.98850131 <a title="163-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Saliency_Based_on_Information_Maximization.html">169 nips-2005-Saliency Based on Information Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil Bruce, John Tsotsos</p><p>Abstract: A model of bottom-up overt attention is proposed based on the principle of maximizing information sampled from a scene. The proposed operation is based on Shannon's self-information measure and is achieved in a neural circuit, which is demonstrated as having close ties with the circuitry existent in the primate visual cortex. It is further shown that the proposed saliency measure may be extended to address issues that currently elude explanation in the domain of saliency based models. Resu lts on natural images are compared with experimental eye tracking data revealing the efficacy of the model in predicting the deployment of overt attention as compared with existing efforts.</p><p>5 0.96733791 <a title="163-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Maximum_Margin_Semi-Supervised_Learning_for_Structured_Variables.html">123 nips-2005-Maximum Margin Semi-Supervised Learning for Structured Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Y. Altun, D. McAllester, M. Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world classiﬁcation problems involve the prediction of multiple inter-dependent variables forming some structural dependency. Recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on supervised classiﬁcation of such structured variables. In this paper, we investigate structured classiﬁcation in a semi-supervised setting. We present a discriminative approach that utilizes the intrinsic geometry of input patterns revealed by unlabeled data points and we derive a maximum-margin formulation of semi-supervised learning for structured variables. Unlike transductive algorithms, our formulation naturally extends to new test points. 1</p><p>6 0.90918189 <a title="163-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Products_of_%60%60Edge-perts.html">158 nips-2005-Products of ``Edge-perts</a></p>

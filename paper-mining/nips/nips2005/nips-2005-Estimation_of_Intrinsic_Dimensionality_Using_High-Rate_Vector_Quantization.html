It builds upon previously proposed Gaussian mixture models with regularized covariance matrices to take into account the local shape of the manifold.

<p>Author: Jorge Silva, Jorge Marques, João Lemos</p><p>Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in learning non-linear manifold models to approximate high-dimensional data. Both for computational complexity reasons and for generalization capability, sparsity is a desired feature in such models. This usually means dimensionality reduction, which naturally implies estimating the intrinsic dimension, but it can also mean selecting a subset of the data to use as landmarks, which is especially important because many existing algorithms have quadratic complexity in the number of observations. This paper presents an algorithm for selecting landmarks, based on LASSO regression, which is well known to favor sparse approximations because it uses regularization with an l1 norm. As an added beneﬁt, a continuous manifold parameterization, based on the landmarks, is also found. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.093476772 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Neuronal_Fiber_Delineation_in_Area_of_Edema_from_Diffusion_Weighted_MRI.html">135 nips-2005-Neuronal Fiber Delineation in Area of Edema from Diffusion Weighted MRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Pasternak, Nathan Intrator, Nir Sochen, Yaniv Assaf</p><p>Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI) is a non invasive method for brain neuronal ﬁbers delineation. Here we show a modiﬁcation for DT-MRI that allows delineation of neuronal ﬁbers which are inﬁltrated by edema. We use the Muliple Tensor Variational (MTV) framework which replaces the diffusion model of DT-MRI with a multiple component model and ﬁts it to the signal attenuation with a variational regularization mechanism. In order to reduce free water contamination we estimate the free water compartment volume fraction in each voxel, remove it, and then calculate the anisotropy of the remaining compartment. The variational framework was applied on data collected with conventional clinical parameters, containing only six diffusion directions. By using the variational framework we were able to overcome the highly ill posed ﬁtting. The results show that we were able to ﬁnd ﬁbers that were not found by DT-MRI.</p><p>6 0.085491575 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Inferring_Motor_Programs_from_Images_of_Handwritten_Digits.html">97 nips-2005-Inferring Motor Programs from Images of Handwritten Digits</a></p>

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Masashi Sugiyama, Motoaki Kawanabe, Vladimir Spokoiny, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new linear method for dimension reduction to identify nonGaussian components in high dimensional data. Our method, NGCA (non-Gaussian component analysis), uses a very general semi-parametric framework. In contrast to existing projection methods we deﬁne what is uninteresting (Gaussian): by projecting out uninterestingness, we can estimate the relevant non-Gaussian subspace. We show that the estimation error of ﬁnding the non-Gaussian components tends to zero at a parametric rate. Once NGCA components are identiﬁed and extracted, various tasks can be applied in the data analysis process, like data visualization, clustering, denoising or classiﬁcation. A numerical study demonstrates the usefulness of our method. 1</p><p>5 0.51117897 <a title="66-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Selecting_Landmark_Points_for_Sparse_Manifold_Learning.html">172 nips-2005-Selecting Landmark Points for Sparse Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert A. Legenstein, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We investigate under what conditions a neuron can learn by experimentally supported rules for spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to predict the arrival times of strong “teacher inputs” to the same neuron. It turns out that in contrast to the famous Perceptron Convergence Theorem, which predicts convergence of the perceptron learning rule for a simpliﬁed neuron model whenever a stable solution exists, no equally strong convergence guarantee can be given for spiking neurons with STDP. But we derive a criterion on the statistical dependency structure of input spike trains which characterizes exactly when learning with STDP will converge on average for a simple model of a spiking neuron. This criterion is reminiscent of the linear separability criterion of the Perceptron Convergence Theorem, but it applies here to the rows of a correlation matrix related to the spike inputs. In addition we show through computer simulations for more realistic neuron models that the resulting analytically predicted positive learning results not only hold for the common interpretation of STDP where STDP changes the weights of synapses, but also for a more realistic interpretation suggested by experimental data where STDP modulates the initial release probability of dynamic synapses. 1</p><p>2 0.79008263 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Describing_Visual_Scenes_using_Transformed_Dirichlet_Processes.html">55 nips-2005-Describing Visual Scenes using Transformed Dirichlet Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba, Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the problem of learning to detect and recognize objects with minimal supervision, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic model for the spatial structure of visual scenes. In contrast with most existing models, our approach explicitly captures uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a given image. Our scene model is based on the transformed Dirichlet process (TDP), a novel extension of the hierarchical DP in which a set of stochastically transformed mixture components are shared between multiple groups of data. For visual scenes, mixture components describe the spatial structure of visual features in an object–centered coordinate frame, while transformations model the object positions in a particular image. Learning and inference in the TDP, which has many potential applications beyond computer vision, is based on an empirically effective Gibbs sampler. Applied to a dataset of partially labeled street scenes, we show that the TDP’s inclusion of spatial structure improves detection performance, ﬂexibly exploiting partially labeled training images. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78406513 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Dimensionality_Using_High-Rate_Vector_Quantization.html">66 nips-2005-Estimation of Intrinsic Dimensionality Using High-Rate Vector Quantization</a></p>

<p>Author: Gergő Orbán, Jozsef Fiser, Richard N. Aslin, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Humans make optimal perceptual decisions in noisy and ambiguous conditions. Computations underlying such optimal behavior have been shown to rely on probabilistic inference according to generative models whose structure is usually taken to be known a priori. We argue that Bayesian model selection is ideal for inferring similar and even more complex model structures from experience. We ﬁnd in experiments that humans learn subtle statistical properties of visual scenes in a completely unsupervised manner. We show that these ﬁndings are well captured by Bayesian model learning within a class of models that seek to explain observed variables by independent hidden causes. 1</p><p>5 0.67850494 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Query_by_Committee_Made_Real.html">160 nips-2005-Query by Committee Made Real</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Training a learning algorithm is a costly task. A major goal of active learning is to reduce this cost. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, KQBC, which is capable of actively learning large scale problems by using selective sampling. The algorithm overcomes the costly sampling step of the well known Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm by projecting onto a low dimensional space. KQBC also enables the use of kernels, providing a simple way of extending QBC to the non-linear scenario. Sampling the low dimension space is done using the hit and run random walk. We demonstrate the success of this novel algorithm by applying it to both artiﬁcial and a real world problems.</p><p>6 0.6778183 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-The_Curse_of_Highly_Variable_Functions_for_Local_Kernel_Machines.html">190 nips-2005-The Curse of Highly Variable Functions for Local Kernel Machines</a></p>

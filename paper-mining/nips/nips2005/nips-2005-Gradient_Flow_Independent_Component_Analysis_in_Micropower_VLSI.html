<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing a set of microphones together with a set of external acoustic events (e.g., hand claps), emitted at unknown times and unknown locations. We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events. The approach is useful for the calibration of ad-hoc microphone arrays and sensor networks. 1</p><p>3 0.17778234 <a title="88-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-An_Analog_Visual_Pre-Processing_Processor_Employing_Cyclic_Line_Access_in_Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects_Architecture.html">22 nips-2005-An Analog Visual Pre-Processing Processor Employing Cyclic Line Access in Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects Architecture</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre V. Schaik, Richard Reeve, Craig Jin, Tara Hamilton</p><p>Abstract: Female crickets can locate males by phonotaxis to the mating song they produce. The behaviour and underlying physiology has been studied in some depth showing that the cricket auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. We present an analogue very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of this process and show that results from testing the circuit agree with simulation and what is known from the behaviour and physiology of the cricket auditory system. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway. 1 In trod u ction Understanding how insects carry out complex sensorimotor tasks can help in the design of simple sensory and robotic systems. Often insect sensors have evolved into intricate filters matched to extract highly specific data from the environment which solves a particular problem directly with little or no need for further processing [1]. Examples include head stabilisation in the fly, which uses vision amongst other senses to estimate self-rotation and thus to stabilise its head in flight, and phonotaxis in the cricket. Because of the narrowness of the cricket body (only a few millimetres), the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) for sounds arriving at the two sides of the head is very small (10–20µs). Even with the tympanal membranes (eardrums) located, as they are, on the forelegs of the cricket, the ITD only reaches about 40µs, which is too low to detect directly from timings of neural spikes. Because the wavelength of the cricket calling song is significantly greater than the width of the cricket body the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) is also very low. In the absence of ITD or IID information, the cricket uses phase to determine direction. This is possible because the male cricket produces an almost pure tone for its calling song. * School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. + Figure 1: The cricket auditory system. Four acoustic inputs channel sounds directly or through tracheal tubes onto two tympanal membranes. Sound from contralateral inputs has to pass a (double) central membrane (the medial septum), inducing a phase delay and reduction in gain. The sound transmission from the contralateral tympanum is very weak, making each eardrum effectively a 3 input system. The physics of the cricket auditory system is well understood [2]; the system (see Figure 1) uses a pair of sound receivers with four acoustic inputs, two on the forelegs, which are the external surfaces of the tympana, and two on the body, the prothoracic or acoustic spiracles [3]. The connecting tracheal tubes are such that interference occurs as sounds travel inside the cricket, producing a directional response at the tympana to frequencies near to that of the calling song. The amplitude of vibration of the tympana, and hence the firing rate of the auditory afferent neurons attached to them, vary as a sound source is moved around the cricket and the sounds from the different inputs move in and out of phase. The outputs of the two tympana match when the sound is straight ahead, and the inputs are bilaterally symmetric with respect to the sound source. However, when sound at the calling song frequency is off-centre the phase of signals on the closer side comes better into alignment, and the signal increases on that side, and conversely decreases on the other. It is that crossover of tympanal vibration amplitudes which allows the cricket to track a sound source (see Figure 6 for example). A simplified version of the auditory system using only two acoustic inputs was implemented in hardware [4], and a simple 8-neuron network was all that was required to then direct a robot to carry out phonotaxis towards a species-specific calling song [5]. A simple simulator was also created to model the behaviour of the auditory system of Figure 1 at different frequencies [6]. Data from Michelsen et al. [2] (Figures 5 and 6) were digitised, and used together with average and “typical” values from the paper to choose gains and delays for the simulation. Figure 2 shows the model of the internal auditory system of the cricket from sound arriving at the acoustic inputs through to transmission down auditory receptor fibres. The simulator implements this model up to the summing of the delayed inputs, as well as modelling the external sound transmission. Results from the simulator were used to check the directionality of the system at different frequencies, and to gain a better understanding of its response. It was impractical to check the effect of leg movements or of complex sounds in the simulator due to the necessity of simulating the sound production and transmission. An aVLSI chip was designed to implement the same model, both allowing more complex experiments, such as leg movements to be run, and experiments to be run in the real world. Figure 2: A model of the auditory system of the cricket, used to build the simulator and the aVLSI implementation (shown in boxes). These experiments with the simulator and the circuits are being published in [6] and the reader is referred to those papers for more details. In the present paper we present the details of the circuits used for the aVLSI implementation. 2 Circuits The chip, implementing the aVLSI box in Figure 2, comprises two all-pass delay filters, three gain circuits, a second-order narrow-band band-pass filter, a first-order wide-band band-pass filter, a first-order high-pass filter, as well as supporting circuitry (including reference voltages, currents, etc.). A single aVLSI chip (MOSIS tiny-chip) thus includes half the necessary circuitry to model the complete auditory system of a cricket. The complete model of the auditory system can be obtained by using two appropriately connected chips. Only two all-pass delay filters need to be implemented instead of three as suggested by Figure 2, because it is only the relative delay between the three pathways arriving at the one summing node that counts. The delay circuits were implemented with fully-differential gm-C filters. In order to extend the frequency range of the delay, a first-order all-pass delay circuit was cascaded with a second-order all-pass delay circuit. The resulting addition of the first-order delay and the second-order delay allowed for an approximately flat delay response for a wider bandwidth as the decreased delay around the corner frequency of the first-order filter cancelled with the increased delay of the second-order filter around its resonant frequency. Figure 3 shows the first- and second-order sections of the all-pass delay circuit. Two of these circuits were used and, based on data presented in [2], were designed with delays of 28µs and 62µs, by way of bias current manipulation. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in figure 3 is a standard OTA which includes the common-mode feedback necessary for fully differential designs. The buffers (Figure 3) are simple, cascoded differential pairs. V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ Figure 3: The first-order all-pass delay circuit (left) and the second-order all-pass delay (right). The differential output of the delay circuits is converted into a current which is multiplied by a variable gain implemented as shown in Figure 4. The gain cell includes a differential pair with source degeneration via transistors N4 and N5. The source degeneration improves the linearity of the current. The three gain cells implemented on the aVLSI have default gains of 2, 3 and 0.91 which are set by holding the default input high and appropriately ratioing the bias currents through the value of vbiasp. To correct any on-chip mismatches and/or explore other gain configurations a current splitter cell [7] (p-splitter, figure 4) allows the gain to be programmed by digital means post fabrication. The current splitter takes an input current (Ibias, figure 4) and divides it into branches which recursively halve the current, i.e., the first branch gives ½ Ibias, the second branch ¼ Ibias, the third branch 1/8 Ibias and so on. These currents can be used together with digitally controlled switches as a Digital-to-Analogue converter. By holding default low and setting C5:C0 appropriately, any gain – from 4 to 0.125 – can be set. To save on output pins the program bits (C5:C0) for each of the three gain cells are set via a single 18-bit shift register in bit-serial fashion. Summing the output of the three gain circuits in the current domain simply involves connecting three wires together. Therefore, a natural option for the filters that follow is to use current domain filters. In our case we have chosen to implement log-domain filters using MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Figure 5 shows the basic building blocks for the filters – the Tau Cell [8] and the multiplier cell – and block diagrams showing how these blocks were connected to create the necessary filtering blocks. The Tau Cell is a log-domain filter which has the firstorder response: I out 1 , = I in sτ + 1 where τ = nC aVT Ia and n = the slope factor, VT = thermal voltage, Ca = capacitance, and Ia = bias current. In figure 5, the input currents to the Tau Cell, Imult and A*Ia, are only used when building a second-order filter. The multiplier cell is simply a translinear loop where: I out1 ∗ I mult = I out 2 ∗ AI a or Imult = AIaIout2/Iout1. The configurations of the Tau Cell to get particular responses are covered in [8] along with the corresponding equations. The high frequency filter of Figure 2 is implemented by the high-pass filter in Figure 5 with a corner frequency of 17kHz. The low frequency filter, however, is divided into two parts since the biological filter’s response (see for example Figure 3A in [9]) separates well into a narrow second-order band-pass filter with a 10kHz resonant frequency and a wide band-pass filter made from a first-order high-pass filter with a 3kHz corner frequency followed by a first-order low-pass filter with a 12kHz corner frequency. These filters are then added together to reproduce the biological filter. The filters’ responses can be adjusted post fabrication via their bias currents. This allows for compensation due to processing and matching errors. Figure 4: The Gain Cell above is used to convert the differential voltage input from the delay cells into a single-ended current output. The gain of each cell is controllable via a programmable current cell (p_splitter). An on-chip bias generator [7] was used to create all the necessary current biases on the chip. All the main blocks (delays, gain cells and filters), however, can have their on-chip bias currents overridden through external pins on the chip. The chip was fabricated using the MOSIS AMI 1.6µm technology and designed using the Cadence Custom IC Design Tools (5.0.33). 3 Methods The chip was tested using sound generated on a computer and played through a soundcard to the chip. Responses from the chip were recorded by an oscilloscope, and uploaded back to the computer on completion. Given that the output from the chip and the gain circuits is a current, an external current-sense circuit built with discrete components was used to enable the output to be probed by the oscilloscope. Figure 5: The circuit diagrams for the log-domain filter building blocks – The Tau Cell and The Multiplier – along with the block diagrams for the three filters used in the aVLSI model. Initial experiments were performed to tune the delays and gains. After that, recordings were taken of the directional frequency responses. Sounds were generated by computer for each chip input to simulate moving the forelegs by delaying the sound by the appropriate amount of time; this was a much simpler solution than using microphones and moving them using motors. 4 Results The aVLSI chip was tested to measure its gains and delays, which were successfully tuned to the appropriate values. The chip was then compared with the simulation to check that it was faithfully modelling the system. A result of this test at 4kHz (approximately the cricket calling-song frequency) is shown in Figure 6. Apart from a drop in amplitude of the signal, the response of the circuit was very similar to that of the simulator. The differences were expected because the aVLSI circuit has to deal with real-world noise, whereas the simulated version has perfect signals. Examples of the gain versus frequency response of the two log-domain band-pass filters are shown in Figure 7. Note that the narrow-band filter peaks at 6kHz, which is significantly above the mating song frequency of the cricket which is around 4.5kHz. This is not a mistake, but is observed in real crickets as well. As stated in the introduction, a range of further testing results with both the circuit and the simulator are being published in [6]. 5 D i s c u s s i on The aVLSI auditory sensor in this research models the hearing of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. It is a more faithful model of the cricket auditory system than was previously built in [4], reproducing all the acoustic inputs, as well as the responses to frequencies of both the co specific calling song and bat echolocation chirps. It also generates outputs corresponding to the two sets of behaviourally relevant auditory receptor fibres. Results showed that it matched the biological data well, though there were some inconsistencies due to an error in the specification that will be addressed in a future iteration of the design. A more complete implementation across all frequencies was impractical because of complexity and size issues as well as serving no clear behavioural purpose. Figure 6: Vibration amplitude of the left (dotted) and right (solid) virtual tympana measured in decibels in response to a 4kHz tone in simulation (left) and on the aVLSI chip (right). The plot shows the amplitude of the tympanal responses as the sound source is rotated around the cricket. Figure 7: Frequency-Gain curves for the narrow-band and wide-band bandpass filters. The long-term aim of this work is to better understand simple sensorimotor control loops in crickets and other insects. The next step is to mount this circuitry on a robot to carry out behavioural experiments, which we will compare with existing and new behavioural data (such as that in [10]). This will allow us to refine our models of the neural circuitry involved. Modelling the sensory afferent neurons in hardware is necessary in order to reduce processor load on our robot, so the next revision will include these either onboard, or on a companion chip as we have done before [11]. We will also move both sides of the auditory system onto a single chip to conserve space on the robot. It is our belief and experience that, as a result of this intelligent pre-processing carried out at the sensor level, the neural circuits necessary to accurately model the behaviour will remain simple.

<p>Author: Guido Nolte, Andreas Ziehe, Frank Meinecke, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When trying to understand the brain, it is of fundamental importance to analyse (e.g. from EEG/MEG measurements) what parts of the cortex interact with each other in order to infer more accurate models of brain activity. Common techniques like Blind Source Separation (BSS) can estimate brain sources and single out artifacts by using the underlying assumption of source signal independence. However, physiologically interesting brain sources typically interact, so BSS will—by construction— fail to characterize them properly. Noting that there are truly interacting sources and signals that only seemingly interact due to effects of volume conduction, this work aims to contribute by distinguishing these effects. For this a new BSS technique is proposed that uses anti-symmetrized cross-correlation matrices and subsequent diagonalization. The resulting decomposition consists of the truly interacting brain sources and suppresses any spurious interaction stemming from volume conduction. Our new concept of interacting source analysis (ISA) is successfully demonstrated on MEG data. 1</p><p>6 0.15607598 <a title="88-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-AER_Building_Blocks_for_Multi-Layer_Multi-Chip_Neuromorphic_Vision_Systems.html">1 nips-2005-AER Building Blocks for Multi-Layer Multi-Chip Neuromorphic Vision Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre V. Schaik, Richard Reeve, Craig Jin, Tara Hamilton</p><p>Abstract: Female crickets can locate males by phonotaxis to the mating song they produce. The behaviour and underlying physiology has been studied in some depth showing that the cricket auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. We present an analogue very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of this process and show that results from testing the circuit agree with simulation and what is known from the behaviour and physiology of the cricket auditory system. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway. 1 In trod u ction Understanding how insects carry out complex sensorimotor tasks can help in the design of simple sensory and robotic systems. Often insect sensors have evolved into intricate filters matched to extract highly specific data from the environment which solves a particular problem directly with little or no need for further processing [1]. Examples include head stabilisation in the fly, which uses vision amongst other senses to estimate self-rotation and thus to stabilise its head in flight, and phonotaxis in the cricket. Because of the narrowness of the cricket body (only a few millimetres), the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) for sounds arriving at the two sides of the head is very small (10–20µs). Even with the tympanal membranes (eardrums) located, as they are, on the forelegs of the cricket, the ITD only reaches about 40µs, which is too low to detect directly from timings of neural spikes. Because the wavelength of the cricket calling song is significantly greater than the width of the cricket body the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) is also very low. In the absence of ITD or IID information, the cricket uses phase to determine direction. This is possible because the male cricket produces an almost pure tone for its calling song. * School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. + Figure 1: The cricket auditory system. Four acoustic inputs channel sounds directly or through tracheal tubes onto two tympanal membranes. Sound from contralateral inputs has to pass a (double) central membrane (the medial septum), inducing a phase delay and reduction in gain. The sound transmission from the contralateral tympanum is very weak, making each eardrum effectively a 3 input system. The physics of the cricket auditory system is well understood [2]; the system (see Figure 1) uses a pair of sound receivers with four acoustic inputs, two on the forelegs, which are the external surfaces of the tympana, and two on the body, the prothoracic or acoustic spiracles [3]. The connecting tracheal tubes are such that interference occurs as sounds travel inside the cricket, producing a directional response at the tympana to frequencies near to that of the calling song. The amplitude of vibration of the tympana, and hence the firing rate of the auditory afferent neurons attached to them, vary as a sound source is moved around the cricket and the sounds from the different inputs move in and out of phase. The outputs of the two tympana match when the sound is straight ahead, and the inputs are bilaterally symmetric with respect to the sound source. However, when sound at the calling song frequency is off-centre the phase of signals on the closer side comes better into alignment, and the signal increases on that side, and conversely decreases on the other. It is that crossover of tympanal vibration amplitudes which allows the cricket to track a sound source (see Figure 6 for example). A simplified version of the auditory system using only two acoustic inputs was implemented in hardware [4], and a simple 8-neuron network was all that was required to then direct a robot to carry out phonotaxis towards a species-specific calling song [5]. A simple simulator was also created to model the behaviour of the auditory system of Figure 1 at different frequencies [6]. Data from Michelsen et al. [2] (Figures 5 and 6) were digitised, and used together with average and “typical” values from the paper to choose gains and delays for the simulation. Figure 2 shows the model of the internal auditory system of the cricket from sound arriving at the acoustic inputs through to transmission down auditory receptor fibres. The simulator implements this model up to the summing of the delayed inputs, as well as modelling the external sound transmission. Results from the simulator were used to check the directionality of the system at different frequencies, and to gain a better understanding of its response. It was impractical to check the effect of leg movements or of complex sounds in the simulator due to the necessity of simulating the sound production and transmission. An aVLSI chip was designed to implement the same model, both allowing more complex experiments, such as leg movements to be run, and experiments to be run in the real world. Figure 2: A model of the auditory system of the cricket, used to build the simulator and the aVLSI implementation (shown in boxes). These experiments with the simulator and the circuits are being published in [6] and the reader is referred to those papers for more details. In the present paper we present the details of the circuits used for the aVLSI implementation. 2 Circuits The chip, implementing the aVLSI box in Figure 2, comprises two all-pass delay filters, three gain circuits, a second-order narrow-band band-pass filter, a first-order wide-band band-pass filter, a first-order high-pass filter, as well as supporting circuitry (including reference voltages, currents, etc.). A single aVLSI chip (MOSIS tiny-chip) thus includes half the necessary circuitry to model the complete auditory system of a cricket. The complete model of the auditory system can be obtained by using two appropriately connected chips. Only two all-pass delay filters need to be implemented instead of three as suggested by Figure 2, because it is only the relative delay between the three pathways arriving at the one summing node that counts. The delay circuits were implemented with fully-differential gm-C filters. In order to extend the frequency range of the delay, a first-order all-pass delay circuit was cascaded with a second-order all-pass delay circuit. The resulting addition of the first-order delay and the second-order delay allowed for an approximately flat delay response for a wider bandwidth as the decreased delay around the corner frequency of the first-order filter cancelled with the increased delay of the second-order filter around its resonant frequency. Figure 3 shows the first- and second-order sections of the all-pass delay circuit. Two of these circuits were used and, based on data presented in [2], were designed with delays of 28µs and 62µs, by way of bias current manipulation. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in figure 3 is a standard OTA which includes the common-mode feedback necessary for fully differential designs. The buffers (Figure 3) are simple, cascoded differential pairs. V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ Figure 3: The first-order all-pass delay circuit (left) and the second-order all-pass delay (right). The differential output of the delay circuits is converted into a current which is multiplied by a variable gain implemented as shown in Figure 4. The gain cell includes a differential pair with source degeneration via transistors N4 and N5. The source degeneration improves the linearity of the current. The three gain cells implemented on the aVLSI have default gains of 2, 3 and 0.91 which are set by holding the default input high and appropriately ratioing the bias currents through the value of vbiasp. To correct any on-chip mismatches and/or explore other gain configurations a current splitter cell [7] (p-splitter, figure 4) allows the gain to be programmed by digital means post fabrication. The current splitter takes an input current (Ibias, figure 4) and divides it into branches which recursively halve the current, i.e., the first branch gives ½ Ibias, the second branch ¼ Ibias, the third branch 1/8 Ibias and so on. These currents can be used together with digitally controlled switches as a Digital-to-Analogue converter. By holding default low and setting C5:C0 appropriately, any gain – from 4 to 0.125 – can be set. To save on output pins the program bits (C5:C0) for each of the three gain cells are set via a single 18-bit shift register in bit-serial fashion. Summing the output of the three gain circuits in the current domain simply involves connecting three wires together. Therefore, a natural option for the filters that follow is to use current domain filters. In our case we have chosen to implement log-domain filters using MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Figure 5 shows the basic building blocks for the filters – the Tau Cell [8] and the multiplier cell – and block diagrams showing how these blocks were connected to create the necessary filtering blocks. The Tau Cell is a log-domain filter which has the firstorder response: I out 1 , = I in sτ + 1 where τ = nC aVT Ia and n = the slope factor, VT = thermal voltage, Ca = capacitance, and Ia = bias current. In figure 5, the input currents to the Tau Cell, Imult and A*Ia, are only used when building a second-order filter. The multiplier cell is simply a translinear loop where: I out1 ∗ I mult = I out 2 ∗ AI a or Imult = AIaIout2/Iout1. The configurations of the Tau Cell to get particular responses are covered in [8] along with the corresponding equations. The high frequency filter of Figure 2 is implemented by the high-pass filter in Figure 5 with a corner frequency of 17kHz. The low frequency filter, however, is divided into two parts since the biological filter’s response (see for example Figure 3A in [9]) separates well into a narrow second-order band-pass filter with a 10kHz resonant frequency and a wide band-pass filter made from a first-order high-pass filter with a 3kHz corner frequency followed by a first-order low-pass filter with a 12kHz corner frequency. These filters are then added together to reproduce the biological filter. The filters’ responses can be adjusted post fabrication via their bias currents. This allows for compensation due to processing and matching errors. Figure 4: The Gain Cell above is used to convert the differential voltage input from the delay cells into a single-ended current output. The gain of each cell is controllable via a programmable current cell (p_splitter). An on-chip bias generator [7] was used to create all the necessary current biases on the chip. All the main blocks (delays, gain cells and filters), however, can have their on-chip bias currents overridden through external pins on the chip. The chip was fabricated using the MOSIS AMI 1.6µm technology and designed using the Cadence Custom IC Design Tools (5.0.33). 3 Methods The chip was tested using sound generated on a computer and played through a soundcard to the chip. Responses from the chip were recorded by an oscilloscope, and uploaded back to the computer on completion. Given that the output from the chip and the gain circuits is a current, an external current-sense circuit built with discrete components was used to enable the output to be probed by the oscilloscope. Figure 5: The circuit diagrams for the log-domain filter building blocks – The Tau Cell and The Multiplier – along with the block diagrams for the three filters used in the aVLSI model. Initial experiments were performed to tune the delays and gains. After that, recordings were taken of the directional frequency responses. Sounds were generated by computer for each chip input to simulate moving the forelegs by delaying the sound by the appropriate amount of time; this was a much simpler solution than using microphones and moving them using motors. 4 Results The aVLSI chip was tested to measure its gains and delays, which were successfully tuned to the appropriate values. The chip was then compared with the simulation to check that it was faithfully modelling the system. A result of this test at 4kHz (approximately the cricket calling-song frequency) is shown in Figure 6. Apart from a drop in amplitude of the signal, the response of the circuit was very similar to that of the simulator. The differences were expected because the aVLSI circuit has to deal with real-world noise, whereas the simulated version has perfect signals. Examples of the gain versus frequency response of the two log-domain band-pass filters are shown in Figure 7. Note that the narrow-band filter peaks at 6kHz, which is significantly above the mating song frequency of the cricket which is around 4.5kHz. This is not a mistake, but is observed in real crickets as well. As stated in the introduction, a range of further testing results with both the circuit and the simulator are being published in [6]. 5 D i s c u s s i on The aVLSI auditory sensor in this research models the hearing of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. It is a more faithful model of the cricket auditory system than was previously built in [4], reproducing all the acoustic inputs, as well as the responses to frequencies of both the co specific calling song and bat echolocation chirps. It also generates outputs corresponding to the two sets of behaviourally relevant auditory receptor fibres. Results showed that it matched the biological data well, though there were some inconsistencies due to an error in the specification that will be addressed in a future iteration of the design. A more complete implementation across all frequencies was impractical because of complexity and size issues as well as serving no clear behavioural purpose. Figure 6: Vibration amplitude of the left (dotted) and right (solid) virtual tympana measured in decibels in response to a 4kHz tone in simulation (left) and on the aVLSI chip (right). The plot shows the amplitude of the tympanal responses as the sound source is rotated around the cricket. Figure 7: Frequency-Gain curves for the narrow-band and wide-band bandpass filters. The long-term aim of this work is to better understand simple sensorimotor control loops in crickets and other insects. The next step is to mount this circuitry on a robot to carry out behavioural experiments, which we will compare with existing and new behavioural data (such as that in [10]). This will allow us to refine our models of the neural circuitry involved. Modelling the sensory afferent neurons in hardware is necessary in order to reduce processor load on our robot, so the next revision will include these either onboard, or on a companion chip as we have done before [11]. We will also move both sides of the auditory system onto a single chip to conserve space on the robot. It is our belief and experience that, as a result of this intelligent pre-processing carried out at the sensor level, the neural circuits necessary to accurately model the behaviour will remain simple.

<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing a set of microphones together with a set of external acoustic events (e.g., hand claps), emitted at unknown times and unknown locations. We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events. The approach is useful for the calibration of ad-hoc microphone arrays and sensor networks. 1</p><p>4 0.58017284 <a title="88-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Separation_of_Music_Signals_by_Harmonic_Structure_Modeling.html">174 nips-2005-Separation of Music Signals by Harmonic Structure Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun-gang Zhang, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Separation of music signals is an interesting but difﬁcult problem. It is helpful for many other music researches such as audio content analysis. In this paper, a new music signal separation method is proposed, which is based on harmonic structure modeling. The main idea of harmonic structure modeling is that the harmonic structure of a music signal is stable, so a music signal can be represented by a harmonic structure model. Accordingly, a corresponding separation algorithm is proposed. The main idea is to learn a harmonic structure model for each music signal in the mixture, and then separate signals by using these models to distinguish harmonic structures of different signals. Experimental results show that the algorithm can separate signals and obtain not only a very high Signalto-Noise Ratio (SNR) but also a rather good subjective audio quality. 1</p><p>5 0.56694967 <a title="88-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Stimulus_Evoked_Independent_Factor_Analysis_of_MEG_Data_with_Large_Background_Activity.html">183 nips-2005-Stimulus Evoked Independent Factor Analysis of MEG Data with Large Background Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Seung-jean Kim, Alessandro Magnani, Stephen Boyd</p><p>Abstract: Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be sensitive to the problem data. Robust Fisher LDA can systematically alleviate the sensitivity problem by explicitly incorporating a model of data uncertainty in a classiﬁcation problem and optimizing for the worst-case scenario under this model. The main contribution of this paper is show that with general convex uncertainty models on the problem data, robust Fisher LDA can be carried out using convex optimization. For a certain type of product form uncertainty model, robust Fisher LDA can be carried out at a cost comparable to standard Fisher LDA. The method is demonstrated with some numerical examples. Finally, we show how to extend these results to robust kernel Fisher discriminant analysis, i.e., robust Fisher LDA in a high dimensional feature space. 1</p><p>3 0.68969625 <a title="88-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Benchmarking_Non-Parametric_Statistical_Tests.html">37 nips-2005-Benchmarking Non-Parametric Statistical Tests</a></p>

Existing active learning methods often assume that the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function can be expressed by the model at hand. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulﬁlled. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can be theoretically justiﬁed under slightly weaker condition: the model does not have to be correctly speciﬁed, but slightly misspeciﬁed models are also allowed. However, it turns out that the weakened condition is still restrictive in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose an alternative active learning method which can be theoretically justiﬁed for a wider class of misspeciﬁed models. Thus, the proposed method has a broader range of applications than the existing method. Numerical studies show that the proposed active learning method is robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and is thus reliable. 1 Introduction and Problem Formulation Let us discuss the regression problem of learning a real-valued function Ê from training examples ´Ü Ý µ ´Ü µ · ¯ Ý Ò ´Üµ deﬁned on ½ where ¯ Ò ½ are i.i.d. noise with mean zero and unknown variance ¾. We use the following linear regression model for learning. ´Ü µ ´µ Ô ½ « ³ ´Ü µ where ³ Ü Ô ½ are ﬁxed linearly independent functions and are parameters to be learned. ´ µ « ´«½ «¾ « Ô µ We evaluate the goodness of the learned function Ü by the expected squared test error over test input points and noise (i.e., the generalization error). When the test input points are drawn independently from a distribution with density ÔØ Ü , the generalization error is expressed as ´ µ ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø where ¯ denotes the expectation over the noise ¯ Ò Ô ´Üµ is known1. ½. In the following, we suppose that Ø In a standard setting of regression, the training input points are provided from the environment, i.e., Ü Ò ½ independently follow the distribution with density ÔØ Ü . On the other hand, in some cases, the training input points can be designed by users. In such cases, it is expected that the accuracy of the learning result can be improved if the training input points are chosen appropriately, e.g., by densely locating training input points in the regions of high uncertainty. ´ µ Active learning—also referred to as experimental design—is the problem of optimizing the location of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. In active learning research, it is often assumed that the regression model is correctly speciﬁed [2, 1, 3], i.e., the learning target function Ü can be expressed by the model. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. ´ µ In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can still be theoretically justiﬁed when the model is approximately correct in a strong sense. Then we propose an alternative active learning method which can also be theoretically justiﬁed for approximately correct models, but the condition on the approximate correctness of the models is weaker than that for the existing method. Thus, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. In the following, we suppose that the training input points Ü Ò ½ are independently drawn from a user-deﬁned distribution with density ÔÜ Ü , and discuss the problem of ﬁnding the optimal density function. ´µ 2 Existing Active Learning Method The generalization error deﬁned by Eq.(1) can be decomposed as ·Î is the (squared) bias term and Î is the variance term given by where ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø Î and ¯ ´Üµ   ¯ ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø A standard way to learn the parameters in the regression model (1) is the ordinary leastsquares learning, i.e., parameter vector « is determined as follows. « ÇÄË It is known that «ÇÄË is given by Ö« Ò Ñ « ÇÄË where Ä ÇÄË ´ µ ½ Ò ´Ü µ   Ý ½ Ä ÇÄË ³ ´Ü µ ¾ Ý and Ý ´Ý½ Ý¾ Ý Ò µ Let ÇÄË , ÇÄË and ÎÇÄË be , and Î for the learned function obtained by the ordinary least-squares learning, respectively. Then the following proposition holds. 1 In some application domains such as web page analysis or bioinformatics, a large number of unlabeled samples—input points without output values independently drawn from the distribution with density ÔØ ´Üµ—are easily gathered. In such cases, a reasonably good estimate of ÔØ ´Üµ may be obtained by some standard density estimation method. Therefore, the assumption that ÔØ ´Üµ is known may not be so restrictive. Proposition 1 ([2, 1, 3]) Suppose that the model is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function Ü is expressed as ´µ Ô ´Ü µ Then ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ and ÎÇÄË are expressed as ÇÄË ¼ ÇÄË and Î ¾ ÇÄË Â ÇÄË where ØÖ´ÍÄ Â ÇÄË ÇÄË Ä ÇÄË µ ³ ´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü Í and Ø Therefore, for the correctly speciﬁed model (1), the generalization error as ÇÄË ¾ ÇÄË is expressed Â ÇÄË Based on this expression, the existing active learning method determines the location of training input points Ü Ò ½ (or the training input density ÔÜ Ü ) so that ÂÇÄË is minimized [2, 1, 3]. ´ µ 3 Analysis of Existing Method under Misspeciﬁcation of Models In this section, we investigate the validity of the existing active learning method for misspeciﬁed models. ´ µ Suppose the model does not exactly include the learning target function Ü , but it approximately includes it, i.e., for a scalar Æ such that Æ is small, Ü is expressed as ´ µ ´Ü µ ´Üµ · ÆÖ´Üµ where ´Üµ is the orthogonal projection of ´Üµ onto the span of residual Ö´Üµ is orthogonal to ³ ´Üµ ½ : Ô Ô ´Üµ ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ Ö´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü and In this case, the bias term Ø ¼ for ³ ´Üµ ½¾ Ô and the ½ Ô is expressed as ¾ ´ ´Üµ   ´Üµµ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü is constant which does not depend on the training input density Ô ´Üµ, we subtract ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ô ´Üµ Ü · where Ø Ø Since in the following discussion.

However, for misspeciﬁed models, «ÇÄË is generally biased even asymptotically if Æ ÇÔ . ´½µ The bias of «ÇÄË is actually caused by the covariate shift [5]—the training input density ÔÜ Ü is different from the test input density ÔØ Ü . For correctly speciﬁed models, inﬂuence of the covariate shift can be ignored, as the existing active learning method does. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we should explicitly cope with the covariate shift. ´µ ´ µ Under the covariate shift, it is known that the following weighted least-squares learning is [5]. asymptotically unbiased even if Æ ÇÔ ´½µ Ô ´Ü µ Ô ´Ü µ ½ Ò Ö« Ò Ñ « Ï ÄË ¾ ´Ü µ   Ý Ø Ü Asymptotic unbiasedness of «Ï ÄË would be intuitively understood by the following identity, which is similar in spirit to importance sampling: ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Ü µ Ü ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ø ´µ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ô ´Ü µ Ü Ô ´Üµ Ø Ü Ü In the following, we assume that ÔÜ Ü is strictly positive for all Ü.

Then we have the following lemma.

Therefore, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. The effect of this extension is experimentally investigated in the next section. ´ 5 µ Numerical Examples We evaluate the usefulness of the proposed active learning method through experiments.

Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation and ¯ . Let ÔØ Ü ½ be the Gaussian density with mean and standard deviation , which is assumed to be known here. Let Ô and the basis functions be ³ Ü Ü  ½ for . Let us consider the following three cases. Æ , where each case corresponds to “correctly speciﬁed”, “approximately correct”, and “misspeciﬁed” (see Figure 1). We choose the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the Gaussian density with mean and standard , where deviation ¼¾ ¿ ´µ ¼  ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼ ½¼ ´µ ¼ ¼¿ ½¾¿ ¼¾ ¾ We compare the accuracy of the following three methods: (A) Proposed active learning criterion + WLS learning : The training input density is determined so that ÂÏ ÄË is minimized. Following the determined input density, training input points Ü ½¼¼ are created and corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼ ½ ½ are observed. Then WLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (B) Existing active learning criterion + OLS learning [2, 1, 3]: The training input density is determined so that ÂÇÄË is minimized. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (C) Passive learning + OLS learning: The test input density ÔØ Ü is used as the training input density. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. ´ µ First, we evaluate the accuracy of ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË as approximations of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . The means and standard deviations of Ï ÄË , ÂÏ ÄË , ÇÄË , and ÂÇÄË over runs are (“correctly depicted as functions of  in Figure 2. These graphs show that when Æ speciﬁed”), both ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË give accurate estimates of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . When Æ (“approximately correct”), ÂÏ ÄË again works well, while ÂÇÄË tends to be negatively biased for large . This result is surprising since as illustrated in Figure 1, the learning target functions with Æ and Æ are visually quite similar. Therefore, it intuitively seems that the result of Æ is not much different from that of Æ . However, the simulation result shows that this slight difference makes ÂÇÄË unreliable. (“misspeciﬁed”), ÂÏ ÄË is still reasonably accurate, while ÂÇÄË is heavily When Æ biased. ½¼¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼¼ ¼ These results show that as an approximation of the generalization error, ÂÏ ÄË is more robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models than ÂÇÄË , which is in good agreement with the theoretical analyses given in Section 3 and Section 4.

When Æ , the existing method (B) works better than the proposed method (A). Actually, in this case, training input densities that approximately minimize Ï ÄË and ÇÄË were found by ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË . Therefore, the difference of the errors is caused by the difference of WLS and OLS: WLS generally has larger variance than OLS. Since bias is zero for both WLS and OLS if Æ , OLS would be more accurate than WLS. Although the proposed method (A) is outperformed by the existing method (B), it still works better than the passive learning scheme (C). When Æ and Æ the proposed method (A) gives signiﬁcantly smaller errors than other methods. ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ Overall, we found that for all three cases, the proposed method (A) works reasonably well and outperforms the passive learning scheme (C). On the other hand, the existing method (B) works excellently in the correctly speciﬁed case, although it tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is found to be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable.

Note that the error bars were reasonably small so they were omitted. ½¼¼ Realistic Data Set: Here we use eight practical data sets provided by DELVE [4]: Bank8fm, Bank-8fh, Bank-8nm, Bank-8nh, Kin-8fm, Kin-8fh, Kin-8nm, and Kin-8nh. Each data set includes samples, consisting of -dimensional input and -dimensional output values. For convenience, every attribute is normalized into . ½¾ ¼ ½℄ ½¾ ½ Suppose we are given all input points (i.e., unlabeled samples). Note that output values are unknown. From the pool of unlabeled samples, we choose Ò input points Ü ½¼¼¼ for training and observe the corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼¼. The ½ ½ task is to predict the output values of all unlabeled samples. ½¼¼¼ In this experiment, the test input density independent Gaussian density. Ô ´Üµ and ­ Ø ´¾ ­¾ ÅÄ Ô ´Üµ is unknown. Ø µ  ÜÔ    Ü   ¾ ÅÄ So we estimate it using the ¾ ´¾­¾ µ¡ ÅÄ where Å Ä are the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and standard ÅÄ and the basis functions be deviation obtained from all unlabeled samples. Let Ô where Ø ³ ´Üµ ¼ ½   ÜÔ   Ü   Ø ¾ ¡ ¾ ¼ for ½¾ ¼ are template points randomly chosen from the pool of unlabeled samples. ´µ We select the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the independent Gaussian density with mean Å Ä and standard deviation ­Å Ä , where  ¼ ¼ ¼ ¾ In this simulation, we can not create the training input points in an arbitrary location because we only have samples. Therefore, we ﬁrst create temporary input points following the determined training input density, and then choose the input points from the pool of unlabeled samples that are closest to the temporary input points. For each data set, we repeat this simulation times, by changing the template points Ø ¼ ½ in each run. ½¾ ½¼¼ ½¼¼ The means and standard deviations of the test error over runs are described in Table 2. The proposed method (A) outperforms the existing method (B) for ﬁve data sets, while it is outperformed by (B) for the other three data sets. We conjecture that the model used for learning is almost correct in these three data sets. This result implies that the proposed method (A) is slightly better than the existing method (B). Figure 3 depicts the relative performance of the proposed method (A) and the existing method (B) compared with the passive learning scheme (C). This shows that (A) outperforms (C) for all eight data sets, while (B) is comparable or is outperformed by (C) for ﬁve data sets. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is overall shown to work better than other schemes. 6 Conclusions We argued that active learning is essentially the situation under the covariate shift—the training input density is different from the test input density. When the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, the covariate shift does not matter. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we have to explicitly cope with the covariate shift. In this paper, we proposed a new active learning method based on the weighted least-squares learning. The numerical study showed that the existing method works better than the proposed method if model is correctly speciﬁed. However, the existing method tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. On the other hand, the proposed method overall worked reasonably well and it consistently outperformed the passive learning scheme. Therefore, the proposed method would be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable. The proposed method can be theoretically justiﬁed if the model is approximately correct in a weak sense. However, it is no longer valid for totally misspeciﬁed models. A natural future direction would be therefore to devise an active learning method which has theoretical guarantee with totally misspeciﬁed models. It is also important to notice that when the model is totally misspeciﬁed, even learning with optimal training input points would not be successful anyway. In such cases, it is of course important to carry out model selection. In active learning research—including the present paper, however, the location of training input points are designed for a single model at hand. That is, the model should have been chosen before performing active learning. Devising a method for simultaneously optimizing models and the location of training input points would be a more important and promising future direction.

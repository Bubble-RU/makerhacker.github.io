<p>Author: O. P. Kreidl, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graphical model with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach leads to a novel message-passing algorithm to be executed ofﬂine, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative examples, (ii) assumptions that guarantee convergence and efﬁciency and (iii) connections to active research areas. 1</p><p>3 0.22911519 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Information_Value_for_Graphical_Models.html">70 nips-2005-Fast Information Value for Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Brigham S. Anderson, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Calculations that quantify the dependencies between variables are vital to many operations with graphical models, e.g., active learning and sensitivity analysis. Previously, pairwise information gain calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size. In this work, we show how to perform a similar computation with cost linear in network size. The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming. The message-passing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy. In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.</p><p>4 0.18767729 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Variable_KD-Tree_Algorithms_for_Spatial_Pattern_Search_and_Discovery.html">200 nips-2005-Variable KD-Tree Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Search and Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Kubica, Joseph Masiero, Robert Jedicke, Andrew Connolly, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding sets of points that conform to a given underlying model from within a dense, noisy set of observations. This problem is motivated by the task of efﬁciently linking faint asteroid detections, but is applicable to a range of spatial queries. We survey current tree-based approaches, showing a trade-off exists between single tree and multiple tree algorithms. To this end, we present a new type of multiple tree algorithm that uses a variable number of trees to exploit the advantages of both approaches. We empirically show that this algorithm performs well using both simulated and astronomical data.</p><p>5 0.18716604 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Consensus_Propagation.html">46 nips-2005-Consensus Propagation</a></p>

Consensus propagation can be viewed as a special case of belief propagation, and our results contribute to the belief propagation literature.

<p>Author: Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose correlations between variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlations. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. This perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and of its convergence in loopy graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.73657537 <a title="125-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Consensus_Propagation.html">46 nips-2005-Consensus Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Artur Garcez, Luis C. Lamb, Dov M. Gabbay</p><p>Abstract: We present a new connectionist model for constructive, intuitionistic modal reasoning. We use ensembles of neural networks to represent intuitionistic modal theories, and show that for each intuitionistic modal program there exists a corresponding neural network ensemble that computes the program. This provides a massively parallel model for intuitionistic modal reasoning, and sets the scene for integrated reasoning, knowledge representation, and learning of intuitionistic theories in neural networks, since the networks in the ensemble can be trained by examples using standard neural learning algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.73597807 <a title="125-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_to_Unseen_Cases.html">85 nips-2005-Generalization to Unseen Cases</a></p>
<p>Author: Teemu Roos, Peter Grünwald, Petri Myllymäki, Henry Tirri</p><p>Abstract: We analyze classiﬁcation error on unseen cases, i.e. cases that are different from those in the training set. Unlike standard generalization error, this off-training-set error may differ signiﬁcantly from the empirical error with high probability even with large sample sizes. We derive a datadependent bound on the difference between off-training-set and standard generalization error. Our result is based on a new bound on the missing mass, which for small samples is stronger than existing bounds based on Good-Turing estimators. As we demonstrate on UCI data-sets, our bound gives nontrivial generalization guarantees in many practical cases. In light of these results, we show that certain claims made in the No Free Lunch literature are overly pessimistic. 1</p><p>4 0.68764824 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Mixture_Modeling_by_Affinity_Propagation.html">127 nips-2005-Mixture Modeling by Affinity Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Delbert Dueck</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has been approached in many ways. Two general and quite different approaches include iteratively ﬁtting a mixture model (e.g., using EM) and linking together pairs of training cases that have high afﬁnity (e.g., using spectral methods). Pair-wise clustering algorithms need not compute sufﬁcient statistics and avoid poor solutions by directly placing similar examples in the same cluster. However, many applications require that each cluster of data be accurately described by a prototype or model, so afﬁnity-based clustering – and its beneﬁts – cannot be directly realized. We describe a technique called “afﬁnity propagation”, which combines the advantages of both approaches. The method learns a mixture model of the data by recursively propagating afﬁnity messages. We demonstrate afﬁnity propagation on the problems of clustering image patches for image segmentation and learning mixtures of gene expression models from microarray data. We ﬁnd that afﬁnity propagation obtains better solutions than mixtures of Gaussians, the K-medoids algorithm, spectral clustering and hierarchical clustering, and is both able to ﬁnd a pre-speciﬁed number of clusters and is able to automatically determine the number of clusters. Interestingly, afﬁnity propagation can be viewed as belief propagation in a graphical model that accounts for pairwise training case likelihood functions and the identiﬁcation of cluster centers. 1</p><p>5 0.60811543 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Glenn Fung, Rómer Rosales, Balaji Krishnapuram</p><p>Abstract: We propose efﬁcient algorithms for learning ranking functions from order constraints between sets—i.e. classes—of training samples. Our algorithms may be used for maximizing the generalized Wilcoxon Mann Whitney statistic that accounts for the partial ordering of the classes: special cases include maximizing the area under the ROC curve for binary classiﬁcation and its generalization for ordinal regression. Experiments on public benchmarks indicate that: (a) the proposed algorithm is at least as accurate as the current state-of-the-art; (b) computationally, it is several orders of magnitude faster and—unlike current methods—it is easily able to handle even large datasets with over 20,000 samples. 1</p><p>6 0.5940603 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>

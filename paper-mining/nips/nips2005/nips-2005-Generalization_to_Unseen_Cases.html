<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Olivier Delalleau, Nicolas L. Roux</p><p>Abstract: We present a series of theoretical arguments supporting the claim that a large class of modern learning algorithms that rely solely on the smoothness prior – with similarity between examples expressed with a local kernel – are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, or more precisely to the variability of the target. Our discussion covers supervised, semisupervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very speciﬁc prior domain knowledge. 1</p><p>3 0.099975616 <a title="85-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Beyond_Gaussian_Processes%3A_On_the_Distributions_of_Infinite_Networks.html">38 nips-2005-Beyond Gaussian Processes: On the Distributions of Infinite Networks</a></p>

We show that with i.i.d. symmetric stable output weights, and more generally with weights distributed from the normal domain of attraction of a stable variable, that the neural functions converge in distribution to stable processes. Conditions are also investigated under which Gaussian limits do occur when the weights are independent but not identically distributed. Some particularly tractable classes of stable distributions are examined, and the possibility of learning with such processes.</p><p>4 0.094813786 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Improved_risk_tail_bounds_for_on-line_algorithms.html">95 nips-2005-Improved risk tail bounds for on-line algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: John D. Lafferty, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We present a family of approximation techniques for probabilistic graphical models, based on the use of graphical preconditioners developed in the scientiﬁc computing literature. Our framework yields rigorous upper and lower bounds on event probabilities and the log partition function of undirected graphical models, using non-iterative procedures that have low time complexity. As in mean ﬁeld approaches, the approximations are built upon tractable subgraphs; however, we recast the problem of optimizing the tractable distribution parameters and approximate inference in terms of the well-studied linear systems problem of obtaining a good matrix preconditioner. Experiments are presented that compare the new approximation schemes to variational methods. 1</p><p>6 0.089250803 <a title="85-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Inference_with_Minimal_Communication%3A_a_Decision-Theoretic_Variational_Approach.html">96 nips-2005-Inference with Minimal Communication: a Decision-Theoretic Variational Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Rebecca Willett, Robert Nowak, Rui M. Castro</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous statistical analysis characterizing regimes in which active learning signiﬁcantly outperforms classical passive learning. Active learning algorithms are able to make queries or select sample locations in an online fashion, depending on the results of the previous queries. In some regimes, this extra ﬂexibility leads to signiﬁcantly faster rates of error decay than those possible in classical passive learning settings. The nature of these regimes is explored by studying fundamental performance limits of active and passive learning in two illustrative nonparametric function classes. In addition to examining the theoretical potential of active learning, this paper describes a practical algorithm capable of exploiting the extra ﬂexibility of the active setting and provably improving upon the classical passive techniques. Our active learning theory and methods show promise in a number of applications, including ﬁeld estimation using wireless sensor networks and fault line detection. 1</p><p>4 0.61041224 <a title="85-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Minimum_Volume_Sets.html">112 nips-2005-Learning Minimum Volume Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P -measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P , and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P . Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P , but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency and an oracle inequality. Estimators based on histograms and dyadic partitions illustrate the proposed rules. 1</p><p>5 0.54776692 <a title="85-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Improved_risk_tail_bounds_for_on-line_algorithms.html">95 nips-2005-Improved risk tail bounds for on-line algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Delbert Dueck</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has been approached in many ways. Two general and quite different approaches include iteratively ﬁtting a mixture model (e.g., using EM) and linking together pairs of training cases that have high afﬁnity (e.g., using spectral methods). Pair-wise clustering algorithms need not compute sufﬁcient statistics and avoid poor solutions by directly placing similar examples in the same cluster. However, many applications require that each cluster of data be accurately described by a prototype or model, so afﬁnity-based clustering – and its beneﬁts – cannot be directly realized. We describe a technique called “afﬁnity propagation”, which combines the advantages of both approaches. The method learns a mixture model of the data by recursively propagating afﬁnity messages. We demonstrate afﬁnity propagation on the problems of clustering image patches for image segmentation and learning mixtures of gene expression models from microarray data. We ﬁnd that afﬁnity propagation obtains better solutions than mixtures of Gaussians, the K-medoids algorithm, spectral clustering and hierarchical clustering, and is both able to ﬁnd a pre-speciﬁed number of clusters and is able to automatically determine the number of clusters. Interestingly, afﬁnity propagation can be viewed as belief propagation in a graphical model that accounts for pairwise training case likelihood functions and the identiﬁcation of cluster centers. 1</p><p>5 0.58421654 <a title="85-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Glenn Fung, Rómer Rosales, Balaji Krishnapuram</p><p>Abstract: We propose efﬁcient algorithms for learning ranking functions from order constraints between sets—i.e. classes—of training samples. Our algorithms may be used for maximizing the generalized Wilcoxon Mann Whitney statistic that accounts for the partial ordering of the classes: special cases include maximizing the area under the ROC curve for binary classiﬁcation and its generalization for ordinal regression. Experiments on public benchmarks indicate that: (a) the proposed algorithm is at least as accurate as the current state-of-the-art; (b) computationally, it is several orders of magnitude faster and—unlike current methods—it is easily able to handle even large datasets with over 20,000 samples. 1</p><p>6 0.58390558 <a title="85-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Information_Value_for_Graphical_Models.html">70 nips-2005-Fast Information Value for Graphical Models</a></p>

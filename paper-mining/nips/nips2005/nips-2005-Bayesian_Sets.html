In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, KQBC, which is capable of actively learning large scale problems by using selective sampling. The algorithm overcomes the costly sampling step of the well known Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm by projecting onto a low dimensional space. KQBC also enables the use of kernels, providing a simple way of extending QBC to the non-linear scenario. Sampling the low dimension space is done using the hit and run random walk.

<p>Author: Brigham S. Anderson, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Calculations that quantify the dependencies between variables are vital to many operations with graphical models, e.g., active learning and sensitivity analysis. Previously, pairwise information gain calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size. In this work, we show how to perform a similar computation with cost linear in network size. The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming. The message-passing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy. In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.</p><p>5 0.096504554 <a title="33-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Laplacian_Score_for_Feature_Selection.html">104 nips-2005-Laplacian Score for Feature Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaofei He, Deng Cai, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: In supervised learning scenarios, feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. Selecting features in unsupervised learning scenarios is a much harder problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. And, almost all of previous unsupervised feature selection methods are “wrapper” techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a “ﬁlter” method for feature selection which is independent of any learning algorithm. Our method can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised fashion. The proposed method is based on the observation that, in many real world classiﬁcation problems, data from the same class are often close to each other. The importance of a feature is evaluated by its power of locality preserving, or, Laplacian Score. We compare our method with data variance (unsupervised) and Fisher score (supervised) on two data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.095828757 <a title="33-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees.html">69 nips-2005-Fast Gaussian Process Regression using KD-Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongryeol Lee, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: In previous work we presented an efﬁcient approach to computing kernel summations which arise in many machine learning methods such as kernel density estimation. This approach, dual-tree recursion with ﬁnitedifference approximation, generalized existing methods for similar problems arising in computational physics in two ways appropriate for statistical problems: toward distribution sensitivity and general dimension, partly by avoiding series expansions. While this proved to be the fastest practical method for multivariate kernel density estimation at the optimal bandwidth, it is much less efﬁcient at larger-than-optimal bandwidths. In this work, we explore the extent to which the dual-tree approach can be integrated with multipole-like Hermite expansions in order to achieve reasonable efﬁciency across all bandwidth scales, though only for low dimensionalities. In the process, we derive and demonstrate the ﬁrst truly hierarchical fast Gauss transforms, effectively combining the best tools from discrete algorithms and continuous approximation theory. 1 Fast Gaussian Summation Kernel summations are fundamental in both statistics/learning and computational physics. NR e This paper will focus on the common form G(xq ) = −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 i.e. where the ker- r=1 nel is the Gaussian kernel with scaling parameter, or bandwidth h, there are NR reference points xr , and we desire the sum for NQ different query points xq . Such kernel summations appear in a wide array of statistical/learning methods [5], perhaps most obviously in kernel density estimation [11], the most widely used distribution-free method for the fundamental task of density estimation, which will be our main example. Understanding kernel summation algorithms from a recently developed uniﬁed perspective [5] begins with the picture of Figure 1, then separately considers the discrete and continuous aspects. Discrete/geometric aspect. In terms of discrete algorithmic structure, the dual-tree framework of [5], in the context of kernel summation, generalizes all of the well-known algorithms. 1 It was applied to the problem of kernel density estimation in [7] using a simple 1 These include the Barnes-Hut algorithm [2], the Fast Multipole Method [8], Appel’s algorithm [1], and the WSPD [4]: the dual-tree method is a node-node algorithm (considers query regions rather than points), is fully recursive, can use distribution-sensitive data structures such as kd-trees, and is bichromatic (can specialize for differing query and reference sets). Figure 1: The basic idea is to approximate the kernel sum contribution of some subset of the reference points XR , lying in some compact region of space R with centroid xR , to a query point. In more efﬁcient schemes a query region is considered, i.e. the approximate contribution is made to an entire subset of the query points XQ lying in some region of space Q, with centroid xQ . ﬁnite-difference approximation, which is tantamount to a centroid approximation. Partially by avoiding series expansions, which depend explicitly on the dimension, the result was the fastest such algorithm for general dimension, when operating at the optimal bandwidth. Unfortunately, when performing cross-validation to determine the (initially unknown) optimal bandwidth, both suboptimally small and large bandwidths must be evaluated. The ﬁnite-difference-based dual-tree method tends to be efﬁcient at or below the optimal bandwidth, and at very large bandwidths, but for intermediately-large bandwidths it suffers. Continuous/approximation aspect. This motivates investigating a multipole-like series approximation which is appropriate for the Gaussian kernel, as introduced by [9], which can be shown the generalize the centroid approximation. We deﬁne the Hermite functions 2 hn (t) by hn (t) = e−t Hn (t), where the Hermite polynomials Hn (t) are deﬁned by the 2 2 Rodrigues formula: Hn (t) = (−1)n et Dn e−t , t ∈ R1 . After scaling and shifting the argument t appropriately, then taking the product of univariate functions for each dimension, we obtain the multivariate Hermite expansion NR G(xq ) = e −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 NR = r=1 r=1 α≥0 1 α! xr − xR √ 2h2 α hα xq − xR √ 2h2 (1) where we’ve adopted the usual multi-index notation as in [9]. This can be re-written as NR G(xq ) = e r=1 −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 NR = r=1 α≥0 1 hα α! xr − xQ √ 2h2 xq − xQ √ 2h2 α (2) to express the sum as a Taylor (local) expansion about a nearby representative centroid xQ in the query region. We will be using both types of expansions simultaneously. Since series approximations only hold locally, Greengard and Rokhlin [8] showed that it is useful to think in terms of a set of three ‘translation operators’ for converting between expansions centered at different points, in order to create their celebrated hierarchical algorithm. This was done in the context of the Coulombic kernel, but the Gaussian kernel has importantly different mathematical properties. The original Fast Gauss Transform (FGT) [9] was based on a ﬂat grid, and thus provided only one operator (“H2L” of the next section), with an associated error bound (which was unfortunately incorrect). The Improved Fast Gauss Transform (IFGT) [14] was based on a ﬂat set of clusters and provided no operators with a rearranged series approximation, which intended to be more favorable in higher dimensions but had an incorrect error bound. We will show the derivations of all the translation operators and associated error bounds needed to obtain, for the ﬁrst time, a hierarchical algorithm for the Gaussian kernel. 2 Translation Operators and Error Bounds The ﬁrst operator converts a multipole expansion of a reference node to form a local expansion centered at the centroid of the query node, and is our main approximation workhorse. Lemma 2.1. Hermite-to-local (H2L) translation operator for Gaussian kernel (as presented in Lemma 2.2 in [9, 10]): Given a reference node XR , a query node XQ , and the Hermite expansion centered at a centroid xR of XR : G(xq ) = Aα hα α≥0 xq −xR √ 2h2 , the Taylor expansion of the Hermite expansion at the centroid xQ of the query node XQ is given by G(xq ) = Bβ β≥0 xq −xQ √ 2h2 β where Bβ = (−1)|β| β! Aα hα+β α≥0 xQ −xR √ 2h2 . Proof. (sketch) The proof consists of replacing the Hermite function portion of the expansion with its Taylor series. NR Note that we can rewrite G(xq ) = α≥0 r=1 1 α! xr −xR √ 2h2 α hα xq −xR √ 2h2 by interchanging the summation order, such that the term in the brackets depends only on the reference points, and can thus be computed indepedent of any query location – we will call such terms Hermite moments. The next operator allows the efﬁcient pre-computation of the Hermite moments in the reference tree in a bottom-up fashion from its children. Lemma 2.2. Hermite-to-Hermite (H2H) translation operator for Gaussian kernel: Given the Hermite expansion centered at a centroid xR′ in a reference node XR′ : xq −x G(xq ) = A′ hα √2hR′ , this same Hermite expansion shifted to a new locaα 2 α≥0 tion xR of the parent node of XR is given by G(xq ) = Aγ hγ γ≥0 Aγ = 0≤α≤γ 1 ′ (γ−α)! Aα xR′ −xR √ 2h2 xq −xR √ 2h2 where γ−α . Proof. We simply replace the Hermite function part of the expansion by a new Taylor series, as follows: « x q − x R′ √ 2h2 α≥0 „ « X ′ X 1 „ x R − x R′ « β xq − xR √ √ = Aα (−1)|β| hα+β β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 „ «β « „ X X ′ 1 x R − x R′ xq − xR |β| √ √ (−1) hα+β = Aα β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 „ «β „ « X X ′ 1 x R′ − x R xq − xR √ √ Aα = hα+β β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 3 2 «γ−α „ « „ X X 1 x R′ − x R q ′ 5 hγ x√− xR 4 √ = Aα (γ − α)! 2h2 2h2 γ≥0 0≤α≤γ G(xq ) = where γ = α + β. X A′ hα α „ The next operator acts as a “clean-up” routine in a hierarchical algorithm. Since we can approximate at different scales in the query tree, we must somehow combine all the approximations at the end of the computation. By performing a breadth-ﬁrst traversal of the query tree, the L2L operator shifts a node’s local expansion to the centroid of each child. Lemma 2.3. Local-to-local (L2L) translation operator for Gaussian kernel: Given a Taylor expansion centered at a centroid xQ′ of a query node XQ′ : G(xq ) = xq −xQ′ √ 2h2 Bβ β≥0 β , the Taylor expansion obtained by shift- ing this expansion to the new centroid xQ of the child node XQ is G(xq ) = α≥0 β≥α β! α!(β−α)! Bβ β−α xQ −xQ′ √ 2h2 xq −xQ √ 2h2 α . Proof. Applying the multinomial theorem to to expand about the new center xQ yields: G(xq ) = X Bβ β≥0 = „ XX β≥0 α≤β xq − xQ′ √ 2h2 Bβ «β β! α!(β − α)! „ xQ − xQ′ √ 2h2 «β−α „ xq − xQ √ 2h2 «α . whose summation order can be interchanged to achieve the result. Because the Hermite and the Taylor expansion are truncated after taking pD terms, we incur an error in approximation. The original error bounds for the Gaussian kernel in [9, 10] were wrong and corrections were shown in [3]. Here, we will present all necessary three error bounds incurred in performing translation operators. We note that these error bounds place limits on the size of the query node and the reference node. 2 Lemma 2.4. Error Bound for Truncating an Hermite Expansion (as presented in [3]): Suppose we are given an Hermite expansion of a reference node XR about its centroid xR : G(xq ) = Aα hα α≥0 xq −xR √ 2h2 NR where Aα = r=1 1 α! xr −xR √ 2h2 α . For any query point xq , the error due to truncating the series after the ﬁrst pD term is |ǫM (p)| ≤ rp )k rp √ p! NR (1−r)D D−1 k=0 D k (1 − D−k where ∀xr ∈ XR satisﬁes ||xr − xR ||∞ < rh for r < 1. Proof. (sketch) We expand the Hermite expansion as a product of one-dimensional Hermite functions, and utilize a bound on one-dimensional Hermite functions due to [13]: n −x2 1 2 √ 2 e 2 , n ≥ 0, x ∈ R1 . n! |hn (x)| ≤ n! Lemma 2.5. Error Bound for Truncating a Taylor Expansion Converted from an Hermite Expansion of Inﬁnite Order: Suppose we are given the following Taylor expansion about the centroid xQ of a query node G(xq ) = Bβ β≥0 2 xq −xQ √ 2h2 β where `Strainn[12] proposed the interesting idea of using Stirling’s formula (for any non-negative integer ´ ≤ n!) to lift the node size constraint; one might imagine that this could allow approxin: n+1 e mation of larger regions in a tree-based algorithm. Unfortunately, the error bounds developed in [12] were also incorrect. We have derived the three necessary corrected error bounds based on the techniques in [3]. However, due to space, and because using these bounds actually degraded performance slightly, we do not include those lemmas here. (−1)|β| β!

The experiments indicate that the DFGTH method is able to achieve reasonable performance across all bandwidth scales. Unfortunately none of the series approximation-based methods do well on the 5-dimensional data, as expected, highlighting the main weakness of the approach presented. Pursuing corrections to the error bounds necessary to use the intriguing series form of [14] may allow an increase in dimensionality. References [1] A. W. Appel.

<p>Author: Daniel B. Neill, Andrew W. Moore, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian method for spatial cluster detection, the “Bayesian spatial scan statistic,” and compare this method to the standard (frequentist) scan statistic approach. We demonstrate that the Bayesian statistic has several advantages over the frequentist approach, including increased power to detect clusters and (since randomization testing is unnecessary) much faster runtime. We evaluate the Bayesian and frequentist methods on the task of prospective disease surveillance: detecting spatial clusters of disease cases resulting from emerging disease outbreaks. We demonstrate that our Bayesian methods are successful in rapidly detecting outbreaks while keeping number of false positives low. 1</p><p>6 0.3867799 <a title="33-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Active_Learning_For_Identifying_Function_Threshold_Boundaries.html">18 nips-2005-Active Learning For Identifying Function Threshold Boundaries</a></p>

<p>Author: John V. Arthur, Kwabena Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neuromorphic chip that uses binary synapses with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to learn stimulated patterns of activity and to compensate for variability in excitability. Speciﬁcally, STDP preferentially potentiates (turns on) synapses that project from excitable neurons, which spike early, to lethargic neurons, which spike late. The additional excitatory synaptic current makes lethargic neurons spike earlier, thereby causing neurons that belong to the same pattern to spike in synchrony. Once learned, an entire pattern can be recalled by stimulating a subset. 1 Variability in Neural Systems Evidence suggests precise spike timing is important in neural coding, speciﬁcally, in the hippocampus. The hippocampus uses timing in the spike activity of place cells (in addition to rate) to encode location in space [1]. Place cells employ a phase code: the timing at which a neuron spikes relative to the phase of the inhibitory theta rhythm (5-12Hz) conveys information. As an animal approaches a place cell’s preferred location, the place cell not only increases its spike rate, but also spikes at earlier phases in the theta cycle. To implement a phase code, the theta rhythm is thought to prevent spiking until the input synaptic current exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and the decreasing inhibition on the downward phase of the cycle [2]. However, even with identical inputs and common theta inhibition, neurons do not spike in synchrony. Variability in excitability spreads the activity in phase. Lethargic neurons (such as those with high thresholds) spike late in the theta cycle, since their input exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and theta inhibition only after the theta inhibition has had time to decrease. Conversely, excitable neurons (such as those with low thresholds) spike early in the theta cycle. Consequently, variability in excitability translates into variability in timing. We hypothesize that the hippocampus achieves its precise spike timing (about 10ms) through plasticity enhanced phase-coding (PEP). The source of hippocampal timing precision in the presence of variability (and noise) remains unexplained. Synaptic plasticity can compensate for variability in excitability if it increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons in inverse proportion to their excitabilities. Recasting this in a phase-coding framework, we desire a learning rule that increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons directly related to their phases. Neurons that lag require additional synaptic input, whereas neurons that lead 120µm 190µm A B Figure 1: STDP Chip. A The chip has a 16-by-16 array of microcircuits; one microcircuit includes four principal neurons, each with 21 STDP circuits. B The STDP Chip is embedded in a circuit board including DACs, a CPLD, a RAM chip, and a USB chip, which communicates with a PC. require none. The spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) observed in the hippocampus satisﬁes this requirement [3]. It requires repeated pre-before-post spike pairings (within a time window) to potentiate and repeated post-before-pre pairings to depress a synapse. Here we validate our hypothesis with a model implemented in silicon, where variability is as ubiquitous as it is in biology [4]. Section 2 presents our silicon system, including the STDP Chip. Section 3 describes and characterizes the STDP circuit. Section 4 demonstrates that PEP compensates for variability and provides evidence that STDP is the compensation mechanism. Section 5 explores a desirable consequence of PEP: unconventional associative pattern recall. Section 6 discusses the implications of the PEP model, including its beneﬁts and applications in the engineering of neuromorphic systems and in the study of neurobiology. 2 Silicon System We have designed, submitted, and tested a silicon implementation of PEP. The STDP Chip was fabricated through MOSIS in a 1P5M 0.25µm CMOS process, with just under 750,000 transistors in just over 10mm2 of area. It has a 32 by 32 array of excitatory principal neurons commingled with a 16 by 16 array of inhibitory interneurons that are not used here (Figure 1A). Each principal neuron has 21 STDP synapses. The address-event representation (AER) [5] is used to transmit spikes off chip and to receive afferent and recurrent spike input. To conﬁgure the STDP Chip as a recurrent network, we embedded it in a circuit board (Figure 1B). The board has ﬁve primary components: a CPLD (complex programmable logic device), the STDP Chip, a RAM chip, a USB interface chip, and DACs (digital-to-analog converters). The central component in the system is the CPLD. The CPLD handles AER trafﬁc, mediates communication between devices, and implements recurrent connections by accessing a lookup table, stored in the RAM chip. The USB interface chip provides a bidirectional link with a PC. The DACs control the analog biases in the system, including the leak current, which the PC varies in real-time to create the global inhibitory theta rhythm. The principal neuron consists of a refractory period and calcium-dependent potassium circuit (RCK), a synapse circuit, and a soma circuit (Figure 2A). RCK and the synapse are ISOMA Soma Synapse STDP Presyn. Spike PE LPF A Presyn. Spike Raster AH 0 0.1 Spike probability RCK Postsyn.

The histogram includes spikes from ﬁve theta cycles. composed of two reusable blocks: the low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and the pulse extender (PE). The soma is a modiﬁed version of the LPF, which receives additional input from an axonhillock circuit (AH). RCK is inhibitory to the neuron. It consists of a PE, which models calcium inﬂux during a spike, and a LPF, which models calcium buffering. When AH ﬁres a spike, a packet of charge is dumped onto a capacitor in the PE. The PE’s output activates until the charge decays away, which takes a few milliseconds. Also, while the PE is active, charge accumulates on the LPF’s capacitor, lowering the LPF’s output voltage. Once the PE deactivates, this charge leaks away as well, but this takes tens of milliseconds because the leak is smaller. The PE’s and the LPF’s inhibitory effects on the soma are both described below in terms of the sum (ISHUNT ) of the currents their output voltages produce in pMOS transistors whose sources are at Vdd (see Figure 2A). Note that, in the absence of spikes, these currents decay exponentially, with a time-constant determined by their respective leaks. The synapse circuit is excitatory to the neuron. It is composed of a PE, which represents the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft, and a LPF, which represents the bound neurotransmitter. The synapse circuit is similar to RCK in structure but differs in function: It is activated not by the principal neuron itself but by the STDP circuits (or directly by afferent spikes that bypass these circuits, i.e., ﬁxed synapses). The synapse’s effect on the soma is also described below in terms of the current (ISYN ) its output voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd. The soma circuit is a leaky integrator. It receives excitation from the synapse circuit and shunting inhibition from RCK and has a leak current as well. Its temporal behavior is described by: τ dISOMA ISYN I0 + ISOMA = dt ISHUNT where ISOMA is the current the capacitor’s voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd (see Figure 2A). ISHUNT is the sum of the leak, refractory, and calciumdependent potassium currents. These currents also determine the time constant: τ = C Ut κISHUNT , where I0 and κ are transistor parameters and Ut is the thermal voltage.

A The circuit is composed of three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM. B The circuit potentiates when the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike and depresses when the postsynaptic spike precedes the presynaptic spike. The soma circuit is connected to an AH, the locus of spike generation. The AH consists of model voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channel populations (modiﬁed from [6] by Kai Hynna). It initiates the AER signaling process required to send a spike off chip. To characterize principal neuron variability, we excited 81 neurons with poisson-like 58Hz spike trains (Figure 2B). We made these spike trains poisson-like by starting with a regular 200Hz spike train and dropping spikes randomly, with probability of 0.71. Thus spikes were delivered to neurons that won the coin toss in synchrony every 5ms. However, neurons did not lock onto the input synchrony due to ﬁltering by the synaptic time constant (see Figure 2B). They also received a common inhibitory input at the theta frequency (8.3Hz), via their leak current. Each neuron was prevented from ﬁring more than one spike in a theta cycle by its model calcium-dependent potassium channel population. The principal neurons’ spike times were variable. To quantify the spike variability, we used timing precision, which we deﬁne as twice the standard deviation of spike times accumulated from ﬁve theta cycles. With an input rate of 58Hz the timing precision was 34ms. 3 STDP Circuit The STDP circuit (related to [7]-[8]), for which the STDP Chip is named, is the most abundant, with 21,504 copies on the chip. This circuit is built from three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM (Figure 3A). The decay and integrator are used to implement potentiation, and depression, in a symmetric fashion. The SRAM holds the current binary state of the synapse, either potentiated or depressed. For potentiation, the decay remembers the last presynaptic spike. Its capacitor is charged when that spike occurs and discharges linearly thereafter. A postsynaptic spike samples the charge remaining on the capacitor, passes it through an exponential function, and dumps the resultant charge into the integrator. This charge decays linearly thereafter. At the time of the postsynaptic spike, the SRAM, a cross-coupled inverter pair, reads the voltage on the integrator’s capacitor. If it exceeds a threshold, the SRAM switches state from depressed to potentiated (∼LTD goes high and ∼LTP goes low). The depression side of the STDP circuit is exactly symmetric, except that it responds to postsynaptic activation followed by presynaptic activation and switches the SRAM’s state from potentiated to depressed (∼LTP goes high and ∼LTD goes low). When the SRAM is in the potentiated state, the presynaptic 50 After STDP 83 92 100 Timing precision(ms) Before STDP 75 B Before STDP After STDP 40 30 20 10 0 50 60 70 80 90 Input rate(Hz) 100 50 58 67 text A 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 C Figure 4: Plasticity enhanced phase-coding.

C Each neuron (center box) sends synapses to (dark gray) and receives synapses from (light gray) twenty-one randomly chosen neighbors up to ﬁve nodes away (black indicates both connections). spike activates the principal neuron’s synapse; otherwise the spike has no effect. We characterized the STDP circuit by activating a plastic synapse and a ﬁxed synapse– which elicits a spike at different relative times. We repeated this pairing at 16Hz. We counted the number of pairings required to potentiate (or depress) the synapse. Based on this count, we calculated the efﬁcacy of each pairing as the inverse number of pairings required (Figure 3B). For example, if twenty pairings were required to potentiate the synapse, the efﬁcacy of that pre-before-post time-interval was one twentieth. The efﬁcacy of both potentiation and depression are ﬁt by exponentials with time constants of 11.4ms and 94.9ms, respectively. This behavior is similar to that observed in the hippocampus: potentiation has a shorter time constant and higher maximum efﬁcacy than depression [3]. 4 Recurrent Network We carried out an experiment designed to test the STDP circuit’s ability to compensate for variability in spike timing through PEP. Each neuron received recurrent connections from 21 randomly selected neurons within an 11 by 11 neighborhood centered on itself (see Figure 4C). Conversely, it made recurrent connections to randomly chosen neurons within the same neighborhood. These connections were mediated by STDP circuits, initialized to the depressed state. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons and delivered spikes at a mean rate of 50 to 100Hz to each one (dropping spikes with a probability of 0.75 to 0.5 from a regular 200Hz train) and provided common theta inhibition as before. We compared the variability in spike timing after ﬁve seconds of learning with the initial distribution. Phase coding was enhanced after STDP (Figure 4A). Before STDP, spike timing among neurons was highly variable (except for the very highest input rate). After STDP, variability was virtually eliminated (except for the very lowest input rate). Initially, the variability, characterized by timing precision, was inversely related to the input rate, decreasing from 34 to 13ms. After ﬁve seconds of STDP, variability decreased and was largely independent of input rate, remaining below 11ms. Potentiated synapses 25 A Synaptic state after STDP 20 15 10 5 0 B 50 100 150 200 Spiking order 250 Figure 5: Compensating for variability. A Some synapses (dots) become potentiated (light) while others remain depressed (dark) after STDP. B The number of potentiated synapses neurons make (pluses) and receive (circles) is negatively (r = -0.71) and positively (r = 0.76) correlated to their rank in the spiking order, respectively. Comparing the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received with its excitability conﬁrmed the PEP hypothesis (i.e., leading neurons provide additional synaptic current to lagging neurons via potentiated recurrent synapses). In this experiment, to eliminate variability due to noise (as opposed to excitability), we provided a 17 by 17 cluster of neurons with a regular 200Hz excitatory input. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. After 10 seconds of STDP, a large fraction of the synapses were potentiated (Figure 5A). When the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received was plotted versus its rank in spiking order (Figure 5B), a clear correlation emerged (r = -0.71 or 0.76, respectively). As expected, neurons that spiked early made more and received fewer potentiated synapses. In contrast, neurons that spiked late made fewer and received more potentiated synapses. 5 Pattern Completion After STDP, we found that the network could recall an entire pattern given a subset, thus the same mechanisms that compensated for variability and noise could also compensate for lack of information. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons as our pattern and delivered a poisson-like spike train with mean rate of 67Hz to each one as in the ﬁrst experiment. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. Before STDP, we stimulated a subset of the pattern and only neurons in that subset spiked (Figure 6A). After ﬁve seconds of STDP, we stimulated the same subset again. This time they recruited spikes from other neurons in the pattern, completing it (Figure 6B). Upon varying the fraction of the pattern presented, we found that the fraction recalled increased faster than the fraction presented. We selected subsets of the original pattern randomly, varying the fraction of neurons chosen from 0.1 to 1.0 (ten trials for each). We classiﬁed neurons as active if they spiked in the two second period over which we recorded. Thus, we characterized PEP’s pattern-recall performance as a function of the probability that the pattern in question’s neurons are activated (Figure 6C). At a fraction of 0.50 presented, nearly all of the neurons in the pattern are consistently activated (0.91±0.06), showing robust pattern completion. We ﬁtted the recall performance with a sigmoid that reached 0.50 recall fraction with an input fraction of 0.30. No spurious neurons were activated during any trials.

C The fraction of the pattern activated grows faster than the fraction stimulated. 6 Discussion Our results demonstrate that PEP successfully compensates for graded variations in our silicon recurrent network using binary (on–off) synapses (in contrast with [8], where weights are graded). While our chip results are encouraging, variability was not eliminated in every case. In the case of the lowest input (50Hz), we see virtually no change (Figure 4A). We suspect the timing remains imprecise because, with such low input, neurons do not spike every theta cycle and, consequently, provide fewer opportunities for the STDP synapses to potentiate. This shortfall illustrates the system’s limits; it can only compensate for variability within certain bounds, and only for activity appropriate to the PEP model. As expected, STDP is the mechanism responsible for PEP. STDP potentiated recurrent synapses from leading neurons to lagging neurons, reducing the disparity among the diverse population of neurons. Even though the STDP circuits are themselves variable, with different efﬁcacies and time constants, when using timing the sign of the weight-change is always correct (data not shown). For this reason, we chose STDP over other more physiological implementations of plasticity, such as membrane-voltage-dependent plasticity (MVDP), which has the capability to learn with graded voltage signals [9], such as those found in active dendrites, providing more computational power [10]. Previously, we investigated a MVDP circuit, which modeled a voltage-dependent NMDAreceptor-gated synapse [11]. It potentiated when the calcium current analog exceeded a threshold, which was designed to occur only during a dendritic action potential. This circuit produced behavior similar to STDP, implying it could be used in PEP. However, it was sensitive to variability in the NMDA and potentiation thresholds, causing a fraction of the population to potentiate anytime the synapse received an input and another fraction to never potentiate, rendering both subpopulations useless. Therefore, the simpler, less biophysical STDP circuit won out over the MVDP circuit: In our system timing is everything. Associative storage and recall naturally emerge in the PEP network when synapses between neurons coactivated by a pattern are potentiated. These synapses allow neurons to recruit their peers when a subset of the pattern is presented, thereby completing the pattern. However, this form of pattern storage and completion differs from Hopﬁeld’s attractor model [12] . Rather than forming symmetric, recurrent neuronal circuits, our recurrent network forms asymmetric circuits in which neurons make connections exclusively to less excitable neurons in the pattern. In both the poisson-like and regular cases (Figures 4 & 5), only about six percent of potentiated connections were reciprocated, as expected by chance. We plan to investigate the storage capacity of this asymmetric form of associative memory. Our system lends itself to modeling brain regions that use precise spike timing, such as the hippocampus. We plan to extend the work presented to store and recall sequences of patterns, as the hippocampus is hypothesized to do. Place cells that represent different locations spike at different phases of the theta cycle, in relation to the distance to their preferred locations. This sequential spiking will allow us to link patterns representing different locations in the order those locations are visited, thereby realizing episodic memory. We propose PEP as a candidate neural mechanism for information coding and storage in the hippocampal system. Observations from the CA1 region of the hippocampus suggest that basal dendrites (which primarily receive excitation from recurrent connections) support submillisecond timing precision, consistent with PEP [13]. We have shown, in a silicon model, PEP’s ability to exploit such fast recurrent connections to sharpen timing precision as well as to associatively store and recall patterns.

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by “Google™ Sets”, we consider the problem of retrieving items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a modelbased concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufﬁcient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, ﬁnding completions of author sets from the NIPS dataset, and ﬁnding completions of sets of words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google™ Sets and show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions. 1</p><p>3 0.66089624 <a title="33-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Learning_vehicular_dynamics%2C_with_application_to_modeling_helicopters.html">120 nips-2005-Learning vehicular dynamics, with application to modeling helicopters</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Varun Ganapathi, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling a helicopter’s dynamics based on state-action trajectories collected from it. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we consider the linear models such as learned by CIFER (the industry standard in helicopter identiﬁcation), and show that the linear parameterization makes certain properties of dynamical systems, such as inertia, fundamentally difﬁcult to capture. We propose an alternative, acceleration based, parameterization that does not suffer from this deﬁciency, and that can be learned as efﬁciently from data. Second, a Markov decision process model of a helicopter’s dynamics would explicitly model only the one-step transitions, but we are often interested in a model’s predictive performance over longer timescales. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient algorithm for (approximately) minimizing the prediction error over long time scales. We present empirical results on two different helicopters. Although this work was motivated by the problem of modeling helicopters, the ideas presented here are general, and can be applied to modeling large classes of vehicular dynamics. 1</p><p>4 0.37114343 <a title="33-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Multiple_Instance_Boosting_for_Object_Detection.html">131 nips-2005-Multiple Instance Boosting for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cha Zhang, John C. Platt, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: A good image object detection algorithm is accurate, fast, and does not require exact locations of objects in a training set. We can create such an object detector by taking the architecture of the Viola-Jones detector cascade and training it with a new variant of boosting that we call MILBoost. MILBoost uses cost functions from the Multiple Instance Learning literature combined with the AnyBoost framework. We adapt the feature selection criterion of MILBoost to optimize the performance of the Viola-Jones cascade. Experiments show that the detection rate is up to 1.6 times better using MILBoost. This increased detection rate shows the advantage of simultaneously learning the locations and scales of the objects in the training set along with the parameters of the classiﬁer. 1</p><p>5 0.37015063 <a title="33-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Query_by_Committee_Made_Real.html">160 nips-2005-Query by Committee Made Real</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Training a learning algorithm is a costly task. A major goal of active learning is to reduce this cost. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, KQBC, which is capable of actively learning large scale problems by using selective sampling. The algorithm overcomes the costly sampling step of the well known Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm by projecting onto a low dimensional space. KQBC also enables the use of kernels, providing a simple way of extending QBC to the non-linear scenario. Sampling the low dimension space is done using the hit and run random walk. We demonstrate the success of this novel algorithm by applying it to both artiﬁcial and a real world problems.</p><p>6 0.36809939 <a title="33-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Krylov_Methods_for_N-Body_Learning.html">71 nips-2005-Fast Krylov Methods for N-Body Learning</a></p>

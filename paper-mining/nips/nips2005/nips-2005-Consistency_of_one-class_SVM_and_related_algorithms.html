</p><p>3 Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. [sent-6, score-0.471]
</p><p>4 These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator. [sent-7, score-0.494]
</p><p>5 (2)  This framework encompasses in particular the classical support vector machine (SVM) [1] when φ(u) = max(1 − u, 0). [sent-15, score-0.066]
</p><p>6 Recent years have witnessed important theoretical advances  aimed at understanding the behavior of such regularized algorithms when n tends to inﬁnity and λ decreases to 0. [sent-16, score-0.323]
</p><p>7 In particular the consistency and convergence rates of the two-class SVM (see, e. [sent-17, score-0.391]
</p><p>8 , [2, 3, 4] and references therein) have been studied in detail, as well as the shape of the asymptotic decision function [5, 6]. [sent-19, score-0.062]
</p><p>9 All results published so far study the case where λ decreases as the number of points tends to inﬁnity (or, equivalently, where λσ −d converges to 0 if one uses the classical non-normalized version of the Gaussian kernel instead of (2)). [sent-20, score-0.338]
</p><p>10 Although it seems natural to reduce regularization as more and more training data are available –even more than natural, it is the spirit of regularization [7, 8]–, there is at least one important situation where λ is typically held ﬁxed: the one-class SVM [9]. [sent-21, score-0.41]
</p><p>11 The estimation is performed by thresholding the function output by the one-class SVM, that is, the SVM (1) with only positive examples; in that case λ is supposed to determine the quantile level1 . [sent-23, score-0.153]
</p><p>12 Although it is known that the fraction of examples in the selected region converges to the desired quantile level α [9], it is still an open question whether the region converges towards a quantile, that is, a region of minimum volume. [sent-24, score-0.396]
</p><p>13 The main contribution of this paper is to show that Bayes consistency can be obtained for algorithms that solve (1) without decreasing λ, if instead the bandwidth σ of the Gaussian kernel decreases at a suitable rate. [sent-26, score-0.577]
</p><p>14 We prove upper bounds on the convergence rate of the classiﬁcation error towards the Bayes risk for a variety of functions φ and of distributions P , in particular for SVM (Theorem 6). [sent-27, score-0.409]
</p><p>15 Moreover, we provide an explicit description of the function asymptotically output by the algorithms, and establish converge rates towards this limit for the L2 norm (Theorem 7). [sent-28, score-0.383]
</p><p>16 Due to lack of space we limit ourselves in this extended abstract to the statement of the main results (Section 2) and sketch the proof of the main theorem (Theorem 3) that underlies all other results in Section 3. [sent-30, score-0.549]
</p><p>17 2  Notations and main results  Let (X, Y ) be a pair of random variables taking values in Rd × {−1, 1}, with distribution P . [sent-32, score-0.05]
</p><p>18 We assume throughout this paper that the marginal distribution of X is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure with density ρ : Rd → R, and that is has a support included in a compact set X ⊂ Rd . [sent-33, score-0.268]
</p><p>19 We denote η : Rd → [0, 1] a measurable version of the conditional distribution of Y = 1 given X. [sent-34, score-0.088]
</p><p>20 The normalized Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel kσ with bandwidth parameter σ > 0 is deﬁned for any (x, x′ ) ∈ Rd × Rd by: kσ (x, x′ ) = √  1 2πσ  d  exp  − x − x′ 2σ 2  2  ,  and the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is denoted by Hσ . [sent-35, score-0.412]
</p><p>21 We √ −d note κσ = 2πσ the normalizing constant that ensures that the kernel integrates to 1. [sent-36, score-0.096]
</p><p>22 For example, for the hinge loss φ(u) = max(0, 1 − u) one can take L(r) = 1, and for the squared hinge loss φ(u) = max(0, 1 − u)2 one can take L(r) = 2(r + 1). [sent-39, score-0.422]
</p><p>23 • Finally, the L2 -norm regularized φ-risk is, for any f ∈ M: Rφ,0 (f ) = EP [φ (Y f (X))] + λ f  2 L2  where, f  2 L2  = Rd  f (x)2 dx ∈ [0, +∞]. [sent-40, score-0.107]
</p><p>24 The minima of the three risk functionals deﬁned above over their respective domains are ∗ ∗ denoted by R∗ , Rφ,σ and Rφ,0 respectively. [sent-41, score-0.219]
</p><p>25 Each of these risks has an empirical counterpart where the expectation with respect to P is replaced by an average over an i. [sent-42, score-0.114]
</p><p>26 In particular, the following empirical version of Rφ,σ will be used ∀σ > 0, f ∈ Hσ , Rφ,σ (f ) =  1 n  n  φ (Yi f (Xi )) + λ f i=1  2 Hσ  . [sent-49, score-0.057]
</p><p>27 The main focus of this paper is the analysis of learning algorithms that minimize the empirical φ-risk regularized by the RKHS norm Rφ,σ , and their limit as the number of points tends to inﬁnity and the kernel width σ decreases to 0 at a suitable rate when n tends to ∞, λ being kept ﬁxed. [sent-50, score-0.806]
</p><p>28 Roughly speaking, our main result shows that in this situation, if φ is a convex loss function, the minimization of Rφ,σ asymptotically amounts to minimizing Rφ,0 . [sent-51, score-0.321]
</p><p>29 This stems from the fact that the empirical average term in the deﬁnition of Rφ,σ converges to its corresponding expectation, while the norm in Hσ of a function f decreases to its L2 norm when σ decreases to zero. [sent-52, score-0.592]
</p><p>30 To turn this intuition into a rigorous statement, we need a few more assumptions about the minimizer of Rφ,0 and about P . [sent-53, score-0.154]
</p><p>31 First, we observe that the minimizer of Rφ,0 is indeed well-deﬁned and can often be explicitly computed: Lemma 1 For any x ∈ Rd , let  fφ,0 (x) = arg min ρ(x) [η(x)φ(α) + (1 − η)φ(−α)] + λα2  . [sent-54, score-0.19]
</p><p>32 α∈R  Then fφ,0 is measurable and satisﬁes: Rφ,0 (fφ,0 ) = inf Rφ,0 (f ) f ∈M  Second, we provide below a general result that shows how to control the excess Rφ,0 -risk of the empirical minimizer of the Rφ,σ -risk, for which we need to recall the notion of modulus of continuity [12]. [sent-55, score-0.829]
</p><p>33 Deﬁnition 2 (Modulus of continuity) Let f be a Lebesgue measurable function from Rd to R. [sent-56, score-0.088]
</p><p>34 Then its modulus of continuity in the L1 -norm is deﬁned for any δ ≥ 0 as follows ω(f, δ) =  sup  f (. [sent-57, score-0.281]
</p><p>35 )  0≤ t ≤δ  L1  ,  (3)  where t is the Euclidian norm of t ∈ Rd . [sent-59, score-0.109]
</p><p>36 Our main result can now be stated as follows: ˆ Theorem 3 (Main Result) Let σ1 > σ > 0, 0 < p < 2, δ > 0, and let fφ,σ denote a minimizer of the Rφ,σ risk over Hσ . [sent-60, score-0.455]
</p><p>37 Assume that the marginal density ρ is bounded, and let M = supx∈Rd ρ(x). [sent-61, score-0.238]
</p><p>38 of (4) bound the estimation error associated with the gaussian RKHS, which naturally tends to be small when the number of training data increases and when the RKHS is ’small’, i. [sent-69, score-0.218]
</p><p>39 As is usually the case in such variance/bias splitings, the variance term here depends on the dimension d of the input space. [sent-72, score-0.061]
</p><p>40 The third term measures the error due to penalizing the L2 -norm of a ﬁxed function in Hσ1 by its . [sent-74, score-0.061]
</p><p>41 This is a price to pay to get a small estimation error. [sent-76, score-0.052]
</p><p>42 As for the fourth term, it is a bound on the approximation error of the Gaussian RKHS. [sent-77, score-0.035]
</p><p>43 In order to highlight the type of convergence rates one can obtain from Theorem 3, let us assume that the φ loss function is Lipschitz on R (e. [sent-79, score-0.281]
</p><p>44 , take the hinge loss), and suppose that for some 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, c1 > 0, and for any h ≥ 0, the function fφ,0 satisﬁes the following inequality ω(fφ,0 , h) ≤ c1 hβ . [sent-81, score-0.114]
</p><p>45 Theorem 3 shows that minimizing the Rφ,σ risk for well-chosen width σ is a an algorithm consistant for the Rφ,0 -risk. [sent-88, score-0.211]
</p><p>46 In order to state a reﬁned version in the particular case of the support vector machine algorithm, we ﬁrst need the following deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 5 We say that a distribution P with ρ as marginal density of X w. [sent-90, score-0.268]
</p><p>47 Lebesgue 2 measure has a low density exponent γ ≥ 0 if there exists (c2 , ǫ0 ) ∈ (0, +∞) such that ∀ǫ ∈ [0, ǫ0 ],  x ∈ Rd : ρ(x) ≤ ǫ  P  ≤ c2 ǫγ . [sent-93, score-0.206]
</p><p>48 We are now in position to state a quantitative relationship between the excess Rφ,0 -risk and the excess R-risk in the case of support vector machines: Theorem 6 Let φ1 (α) = max (1 − α, 0) be the hinge loss function, and φ2 (α) = 2 max (1 − α, 0) , be the squared hinge loss function. [sent-94, score-1.13]
</p><p>49 Hence we have proved the consistency of SVM, together with upper bounds on the convergence rates, in a situation where the effect of regularization does not vanish asymptotically. [sent-96, score-0.718]
</p><p>50 Another consequence of the Rφ,0 -consistency of an algorithm is the L2 -convergence of the function output by the algorithm to the minimizer of the Rφ,0 -risk: Lemma 7 For any f ∈ M, the following holds: f − fφ,0  2 L2  ≤  1 ∗ Rφ,0 (f ) − Rφ,0 . [sent-97, score-0.154]
</p><p>51 λ  This result is particularly relevant to study algorithms whose objective are not binary classiﬁcation. [sent-98, score-0.039]
</p><p>52 Then we claim the following:  Theorem 8 Let ρλ denote the density truncated as follows: ρ(x) 2λ  ρλ (x) =  1  if ρ(x) ≤ 2λ, otherwise. [sent-100, score-0.204]
</p><p>53 Then, under the general conditions of Theorem 3, for σ choosen as in Equation (8), ˆ lim fσ − ρλ L = 0 . [sent-105, score-0.142]
</p><p>54 Then, under the general assumptions of Theorem 3, we have lim HP (Cµ ) − HP Cµ = 0 , (11) n→+∞  for σ choosen as in Equation (8). [sent-108, score-0.142]
</p><p>55 The excess-mass functional was ﬁrst introduced in [10] to assess the quality of density level set estimators. [sent-109, score-0.274]
</p><p>56 It is maximized by the true density level set Cµ and acts as a risk functional in the one-class framework. [sent-110, score-0.451]
</p><p>57 The proof ef Theorem 9 is based on the following result: if ρ is a density estimator converging to the true density ρ in the L2 sense, then ˆ for any ﬁxed 0 < µ < sup {ρ}, the excess mass of the level set of ρ at level µ converges ˆ to the excess mass of Cµ . [sent-111, score-1.274]
</p><p>58 In other words, as is the case in the classiﬁcation framework, plug-in estimators built on L2 -consistent density estimators are consistent with respect to the excess mass. [sent-112, score-0.517]
</p><p>59 By studying the relationship between the Gaussian RKHS norm and the L2 norm, it can be shown that ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ Rφ,0 fφ,σ − Rφ,σ fφ,σ = λ fφ,σ 2 − fφ,σ 2 ≤ 0, L2  Hσ  ∗ while the following stems from the deﬁnition of Rφ,σ : ∗ Rφ,σ − Rφ,σ (kσ1 ∗ fφ,0 ) ≤ 0. [sent-118, score-0.158]
</p><p>60 ∗ ˆ Hence, controlling Rφ,0 (fφ,σ )−Rφ,0 boils down to controlling each of the remaining three terms in (12). [sent-119, score-0.07]
</p><p>61 • The second term in (12) is usually referred to as the sample error or estimation error. [sent-120, score-0.113]
</p><p>62 Using estimates of local Rademacher complexities through covering numbers for the Gaussian RKHS due to [4], the following result can be shown: ˆ Lemma 10 For any σ > 0 small enough, let fφ,σ be the minimizer of the Rφ,σ risk on a sample of size n, where φ is a convex loss function. [sent-122, score-0.558]
</p><p>63 • In order to upper bound the fourth term in (12), the analysis of the convergence of the Gaussian RKHS norm towards the L2 norm when the bandwidth of the kernel tends to 0 leads to: Rφ,σ (kσ1 ∗ fφ,0 ) − Rφ,0 (kσ1 ∗ fφ,0 ) = kσ1 ∗ fφ,0 2 σ − kσ1 ∗ fφ,0 2 2 H L σ2 2 fφ,0 2σ1 φ (0) σ 2 ≤ 2 . [sent-124, score-0.776]
</p><p>64 2λσ1 ≤  2 L2  • The ﬁfth term in (12) corresponds to the approximation error. [sent-125, score-0.061]
</p><p>65 It can be shown that for any bounded function in L1 (Rd ) and all σ > 0, the following holds: √ (13) kσ ∗ f − f L1 ≤ (1 + d)ω(f, σ) , where ω(f, . [sent-126, score-0.043]
</p><p>66 ) denotes the modulus of continuity of f in the L1 norm. [sent-127, score-0.246]
</p><p>67 Conclusion  We have shown that consistency of learning algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical risk can be obtained even when the so-called regularization term does not asymptotically vanish, and derived the consistency of one-class SVM as a density level set estimator. [sent-129, score-1.398]
</p><p>68 Our method of proof is based on an unusual decomposition of the excess risk due to the presence of the regularization term, which plays an important role in the determination of the asymptotic limit of the function that minimizes the empirical risk. [sent-130, score-0.82]
</p><p>69 Although the upper bounds on the convergence rates we obtain are not optimal, they provide a ﬁrst step toward the analysis of learning algorithms in this context. [sent-131, score-0.292]

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic limit of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish.

<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Johnny Mariethoz, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that the hinge loss can be interpreted as the neg-log-likelihood of a semi-parametric model of posterior probabilities. From this point of view, SVMs represent the parametric component of a semi-parametric model ﬁtted by a maximum a posteriori estimation procedure. This connection enables to derive a mapping from SVM scores to estimated posterior probabilities. Unlike previous proposals, the suggested mapping is interval-valued, providing a set of posterior probabilities compatible with each SVM score. This framework offers a new way to adapt the SVM optimization problem to unbalanced classiﬁcation, when decisions result in unequal (asymmetric) losses. Experiments show improvements over state-of-the-art procedures. 1</p><p>3 0.19145255 <a title="47-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Divergences%2C_surrogate_loss_functions_and_experimental_design.html">58 nips-2005-Divergences, surrogate loss functions and experimental design</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuanlong Nguyen, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide a general theorem that establishes a correspondence between surrogate loss functions in classiﬁcation and the family of f -divergences. Moreover, we provide constructive procedures for determining the f -divergence induced by a given surrogate loss, and conversely for ﬁnding all surrogate loss functions that realize a given f -divergence. Next we introduce the notion of universal equivalence among loss functions and corresponding f -divergences, and provide necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for universal equivalence to hold. These ideas have applications to classiﬁcation problems that also involve a component of experiment design; in particular, we leverage our results to prove consistency of a procedure for learning a classiﬁer under decentralization requirements. 1</p><p>4 0.18332314 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Aggregation_by_Mirror_Descent_with_Averaging.html">82 nips-2005-Generalization Error Bounds for Aggregation by Mirror Descent with Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Anatoli Juditsky, Alexander Nazin, Alexandre Tsybakov, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing an aggregated estimator from a ﬁnite class of base functions which approximately minimizes a convex risk functional under the ℓ1 constraint. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic procedure, the mirror descent, which performs gradient descent in the dual space. The generated estimates are additionally averaged in a recursive fashion with speciﬁc weights. Mirror descent algorithms have been developed in different contexts and they are known to be particularly efﬁcient in high dimensional problems. Moreover their implementation is adapted to the online setting.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic limit of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator. 1</p><p>2 0.75799936 <a title="47-lsi-2" href="./nips-2005-Divergences%2C_surrogate_loss_functions_and_experimental_design.html">58 nips-2005-Divergences, surrogate loss functions and experimental design</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuanlong Nguyen, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide a general theorem that establishes a correspondence between surrogate loss functions in classiﬁcation and the family of f -divergences. Moreover, we provide constructive procedures for determining the f -divergence induced by a given surrogate loss, and conversely for ﬁnding all surrogate loss functions that realize a given f -divergence. Next we introduce the notion of universal equivalence among loss functions and corresponding f -divergences, and provide necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for universal equivalence to hold. These ideas have applications to classiﬁcation problems that also involve a component of experiment design; in particular, we leverage our results to prove consistency of a procedure for learning a classiﬁer under decentralization requirements. 1</p><p>3 0.70987457 <a title="47-lsi-3" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Minimum_Volume_Sets.html">112 nips-2005-Learning Minimum Volume Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P -measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P , and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P . Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P , but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency and an oracle inequality. Estimators based on histograms and dyadic partitions illustrate the proposed rules. 1</p><p>4 0.69127625 <a title="47-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_SVMs_with_an_Application_to_Unbalanced_Classification.html">14 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Interpretation of SVMs with an Application to Unbalanced Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Johnny Mariethoz, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that the hinge loss can be interpreted as the neg-log-likelihood of a semi-parametric model of posterior probabilities. From this point of view, SVMs represent the parametric component of a semi-parametric model ﬁtted by a maximum a posteriori estimation procedure. This connection enables to derive a mapping from SVM scores to estimated posterior probabilities. Unlike previous proposals, the suggested mapping is interval-valued, providing a set of posterior probabilities compatible with each SVM score. This framework offers a new way to adapt the SVM optimization problem to unbalanced classiﬁcation, when decisions result in unequal (asymmetric) losses. Experiments show improvements over state-of-the-art procedures. 1</p><p>5 0.67025226 <a title="47-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Convergence_and_Consistency_of_Regularized_Boosting_Algorithms_with_Stationary_B-Mixing_Observations.html">49 nips-2005-Convergence and Consistency of Regularized Boosting Algorithms with Stationary B-Mixing Observations</a></p>

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Peter Dayan, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: The misjudgement of tilt in images lies at the heart of entertaining visual illusions and rigorous perceptual psychophysics. A wealth of ﬁndings has attracted many mechanistic models, but few clear computational principles. We adopt a Bayesian approach to perceptual tilt estimation, showing how a smoothness prior offers a powerful way of addressing much confusing data. In particular, we faithfully model recent results showing that conﬁdence in estimation can be systematically affected by the same aspects of images that affect bias. Conﬁdence is central to Bayesian modeling approaches, and is applicable in many other perceptual domains. Perceptual anomalies and illusions, such as the misjudgements of motion and tilt evident in so many psychophysical experiments, have intrigued researchers for decades.1–3 A Bayesian view4–8 has been particularly inﬂuential in models of motion processing, treating such anomalies as the normative product of prior information (often statistically codifying Gestalt laws) with likelihood information from the actual scenes presented. Here, we expand the range of statistically normative accounts to tilt estimation, for which there are classes of results (on estimation conﬁdence) that are so far not available for motion. The tilt illusion arises when the perceived tilt of a center target is misjudged (ie bias) in the presence of ﬂankers. Another phenomenon, called Crowding, refers to a loss in the conﬁdence (ie sensitivity) of perceived target tilt in the presence of ﬂankers. Attempts have been made to formalize these phenomena quantitatively. Crowding has been modeled as compulsory feature pooling (ie averaging of orientations), ignoring spatial positions.9, 10 The tilt illusion has been explained by lateral interactions11, 12 in populations of orientationtuned units; and by calibration.13 However, most models of this form cannot explain a number of crucial aspects of the data. First, the geometry of the positional arrangement of the stimuli affects attraction versus repulsion in bias, as emphasized by Kapadia et al14 (ﬁgure 1A), and others.15, 16 Second, Solomon et al. recently measured bias and sensitivity simultaneously.11 The rich and surprising range of sensitivities, far from ﬂat as a function of ﬂanker angles (ﬁgure 1B), are outside the reach of standard models. Moreover, current explanations do not offer a computational account of tilt perception as the outcome of a normative inference process. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian framework for orientation estimation, with a prior favoring smoothness, can naturally explain a range of seemingly puzzling tilt data. We explicitly consider both the geometry of the stimuli, and the issue of conﬁdence in the esti- 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 (B) Attraction Repulsion Sensititvity (1/deg) Bias (deg) (A) 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 Flanker tilt (deg) Figure 1: Tilt biases and sensitivities in visual perception. (A) Kapadia et al demonstrated the importance of geometry on tilt bias, with bar stimuli in the fovea (and similar results in the periphery). When 5 degrees clockwise ﬂankers are arranged colinearly, the center target appears attracted in the direction of the ﬂankers; when ﬂankers are lateral, the target appears repulsed. Data are an average of 5 subjects.14 (B) Solomon et al measured both biases and sensitivities for gratings in the visual periphery.11 On the top are example stimuli, with ﬂankers tilted 22.5 degrees clockwise. This constitutes the classic tilt illusion, with a repulsive bias percept. In addition, sensitivities vary as a function of ﬂanker angles, in a systematic way (even in cases when there are no biases at all). Sensitivities are given in units of the inverse of standard deviation of the tilt estimate. More detailed data for both experiments are shown in the results section. mation. Bayesian analyses have most frequently been applied to bias. Much less attention has been paid to the equally important phenomenon of sensitivity. This aspect of our model should be applicable to other perceptual domains. In section 1 we formulate the Bayesian model. The prior is determined by the principle of creating a smooth contour between the target and ﬂankers. We describe how to extract the bias and sensitivity. In section 2 we show experimental data of Kapadia et al and Solomon et al, alongside the model simulations, and demonstrate that the model can account for both geometry, and bias and sensitivity measurements in the data. Our results suggest a more uniﬁed, rational, approach to understanding tilt perception. 1 Bayesian model Under our Bayesian model, inference is controlled by the posterior distribution over the tilt of the target element. This comes from the combination of a prior favoring smooth conﬁgurations of the ﬂankers and target, and the likelihood associated with the actual scene. A complete distribution would consider all possible angles and relative spatial positions of the bars, and marginalize the posterior over all but the tilt of the central element. For simplicity, we make two benign approximations: conditionalizing over (ie clamping) the angles of the ﬂankers, and exploring only a small neighborhood of their positions. We now describe the steps of inference. Smoothness prior: Under these approximations, we consider a given actual conﬁguration (see ﬁg 2A) of ﬂankers f1 = (φ1 , x1 ), f2 = (φ2 , x2 ) and center target c = (φc , xc ), arranged from top to bottom. We have to generate a prior over φc and δ1 = x1 − xc and δ2 = x2 − xc based on the principle of smoothness. As a less benign approximation, we do this in two stages: articulating a principle that determines a single optimal conﬁguration; and generating a prior as a mixture of a Gaussian about this optimum and a uniform distribution, with the mixing proportion of the latter being determined by the smoothness of the optimum. Smoothness has been extensively studied in the computer vision literature.17–20 One widely (B) (C) f1 f1 β1 R Probability max smooth Max smooth target (deg) (A) 40 20 0 -20 c δ1 c -40 Φc f2 f2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 80 -80 -60 -40 20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 80 Figure 2: Geometry and smoothness for ﬂankers, f1 and f2 , and center target, c. (A) Example actual conﬁguration of ﬂankers and target, aligned along the y axis from top to bottom. (B) The elastica procedure can rotate the target angle (to Φc ) and shift the relative ﬂanker and target positions on the x axis (to δ1 and δ2 ) in its search for the maximally smooth solution. Small spatial shifts (up to 1/15 the size of R) of positions are allowed, but positional shift is overemphasized in the ﬁgure for visibility. (C) Top: center tilt that results in maximal smoothness, as a function of ﬂanker tilt. Boxed cartoons show examples for given ﬂanker tilts, of the optimally smooth conﬁguration. Note attraction of target towards ﬂankers for small ﬂanker angles; here ﬂankers and target are positioned in a nearly colinear arrangement. Note also repulsion of target away from ﬂankers for intermediate ﬂanker angles. Bottom: P [c, f1 , f2 ] for center tilt that yields maximal smoothness. The y axis is normalized between 0 and 1. used principle, elastica, known even to Euler, has been applied to contour completion21 and other computer vision applications.17 The basic idea is to ﬁnd the curve with minimum energy (ie, square of curvature). Sharon et al19 showed that the elastica function can be well approximated by a number of simpler forms. We adopt a version that Leung and Malik18 adopted from Sharon et al.19 We assume that the probability for completing a smooth curve, can be factorized into two terms: P [c, f1 , f2 ] = G(c, f1 )G(c, f2 ) (1) with the term G(c, f1 ) (and similarly, G(c, f2 )) written as: R Dβ 2 2 Dβ = β1 + βc − β1 βc (2) − ) where σR σβ and β1 (and similarly, βc ) is the angle between the orientation at f1 , and the line joining f1 and c. The distance between the centers of f1 and c is given by R. The two constants, σβ and σR , control the relative contribution to smoothness of the angle versus the spatial distance. Here, we set σβ = 1, and σR = 1.5. Figure 2B illustrates an example geometry, in which φc , δ1 , and δ2 , have been shifted from the actual scene (of ﬁgure 2A). G(c, f1 ) = exp(− We now estimate the smoothest solution for given conﬁgurations. Figure 2C shows for given ﬂanker tilts, the center tilt that yields maximal smoothness, and the corresponding probability of smoothness. For near vertical ﬂankers, the spatial lability leads to very weak attraction and high probability of smoothness. As the ﬂanker angle deviates farther from vertical, there is a large repulsion, but also lower probability of smoothness. These observations are key to our model: the maximally smooth center tilt will inﬂuence attractive and repulsive interactions of tilt estimation; the probability of smoothness will inﬂuence the relative weighting of the prior versus the likelihood. From the smoothness principle, we construct a two dimensional prior (ﬁgure 3A).

(E) For this target tilt, we calculate probability clockwise, and obtain one point on psychometric curve. and ﬂankers (called ’position’). The prior is a 2D Gaussian distribution, sat upon a constant baseline.22 The Gaussian is centered at the estimated smoothest target angle and relative position, and the baseline is determined by the probability of smoothness. The baseline, and its dependence on the ﬂanker orientation, is a key difference from Weiss et al’s Gaussian prior for smooth, slow motion. It can be seen as a mechanism to allow segmentation (see Posterior description below). The standard deviation of the Gaussian is a free parameter. Likelihood: The likelihood over tilt and position (ﬁgure 3B) is determined by a 2D Gaussian distribution with an added baseline.22 The Gaussian is centered at the actual target tilt; and at a position taken as zero, since this is the actual position, to which the prior is compared. The standard deviation and baseline constant are free parameters. Posterior and marginalization: The posterior comes from multiplying likelihood and prior (ﬁgure 3C) and then marginalizing over position to obtain a 1D distribution over tilt. Figure 3D shows an example in which this distribution is bimodal. Other likelihoods, with closer agreement between target and smooth prior, give unimodal distributions. Note that the bimodality is a direct consequence of having an added baseline to the prior and likelihood (if these were Gaussian without a baseline, the posterior would always be Gaussian). The viewer is effectively assessing whether the target is associated with the same object as the ﬂankers, and this is reﬂected in the baseline, and consequently, in the bimodality, and conﬁdence estimate. We deﬁne α as the mean angle of the 1D posterior distribution (eg, value of dashed line on the x axis), and β as the height of the probability distribution at that mean angle (eg, height of dashed line). The term β is an indication of conﬁdence in the angle estimate, where for larger values we are more certain of the estimate. Decision of probability clockwise: The probability of a clockwise tilt is estimated from the marginalized posterior: 1 P = 1 + exp (3) −α.∗k − log(β+η) where α and β are deﬁned as above, k is a free parameter and η a small constant. Free parameters are set to a single constant value for all ﬂanker and center conﬁgurations. Weiss et al use a similar compressive nonlinearity, but without the term β. We also tried a decision function that integrates the posterior, but the resulting curves were far from the sigmoidal nature of the data. Bias and sensitivity: For one target tilt, we generate a single probability and therefore a single point on the psychometric function relating tilt to the probability of choosing clockwise.

The ﬁt to a cumulative Gaussian and extraction of these parameters exactly mimic psychophysical procedures.11 2 Results: data versus model We ﬁrst consider the geometry of the center and ﬂanker conﬁgurations, modeling the full psychometric curve for colinear and parallel ﬂanks (recall that ﬁgure 1A showed summary biases). Figure 4A;B demonstrates attraction in the data and model; that is, the psychometric curve is shifted towards the ﬂanker, because of the nature of smooth completions for colinear ﬂankers. Figure 4C;D shows repulsion in the data and model. In this case, the ﬂankers are arranged laterally instead of colinearly. The smoothest solution in the model arises by shifting the target estimate away from the ﬂankers. This shift is rather minor, because the conﬁguration has a low probability of smoothness (similar to ﬁgure 2C), and thus the prior exerts only a weak effect. The above results show examples of changes in the psychometric curve, but do not address both bias and, particularly, sensitivity, across a whole range of ﬂanker conﬁgurations. Figure 5 depicts biases and sensitivity from Solomon et al, versus the Bayes model. The data are shown for a representative subject, but the qualitative behavior is consistent across all subjects tested. In ﬁgure 5A, bias is shown, for the condition that both ﬂankers are tilted at the same angle. The data exhibit small attraction at near vertical ﬂanker angles (this arrangement is close to colinear); large repulsion at intermediate ﬂanker angles of 22.5 and 45 degrees from vertical; and minimal repulsion at large angles from vertical. This behavior is also exhibited in the Bayes model (Figure 5B). For intermediate ﬂanker angles, the smoothest solution in the model is repulsive, and the effect of the prior is strong enough to induce a signiﬁcant repulsion. For large angles, the prior exerts almost no effect. Interestingly, sensitivity is far from ﬂat in both data and model. In the data (Figure 5C), there is most loss in sensitivity at intermediate ﬂanker angles of 22.5 and 45 degrees (ie, the subject is less certain); and sensitivity is higher for near vertical or near horizontal ﬂankers. The model shows the same qualitative behavior (Figure 5D). In the model, there are two factors driving sensitivity: one is the probability of completing a smooth curvature for a given ﬂanker conﬁguration, as in Figure 2B; this determines the strength of the prior. The other factor is certainty in a particular center estimation; this is determined by β, derived from the posterior distribution, and incorporated into the decision stage of the model Data 5 0 -60 -40 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 60 80 -60 -40 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 80 60 80 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 80 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 80 (F) Bias (deg) 10 5 0 -5 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 -80 (D) 10 -10 -10 80 Sensitivity (1/deg) -80 5 0 -5 -80 -80 -60 -60 -40 -40 -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) -20 0 20 40 Flanker tilt (deg) 60 -10 80 (H) 60 80 Sensitivity (1/deg) Sensititvity (1/deg) Bias (deg) 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 (G) Sensititvity (1/deg) 0 -5 (C) (E) 5 -5 -10 Model (B) 10 Bias (deg) Bias (deg) (A) 10 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 -80 -60 -40 Figure 5: Solomon et al data11 (subject FF), versus Bayesian model. (A) Data and (B) model biases with same-tilted ﬂankers; (C) Data and (D) model sensitivities with same-tilted ﬂankers; (E;G) data and (F;H) model as above, but for opposite-tilted ﬂankers (note that opposite-tilted data was collected for less ﬂanker angles). Each point in the ﬁgure is derived by ﬁtting a cummulative Gaussian distribution N (µ, σ) to corresponding psychometric curve, and setting bias 1 equal to µ and sensitivity to σ . In all experiments, ﬂanker and target gratings are presented in the visual periphery. Both data and model stimuli are averages of two conﬁgurations, on the left hand side (9 O’clock position) and right hand side (3 O’clock position). The conﬁgurations are similar to Figure 1 (B), but slightly shifted according to an iso-eccentric circle, so that all stimuli are similarly visible in the periphery. (equation 3). For ﬂankers that are far from vertical, the prior has minimal effect because one cannot ﬁnd a smooth solution (eg, the likelihood dominates), and thus sensitivity is higher. The low sensitivity at intermediate angles arises because the prior has considerable effect; and there is conﬂict between the prior (tilt, position), and likelihood (tilt, position). This leads to uncertainty in the target angle estimation . For ﬂankers near vertical, the prior exerts a strong effect; but there is less conﬂict between the likelihood and prior estimates (tilt, position) for a vertical target. This leads to more conﬁdence in the posterior estimate, and therefore, higher sensitivity. The only aspect that our model does not reproduce is the (more subtle) sensitivity difference between 0 and +/- 5 degree ﬂankers. Figure 5E-H depict data and model for opposite tilted ﬂankers. The bias is now close to zero in the data (Figure 5E) and model (Figure 5F), as would be expected (since the maximally smooth angle is now always roughly vertical). Perhaps more surprisingly, the sensitivities continue to to be non-ﬂat in the data (Figure 5G) and model (Figure 5H). This behavior arises in the model due to the strength of prior, and positional uncertainty. As before, there is most loss in sensitivity at intermediate angles. Note that to ﬁt Kapadia et al, simulations used a constant parameter of k = 9 in equation 3, whereas for the Solomon et al. simulations, k = 2.5. This indicates that, in our model, there was higher conﬁdence in the foveal experiments than in the peripheral ones. 3 Discussion We applied a Bayesian framework to the widely studied tilt illusion, and demonstrated the model on examples from two different data sets involving foveal and peripheral estimation. Our results support the appealing hypothesis that perceptual misjudgements are not a consequence of poor system design, but rather can be described as optimal inference.4–8 Our model accounts correctly for both attraction and repulsion, determined by the smoothness prior and the geometry of the scene. We emphasized the issue of estimation conﬁdence. The dataset showing how conﬁdence is affected by the same issues that affect bias,11 was exactly appropriate for a Bayesian formulation; other models in the literature typically do not incorporate conﬁdence in a thoroughly probabilistic manner. In fact, our model ﬁts the conﬁdence (and bias) data more proﬁciently than an account based on lateral interactions among a population of orientationtuned cells.11 Other Bayesian work, by Stocker et al,6 utilized the full slope of the psychometric curve in ﬁtting a prior and likelihood to motion data, but did not examine the issue of conﬁdence. Estimation conﬁdence plays a central role in Bayesian formulations as a whole. Understanding how priors affect conﬁdence should have direct bearing on many other Bayesian calculations such as multimodal integration.23 Our model is obviously over-simpliﬁed in a number of ways. First, we described it in terms of tilts and spatial positions; a more complete version should work in the pixel/ﬁltering domain.18, 19 We have also only considered two ﬂanking elements; the model is extendible to a full-ﬁeld surround, whereby smoothness operates along a range of geometric directions, and some directions are more (smoothly) dominant than others. Second, the prior is constructed by summarizing the maximal smoothness information; a more probabilistically correct version should capture the full probability of smoothness in its prior. Third, our model does not incorporate a formal noise representation; however, sensitivities could be inﬂuenced both by stimulus-driven noise and conﬁdence. Fourth, our model does not address attraction in the so-called indirect tilt illusion, thought to be mediated by a different mechanism. Finally, we have yet to account for neurophysiological data within this framework, and incorporate constraints at the neural implementation level. However, versions of our computations are oft suggested for intra-areal and feedback cortical circuits; and smoothness principles form a key part of the association ﬁeld connection scheme in Li’s24 dynamical model of contour integration in V1. Our model is connected to a wealth of literature in computer vision and perception. Notably, occlusion and contour completion might be seen as the extreme example in which there is no likelihood information at all for the center target; a host of papers have shown that under these circumstances, smoothness principles such as elastica and variants explain many aspects of perception. The model is also associated with many studies on contour integration motivated by Gestalt principles;25, 26 and exploration of natural scene statistics and Gestalt,27, 28 including the relation to contour grouping within a Bayesian framework.29, 30 Indeed, our model could be modiﬁed to include a prior from natural scenes. There are various directions for the experimental test and reﬁnement of our model. Most pressing is to determine bias and sensitivity for different center and ﬂanker contrasts. As in the case of motion, our model predicts that when there is more uncertainty in the center element, prior information is more dominant. Another interesting test would be to design a task such that the center element is actually part of a different ﬁgure and unrelated to the ﬂankers; our framework predicts that there would be minimal bias, because of segmentation. Our model should also be applied to other tilt-based illusions such as the Fraser spiral and Z¨ llner. Finally, our model can be applied to other perceptual domains;31 and given o the apparent similarities between the tilt illusion and the tilt after-effect, we plan to extend the model to adaptation, by considering smoothness in time as well as space.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic limit of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator. 1</p><p>3 0.84011137 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Radial_Basis_Function_Network_for_Multi-task_Learning.html">161 nips-2005-Radial Basis Function Network for Multi-task Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: John D. Lafferty, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We present a family of approximation techniques for probabilistic graphical models, based on the use of graphical preconditioners developed in the scientiﬁc computing literature. Our framework yields rigorous upper and lower bounds on event probabilities and the log partition function of undirected graphical models, using non-iterative procedures that have low time complexity. As in mean ﬁeld approaches, the approximations are built upon tractable subgraphs; however, we recast the problem of optimizing the tractable distribution parameters and approximate inference in terms of the well-studied linear systems problem of obtaining a good matrix preconditioner. Experiments are presented that compare the new approximation schemes to variational methods. 1</p><p>5 0.70860511 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-From_Weighted_Classification_to_Policy_Search.html">78 nips-2005-From Weighted Classification to Policy Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.69635963 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Convex_Neural_Networks.html">50 nips-2005-Convex Neural Networks</a></p>

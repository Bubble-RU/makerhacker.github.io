Here instead of considering the reconstruction error of KPCA we are interested in approximation error bounds for the eigenspaces themselves. We prove an upper bound depending on the spacing between eigenvalues but not on the dimensionality of the eigenspace. As a consequence this allows to infer stability results for these estimated spaces. 1 Introduction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA for short in the sequel) is a widely used tool for data dimensionality reduction. It consists in ﬁnding the most relevant lower-dimension projection of some data in the sense that the projection should keep as much of the variance of the original data as possible. If the target dimensionality of the projected data is ﬁxed in advance, say D – an assumption that we will make throughout the present paper – the solution of this problem is obtained by considering the projection on the span SD of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Here by ’ﬁrst D eigenvectors’ we mean eigenvectors associated to the D largest eigenvalues counted with multiplicity; hereafter with some abuse the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors will be called “D-eigenspace” for short when there is no risk of confusion. The introduction of the ’Kernel trick’ has allowed to extend this methodology to data mapped in a kernel feature space, then called KPCA [8]. The interest of this extension is that, while still linear in feature space, it gives rise to nonlinear interpretation in original space – vectors in the kernel feature space can be interpreted as nonlinear functions on the original space. For PCA as well as KPCA, the true covariance matrix (resp. covariance operator) is not known and has to be estimated from the available data, an procedure which in the case of ¨ Kernel spaces is linked to the so-called Nystrom approximation [13]. The subspace given as an output is then obtained as D-eigenspace SD of the empirical covariance matrix or operator. An interesting question from a statistical or learning theoretical point of view is then, how reliable this estimate is. This question has already been studied [10, 2] from the point of view of the reconstruction error of the estimated subspace. What this means is that (assuming the data is centered in Kernel space for simplicity) the average reconstruction error (square norm of the distance to the projection) of SD converges to the (optimal) reconstruction error of SD and that bounds are known about the rate of convergence. However, this does not tell us much about the convergence of SD to SD – since two very different subspaces can have a very similar reconstruction error, in particular when some eigenvalues are very close to each other (the gap between the eigenvalues will actually appear as a central point of the analysis to come). In the present work, we set to study the behavior of these D-eigenspaces themselves: we provide ﬁnite sample bounds describing the closeness of the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator to the true one. There are several broad motivations for this analysis. First, the reconstruction error alone is a valid criterion only if one really plans to perform dimensionality reduction of the data and stop there. However, PCA is often used merely as a preprocessing step and the projected data is then submitted to further processing (which could be classiﬁcation, regression or something else). In particular for KPCA, the projection subspace in the kernel space can be interpreted as a subspace of functions on the original space; one then expects these functions to be relevant for the data at hand and for some further task (see e.g. [3]). In these cases, if we want to analyze the full procedure (from a learning theoretical sense), it is desirable to have a more precise information on the selected subspace than just its reconstruction error. In particular, from a learning complexity point of view, it is important to ensure that functions used for learning stay in a set of limited complexity, which is ensured if the selected subspace is stable (which is a consequence of its convergence). The approach we use here is based on perturbation bounds and we essentially walk in the steps pioneered by Kolchinskii and Gin´ [7] (see also [4]) using tools of operator perturbae tion theory [5]. Similar methods have been used to prove consistency of spectral clustering [12, 11]. An important difference here is that we want to study directly the convergence of the whole subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors instead of the separate convergence of the individual eigenvectors; in particular we are interested in how D acts as a complexity parameter. The important point in our main result is that it does not: only the gap between the D-th and the (D + 1)-th eigenvalue comes into account. This means that there in no increase in complexity (as far as this bound is concerned: of course we cannot exclude that better bounds can be obtained in the future) between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone or the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Our contribution in the present work is thus • to adapt the operator perturbation result of [7] to D-eigenspaces. • to get non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation error of Kernel-PCA eigenspaces thanks to the previous tool. In section 2 we introduce shortly the notation, explain the main ingredients used and obtain a ﬁrst bound based on controlling separately the ﬁrst D eigenvectors, and depending on the dimension D. In section 3 we explain why the ﬁrst bound is actually suboptimal and derive an improved bound as a consequence of an operator perturbation result that is more adapted to our needs and deals directly with the D-eigenspace as a whole. Section 4 concludes and discusses the obtained results. Mathematical proofs are found in the appendix. 2 First result. Notation. The interest variable X takes its values in some measurable space X , following the distribution P . We consider KPCA and are therefore primarily interested in the mapping of X into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H with kernel function k through the feature mapping ϕ(x) = k(x, ·). The objective of the kernel PCA procedure is to recover a D-dimensional subspace SD of H such that the projection of ϕ(X) on SD has maximum averaged squared norm. All operators considered in what follows are Hilbert-Schmidt and the norm considered for these operators will be the Hilbert-Schmidt norm unless precised otherwise. Furthermore we only consider symmetric nonnegative operators, so that they can be diagonalized and have a discrete spectrum. Let C denote the covariance operator of variable ϕ(X). To simplify notation we assume that nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . of C are all simple (This is for convenience only. In the conclusion we discuss what changes have to be made if this is not the case). Let φ1 , φ2 , . . . be the associated eigenvectors. It is well-known that the optimal D-dimensional reconstruction space is SD = span{φ1 , . . . , φD }. The KPCA procedure approximates this objective by considering the empirical covariance operator, denoted Cn , and the subspace SD spanned by its ﬁrst D eigenvectors. We denote PSD , PSD the orthogonal projectors on b these spaces. A ﬁrst bound. Broadly speaking, the main steps required to obtain the type of result we are interested in are 1. A non-asympotic bound on the (Hilbert-Schmidt) norm of the difference between the empirical and the true covariance operators; 2. An operator perturbation result bounding the difference between spectral projectors of two operators by the norm of their difference. The combination of these two steps leads to our goal. The ﬁrst step consists in the following Lemma coming from [9]: Lemma 1 (Corollary 5 of [9]) Supposing that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M , with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , 2M ξ Cn − C ≤ √ 1+ . 2 n As for the second step, [7] provides the following perturbation bound (see also e.g. [12]): Theorem 2 (Simpliﬁed Version of [7], Theorem 5.2 ) Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple positive eigenvalues λ 1 > 1 λ2 > . . . For an integer r such that λr > 0, let δr = δr ∧ δr−1 where δr = 2 (λr − λr+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that B < δr /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator with simple nonzero eigenvalues. Let Pr (A) (resp. Pr (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the r-th eigenvector of A (resp. (A + B)). Then, these projectors satisfy: Pr (A) − Pr (A + B) ≤ 2 B δr . Remark about the Approximation Error of the Eigenvectors: let us recall that a control over the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the projections onto eigenspaces imply a control on the approximation errors of the eigenvectors themselves. Indeed, let φr , ψr denote the (normalized) r-th eigenvectors of the operators above with signs chosen so that φ r , ψr > 0. Then P φ r − P ψr 2 2 = 2(1 − φr , ψr ) ≥ 2(1 − φr , ψr ) = φr − ψr 2 . Now, the orthogonal projector on the direct sum of the ﬁrst D eigenspaces is the sum D r=1 Pr . Using the triangle inequality, and combining Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, we conclude that with probability at least 1 − e−ξ the following holds: D P SD − P SD ≤ b −1 δr r=1 4M √ n 1+ ξ 2 , 2 provided that n ≥ 16M 2 1 + ξ 2 −2 (sup1≤r≤D δr ) . The disadvantage of this bound is that we are penalized on the one hand by the (inverse) gaps between the eigenvalues, and on the other by the dimension D (because we have to sum the inverse gaps from 1 to D). In the next section we improve the operator perturbation bound to get an improved result where only the gap δD enters into account. 3 Improved Result. We ﬁrst prove the following variant on the operator perturbation property which better corresponds to our needs by taking directly into account the projection on the ﬁrst D eigenvectors at once. The proof uses the same kind of techniques as in [7]. Theorem 3 Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . Let D > 0 be an integer such that λD > 0, δD = 1 (λD − λD+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that 2 B < δD /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator. Let P D (A) (resp. P D (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors A (resp. (A + B)). Then these satisfy: P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ B . δD (1) This then gives rise to our main result on KPCA: Theorem 4 Assume that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M . Let SD , SD be the subspaces spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of C, resp. Cn deﬁned earlier. Denoting λ1 > λ2 > . . . the 1 eigenvalues of C, if D > 0 is such that λD > 0, put δD = 2 (λD − λD+1 ) and BD = 2M δD 1+ ξ 2 . 2 Then provided that n ≥ BD , the following bound holds with probability at least 1 − e−ξ : BD P SD − P SD ≤ √ . b n (2) This entails in particular ⊥ SD ⊂ g + h, g ∈ SD , h ∈ SD , h 1 Hk ≤ 2BD n− 2 g Hk . (3) The important point here is that the approximation error now only depends on D through the (inverse) gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. Note that using the results of section 2, we would have obtained exactly the same bound for estimating the D-th eigenvector only – or even a worse bound since δD = δD ∧ δD−1 appears in this case. Thus, at least from the point of view of this technique (which could still yield suboptimal bounds), there is no increase of complexity between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone and estimating the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Note that the inclusion (3) can be interpreted geometrically by saying that for any vector in SD , the √ tangent of the angle between this vector and its projection on SD is upper bounded by BD / n, which we can interpret as a stability property. Comment about the Centered Case. In the actual (K)PCA procedure, the data is actually ﬁrst empirically recentered, so that one has to consider the centered covariance operator C and its empirical counterpart C n . A result similar to Theorem 4 also holds in this case (up to some additional constant factors). Indeed, a result similar to Lemma 1 holds for the recentered operators [2]. Combined again with Theorem 3, this allows to come to similar conclusions for the “true” centered KPCA. 4 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper, ﬁnite sample size conﬁdence bounds of the eigenspaces of Kernel-PCA (the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator) are provided using tools of operator perturbation theory. This provides a ﬁrst step towards an in-depth complexity analysis of algorithms using KPCA as pre-processing, and towards taking into account the randomness of the obtained models (e.g. [3]). We proved a bound in which the complexity factor for estimating the eigenspace SD by its empirical counterpart depends only on the inverse gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. In addition to the previously cited works, we take into account the centering of the data and obtain comparable rates. In this work we assumed for simplicity of notation the eigenvalues to be simple. In the case the covariance operator C has nonzero eigenvalues with multiplicities m1 , m2 , . . . possibly larger than one, the analysis remains the same except for one point: we have to assume that the dimension D of the subspaces considered is of the form m1 + · · · + mr for a certain r. This could seem restrictive in comparison with the results obtained for estimating the sum of the ﬁrst D eigenvalues themselves [2] (which is linked to the reconstruction error in KPCA) where no such restriction appears. However, it should be clear that we need this restriction when considering D−eigenspaces themselves since the target space has to be unequivocally deﬁned, otherwise convergence cannot occur. Thus, it can happen in this special case that the reconstruction error converges while the projection space itself does not. Finally, a common point of the two analyses (over the spectrum and over the eigenspaces) lies in the fact that the bounds involve an inverse gap in the eigenvalues of the true covariance operator. Finally, how tight are these bounds and do they at least carry some correct qualitative information about the behavior of the eigenspaces? Asymptotic results (central limit Theorems) in [6, 4] always provide the correct goal to shoot for since they actually give the limit distributions of these quantities. They imply that there is still important ground to cover before bridging the gap between asymptotic and non-asymptotic. This of course opens directions for future work.

We give a short proof for the sake of n 1 completness. Cn − C = n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] with CX = ϕ(X) ⊗ ϕ(X)∗ = k(X, X) ≤ M . We can apply the bounded difference inequality to the variable Cn − C , so that with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , Cn − C ≤ E [ Cn − C ] + 2M Moreover, by Jensen’s inequality E [ Cn − C ] ≤ E n 1 simple calculations leads to E n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] 2 4M n . This concludes the proof of lemma 1. 1 n 2 n i=1 CXi 1 = nE 2 ξ 2n . 1 2 − E [CX ] , and CX − E [CX ] 2 ≤ Proof of Theorem 3. The variation of this proof with respect to Theorem 5.2 in [7] is (a) to work directly in a (inﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert space, requiring extra caution for some details and (b) obtaining an improved bound by considering D-eigenspaces at once. The key property of Hilbert-Schmidt operators allowing to work directly in a inﬁnite dimensional setting is that HS(H) is a both right and left ideal of Lc (H, H), the Banach space of all continuous linear operators of H endowed with the operator norm . op . Indeed, ∀ T ∈ HS(H), ∀S ∈ Lc (H, H), T S and ST belong to HS(H) with TS ≤ T S ST ≤ T and op S op . (4) The spectrum of an Hilbert-Schmidt operator T is denoted Λ(T ) and the sequence of eigenvalues in non-increasing order is denoted λ(T ) = (λ1 (T ) ≥ λ2 (T ) ≥ . . .) . In the following, P D (T ) denotes the orthogonal projector onto the D-eigenspace of T . The Hoffmann-Wielandt inequality in inﬁnite dimensional setting[1] yields that: λ(A) − λ(A + B) 2 ≤ B ≤ δD . 2 (5) implying in particular that ∀i > 0, |λi (A) − λi (A + B)| ≤ δD . 2 (6) Results found in [5] p.39 yield the formula P D (A) − P D (A + B) = − 1 2iπ γ (RA (z) − RA+B (z))dz ∈ Lc (H, H) . (7) where RA (z) = (A − z Id)−1 is the resolvent of A, provided that γ is a simple closed curve in C enclosing exactly the ﬁrst D eigenvalues of A and (A + B). Moreover, the same reference (p.60) states that for ξ in the complementary of Λ(A), RA (ξ) op = dist(ξ, Λ(A)) −1 . (8) The proof of the theorem now relies on the simple choice for the closed curve γ in (7), drawn in the picture below and consisting of three straight lines and a semi-circle of radius D L. For all L > δ2 , γ intersect neither the eigenspectrum of A (by equation (6)) nor the eigenspectrum of A + B. Moreover, the eigenvalues of A (resp. A + B) enclosed by γ are exactly λ1 (A), . . . , λD (A) (resp. λ1 (A + B), . . . , λD (A + B)). Moreover, for z ∈ γ, T (z) = RA (z) − RA+B (z) = −RA+B (z)BRA (z) belongs to HS(H) and depends continuously on z by (4). Consequently, P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 1 2π b a (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) |γ (t)|dt . N Let SN = n=0 (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z). RA+B (z) = (Id + RA (z)B)−1 RA (z) and, for z ∈ γ and L > δD , RA (z)B op ≤ RA (z) op B ≤ δD 1 ≤ , 2 dist(z, Λ(A)) 2 γ L L δD λ 0 D+1 δD λ2 λD λ1 δD δD δD 2 2 2 L . op imply that SN −→ RA+B (z) (uniformly for z ∈ γ). Using property (4), since B ∈ . HS(H), SN BRA (z) −→ RA+B (z)BRA (z) = RA+B (z) − RA (z) . Finally, RA (z) − RA+B (z) = (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z) n≥1 where the series converges in HS(H), uniformly in z ∈ γ. Using again property (4) and (8) implies B n (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) ≤ RA (γ(t)) n+1 B n ≤ op distn+1 (γ(t), Λ(A)) n≥1 Finally, since for L > δD , B ≤ δD 2 n≥1 ≤ dist(γ(t),Λ(A)) , 2 b B 1 |γ (t)|dt . 2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) π a dist Splitting the last integral into four parts according to the deﬁnition of the contour γ, we obtain P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 2arctan( δL ) 1 µ1 (A) − (µD (A) − δD ) π D |γ (t)|dt ≤ + +2 , dist2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) δD L L2 a and letting L goes to inﬁnity leads to the result. b Proof of Theorem 4.

The objective of the kernel PCA procedure is to recover a D-dimensional subspace SD of H such that the projection of ϕ(X) on SD has maximum averaged squared norm. All operators considered in what follows are Hilbert-Schmidt and the norm considered for these operators will be the Hilbert-Schmidt norm unless precised otherwise. Furthermore we only consider symmetric nonnegative operators, so that they can be diagonalized and have a discrete spectrum. Let C denote the covariance operator of variable ϕ(X). To simplify notation we assume that nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . of C are all simple (This is for convenience only. In the conclusion we discuss what changes have to be made if this is not the case). Let φ1 , φ2 , . . . be the associated eigenvectors. It is well-known that the optimal D-dimensional reconstruction space is SD = span{φ1 , . . . , φD }. The KPCA procedure approximates this objective by considering the empirical covariance operator, denoted Cn , and the subspace SD spanned by its ﬁrst D eigenvectors. We denote PSD , PSD the orthogonal projectors on b these spaces. A ﬁrst bound. Broadly speaking, the main steps required to obtain the type of result we are interested in are 1. A non-asympotic bound on the (Hilbert-Schmidt) norm of the difference between the empirical and the true covariance operators; 2. An operator perturbation result bounding the difference between spectral projectors of two operators by the norm of their difference. The combination of these two steps leads to our goal. The ﬁrst step consists in the following Lemma coming from [9]: Lemma 1 (Corollary 5 of [9]) Supposing that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M , with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , 2M ξ Cn − C ≤ √ 1+ . 2 n As for the second step, [7] provides the following perturbation bound (see also e.g. [12]): Theorem 2 (Simpliﬁed Version of [7], Theorem 5.2 ) Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple positive eigenvalues λ 1 > 1 λ2 > . . . For an integer r such that λr > 0, let δr = δr ∧ δr−1 where δr = 2 (λr − λr+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that B < δr /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator with simple nonzero eigenvalues. Let Pr (A) (resp. Pr (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the r-th eigenvector of A (resp. (A + B)). Then, these projectors satisfy: Pr (A) − Pr (A + B) ≤ 2 B δr . Remark about the Approximation Error of the Eigenvectors: let us recall that a control over the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the projections onto eigenspaces imply a control on the approximation errors of the eigenvectors themselves. Indeed, let φr , ψr denote the (normalized) r-th eigenvectors of the operators above with signs chosen so that φ r , ψr > 0. Then P φ r − P ψr 2 2 = 2(1 − φr , ψr ) ≥ 2(1 − φr , ψr ) = φr − ψr 2 . Now, the orthogonal projector on the direct sum of the ﬁrst D eigenspaces is the sum D r=1 Pr . Using the triangle inequality, and combining Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, we conclude that with probability at least 1 − e−ξ the following holds: D P SD − P SD ≤ b −1 δr r=1 4M √ n 1+ ξ 2 , 2 provided that n ≥ 16M 2 1 + ξ 2 −2 (sup1≤r≤D δr ) . The disadvantage of this bound is that we are penalized on the one hand by the (inverse) gaps between the eigenvalues, and on the other by the dimension D (because we have to sum the inverse gaps from 1 to D). In the next section we improve the operator perturbation bound to get an improved result where only the gap δD enters into account. 3 Improved Result. We ﬁrst prove the following variant on the operator perturbation property which better corresponds to our needs by taking directly into account the projection on the ﬁrst D eigenvectors at once. The proof uses the same kind of techniques as in [7]. Theorem 3 Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . Let D > 0 be an integer such that λD > 0, δD = 1 (λD − λD+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that 2 B < δD /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator. Let P D (A) (resp. P D (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors A (resp. (A + B)). Then these satisfy: P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ B . δD (1) This then gives rise to our main result on KPCA: Theorem 4 Assume that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M . Let SD , SD be the subspaces spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of C, resp. Cn deﬁned earlier. Denoting λ1 > λ2 > . . . the 1 eigenvalues of C, if D > 0 is such that λD > 0, put δD = 2 (λD − λD+1 ) and BD = 2M δD 1+ ξ 2 . 2 Then provided that n ≥ BD , the following bound holds with probability at least 1 − e−ξ : BD P SD − P SD ≤ √ . b n (2) This entails in particular ⊥ SD ⊂ g + h, g ∈ SD , h ∈ SD , h 1 Hk ≤ 2BD n− 2 g Hk . (3) The important point here is that the approximation error now only depends on D through the (inverse) gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. Note that using the results of section 2, we would have obtained exactly the same bound for estimating the D-th eigenvector only – or even a worse bound since δD = δD ∧ δD−1 appears in this case. Thus, at least from the point of view of this technique (which could still yield suboptimal bounds), there is no increase of complexity between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone and estimating the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Note that the inclusion (3) can be interpreted geometrically by saying that for any vector in SD , the √ tangent of the angle between this vector and its projection on SD is upper bounded by BD / n, which we can interpret as a stability property. Comment about the Centered Case. In the actual (K)PCA procedure, the data is actually ﬁrst empirically recentered, so that one has to consider the centered covariance operator C and its empirical counterpart C n . A result similar to Theorem 4 also holds in this case (up to some additional constant factors). Indeed, a result similar to Lemma 1 holds for the recentered operators [2]. Combined again with Theorem 3, this allows to come to similar conclusions for the “true” centered KPCA. 4 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper, ﬁnite sample size conﬁdence bounds of the eigenspaces of Kernel-PCA (the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator) are provided using tools of operator perturbation theory. This provides a ﬁrst step towards an in-depth complexity analysis of algorithms using KPCA as pre-processing, and towards taking into account the randomness of the obtained models (e.g. [3]). We proved a bound in which the complexity factor for estimating the eigenspace SD by its empirical counterpart depends only on the inverse gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. In addition to the previously cited works, we take into account the centering of the data and obtain comparable rates. In this work we assumed for simplicity of notation the eigenvalues to be simple. In the case the covariance operator C has nonzero eigenvalues with multiplicities m1 , m2 , . . . possibly larger than one, the analysis remains the same except for one point: we have to assume that the dimension D of the subspaces considered is of the form m1 + · · · + mr for a certain r. This could seem restrictive in comparison with the results obtained for estimating the sum of the ﬁrst D eigenvalues themselves [2] (which is linked to the reconstruction error in KPCA) where no such restriction appears. However, it should be clear that we need this restriction when considering D−eigenspaces themselves since the target space has to be unequivocally deﬁned, otherwise convergence cannot occur. Thus, it can happen in this special case that the reconstruction error converges while the projection space itself does not. Finally, a common point of the two analyses (over the spectrum and over the eigenspaces) lies in the fact that the bounds involve an inverse gap in the eigenvalues of the true covariance operator. Finally, how tight are these bounds and do they at least carry some correct qualitative information about the behavior of the eigenspaces? Asymptotic results (central limit Theorems) in [6, 4] always provide the correct goal to shoot for since they actually give the limit distributions of these quantities. They imply that there is still important ground to cover before bridging the gap between asymptotic and non-asymptotic. This of course opens directions for future work.

We give a short proof for the sake of n 1 completness. Cn − C = n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] with CX = ϕ(X) ⊗ ϕ(X)∗ = k(X, X) ≤ M . We can apply the bounded difference inequality to the variable Cn − C , so that with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , Cn − C ≤ E [ Cn − C ] + 2M Moreover, by Jensen’s inequality E [ Cn − C ] ≤ E n 1 simple calculations leads to E n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] 2 4M n . This concludes the proof of lemma 1. 1 n 2 n i=1 CXi 1 = nE 2 ξ 2n . 1 2 − E [CX ] , and CX − E [CX ] 2 ≤ Proof of Theorem 3. The variation of this proof with respect to Theorem 5.2 in [7] is (a) to work directly in a (inﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert space, requiring extra caution for some details and (b) obtaining an improved bound by considering D-eigenspaces at once. The key property of Hilbert-Schmidt operators allowing to work directly in a inﬁnite dimensional setting is that HS(H) is a both right and left ideal of Lc (H, H), the Banach space of all continuous linear operators of H endowed with the operator norm . op . Indeed, ∀ T ∈ HS(H), ∀S ∈ Lc (H, H), T S and ST belong to HS(H) with TS ≤ T S ST ≤ T and op S op . (4) The spectrum of an Hilbert-Schmidt operator T is denoted Λ(T ) and the sequence of eigenvalues in non-increasing order is denoted λ(T ) = (λ1 (T ) ≥ λ2 (T ) ≥ . . .) . In the following, P D (T ) denotes the orthogonal projector onto the D-eigenspace of T . The Hoffmann-Wielandt inequality in inﬁnite dimensional setting[1] yields that: λ(A) − λ(A + B) 2 ≤ B ≤ δD . 2 (5) implying in particular that ∀i > 0, |λi (A) − λi (A + B)| ≤ δD . 2 (6) Results found in [5] p.39 yield the formula P D (A) − P D (A + B) = − 1 2iπ γ (RA (z) − RA+B (z))dz ∈ Lc (H, H) . (7) where RA (z) = (A − z Id)−1 is the resolvent of A, provided that γ is a simple closed curve in C enclosing exactly the ﬁrst D eigenvalues of A and (A + B). Moreover, the same reference (p.60) states that for ξ in the complementary of Λ(A), RA (ξ) op = dist(ξ, Λ(A)) −1 . (8) The proof of the theorem now relies on the simple choice for the closed curve γ in (7), drawn in the picture below and consisting of three straight lines and a semi-circle of radius D L. For all L > δ2 , γ intersect neither the eigenspectrum of A (by equation (6)) nor the eigenspectrum of A + B. Moreover, the eigenvalues of A (resp. A + B) enclosed by γ are exactly λ1 (A), . . . , λD (A) (resp. λ1 (A + B), . . . , λD (A + B)). Moreover, for z ∈ γ, T (z) = RA (z) − RA+B (z) = −RA+B (z)BRA (z) belongs to HS(H) and depends continuously on z by (4). Consequently, P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 1 2π b a (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) |γ (t)|dt . N Let SN = n=0 (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z). RA+B (z) = (Id + RA (z)B)−1 RA (z) and, for z ∈ γ and L > δD , RA (z)B op ≤ RA (z) op B ≤ δD 1 ≤ , 2 dist(z, Λ(A)) 2 γ L L δD λ 0 D+1 δD λ2 λD λ1 δD δD δD 2 2 2 L . op imply that SN −→ RA+B (z) (uniformly for z ∈ γ). Using property (4), since B ∈ . HS(H), SN BRA (z) −→ RA+B (z)BRA (z) = RA+B (z) − RA (z) . Finally, RA (z) − RA+B (z) = (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z) n≥1 where the series converges in HS(H), uniformly in z ∈ γ. Using again property (4) and (8) implies B n (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) ≤ RA (γ(t)) n+1 B n ≤ op distn+1 (γ(t), Λ(A)) n≥1 Finally, since for L > δD , B ≤ δD 2 n≥1 ≤ dist(γ(t),Λ(A)) , 2 b B 1 |γ (t)|dt . 2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) π a dist Splitting the last integral into four parts according to the deﬁnition of the contour γ, we obtain P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 2arctan( δL ) 1 µ1 (A) − (µD (A) − δD ) π D |γ (t)|dt ≤ + +2 , dist2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) δD L L2 a and letting L goes to inﬁnity leads to the result. b Proof of Theorem 4.

We observe a rich variety of mechanisms for the phenomenon and analyze them based on the relative gain of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. We observe an average growth in the spatial extent of excitation and inhibition for low contrast, as predicted from phenomenological models.

<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Stephane Lafon, Ioannis Kevrekidis, Ronald R. Coifman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion based probabilistic interpretation of spectral clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms that use the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. Given the pairwise adjacency matrix of all points, we deﬁne a diffusion distance between any two data points and show that the low dimensional representation of the data by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the corresponding Markov matrix is optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, assuming that data points are random samples from a density p(x) = e−U (x) we identify these eigenvectors as discrete approximations of eigenfunctions of a Fokker-Planck operator in a potential 2U (x) with reﬂecting boundary conditions. Finally, applying known results regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the continuous Fokker-Planck operator, we provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the success of spectral clustering and dimensional reduction algorithms based on these ﬁrst few eigenvectors. This analysis elucidates, in terms of the characteristics of diffusion processes, many empirical ﬁndings regarding spectral clustering algorithms.

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning a quadratic Gaussian metric (Mahalanobis distance) for use in classiﬁcation tasks. Our method relies on the simple geometric intuition that a good metric is one under which points in the same class are simultaneously near each other and far from points in the other classes. We construct a convex optimization problem whose solution generates such a metric by trying to collapse all examples in the same class to a single point and push examples in other classes inﬁnitely far away. We show that when the metric we learn is used in simple classiﬁers, it yields substantial improvements over standard alternatives on a variety of problems. We also discuss how the learned metric may be used to obtain a compact low dimensional feature representation of the original input space, allowing more efﬁcient classiﬁcation with very little reduction in performance. 1 Supervised Learning of Metrics The problem of learning a distance measure (metric) over an input space is of fundamental importance in machine learning [10, 9], both supervised and unsupervised. When such measures are learned directly from the available data, they can be used to improve learning algorithms which rely on distance computations such as nearest neighbour classiﬁcation [5], supervised kernel machines (such as GPs or SVMs) and even unsupervised clustering algorithms [10]. Good similarity measures may also provide insight into the underlying structure of data (e.g. inter-protein distances), and may aid in building better data visualizations via embedding. In fact, there is a close link between distance learning and feature extraction since whenever we construct a feature ´Üµ for an input using a simple distance funcspace , we can measure distances between Ü½ Ü¾ ¾ tion (e.g. Euclidean) ´Ü½ µ ´Ü¾ µ℄ in feature space. Thus by ﬁxing , any feature extraction algorithm may be considered a metric learning method. Perhaps the simplest illustration of this approach is when the ´Üµ is a linear projection of Ü ¾ Ö so that ´Üµ Ï Ü. The Euclidean distance between ´Ü½ µ and ´Ü¾ µ is then the Mahalanobis distance ´Ü½ µ   ´Ü¾ µ ¾ ´Ü½   Ü¾ µÌ ´Ü½   Ü¾ µ, where Ï Ì Ï is a positive semideﬁnite matrix. Much of the recent work on metric learning has indeed focused on learning Mahalanobis distances, i.e. learning the matrix . This is also the goal of the current work. A common approach to learning metrics is to assume some knowledge in the form of equiv- alence relations, i.e. which points should be close and which should be far (without specifying their exact distances). In the classiﬁcation setting there is a natural equivalence relation, namely whether two points are in the same class or not. One of the classical statistical methods which uses this idea for the Mahalanobis distance is Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis (see e.g. [6]). Other more recent methods are [10, 9, 5] which seek to minimize various separation criteria between the classes under the new metric. In this work, we present a novel approach to learning such a metric. Our approach, the Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning algorithm (MCML), relies on the simple geometric intuition that if all points in the same class could be mapped into a single location in feature space and all points in other classes mapped to other locations, this would result in an ideal approximation of our equivalence relation. Our algorithm approximates this scenario via a stochastic selection rule, as in Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) [5]. However, unlike NCA, the optimization problem is convex and thus our method is completely speciﬁed by our objective function. Different initialization and optimization techniques may affect the speed of obtaining the solution but the ﬁnal solution itself is unique. We also show that our method approximates the local covariance structure of the data, as opposed to Linear Discriminant Analysis methods which use only global covariance structure. 2 The Approach of Collapsing Classes Given a set of Ò labeled examples ´Ü Ý µ, where Ü Ý ¾ ½ , we seek a space. We focus on Mahalanobis form metrics similarity measure between two points in ´Ü where Ü ´Ü µ ¾   Ü µÌ Ö and ´Ü  Ü µ (1) is a positive semideﬁnite (PSD) matrix. Intuitively, what we want from a good metric is that it makes elements of in the same class look close whereas those in different classes appear far. Our approach starts with the ideal case when this is true in the most optimistic sense: same class points are at zero distance, and different class points are inﬁnitely far. Alternatively this can be viewed as mapping Ü via a linear projection Ï Ü ( Ï Ì Ï ), such that all points in the same class are mapped into the same point. This intuition is related to the analysis of spectral clustering [8], where the ideal case analysis of the algorithm results in all same cluster points being mapped to a single point. To learn a metric which approximates the ideal geometric setup described above, we introduce, for each training point, a conditional distribution over other points (as in [5]). such that Speciﬁcally, for each Ü we deﬁne a conditional distribution over points Ô ´ µ ½ È       (2) If all points in the same class were mapped to a single point and inﬁnitely far from points in different classes, we would have the ideal “bi-level” distribution: Ô¼ ´ µ » Ò ½ ¼ Ý Ý Ý Ý (3) Furthermore, under very mild conditions, any set of points which achieves the above distribution must have the desired geometry. In particular, assume there are at least Ö · ¾ points in each class, where Ö rank ℄ (note that Ö Ö). Then Ô ´ µ Ô¼ ´ µ ( ) implies that under all points in the same class will be mapped to a single point, inﬁnitely far from other class points 1 . 1 Proof sketch: The inﬁnite separation between points of different classes follows simply from Thus it is natural to seek a matrix such that Ô ´ µ is as close as possible to Ô¼ ´ Since we are trying to match distributions, we minimize the KL divergence ÃÄ Ô¼ Ô℄: ÑÒ ÃÄ Ô¼ ´ µ Ô ´ µ℄ ¾ ÈË ×Ø µ. (4) The crucial property of this optimization problem is that it is convex in the matrix . To see this, ﬁrst note that any convex linear combination of feasible solutions « ¼ · ´½   «µ ½ s.t. ¼ « ½ is still a feasible solution, since the set of PSD matrices is convex. Next, we can show that ´ µ alway has a greater cost than either of the endpoints. To do this, we rewrite the objective function ´ µ ÃÄ Ô¼ ´ µ Ô´ µ℄ in the form 2 : È   ´ µ ÐÓ Ý Ý Ô´ µ · Ý ÐÓ Ý where we assumed for simplicity that classes are equi-probable, yielding a multiplicative constant. To see why ´ µ is convex, ﬁrst note that ´Ü   Ü µÌ ´Ü   Ü µ is linear is a ÐÓ ÜÔ function of afﬁne functions of in , and thus convex. The function ÐÓ and is therefore also convex (see [4], page 74). È 2.1 Convex Duality Since our optimization problem is convex, it has an equivalent convex dual. Speciﬁcally, the convex dual of Eq. (4) is the following entropy maximization problem: À Ô´ Ñ Ü Ô´ µ where Ú Ü ×Ø µ℄ Ô¼ ´ Ú ÚÌ ℄   µ Ô´ µ Ú ÚÌ ℄   Ü , À ¡℄ is the entropy function and we require È Ô´ µ ¼ ½ (5) . To prove this duality we start with the proposed dual and obtain the original problem in Equation 4 as its dual. Write the Lagrangian for the above problem (where is PSD) 3 Ä´Ô   ¬µ À ´Ô´ µµ   Ì Ö´ ´ Ô¼ ´ Ú ÚÌ ℄   Ô Ú ÚÌ ℄µµµ   ¬ ´ Ô´ µ   ½µ The dual function is deﬁned as ´ ¬ µ Ñ ÒÔ Ä´Ô ¬ µ.

Since ´ µ should be maximized, and we have the desired duality result (identifying with ). ¼ » µ ¼ when Ý Ý . For a given point Ü , all the points in its class satisfy Ô´ µ ½. Due to the structure of Ô´ µ in Equation 2, and because it is obeyed for all points in Ü¼ × class, this implies that all the points in that class are equidistant from each other. However, it is easy to show that the maximum number of different equidistant points (also known as the equilateral dimension [1]) in Ö dimensions is Ö · ½. Since by assumption we have at least Ö · ¾ points in the class of Ü , and maps points into Ö , it follows that all points are identical. 2 À Ô¼ ´ µ℄. Up to an additive constant 3 We consider the equivalent problem of minimizing minus entropy. Ô¼ ´  È 2.1.1 Relation to covariance based and embedding methods The convex dual derived above reveals an interesting relation to covariance based learning methods. The sufﬁcient statistics used by the algorithm are a set of Ò “spread” matrices. Each matrix is of the form Ô¼ ´ µ Ú ÚÌ ℄. The algorithm tries to ﬁnd a maximum entropy distribution which matches these matrices when averaged over the sample. This should be contrasted with the covariance matrices used in metric learning such as Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis. The latter uses the within and between class covariance matrices. The within covariance matrix is similar to the covariance matrix used here, but is calculated with respect to the class means, whereas here it is calculated separately for every point, and is centered on this point. This highlights the fact that MCML is not based on Gaussian assumptions where it is indeed sufﬁcient to calculate a single class covariance. Our method can also be thought of as a supervised version of the Stochastic Neighbour Embedding algorithm [7] in which the “target” distribution is Ô¼ (determined by the class labels) and the embedding points are not completely free but are instead constrained to be of the form Ï Ü . 2.2 Optimizing the Convex Objective Since the optimization problem in Equation 4 is convex, it is guaranteed to have only a single minimum which is the globally optimal solution4 . It can be optimized using any appropriate numerical convex optimization machinery; all methods will yield the same solution although some may be faster than others. One standard approach is to use interior point Newton methods. However, these algorithms require the Hessian to be calculated, which would require Ç´ µ resources, and could be prohibitive in our case. Instead, we have experimented with using a ﬁrst order gradient method, speciﬁcally the projected gradient approach as in [10]. At each iteration we take a small step in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function5, followed by a projection back onto the PSD cone. This projection is performed simply by taking the eigen-decomposition of and removing the components with negative eigenvalues. The algorithm is summarized below: Ý µ, Ò Input: Set of labeled data points ´Ü Output: PSD metric which optimally collapses classes. ½ Initialization: Initialize ¼ to some PSD matrix (randomly or using some initialization heuristic). Iterate: È Ø   ¯   ÔØ where   Ü Ô Ü ¯ Calculate the eigen-decomposition of È È Ù ÙÌ , then set Ø Ø Ø ¯ Set Ø·½ ´ µ ´ ´ ¼´ µ µ ´ µµ´ µ´Ü   Ü µÌ ·½ ·½ ·½ Ñ Ü´ ¼µÙ ÙÌ Of course in principle it is possible to optimize over the dual instead of the primal but in our case, if the training data consists of Ò points in Ö-dimensional space then the primal has only Ç´Ö¾ ¾µ variables while the dual has Ç´Ò¾ µ so it will almost always be more efﬁcient to operate on the primal directly. One exception to this case may be the kernel version (Section 4) where the primal is also of size Ç´Ò¾ µ. 4 When the data can be exactly collapsed into single class points, there will be multiple solutions at inﬁnity. However, this is very unlikely to happen in real data. 5 In the experiments, we used an Armijo like step size rule, as described in [3]. 3 Low Dimensional Projections for Feature Extraction The Mahalanobis distance under a metric can be interpreted as a linear projection of the original inputs by the square root of , followed by Euclidean distance in the projected space. Matrices which have less than full rank correspond to Mahalanobis distances based on low dimensional projections. Such metrics and the induced distances can be advantageous for several reasons [5]. First, low dimensional projections can substantially reduce the storage and computational requirements of a supervised method since only the projections of the training points must be stored and the manipulations at test time all occur in the lower dimensional feature space. Second, low dimensional projections re-represent the inputs, allowing for a supervised embedding or visualization of the original data. If we consider matrices with rank at most Õ , we can always represent them in the form Ï Ì Ï for some projection matrix Ï of size Õ ¢ Ö. This corresponds to projecting the original data into a Õ -dimensional space speciﬁed by the rows of Ï . However, rank constraints on a matrix are not convex [4], and hence the rank constrained problem is not convex and is likely to have local minima which make the optimization difﬁcult and illdeﬁned since it becomes sensitive to initial conditions and choice of optimization method. Luckily, there is an alternative approach to obtaining low dimensional projections, which does specify a unique solution by sequentially solving two globally tractable problems. This is the approach we follow here. First we solve for a (potentially) full rank metric using the convex program outlined above, and then obtain a low rank projection from it via spectral decomposition. This is done by diagonalizing into the form Ö Ú ÚÌ where ½ and Ú are the corre¾ Ö are eigenvalues of ½ sponding eigenvectors. To obtain a low rank projection we constrain the sum above to Õ include only the Õ terms corresponding to the Õ largest eigenvalues: Õ Ú ÚÌ . ½ The resulting projection is uniquely deﬁned (up to an irrelevant unitary transformation) as Ô Ì Ì Ï ´ ÚÕ ℄. ½ Õ µ Ú½ È È Ô In general, the projection returned by this approach is not guaranteed to be the same as the projection corresponding to minimizing our objective function subject to a rank constraint on unless the optimal metric is of rank less than or equal to Õ . However, as we show in the experimental results, it is often the case that for practical problems the optimal has an eigen-spectrum which is rapidly decaying, so that many of its eigenvalues are indeed very small, suggesting the low rank solution will be close to optimal. 4 Learning Metrics with Kernels It is interesting to consider the case where Ü are mapped into a high dimensional feature space ´Ü µ and a Mahalanobis distance is sought in this space. We focus on the case where dot products in the feature space may be expressed via a kernel function, such that ´Ü µ ¡ ´Ü µ ´Ü Ü µ for some kernel . We now show how our method can be changed to accommodate this setting, so that optimization depends only on dot products. Consider the regularized target function: Ê ´ µ ÃÄ Ô¼ ´ µ Ô´ µ℄ · Ì Ö´ µ (6) where the regularizing factor is equivalent to the Frobenius norm of the projection matrix Ï since Ì Ö´ µ Ï ¾. Deriving w.r.t. Ï we obtain Ï Í , where Í is some matrix which speciﬁes Ï as a linear combination of sample points, and the Ø row of the matrix Ì Í Ì Í . Deﬁning the PSD matrix is Ü . Thus is given by Í Ì Í , we can recast our optimization as looking for a PSD matrix , where the Mahalanobis distance is ´Ü   Ü µÌ Ì ´Ü   Ü µ ´   µÌ ´   µ, where we deﬁne Ü. This is exactly our original distance, with Ü replaced by , which depends only on dot products in space. The regularization term also depends solely on the dot products since Ì Ö´ µ Ì Ö´ Ì µ Ì Ö´ Ì µ Ì Ö´Ã µ, where Ã is the kernel matrix given Ì . Note that the trace is a linear function of , keeping the problem convex. by Ã Thus, as long as dot products can be represented via kernels, the optimization can be carried out without explicitly using the high dimensional space. To obtain a low dimensional solution, we follow the approach in Section 3: obtain a decomposition Î Ì Î 6 , and take the projection matrix to be the ﬁrst Õ rows of ¼ Î . Ì , and thus Ì Ì As a ﬁrst step, we calculate a matrix such that . Since is a correlation matrix for the rows of it can be shown (as in Kernel PCA) that its (left) eigenvectors are linear combinations of the rows of . Denoting by Î « the eigenvector matrix, we obtain, after some algebra, that « Ã Ì «. We conclude that « is an eigenvector of the matrix Ã Ì . Denote by « the matrix whose rows are orthonormal eigenvectors of Ã Ì . Then Î can be shown to be orthonormal if we set  ¼ « . The ﬁnal projection will then be ¼ Î Ü « . Low dimensional Î projections will be obtained by keeping only the ﬁrst Õ components of this projection. 5 Experimental Results We compared our method to several metric learning algorithms on a supervised classiﬁcation task. Training data was ﬁrst used to learn a metric over the input space. Then this metric was used in a 1-nearest-neighbor algorithm to classify a test set. The datasets we investigated were taken from the UCI repository and have been used previously in evaluating supervised methods for metric learning [10, 5]. To these we added the USPS handwritten digits (downsampled to 8x8 pixels) and the YALE faces [2] (downsampled to 31x22). The algorithms used in the comparative evaluation were ¯ ¯ ¯ Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which projects on the eigenvectors   of ËÏ½ Ë where ËÏ Ë are the within and between class covariance matrices. The method of Xing et al [10] which minimizes the mean within class distance, while keeping the mean between class distance larger than one. Principal Component Analysis (PCA). There are several possibilities for scaling the PCA projections. We tested several, and report results of the empirically superior one (PCAW), which scales the projection components so that the covariance matrix after projection is the identity. PCAW often performs poorly on high dimensions, but globally outperforms all other variants. We also evaluated the kernel version of MCML with an RBF kernel (denoted by KMCML)7 . Since all methods allow projections to lower dimensions we compared performance for different projection dimensions 8 . The out-of sample performance results (based on 40 random splits of the data taking 70% for training and 30% for testing9 ) are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that when used in a simple nearest-neighbour classiﬁer, the metric learned by MCML almost always performs as well as, or signiﬁcantly better than those learned by all other methods, across most dimensions. Furthermore, the kernel version of MCML outperforms the linear one on most datasets. Where Î is orthonormal, and the eigenvalues in are sorted in decreasing order. The regularization parameter and the width of the RBF kernel were chosen using 5 fold crossvalidation. KMCML was only evaluated for datasets with less than 1000 training points. 8 To obtain low dimensional mappings we used the approach outlined in Section 3. 9 Except for the larger datasets where 1000 random samples were used for training. 6 7 Wine 0.2 0.1 2 4 6 8 10 Projection Dimension 0.5 Error Rate Error Rate Balance Ion MCML PCAW LDA XING KMCML 0.3 0.25 0.4 0.2 0.15 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.05 10 20 30 Projection Dimension Soybean−small 0.1 1 2 3 Protein 4 Spam 0.6 0.4 0.25 0.5 0.4 0 5 10 15 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.15 20 5 10 Yale7 15 20 0.1 10 20 30 40 50 40 50 Digits Housing 0.6 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.35 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.25 10 20 30 40 50 5 10 15 10 20 30 Figure 1: Classiﬁcation error rate on several UCI datasets, USPS digits and YALE faces, for different projection dimensions.

They also have the added advantage of obtaining projections to all dimensions using one optimization run. Below, we also compare the MCML results to the results of two non-convex procedures. The ﬁrst is the Non Convex variant of MCML (NMCML): The objective function of MCML can be optimized w.r.t the projection matrix Ï , where Ï Ì Ï . Although this is no longer a convex problem, it is not constrained and is thus easier to optimize. The second non convex method is Neighbourhood Components Analysis (NCA) [5], which attempts to directly minimize the error incurred by a nearest neighbor classiﬁer. For both methods we optimized the matrix Ï by restarting the optimization separately for each size of Ï . Minimization was performed using a conjugate gradient algorithm, initialized by LDA or randomly. Figure 2 shows results on a subset of the UCI datasets. It can be seen that the performance of NMCML is similar to that of MCML, although it is less stable, possibly due to local minima, and both methods usually outperform NCA. The inset in each ﬁgure shows the spectrum of the MCML matrix , revealing that it often drops quickly after a few dimensions. This illustrates the effectiveness of our two stage optimization procedure, and suggests its low dimensional solutions are close to optimal. 6 Discussion and Extensions We have presented an algorithm for learning maximally collapsing metrics (MCML), based on the intuition of collapsing classes into single points.

However, if points belonging to a single class appear in several disconnected clusters in input (or feature) space, it is unlikely that MCML could collapse the class into a single point. It is possible that using a mixture of distributions, an EM-like algorithm can be constructed to accommodate this scenario. The method can also be used to learn low dimensional projections of the input space. We showed that it performs well, even across a range of projection dimensions, and consistently outperforms existing methods. Finally, we have shown how the method can be extended to projections in high dimensional feature spaces using the kernel trick. The resulting nonlinear method was shown to improve classiﬁcation results over the linear version. References Ò [1] N. Alon and P. Pudlak. Equilateral sets in ÐÔ . Geom. Funct. Anal., 13(3), 2003.

<p>Author: Laurent Zwald, Gilles Blanchard</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a non-asymptotic statistical analysis of Kernel-PCA with a focus different from the one proposed in previous work on this topic. Here instead of considering the reconstruction error of KPCA we are interested in approximation error bounds for the eigenspaces themselves. We prove an upper bound depending on the spacing between eigenvalues but not on the dimensionality of the eigenspace. As a consequence this allows to infer stability results for these estimated spaces. 1 Introduction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA for short in the sequel) is a widely used tool for data dimensionality reduction. It consists in ﬁnding the most relevant lower-dimension projection of some data in the sense that the projection should keep as much of the variance of the original data as possible. If the target dimensionality of the projected data is ﬁxed in advance, say D – an assumption that we will make throughout the present paper – the solution of this problem is obtained by considering the projection on the span SD of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Here by ’ﬁrst D eigenvectors’ we mean eigenvectors associated to the D largest eigenvalues counted with multiplicity; hereafter with some abuse the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors will be called “D-eigenspace” for short when there is no risk of confusion. The introduction of the ’Kernel trick’ has allowed to extend this methodology to data mapped in a kernel feature space, then called KPCA [8]. The interest of this extension is that, while still linear in feature space, it gives rise to nonlinear interpretation in original space – vectors in the kernel feature space can be interpreted as nonlinear functions on the original space. For PCA as well as KPCA, the true covariance matrix (resp. covariance operator) is not known and has to be estimated from the available data, an procedure which in the case of ¨ Kernel spaces is linked to the so-called Nystrom approximation [13]. The subspace given as an output is then obtained as D-eigenspace SD of the empirical covariance matrix or operator. An interesting question from a statistical or learning theoretical point of view is then, how reliable this estimate is. This question has already been studied [10, 2] from the point of view of the reconstruction error of the estimated subspace. What this means is that (assuming the data is centered in Kernel space for simplicity) the average reconstruction error (square norm of the distance to the projection) of SD converges to the (optimal) reconstruction error of SD and that bounds are known about the rate of convergence. However, this does not tell us much about the convergence of SD to SD – since two very different subspaces can have a very similar reconstruction error, in particular when some eigenvalues are very close to each other (the gap between the eigenvalues will actually appear as a central point of the analysis to come). In the present work, we set to study the behavior of these D-eigenspaces themselves: we provide ﬁnite sample bounds describing the closeness of the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator to the true one. There are several broad motivations for this analysis. First, the reconstruction error alone is a valid criterion only if one really plans to perform dimensionality reduction of the data and stop there. However, PCA is often used merely as a preprocessing step and the projected data is then submitted to further processing (which could be classiﬁcation, regression or something else). In particular for KPCA, the projection subspace in the kernel space can be interpreted as a subspace of functions on the original space; one then expects these functions to be relevant for the data at hand and for some further task (see e.g. [3]). In these cases, if we want to analyze the full procedure (from a learning theoretical sense), it is desirable to have a more precise information on the selected subspace than just its reconstruction error. In particular, from a learning complexity point of view, it is important to ensure that functions used for learning stay in a set of limited complexity, which is ensured if the selected subspace is stable (which is a consequence of its convergence). The approach we use here is based on perturbation bounds and we essentially walk in the steps pioneered by Kolchinskii and Gin´ [7] (see also [4]) using tools of operator perturbae tion theory [5]. Similar methods have been used to prove consistency of spectral clustering [12, 11]. An important difference here is that we want to study directly the convergence of the whole subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors instead of the separate convergence of the individual eigenvectors; in particular we are interested in how D acts as a complexity parameter. The important point in our main result is that it does not: only the gap between the D-th and the (D + 1)-th eigenvalue comes into account. This means that there in no increase in complexity (as far as this bound is concerned: of course we cannot exclude that better bounds can be obtained in the future) between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone or the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Our contribution in the present work is thus • to adapt the operator perturbation result of [7] to D-eigenspaces. • to get non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation error of Kernel-PCA eigenspaces thanks to the previous tool. In section 2 we introduce shortly the notation, explain the main ingredients used and obtain a ﬁrst bound based on controlling separately the ﬁrst D eigenvectors, and depending on the dimension D. In section 3 we explain why the ﬁrst bound is actually suboptimal and derive an improved bound as a consequence of an operator perturbation result that is more adapted to our needs and deals directly with the D-eigenspace as a whole. Section 4 concludes and discusses the obtained results. Mathematical proofs are found in the appendix. 2 First result. Notation. The interest variable X takes its values in some measurable space X , following the distribution P . We consider KPCA and are therefore primarily interested in the mapping of X into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H with kernel function k through the feature mapping ϕ(x) = k(x, ·). The objective of the kernel PCA procedure is to recover a D-dimensional subspace SD of H such that the projection of ϕ(X) on SD has maximum averaged squared norm. All operators considered in what follows are Hilbert-Schmidt and the norm considered for these operators will be the Hilbert-Schmidt norm unless precised otherwise. Furthermore we only consider symmetric nonnegative operators, so that they can be diagonalized and have a discrete spectrum. Let C denote the covariance operator of variable ϕ(X). To simplify notation we assume that nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . of C are all simple (This is for convenience only. In the conclusion we discuss what changes have to be made if this is not the case). Let φ1 , φ2 , . . . be the associated eigenvectors. It is well-known that the optimal D-dimensional reconstruction space is SD = span{φ1 , . . . , φD }. The KPCA procedure approximates this objective by considering the empirical covariance operator, denoted Cn , and the subspace SD spanned by its ﬁrst D eigenvectors. We denote PSD , PSD the orthogonal projectors on b these spaces. A ﬁrst bound. Broadly speaking, the main steps required to obtain the type of result we are interested in are 1. A non-asympotic bound on the (Hilbert-Schmidt) norm of the difference between the empirical and the true covariance operators; 2. An operator perturbation result bounding the difference between spectral projectors of two operators by the norm of their difference. The combination of these two steps leads to our goal. The ﬁrst step consists in the following Lemma coming from [9]: Lemma 1 (Corollary 5 of [9]) Supposing that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M , with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , 2M ξ Cn − C ≤ √ 1+ . 2 n As for the second step, [7] provides the following perturbation bound (see also e.g. [12]): Theorem 2 (Simpliﬁed Version of [7], Theorem 5.2 ) Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple positive eigenvalues λ 1 > 1 λ2 > . . . For an integer r such that λr > 0, let δr = δr ∧ δr−1 where δr = 2 (λr − λr+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that B < δr /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator with simple nonzero eigenvalues. Let Pr (A) (resp. Pr (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the r-th eigenvector of A (resp. (A + B)). Then, these projectors satisfy: Pr (A) − Pr (A + B) ≤ 2 B δr . Remark about the Approximation Error of the Eigenvectors: let us recall that a control over the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the projections onto eigenspaces imply a control on the approximation errors of the eigenvectors themselves. Indeed, let φr , ψr denote the (normalized) r-th eigenvectors of the operators above with signs chosen so that φ r , ψr > 0. Then P φ r − P ψr 2 2 = 2(1 − φr , ψr ) ≥ 2(1 − φr , ψr ) = φr − ψr 2 . Now, the orthogonal projector on the direct sum of the ﬁrst D eigenspaces is the sum D r=1 Pr . Using the triangle inequality, and combining Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, we conclude that with probability at least 1 − e−ξ the following holds: D P SD − P SD ≤ b −1 δr r=1 4M √ n 1+ ξ 2 , 2 provided that n ≥ 16M 2 1 + ξ 2 −2 (sup1≤r≤D δr ) . The disadvantage of this bound is that we are penalized on the one hand by the (inverse) gaps between the eigenvalues, and on the other by the dimension D (because we have to sum the inverse gaps from 1 to D). In the next section we improve the operator perturbation bound to get an improved result where only the gap δD enters into account. 3 Improved Result. We ﬁrst prove the following variant on the operator perturbation property which better corresponds to our needs by taking directly into account the projection on the ﬁrst D eigenvectors at once. The proof uses the same kind of techniques as in [7]. Theorem 3 Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . Let D > 0 be an integer such that λD > 0, δD = 1 (λD − λD+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that 2 B < δD /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator. Let P D (A) (resp. P D (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors A (resp. (A + B)). Then these satisfy: P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ B . δD (1) This then gives rise to our main result on KPCA: Theorem 4 Assume that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M . Let SD , SD be the subspaces spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of C, resp. Cn deﬁned earlier. Denoting λ1 > λ2 > . . . the 1 eigenvalues of C, if D > 0 is such that λD > 0, put δD = 2 (λD − λD+1 ) and BD = 2M δD 1+ ξ 2 . 2 Then provided that n ≥ BD , the following bound holds with probability at least 1 − e−ξ : BD P SD − P SD ≤ √ . b n (2) This entails in particular ⊥ SD ⊂ g + h, g ∈ SD , h ∈ SD , h 1 Hk ≤ 2BD n− 2 g Hk . (3) The important point here is that the approximation error now only depends on D through the (inverse) gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. Note that using the results of section 2, we would have obtained exactly the same bound for estimating the D-th eigenvector only – or even a worse bound since δD = δD ∧ δD−1 appears in this case. Thus, at least from the point of view of this technique (which could still yield suboptimal bounds), there is no increase of complexity between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone and estimating the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Note that the inclusion (3) can be interpreted geometrically by saying that for any vector in SD , the √ tangent of the angle between this vector and its projection on SD is upper bounded by BD / n, which we can interpret as a stability property. Comment about the Centered Case. In the actual (K)PCA procedure, the data is actually ﬁrst empirically recentered, so that one has to consider the centered covariance operator C and its empirical counterpart C n . A result similar to Theorem 4 also holds in this case (up to some additional constant factors). Indeed, a result similar to Lemma 1 holds for the recentered operators [2]. Combined again with Theorem 3, this allows to come to similar conclusions for the “true” centered KPCA. 4 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper, ﬁnite sample size conﬁdence bounds of the eigenspaces of Kernel-PCA (the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator) are provided using tools of operator perturbation theory. This provides a ﬁrst step towards an in-depth complexity analysis of algorithms using KPCA as pre-processing, and towards taking into account the randomness of the obtained models (e.g. [3]). We proved a bound in which the complexity factor for estimating the eigenspace SD by its empirical counterpart depends only on the inverse gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. In addition to the previously cited works, we take into account the centering of the data and obtain comparable rates. In this work we assumed for simplicity of notation the eigenvalues to be simple. In the case the covariance operator C has nonzero eigenvalues with multiplicities m1 , m2 , . . . possibly larger than one, the analysis remains the same except for one point: we have to assume that the dimension D of the subspaces considered is of the form m1 + · · · + mr for a certain r. This could seem restrictive in comparison with the results obtained for estimating the sum of the ﬁrst D eigenvalues themselves [2] (which is linked to the reconstruction error in KPCA) where no such restriction appears. However, it should be clear that we need this restriction when considering D−eigenspaces themselves since the target space has to be unequivocally deﬁned, otherwise convergence cannot occur. Thus, it can happen in this special case that the reconstruction error converges while the projection space itself does not. Finally, a common point of the two analyses (over the spectrum and over the eigenspaces) lies in the fact that the bounds involve an inverse gap in the eigenvalues of the true covariance operator. Finally, how tight are these bounds and do they at least carry some correct qualitative information about the behavior of the eigenspaces? Asymptotic results (central limit Theorems) in [6, 4] always provide the correct goal to shoot for since they actually give the limit distributions of these quantities. They imply that there is still important ground to cover before bridging the gap between asymptotic and non-asymptotic. This of course opens directions for future work.

We give a short proof for the sake of n 1 completness. Cn − C = n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] with CX = ϕ(X) ⊗ ϕ(X)∗ = k(X, X) ≤ M . We can apply the bounded difference inequality to the variable Cn − C , so that with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , Cn − C ≤ E [ Cn − C ] + 2M Moreover, by Jensen’s inequality E [ Cn − C ] ≤ E n 1 simple calculations leads to E n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] 2 4M n . This concludes the proof of lemma 1. 1 n 2 n i=1 CXi 1 = nE 2 ξ 2n . 1 2 − E [CX ] , and CX − E [CX ] 2 ≤ Proof of Theorem 3. The variation of this proof with respect to Theorem 5.2 in [7] is (a) to work directly in a (inﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert space, requiring extra caution for some details and (b) obtaining an improved bound by considering D-eigenspaces at once. The key property of Hilbert-Schmidt operators allowing to work directly in a inﬁnite dimensional setting is that HS(H) is a both right and left ideal of Lc (H, H), the Banach space of all continuous linear operators of H endowed with the operator norm . op . Indeed, ∀ T ∈ HS(H), ∀S ∈ Lc (H, H), T S and ST belong to HS(H) with TS ≤ T S ST ≤ T and op S op . (4) The spectrum of an Hilbert-Schmidt operator T is denoted Λ(T ) and the sequence of eigenvalues in non-increasing order is denoted λ(T ) = (λ1 (T ) ≥ λ2 (T ) ≥ . . .) . In the following, P D (T ) denotes the orthogonal projector onto the D-eigenspace of T . The Hoffmann-Wielandt inequality in inﬁnite dimensional setting[1] yields that: λ(A) − λ(A + B) 2 ≤ B ≤ δD . 2 (5) implying in particular that ∀i > 0, |λi (A) − λi (A + B)| ≤ δD . 2 (6) Results found in [5] p.39 yield the formula P D (A) − P D (A + B) = − 1 2iπ γ (RA (z) − RA+B (z))dz ∈ Lc (H, H) . (7) where RA (z) = (A − z Id)−1 is the resolvent of A, provided that γ is a simple closed curve in C enclosing exactly the ﬁrst D eigenvalues of A and (A + B). Moreover, the same reference (p.60) states that for ξ in the complementary of Λ(A), RA (ξ) op = dist(ξ, Λ(A)) −1 . (8) The proof of the theorem now relies on the simple choice for the closed curve γ in (7), drawn in the picture below and consisting of three straight lines and a semi-circle of radius D L. For all L > δ2 , γ intersect neither the eigenspectrum of A (by equation (6)) nor the eigenspectrum of A + B. Moreover, the eigenvalues of A (resp. A + B) enclosed by γ are exactly λ1 (A), . . . , λD (A) (resp. λ1 (A + B), . . . , λD (A + B)). Moreover, for z ∈ γ, T (z) = RA (z) − RA+B (z) = −RA+B (z)BRA (z) belongs to HS(H) and depends continuously on z by (4). Consequently, P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 1 2π b a (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) |γ (t)|dt . N Let SN = n=0 (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z). RA+B (z) = (Id + RA (z)B)−1 RA (z) and, for z ∈ γ and L > δD , RA (z)B op ≤ RA (z) op B ≤ δD 1 ≤ , 2 dist(z, Λ(A)) 2 γ L L δD λ 0 D+1 δD λ2 λD λ1 δD δD δD 2 2 2 L . op imply that SN −→ RA+B (z) (uniformly for z ∈ γ). Using property (4), since B ∈ . HS(H), SN BRA (z) −→ RA+B (z)BRA (z) = RA+B (z) − RA (z) . Finally, RA (z) − RA+B (z) = (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z) n≥1 where the series converges in HS(H), uniformly in z ∈ γ. Using again property (4) and (8) implies B n (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) ≤ RA (γ(t)) n+1 B n ≤ op distn+1 (γ(t), Λ(A)) n≥1 Finally, since for L > δD , B ≤ δD 2 n≥1 ≤ dist(γ(t),Λ(A)) , 2 b B 1 |γ (t)|dt . 2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) π a dist Splitting the last integral into four parts according to the deﬁnition of the contour γ, we obtain P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 2arctan( δL ) 1 µ1 (A) − (µD (A) − δD ) π D |γ (t)|dt ≤ + +2 , dist2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) δD L L2 a and letting L goes to inﬁnity leads to the result. b Proof of Theorem 4.

This decomposition, based on a recursive pruning of the least connected vertices, allows to disentangle the hierarchical structure of networks by progressively focusing on their central cores. By using this strategy we develop a general visualization algorithm that can be used to compare the structural properties of various networks and highlight their hierarchical structure. The low computational complexity of the algorithm, O(n + e), where n is the size of the network, and e is the number of edges, makes it suitable for the visualization of very large sparse networks.

<p>Author: Laurent Zwald, Gilles Blanchard</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a non-asymptotic statistical analysis of Kernel-PCA with a focus different from the one proposed in previous work on this topic. Here instead of considering the reconstruction error of KPCA we are interested in approximation error bounds for the eigenspaces themselves. We prove an upper bound depending on the spacing between eigenvalues but not on the dimensionality of the eigenspace. As a consequence this allows to infer stability results for these estimated spaces. 1 Introduction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA for short in the sequel) is a widely used tool for data dimensionality reduction. It consists in ﬁnding the most relevant lower-dimension projection of some data in the sense that the projection should keep as much of the variance of the original data as possible. If the target dimensionality of the projected data is ﬁxed in advance, say D – an assumption that we will make throughout the present paper – the solution of this problem is obtained by considering the projection on the span SD of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Here by ’ﬁrst D eigenvectors’ we mean eigenvectors associated to the D largest eigenvalues counted with multiplicity; hereafter with some abuse the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors will be called “D-eigenspace” for short when there is no risk of confusion. The introduction of the ’Kernel trick’ has allowed to extend this methodology to data mapped in a kernel feature space, then called KPCA [8]. The interest of this extension is that, while still linear in feature space, it gives rise to nonlinear interpretation in original space – vectors in the kernel feature space can be interpreted as nonlinear functions on the original space. For PCA as well as KPCA, the true covariance matrix (resp. covariance operator) is not known and has to be estimated from the available data, an procedure which in the case of ¨ Kernel spaces is linked to the so-called Nystrom approximation [13]. The subspace given as an output is then obtained as D-eigenspace SD of the empirical covariance matrix or operator. An interesting question from a statistical or learning theoretical point of view is then, how reliable this estimate is. This question has already been studied [10, 2] from the point of view of the reconstruction error of the estimated subspace. What this means is that (assuming the data is centered in Kernel space for simplicity) the average reconstruction error (square norm of the distance to the projection) of SD converges to the (optimal) reconstruction error of SD and that bounds are known about the rate of convergence. However, this does not tell us much about the convergence of SD to SD – since two very different subspaces can have a very similar reconstruction error, in particular when some eigenvalues are very close to each other (the gap between the eigenvalues will actually appear as a central point of the analysis to come). In the present work, we set to study the behavior of these D-eigenspaces themselves: we provide ﬁnite sample bounds describing the closeness of the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator to the true one. There are several broad motivations for this analysis. First, the reconstruction error alone is a valid criterion only if one really plans to perform dimensionality reduction of the data and stop there. However, PCA is often used merely as a preprocessing step and the projected data is then submitted to further processing (which could be classiﬁcation, regression or something else). In particular for KPCA, the projection subspace in the kernel space can be interpreted as a subspace of functions on the original space; one then expects these functions to be relevant for the data at hand and for some further task (see e.g. [3]). In these cases, if we want to analyze the full procedure (from a learning theoretical sense), it is desirable to have a more precise information on the selected subspace than just its reconstruction error. In particular, from a learning complexity point of view, it is important to ensure that functions used for learning stay in a set of limited complexity, which is ensured if the selected subspace is stable (which is a consequence of its convergence). The approach we use here is based on perturbation bounds and we essentially walk in the steps pioneered by Kolchinskii and Gin´ [7] (see also [4]) using tools of operator perturbae tion theory [5]. Similar methods have been used to prove consistency of spectral clustering [12, 11]. An important difference here is that we want to study directly the convergence of the whole subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors instead of the separate convergence of the individual eigenvectors; in particular we are interested in how D acts as a complexity parameter. The important point in our main result is that it does not: only the gap between the D-th and the (D + 1)-th eigenvalue comes into account. This means that there in no increase in complexity (as far as this bound is concerned: of course we cannot exclude that better bounds can be obtained in the future) between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone or the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Our contribution in the present work is thus • to adapt the operator perturbation result of [7] to D-eigenspaces. • to get non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation error of Kernel-PCA eigenspaces thanks to the previous tool. In section 2 we introduce shortly the notation, explain the main ingredients used and obtain a ﬁrst bound based on controlling separately the ﬁrst D eigenvectors, and depending on the dimension D. In section 3 we explain why the ﬁrst bound is actually suboptimal and derive an improved bound as a consequence of an operator perturbation result that is more adapted to our needs and deals directly with the D-eigenspace as a whole. Section 4 concludes and discusses the obtained results. Mathematical proofs are found in the appendix. 2 First result. Notation. The interest variable X takes its values in some measurable space X , following the distribution P . We consider KPCA and are therefore primarily interested in the mapping of X into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H with kernel function k through the feature mapping ϕ(x) = k(x, ·). The objective of the kernel PCA procedure is to recover a D-dimensional subspace SD of H such that the projection of ϕ(X) on SD has maximum averaged squared norm. All operators considered in what follows are Hilbert-Schmidt and the norm considered for these operators will be the Hilbert-Schmidt norm unless precised otherwise. Furthermore we only consider symmetric nonnegative operators, so that they can be diagonalized and have a discrete spectrum. Let C denote the covariance operator of variable ϕ(X). To simplify notation we assume that nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . of C are all simple (This is for convenience only. In the conclusion we discuss what changes have to be made if this is not the case). Let φ1 , φ2 , . . . be the associated eigenvectors. It is well-known that the optimal D-dimensional reconstruction space is SD = span{φ1 , . . . , φD }. The KPCA procedure approximates this objective by considering the empirical covariance operator, denoted Cn , and the subspace SD spanned by its ﬁrst D eigenvectors. We denote PSD , PSD the orthogonal projectors on b these spaces. A ﬁrst bound. Broadly speaking, the main steps required to obtain the type of result we are interested in are 1. A non-asympotic bound on the (Hilbert-Schmidt) norm of the difference between the empirical and the true covariance operators; 2. An operator perturbation result bounding the difference between spectral projectors of two operators by the norm of their difference. The combination of these two steps leads to our goal. The ﬁrst step consists in the following Lemma coming from [9]: Lemma 1 (Corollary 5 of [9]) Supposing that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M , with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , 2M ξ Cn − C ≤ √ 1+ . 2 n As for the second step, [7] provides the following perturbation bound (see also e.g. [12]): Theorem 2 (Simpliﬁed Version of [7], Theorem 5.2 ) Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple positive eigenvalues λ 1 > 1 λ2 > . . . For an integer r such that λr > 0, let δr = δr ∧ δr−1 where δr = 2 (λr − λr+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that B < δr /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator with simple nonzero eigenvalues. Let Pr (A) (resp. Pr (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the r-th eigenvector of A (resp. (A + B)). Then, these projectors satisfy: Pr (A) − Pr (A + B) ≤ 2 B δr . Remark about the Approximation Error of the Eigenvectors: let us recall that a control over the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the projections onto eigenspaces imply a control on the approximation errors of the eigenvectors themselves. Indeed, let φr , ψr denote the (normalized) r-th eigenvectors of the operators above with signs chosen so that φ r , ψr > 0. Then P φ r − P ψr 2 2 = 2(1 − φr , ψr ) ≥ 2(1 − φr , ψr ) = φr − ψr 2 . Now, the orthogonal projector on the direct sum of the ﬁrst D eigenspaces is the sum D r=1 Pr . Using the triangle inequality, and combining Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, we conclude that with probability at least 1 − e−ξ the following holds: D P SD − P SD ≤ b −1 δr r=1 4M √ n 1+ ξ 2 , 2 provided that n ≥ 16M 2 1 + ξ 2 −2 (sup1≤r≤D δr ) . The disadvantage of this bound is that we are penalized on the one hand by the (inverse) gaps between the eigenvalues, and on the other by the dimension D (because we have to sum the inverse gaps from 1 to D). In the next section we improve the operator perturbation bound to get an improved result where only the gap δD enters into account. 3 Improved Result. We ﬁrst prove the following variant on the operator perturbation property which better corresponds to our needs by taking directly into account the projection on the ﬁrst D eigenvectors at once. The proof uses the same kind of techniques as in [7]. Theorem 3 Let A be a symmetric positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator of the Hilbert space H with simple nonzero eigenvalues λ1 > λ2 > . . . Let D > 0 be an integer such that λD > 0, δD = 1 (λD − λD+1 ). Let B ∈ HS(H) be another symmetric operator such that 2 B < δD /2 and (A + B) is still a positive operator. Let P D (A) (resp. P D (A + B)) denote the orthogonal projector onto the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors A (resp. (A + B)). Then these satisfy: P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ B . δD (1) This then gives rise to our main result on KPCA: Theorem 4 Assume that supx∈X k(x, x) ≤ M . Let SD , SD be the subspaces spanned by the ﬁrst D eigenvectors of C, resp. Cn deﬁned earlier. Denoting λ1 > λ2 > . . . the 1 eigenvalues of C, if D > 0 is such that λD > 0, put δD = 2 (λD − λD+1 ) and BD = 2M δD 1+ ξ 2 . 2 Then provided that n ≥ BD , the following bound holds with probability at least 1 − e−ξ : BD P SD − P SD ≤ √ . b n (2) This entails in particular ⊥ SD ⊂ g + h, g ∈ SD , h ∈ SD , h 1 Hk ≤ 2BD n− 2 g Hk . (3) The important point here is that the approximation error now only depends on D through the (inverse) gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. Note that using the results of section 2, we would have obtained exactly the same bound for estimating the D-th eigenvector only – or even a worse bound since δD = δD ∧ δD−1 appears in this case. Thus, at least from the point of view of this technique (which could still yield suboptimal bounds), there is no increase of complexity between estimating the D-th eigenvector alone and estimating the span of the ﬁrst D eigenvectors. Note that the inclusion (3) can be interpreted geometrically by saying that for any vector in SD , the √ tangent of the angle between this vector and its projection on SD is upper bounded by BD / n, which we can interpret as a stability property. Comment about the Centered Case. In the actual (K)PCA procedure, the data is actually ﬁrst empirically recentered, so that one has to consider the centered covariance operator C and its empirical counterpart C n . A result similar to Theorem 4 also holds in this case (up to some additional constant factors). Indeed, a result similar to Lemma 1 holds for the recentered operators [2]. Combined again with Theorem 3, this allows to come to similar conclusions for the “true” centered KPCA. 4 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper, ﬁnite sample size conﬁdence bounds of the eigenspaces of Kernel-PCA (the D-eigenspaces of the empirical covariance operator) are provided using tools of operator perturbation theory. This provides a ﬁrst step towards an in-depth complexity analysis of algorithms using KPCA as pre-processing, and towards taking into account the randomness of the obtained models (e.g. [3]). We proved a bound in which the complexity factor for estimating the eigenspace SD by its empirical counterpart depends only on the inverse gap between the D-th and (D + 1)-th eigenvalues. In addition to the previously cited works, we take into account the centering of the data and obtain comparable rates. In this work we assumed for simplicity of notation the eigenvalues to be simple. In the case the covariance operator C has nonzero eigenvalues with multiplicities m1 , m2 , . . . possibly larger than one, the analysis remains the same except for one point: we have to assume that the dimension D of the subspaces considered is of the form m1 + · · · + mr for a certain r. This could seem restrictive in comparison with the results obtained for estimating the sum of the ﬁrst D eigenvalues themselves [2] (which is linked to the reconstruction error in KPCA) where no such restriction appears. However, it should be clear that we need this restriction when considering D−eigenspaces themselves since the target space has to be unequivocally deﬁned, otherwise convergence cannot occur. Thus, it can happen in this special case that the reconstruction error converges while the projection space itself does not. Finally, a common point of the two analyses (over the spectrum and over the eigenspaces) lies in the fact that the bounds involve an inverse gap in the eigenvalues of the true covariance operator. Finally, how tight are these bounds and do they at least carry some correct qualitative information about the behavior of the eigenspaces? Asymptotic results (central limit Theorems) in [6, 4] always provide the correct goal to shoot for since they actually give the limit distributions of these quantities. They imply that there is still important ground to cover before bridging the gap between asymptotic and non-asymptotic. This of course opens directions for future work.

We give a short proof for the sake of n 1 completness. Cn − C = n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] with CX = ϕ(X) ⊗ ϕ(X)∗ = k(X, X) ≤ M . We can apply the bounded difference inequality to the variable Cn − C , so that with probability greater than 1 − e−ξ , Cn − C ≤ E [ Cn − C ] + 2M Moreover, by Jensen’s inequality E [ Cn − C ] ≤ E n 1 simple calculations leads to E n i=1 CXi − E [CX ] 2 4M n . This concludes the proof of lemma 1. 1 n 2 n i=1 CXi 1 = nE 2 ξ 2n . 1 2 − E [CX ] , and CX − E [CX ] 2 ≤ Proof of Theorem 3. The variation of this proof with respect to Theorem 5.2 in [7] is (a) to work directly in a (inﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert space, requiring extra caution for some details and (b) obtaining an improved bound by considering D-eigenspaces at once. The key property of Hilbert-Schmidt operators allowing to work directly in a inﬁnite dimensional setting is that HS(H) is a both right and left ideal of Lc (H, H), the Banach space of all continuous linear operators of H endowed with the operator norm . op . Indeed, ∀ T ∈ HS(H), ∀S ∈ Lc (H, H), T S and ST belong to HS(H) with TS ≤ T S ST ≤ T and op S op . (4) The spectrum of an Hilbert-Schmidt operator T is denoted Λ(T ) and the sequence of eigenvalues in non-increasing order is denoted λ(T ) = (λ1 (T ) ≥ λ2 (T ) ≥ . . .) . In the following, P D (T ) denotes the orthogonal projector onto the D-eigenspace of T . The Hoffmann-Wielandt inequality in inﬁnite dimensional setting[1] yields that: λ(A) − λ(A + B) 2 ≤ B ≤ δD . 2 (5) implying in particular that ∀i > 0, |λi (A) − λi (A + B)| ≤ δD . 2 (6) Results found in [5] p.39 yield the formula P D (A) − P D (A + B) = − 1 2iπ γ (RA (z) − RA+B (z))dz ∈ Lc (H, H) . (7) where RA (z) = (A − z Id)−1 is the resolvent of A, provided that γ is a simple closed curve in C enclosing exactly the ﬁrst D eigenvalues of A and (A + B). Moreover, the same reference (p.60) states that for ξ in the complementary of Λ(A), RA (ξ) op = dist(ξ, Λ(A)) −1 . (8) The proof of the theorem now relies on the simple choice for the closed curve γ in (7), drawn in the picture below and consisting of three straight lines and a semi-circle of radius D L. For all L > δ2 , γ intersect neither the eigenspectrum of A (by equation (6)) nor the eigenspectrum of A + B. Moreover, the eigenvalues of A (resp. A + B) enclosed by γ are exactly λ1 (A), . . . , λD (A) (resp. λ1 (A + B), . . . , λD (A + B)). Moreover, for z ∈ γ, T (z) = RA (z) − RA+B (z) = −RA+B (z)BRA (z) belongs to HS(H) and depends continuously on z by (4). Consequently, P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 1 2π b a (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) |γ (t)|dt . N Let SN = n=0 (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z). RA+B (z) = (Id + RA (z)B)−1 RA (z) and, for z ∈ γ and L > δD , RA (z)B op ≤ RA (z) op B ≤ δD 1 ≤ , 2 dist(z, Λ(A)) 2 γ L L δD λ 0 D+1 δD λ2 λD λ1 δD δD δD 2 2 2 L . op imply that SN −→ RA+B (z) (uniformly for z ∈ γ). Using property (4), since B ∈ . HS(H), SN BRA (z) −→ RA+B (z)BRA (z) = RA+B (z) − RA (z) . Finally, RA (z) − RA+B (z) = (−1)n (RA (z)B)n RA (z) n≥1 where the series converges in HS(H), uniformly in z ∈ γ. Using again property (4) and (8) implies B n (RA − RA+B )(γ(t)) ≤ RA (γ(t)) n+1 B n ≤ op distn+1 (γ(t), Λ(A)) n≥1 Finally, since for L > δD , B ≤ δD 2 n≥1 ≤ dist(γ(t),Λ(A)) , 2 b B 1 |γ (t)|dt . 2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) π a dist Splitting the last integral into four parts according to the deﬁnition of the contour γ, we obtain P D (A) − P D (A + B) ≤ 2arctan( δL ) 1 µ1 (A) − (µD (A) − δD ) π D |γ (t)|dt ≤ + +2 , dist2 (γ(t), Λ(A)) δD L L2 a and letting L goes to inﬁnity leads to the result. b Proof of Theorem 4.

<p>Author: Peter Mccracken, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a method of modeling dynamical systems using only observable data, such as actions and observations, to describe their model. PSRs use predictions about the outcome of future tests to summarize the system state. The best existing techniques for discovery and learning of PSRs use a Monte Carlo approach to explicitly estimate these outcome probabilities. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for discovery and learning of PSRs that uses a gradient descent approach to compute the predictions for the current state. The algorithm takes advantage of the large amount of structure inherent in a valid prediction matrix to constrain its predictions. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used online by an agent to constantly improve its prediction quality; something that current state of the art discovery and learning algorithms are unable to do. We give empirical results to show that our constrained gradient algorithm is able to discover core tests using very small amounts of data, and with larger amounts of data can compute accurate predictions of the system dynamics. 1</p><p>5 0.57814753 <a title="147-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">57 nips-2005-Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, John Blitzer, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We show how to learn a Mahanalobis distance metric for k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation by semideﬁnite programming. The metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. On seven data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation—for example, achieving a test error rate of 1.3% on the MNIST handwritten digits. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the learning problem reduces to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our framework requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.52275276 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Infinite_latent_feature_models_and_the_Indian_buffet_process.html">98 nips-2005-Infinite latent feature models and the Indian buffet process</a></p>

<p>Author: James Diebel, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a highly successful application of MRFs to the problem of generating high-resolution range images. A new generation of range sensors combines the capture of low-resolution range images with the acquisition of registered high-resolution camera images. The MRF in this paper exploits the fact that discontinuities in range and coloring tend to co-align. This enables it to generate high-resolution, low-noise range images by integrating regular camera images into the range data. We show that by using such an MRF, we can substantially improve over existing range imaging technology. 1</p><p>3 0.17623009 <a title="170-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Depth_from_Single_Monocular_Images.html">110 nips-2005-Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashutosh Saxena, Sung H. Chung, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of depth estimation from a single monocular image. We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufﬁcient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps. 1</p><p>4 0.12765904 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Off-Road_Obstacle_Avoidance_through_End-to-End_Learning.html">143 nips-2005-Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance through End-to-End Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Urs Muller, Jan Ben, Eric Cosatto, Beat Flepp, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a vision-based obstacle avoidance system for off-road mobile robots. The system is trained from end to end to map raw input images to steering angles. It is trained in supervised mode to predict the steering angles provided by a human driver during training runs collected in a wide variety of terrains, weather conditions, lighting conditions, and obstacle types. The robot is a 50cm off-road truck, with two forwardpointing wireless color cameras. A remote computer processes the video and controls the robot via radio. The learning system is a large 6-layer convolutional network whose input is a single left/right pair of unprocessed low-resolution images. The robot exhibits an excellent ability to detect obstacles and navigate around them in real time at speeds of 2 m/s.</p><p>5 0.11747601 <a title="170-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Cue-Invariant_Visual_Responses.html">109 nips-2005-Learning Cue-Invariant Visual Responses</a></p>
<p>Author: Jarmo Hurri</p><p>Abstract: Multiple visual cues are used by the visual system to analyze a scene; achromatic cues include luminance, texture, contrast and motion. Singlecell recordings have shown that the mammalian visual cortex contains neurons that respond similarly to scene structure (e.g., orientation of a boundary), regardless of the cue type conveying this information. This paper shows that cue-invariant response properties of simple- and complex-type cells can be learned from natural image data in an unsupervised manner. In order to do this, we also extend a previous conceptual model of cue invariance so that it can be applied to model simple- and complex-cell responses. Our results relate cue-invariant response properties to natural image statistics, thereby showing how the statistical modeling approach can be used to model processing beyond the elemental response properties visual neurons. This work also demonstrates how to learn, from natural image data, more sophisticated feature detectors than those based on changes in mean luminance, thereby paving the way for new data-driven approaches to image processing and computer vision. 1</p><p>6 0.11705434 <a title="170-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Inferring_Motor_Programs_from_Images_of_Handwritten_Digits.html">97 nips-2005-Inferring Motor Programs from Images of Handwritten Digits</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Linear implementations of the efﬁcient coding hypothesis, such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding models, have provided functional explanations for properties of simple cells in V1 [1, 2]. These models, however, ignore the non-linear behavior of neurons and fail to match individual and population properties of neural receptive ﬁelds in subtle but important ways. Hierarchical models, including Gaussian Scale Mixtures [3, 4] and other generative statistical models [5, 6], can capture higher-order regularities in natural images and explain nonlinear aspects of neural processing such as normalization and context effects [6,7]. Previously, it had been assumed that the lower level representation is independent of the hierarchy, and had been ﬁxed when training these models. Here we examine the optimal lower-level representations derived in the context of a hierarchical model and ﬁnd that the resulting representations are strikingly different from those based on linear models. Unlike the the basis functions and ﬁlters learned by ICA or sparse coding, these functions individually more closely resemble simple cell receptive ﬁelds and collectively span a broad range of spatial scales. Our work uniﬁes several related approaches and observations about natural image structure and suggests that hierarchical models might yield better representations of image structure throughout the hierarchy.</p><p>6 0.44880739 <a title="170-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Inferring_Motor_Programs_from_Images_of_Handwritten_Digits.html">97 nips-2005-Inferring Motor Programs from Images of Handwritten Digits</a></p>

<p>Author: Frank Wood, Stefan Roth, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic modeling of correlated neural population ﬁring activity is central to understanding the neural code and building practical decoding algorithms. No parametric models currently exist for modeling multivariate correlated neural data and the high dimensional nature of the data makes fully non-parametric methods impractical. To address these problems we propose an energy-based model in which the joint probability of neural activity is represented using learned functions of the 1D marginal histograms of the data. The parameters of the model are learned using contrastive divergence and an optimization procedure for ﬁnding appropriate marginal directions. We evaluate the method using real data recorded from a population of motor cortical neurons. In particular, we model the joint probability of population spiking times and 2D hand position and show that the likelihood of test data under our model is signiﬁcantly higher than under other models. These results suggest that our model captures correlations in the ﬁring activity. Our rich probabilistic model of neural population activity is a step towards both measurement of the importance of correlations in neural coding and improved decoding of population activity. 1</p><p>5 0.66837806 <a title="170-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Analyzing_Coupled_Brain_Sources%3A_Distinguishing_True_from_Spurious_Interaction.html">29 nips-2005-Analyzing Coupled Brain Sources: Distinguishing True from Spurious Interaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Guido Nolte, Andreas Ziehe, Frank Meinecke, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When trying to understand the brain, it is of fundamental importance to analyse (e.g. from EEG/MEG measurements) what parts of the cortex interact with each other in order to infer more accurate models of brain activity. Common techniques like Blind Source Separation (BSS) can estimate brain sources and single out artifacts by using the underlying assumption of source signal independence. However, physiologically interesting brain sources typically interact, so BSS will—by construction— fail to characterize them properly. Noting that there are truly interacting sources and signals that only seemingly interact due to effects of volume conduction, this work aims to contribute by distinguishing these effects. For this a new BSS technique is proposed that uses anti-symmetrized cross-correlation matrices and subsequent diagonalization. The resulting decomposition consists of the truly interacting brain sources and suppresses any spurious interaction stemming from volume conduction. Our new concept of interacting source analysis (ISA) is successfully demonstrated on MEG data. 1</p><p>6 0.66784906 <a title="170-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-The_Information-Form_Data_Association_Filter.html">192 nips-2005-The Information-Form Data Association Filter</a></p>

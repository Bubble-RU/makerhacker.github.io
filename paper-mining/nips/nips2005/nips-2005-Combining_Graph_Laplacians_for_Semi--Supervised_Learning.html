<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>3 0.27009201 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Maximum_Margin_Semi-Supervised_Learning_for_Structured_Variables.html">123 nips-2005-Maximum Margin Semi-Supervised Learning for Structured Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Y. Altun, D. McAllester, M. Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world classiﬁcation problems involve the prediction of multiple inter-dependent variables forming some structural dependency. Recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on supervised classiﬁcation of such structured variables. In this paper, we investigate structured classiﬁcation in a semi-supervised setting. We present a discriminative approach that utilizes the intrinsic geometry of input patterns revealed by unlabeled data points and we derive a maximum-margin formulation of semi-supervised learning for structured variables. Unlike transductive algorithms, our formulation naturally extends to new test points. 1</p><p>4 0.24785836 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Hyperparameter_and_Kernel_Learning_for_Graph_Based_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">92 nips-2005-Hyperparameter and Kernel Learning for Graph Based Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Hyungil Ahn, Yuan Qi, Rosalind W. Picard</p><p>Abstract: There have been many graph-based approaches for semi-supervised classiﬁcation. One problem is that of hyperparameter learning: performance depends greatly on the hyperparameters of the similarity graph, transformation of the graph Laplacian and the noise model. We present a Bayesian framework for learning hyperparameters for graph-based semisupervised classiﬁcation. Given some labeled data, which can contain inaccurate labels, we pose the semi-supervised classiﬁcation as an inference problem over the unknown labels. Expectation Propagation is used for approximate inference and the mean of the posterior is used for classiﬁcation. The hyperparameters are learned using EM for evidence maximization. We also show that the posterior mean can be written in terms of the kernel matrix, providing a Bayesian classiﬁer to classify new points. Tests on synthetic and real datasets show cases where there are signiﬁcant improvements in performance over the existing approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.22600794 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">57 nips-2005-Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, John Blitzer, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We show how to learn a Mahanalobis distance metric for k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation by semideﬁnite programming. The metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. On seven data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation—for example, achieving a test error rate of 1.3% on the MNIST handwritten digits. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the learning problem reduces to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our framework requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.1889797 <a title="42-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Metric_Learning_by_Collapsing_Classes.html">126 nips-2005-Metric Learning by Collapsing Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lankriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constraint quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result and works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined. 1</p><p>6 0.68552732 <a title="42-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Large-Scale_Multiclass_Transduction.html">105 nips-2005-Large-Scale Multiclass Transduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Suzuki, Hideki Isozaki</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to feature selection based on a statistical feature mining technique for sequence and tree kernels. Since natural language data take discrete structures, convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are advantageous for both the concept and accuracy of many natural language processing tasks. However, experiments have shown that the best results can only be achieved when limited small sub-structures are dealt with by these kernels. This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels and then proposes a statistical feature selection that enable us to use larger sub-structures effectively. The proposed method, in order to execute efﬁciently, can be embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments on real NLP tasks conﬁrm the problem in the conventional method and compare the performance of a conventional method to that of the proposed method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.93806744 <a title="42-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Combining_Graph_Laplacians_for_Semi--Supervised_Learning.html">42 nips-2005-Combining Graph Laplacians for Semi--Supervised Learning</a></p>

The observation spaces are linked via a single, reduced-dimensionality latent variable space. We present results from two datasets demonstrating the algorithms’s ability to synthesize novel data from learned correspondences. We ﬁrst show that the method can learn the nonlinear mapping between corresponding views of objects, ﬁlling in missing data as needed to synthesize novel views. We then show that the method can learn a mapping between human degrees of freedom and robotic degrees of freedom for a humanoid robot, allowing robotic imitation of human poses from motion capture data. 1</p><p>4 0.89588618 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Consensus_Propagation.html">46 nips-2005-Consensus Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy, Ciamac C. Moallemi</p><p>Abstract: We propose consensus propagation, an asynchronous distributed protocol for averaging numbers across a network. We establish convergence, characterize the convergence rate for regular graphs, and demonstrate that the protocol exhibits better scaling properties than pairwise averaging, an alternative that has received much recent attention. Consensus propagation can be viewed as a special case of belief propagation, and our results contribute to the belief propagation literature. In particular, beyond singly-connected graphs, there are very few classes of relevant problems for which belief propagation is known to converge. 1</p><p>5 0.7437557 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-From_Lasso_regression_to_Feature_vector_machine.html">77 nips-2005-From Lasso regression to Feature vector machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Li, Yiming Yang, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Lasso regression tends to assign zero weights to most irrelevant or redundant features, and hence is a promising technique for feature selection. Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels deﬁned on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.</p><p>6 0.71384865 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Nearest_Neighbor_Based_Feature_Selection_for_Regression_and_its_Application_to_Neural_Activity.html">132 nips-2005-Nearest Neighbor Based Feature Selection for Regression and its Application to Neural Activity</a></p>

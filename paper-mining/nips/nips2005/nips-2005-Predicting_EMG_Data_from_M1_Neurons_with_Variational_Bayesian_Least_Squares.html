<p>Author: Bo Wen, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mechanism we proposed in which OHC motile forces, through the microanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the degree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes saturation of OHC forces. 1 Silicon Cochleae Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear micromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suffers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This parallel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3]. Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar membrane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling (ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism (ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Oval window organ of Corti BM Round window IHC RL A OHC PhP DC BM Basal @ Stereocilia i -1 i i+1 Apical B Figure 1: The inner ear.

Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior. 2 Active Bidirectional Coupling The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The movement of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved. We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process (PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP) is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1. Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk. In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between BM segments in the longitudinal direction.

Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts) are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h (cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall. Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 2 φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 2 denotes the Laplacian operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the x and y directions: Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y. The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion (with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows. ˙ ¨ Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S(x)δ(x) + β(x)δ(x) + M (x)δ(x), (1) where S(x) is the stiffness, β(x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂(φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂t is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density. The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by FOHC (x) = s0 tanh(αγS(x)δ(x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS(x)δ(x + d)/s0 ) , (2) where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level. We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP. 4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a 2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation. 4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level, the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10], we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of nMOS transistors. Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term): ˙ Iin = S(x) Imem dt + β(x)Imem + M (x)I˙mem , (3) where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn, Imem ˙ drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity, δ. The FOHC term is dealt with in Section 4.2. Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is τ1 Is s + Is τ2 Io s + Io Imem = −Iin + Io , = Iin − bIs , = Iin + Is − Io , (4) (5) (6) where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants τ1 and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as: Iin s2 = (b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 Imem . Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs: S(x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 , β(x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 , and M (x) = 1. Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathematical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to Half LPF ( ) + Iout- Iin+ Iout+ Iout Vq Iin+ Iin- C+ B Iin- A Iin+ + - - Iin- + + + C To neighbors Is- Is+ > + > + IT+ IT- + - + From neighbors Io- Io+ + + + + - - + + LPF Iout+ Iout- BM Imem+ Imem- Figure 3: Low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and second-order section circuit design.

It consists of two LPFs and connects to its neighbors through Is and IT . simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon area). 4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with Imem dt to obtain FOHC = rﬀ S(x)T Imem (x − d)dt − rfb S(x)T Imem (x + d)dt , where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, Imem (x − d)dt = −τ1f Isf and Imem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small. We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result: τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ). Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream neighbors of each segment.

A Architecture: Two diffusive grids with embedded BM circuits model the cochlea. B Detail. BM circuits exchange currents with their neighbors. 4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of BM is driven by the pressure difference across it. Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for the BM circuit. It is described by + − + − + − + − + − 2 τ (Iout − Iout )s + (Iout − Iout ) = Iin − Iin and τ Iout Iout s + Iout Iout = Iq , where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output current, and τ sets the time constant. Combining the common-mode constraint with the differential design equation yields the nodal equation for the positive path (the negative path has superscripts + and − swapped): + − + + + − 2 ˙+ C Vout = Iτ (Iin − Iin ) + (Iq /Iout − Iout ) /(Iout + Iout ). + This nodal equation suggests the half-LPF circuit shown in Figure 3A. Vout , the voltage on + the positive capacitor (C ), gates a pMOS transistor to produce the corresponding current + − − signal, Iout (Vout and Iout are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = CuT/κIτ (κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these subcircuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B). The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthesized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat /(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat. 4.4 Chip Architecture We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in 0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema. 5 Chip Measurements We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear positions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea [13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from 1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]). The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology (computed from [13]).

A Amplitude. B Phase. Dashed lines: Biological data (adapted from [13]). Dots mark peaks. We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC. Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a 4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage 178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region (resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies. These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data. 6 Conclusions We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that utilizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear ampliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors.

Responses become broader and show compressive growth. plemented in the log-domain, with Class AB operation, our silicon cochlea shows enhanced frequency responses, with compressive behavior around the CF, when ABC is turned on. These features are desirable in prosthetic applications and automatic speech recognition systems as they capture the properties of the biological cochlea. References [1] Lyon, R.F. & Mead, C.A.

<p>Author: Fan Li, Yiming Yang, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Lasso regression tends to assign zero weights to most irrelevant or redundant features, and hence is a promising technique for feature selection. Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels deﬁned on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.</p><p>4 0.14157136 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-The_Information-Form_Data_Association_Filter.html">192 nips-2005-The Information-Form Data Association Filter</a></p>

The key innovation is a representation of the data association posterior in information form, in which the “proximity” of objects and tracks are expressed by numerical links. Updating these links requires linear time, compared to exponential time required for computing the exact posterior probabilities.

<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Elon Portugaly, Tamar Flash, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The two-thirds power law, an empirical law stating an inverse non-linear relationship between the tangential hand speed and the curvature of its trajectory during curved motion, is widely acknowledged to be an invariant of upper-limb movement. It has also been shown to exist in eyemotion, locomotion and was even demonstrated in motion perception and prediction. This ubiquity has fostered various attempts to uncover the origins of this empirical relationship. In these it was generally attributed either to smoothness in hand- or joint-space or to the result of mechanisms that damp noise inherent in the motor system to produce the smooth trajectories evident in healthy human motion. We show here that white Gaussian noise also obeys this power-law. Analysis of signal and noise combinations shows that trajectories that were synthetically created not to comply with the power-law are transformed to power-law compliant ones after combination with low levels of noise. Furthermore, there exist colored noise types that drive non-power-law trajectories to power-law compliance and are not affected by smoothing. These results suggest caution when running experiments aimed at verifying the power-law or assuming its underlying existence without proper analysis of the noise. Our results could also suggest that the power-law might be derived not from smoothness or smoothness-inducing mechanisms operating on the noise inherent in our motor system but rather from the correlated noise which is inherent in this motor system. 1</p><p>6 0.083342806 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Selecting_Landmark_Points_for_Sparse_Manifold_Learning.html">172 nips-2005-Selecting Landmark Points for Sparse Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Aaron D'souza, Kenji Yamamoto, Toshinori Yoshioka, Donna Hoffman, Shinji Kakei, Lauren Sergio, John Kalaska, Mitsuo Kawato</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of projects in neuroscience requires the statistical analysis of high dimensional data sets, as, for instance, in predicting behavior from neural ﬁring or in operating artiﬁcial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Linear analysis techniques remain prevalent in such cases, but classical linear regression approaches are often numerically too fragile in high dimensions. In this paper, we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed with linear approaches from neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1). To achieve robust data analysis, we develop a full Bayesian approach to linear regression that automatically detects and excludes irrelevant features in the data, regularizing against overﬁtting. In comparison with ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, partial least squares, LASSO regression and a brute force combinatorial search for the most predictive input features in the data, we demonstrate that the new Bayesian method oﬀers a superior mixture of characteristics in terms of regularization against overﬁtting, computational eﬃciency and ease of use, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. As neuroscientiﬁc results, our analyses demonstrate that EMG data can be well predicted from M1 neurons, further opening the path for possible real-time interfaces between brains and machines. 1</p><p>2 0.73374826 <a title="155-lsi-2" href="./nips-2005-Active_Bidirectional_Coupling_in_a_Cochlear_Chip.html">17 nips-2005-Active Bidirectional Coupling in a Cochlear Chip</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wen, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mechanism we proposed in which OHC motile forces, through the microanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the degree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes saturation of OHC forces. 1 Silicon Cochleae Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear micromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suffers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This parallel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3]. Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar membrane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling (ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism (ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Oval window organ of Corti BM Round window IHC RL A OHC PhP DC BM Basal @ Stereocilia i -1 i i+1 Apical B Figure 1: The inner ear.

Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior. 2 Active Bidirectional Coupling The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The movement of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved. We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process (PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP) is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1. Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk. In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between BM segments in the longitudinal direction.

Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts) are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h (cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall. Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 2 φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 2 denotes the Laplacian operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the x and y directions: Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y. The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion (with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows. ˙ ¨ Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S(x)δ(x) + β(x)δ(x) + M (x)δ(x), (1) where S(x) is the stiffness, β(x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂(φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂t is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density. The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by FOHC (x) = s0 tanh(αγS(x)δ(x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS(x)δ(x + d)/s0 ) , (2) where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level. We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP. 4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a 2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation. 4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level, the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10], we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of nMOS transistors. Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term): ˙ Iin = S(x) Imem dt + β(x)Imem + M (x)I˙mem , (3) where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn, Imem ˙ drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity, δ. The FOHC term is dealt with in Section 4.2. Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is τ1 Is s + Is τ2 Io s + Io Imem = −Iin + Io , = Iin − bIs , = Iin + Is − Io , (4) (5) (6) where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants τ1 and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as: Iin s2 = (b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 Imem . Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs: S(x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 , β(x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 , and M (x) = 1. Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathematical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to Half LPF ( ) + Iout- Iin+ Iout+ Iout Vq Iin+ Iin- C+ B Iin- A Iin+ + - - Iin- + + + C To neighbors Is- Is+ > + > + IT+ IT- + - + From neighbors Io- Io+ + + + + - - + + LPF Iout+ Iout- BM Imem+ Imem- Figure 3: Low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and second-order section circuit design.

It consists of two LPFs and connects to its neighbors through Is and IT . simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon area). 4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with Imem dt to obtain FOHC = rﬀ S(x)T Imem (x − d)dt − rfb S(x)T Imem (x + d)dt , where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, Imem (x − d)dt = −τ1f Isf and Imem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small. We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result: τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ). Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream neighbors of each segment.

A Architecture: Two diffusive grids with embedded BM circuits model the cochlea. B Detail. BM circuits exchange currents with their neighbors. 4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of BM is driven by the pressure difference across it. Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for the BM circuit. It is described by + − + − + − + − + − 2 τ (Iout − Iout )s + (Iout − Iout ) = Iin − Iin and τ Iout Iout s + Iout Iout = Iq , where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output current, and τ sets the time constant. Combining the common-mode constraint with the differential design equation yields the nodal equation for the positive path (the negative path has superscripts + and − swapped): + − + + + − 2 ˙+ C Vout = Iτ (Iin − Iin ) + (Iq /Iout − Iout ) /(Iout + Iout ). + This nodal equation suggests the half-LPF circuit shown in Figure 3A. Vout , the voltage on + the positive capacitor (C ), gates a pMOS transistor to produce the corresponding current + − − signal, Iout (Vout and Iout are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = CuT/κIτ (κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these subcircuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B). The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthesized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat /(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat. 4.4 Chip Architecture We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in 0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema. 5 Chip Measurements We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear positions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea [13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from 1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]). The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology (computed from [13]).

A Amplitude. B Phase. Dashed lines: Biological data (adapted from [13]). Dots mark peaks. We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC. Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a 4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage 178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region (resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies. These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data. 6 Conclusions We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that utilizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear ampliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors.

<p>Author: Fan Li, Yiming Yang, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Lasso regression tends to assign zero weights to most irrelevant or redundant features, and hence is a promising technique for feature selection. Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels deﬁned on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.</p><p>5 0.45379198 <a title="155-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Selecting_Landmark_Points_for_Sparse_Manifold_Learning.html">172 nips-2005-Selecting Landmark Points for Sparse Manifold Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jorge Silva, Jorge Marques, João Lemos</p><p>Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in learning non-linear manifold models to approximate high-dimensional data. Both for computational complexity reasons and for generalization capability, sparsity is a desired feature in such models. This usually means dimensionality reduction, which naturally implies estimating the intrinsic dimension, but it can also mean selecting a subset of the data to use as landmarks, which is especially important because many existing algorithms have quadratic complexity in the number of observations. This paper presents an algorithm for selecting landmarks, based on LASSO regression, which is well known to favor sparse approximations because it uses regularization with an l1 norm. As an added beneﬁt, a continuous manifold parameterization, based on the landmarks, is also found. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.4091405 <a title="155-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Learning_to_Control_an_Octopus_Arm_with_Gaussian_Process_Temporal_Difference_Methods.html">119 nips-2005-Learning to Control an Octopus Arm with Gaussian Process Temporal Difference Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Aaron D'souza, Kenji Yamamoto, Toshinori Yoshioka, Donna Hoffman, Shinji Kakei, Lauren Sergio, John Kalaska, Mitsuo Kawato</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of projects in neuroscience requires the statistical analysis of high dimensional data sets, as, for instance, in predicting behavior from neural ﬁring or in operating artiﬁcial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Linear analysis techniques remain prevalent in such cases, but classical linear regression approaches are often numerically too fragile in high dimensions. In this paper, we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed with linear approaches from neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1). To achieve robust data analysis, we develop a full Bayesian approach to linear regression that automatically detects and excludes irrelevant features in the data, regularizing against overﬁtting. In comparison with ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, partial least squares, LASSO regression and a brute force combinatorial search for the most predictive input features in the data, we demonstrate that the new Bayesian method oﬀers a superior mixture of characteristics in terms of regularization against overﬁtting, computational eﬃciency and ease of use, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. As neuroscientiﬁc results, our analyses demonstrate that EMG data can be well predicted from M1 neurons, further opening the path for possible real-time interfaces between brains and machines. 1</p><p>2 0.69670093 <a title="155-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Identifying_Distributed_Object_Representations_in_Human_Extrastriate_Visual_Cortex.html">94 nips-2005-Identifying Distributed Object Representations in Human Extrastriate Visual Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Rory Sayres, David Ress, Kalanit Grill-spector</p><p>Abstract: The category of visual stimuli has been reliably decoded from patterns of neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex [1]. It has yet to be seen whether object identity can be inferred from this activity. We present fMRI data measuring responses in human extrastriate cortex to a set of 12 distinct object images. We use a simple winner-take-all classifier, using half the data from each recording session as a training set, to evaluate encoding of object identity across fMRI voxels. Since this approach is sensitive to the inclusion of noisy voxels, we describe two methods for identifying subsets of voxels in the data which optimally distinguish object identity. One method characterizes the reliability of each voxel within subsets of the data, while another estimates the mutual information of each voxel with the stimulus set. We find that both metrics can identify subsets of the data which reliably encode object identity, even when noisy measurements are artificially added to the data. The mutual information metric is less efficient at this task, likely due to constraints in fMRI data. 1</p><p>3 0.63988262 <a title="155-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Measuring_Shared_Information_and_Coordinated_Activity_in_Neuronal_Networks.html">124 nips-2005-Measuring Shared Information and Coordinated Activity in Neuronal Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristina Klinkner, Cosma Shalizi, Marcelo Camperi</p><p>Abstract: Most nervous systems encode information about stimuli in the responding activity of large neuronal networks. This activity often manifests itself as dynamically coordinated sequences of action potentials. Since multiple electrode recordings are now a standard tool in neuroscience research, it is important to have a measure of such network-wide behavioral coordination and information sharing, applicable to multiple neural spike train data. We propose a new statistic, informational coherence, which measures how much better one unit can be predicted by knowing the dynamical state of another. We argue informational coherence is a measure of association and shared information which is superior to traditional pairwise measures of synchronization and correlation. To ﬁnd the dynamical states, we use a recently-introduced algorithm which reconstructs effective state spaces from stochastic time series. We then extend the pairwise measure to a multivariate analysis of the network by estimating the network multi-information. We illustrate our method by testing it on a detailed model of the transition from gamma to beta rhythms. Much of the most important information in neural systems is shared over multiple neurons or cortical areas, in such forms as population codes and distributed representations [1]. On behavioral time scales, neural information is stored in temporal patterns of activity as opposed to static markers; therefore, as information is shared between neurons or brain regions, it is physically instantiated as coordination between entire sequences of neural spikes. Furthermore, neural systems and regions of the brain often require coordinated neural activity to perform important functions; acting in concert requires multiple neurons or cortical areas to share information [2]. Thus, if we want to measure the dynamic network-wide behavior of neurons and test hypotheses about them, we need reliable, practical methods to detect and quantify behavioral coordination and the associated information sharing across multiple neural units. These would be especially useful in testing ideas about how particular forms of coordination relate to distributed coding (e.g., that of [3]). Current techniques to analyze relations among spike trains handle only pairs of neurons, so we further need a method which is extendible to analyze the coordination in the network, system, or region as a whole. Here we propose a new measure of behavioral coordination and information sharing, informational coherence, based on the notion of dynamical state. Section 1 argues that coordinated behavior in neural systems is often not captured by exist- ing measures of synchronization or correlation, and that something sensitive to nonlinear, stochastic, predictive relationships is needed. Section 2 deﬁnes informational coherence as the (normalized) mutual information between the dynamical states of two systems and explains how looking at the states, rather than just observables, fulﬁlls the needs laid out in Section 1. Since we rarely know the right states a prori, Section 2.1 brieﬂy describes how we reconstruct effective state spaces from data. Section 2.2 gives some details about how we calculate the informational coherence and approximate the global information stored in the network. Section 3 applies our method to a model system (a biophysically detailed conductance-based model) comparing our results to those of more familiar second-order statistics. In the interest of space, we omit proofs and a full discussion of the existing literature, giving only minimal references here; proofs and references will appear in a longer paper now in preparation. 1 Synchrony or Coherence? Most hypotheses which involve the idea that information sharing is reﬂected in coordinated activity across neural units invoke a very speciﬁc notion of coordinated activity, namely strict synchrony: the units should be doing exactly the same thing (e.g., spiking) at exactly the same time. Investigators then measure coordination by measuring how close the units come to being strictly synchronized (e.g., variance in spike times). From an informational point of view, there is no reason to favor strict synchrony over other kinds of coordination. One neuron consistently spiking 50 ms after another is just as informative a relationship as two simultaneously spiking, but such stable phase relations are missed by strict-synchrony approaches. Indeed, whatever the exact nature of the neural code, it uses temporally extended patterns of activity, and so information sharing should be reﬂected in coordination of those patterns, rather than just the instantaneous activity. There are three common ways of going beyond strict synchrony: cross-correlation and related second-order statistics, mutual information, and topological generalized synchrony. The cross-correlation function (the normalized covariance function; this includes, for present purposes, the joint peristimulus time histogram [2]), is one of the most widespread measures of synchronization. It can be efﬁciently calculated from observable series; it handles statistical as well as deterministic relationships between processes; by incorporating variable lags, it reduces the problem of phase locking. Fourier transformation of the covariance function γXY (h) yields the cross-spectrum FXY (ν), which in turn gives the 2 spectral coherence cXY (ν) = FXY (ν)/FX (ν)FY (ν), a normalized correlation between the Fourier components of X and Y . Integrated over frequencies, the spectral coherence measures, essentially, the degree of linear cross-predictability of the two series. ([4] applies spectral coherence to coordinated neural activity.) However, such second-order statistics only handle linear relationships. Since neural processes are known to be strongly nonlinear, there is little reason to think these statistics adequately measure coordination and synchrony in neural systems. Mutual information is attractive because it handles both nonlinear and stochastic relationships and has a very natural and appealing interpretation. Unfortunately, it often seems to fail in practice, being disappointingly small even between signals which are known to be tightly coupled [5]. The major reason is that the neural codes use distinct patterns of activity over time, rather than many different instantaneous actions, and the usual approach misses these extended patterns. Consider two neurons, one of which drives the other to spike 50 ms after it does, the driving neuron spiking once every 500 ms. These are very tightly coordinated, but whether the ﬁrst neuron spiked at time t conveys little information about what the second neuron is doing at t — it’s not spiking, but it’s not spiking most of the time anyway. Mutual information calculated from the direct observations conﬂates the “no spike” of the second neuron preparing to ﬁre with its just-sitting-around “no spike”. Here, mutual information could ﬁnd the coordination if we used a 50 ms lag, but that won’t work in general. Take two rate-coding neurons with base-line ﬁring rates of 1 Hz, and suppose that a stimulus excites one to 10 Hz and suppresses the other to 0.1 Hz. The spiking rates thus share a lot of information, but whether the one neuron spiked at t is uninformative about what the other neuron did then, and lagging won’t help. Generalized synchrony is based on the idea of establishing relationships between the states of the various units. “State” here is taken in the sense of physics, dynamics and control theory: the state at time t is a variable which ﬁxes the distribution of observables at all times ≥ t, rendering the past of the system irrelevant [6]. Knowing the state allows us to predict, as well as possible, how the system will evolve, and how it will respond to external forces [7]. Two coupled systems are said to exhibit generalized synchrony if the state of one system is given by a mapping from the state of the other. Applications to data employ statespace reconstruction [8]: if the state x ∈ X evolves according to smooth, d-dimensional deterministic dynamics, and we observe a generic function y = f (x), then the space Y of time-delay vectors [y(t), y(t − τ ), ...y(t − (k − 1)τ )] is diffeomorphic to X if k > 2d, for generic choices of lag τ . The various versions of generalized synchrony differ on how, precisely, to quantify the mappings between reconstructed state spaces, but they all appear to be empirically equivalent to one another and to notions of phase synchronization based on Hilbert transforms [5]. Thus all of these measures accommodate nonlinear relationships, and are potentially very ﬂexible. Unfortunately, there is essentially no reason to believe that neural systems have deterministic dynamics at experimentally-accessible levels of detail, much less that there are deterministic relationships among such states for different units. What we want, then, but none of these alternatives provides, is a quantity which measures predictive relationships among states, but allows those relationships to be nonlinear and stochastic. The next section introduces just such a measure, which we call “informational coherence”. 2 States and Informational Coherence There are alternatives to calculating the “surface” mutual information between the sequences of observations themselves (which, as described, fails to capture coordination). If we know that the units are phase oscillators, or rate coders, we can estimate their instantaneous phase or rate and, by calculating the mutual information between those variables, see how coordinated the units’ patterns of activity are. However, phases and rates do not exhaust the repertoire of neural patterns and a more general, common scheme is desirable. The most general notion of “pattern of activity” is simply that of the dynamical state of the system, in the sense mentioned above. We now formalize this. Assuming the usual notation for Shannon information [9], the information content of a state variable X is H[X] and the mutual information between X and Y is I[X; Y ]. As is well-known, I[X; Y ] ≤ min H[X], H[Y ]. We use this to normalize the mutual state information to a 0 − 1 scale, and this is the informational coherence (IC). ψ(X, Y ) = I[X; Y ] , with 0/0 = 0 . min H[X], H[Y ] (1) ψ can be interpreted as follows. I[X; Y ] is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution of X and Y , and the product of their marginal distributions [9], indicating the error involved in ignoring the dependence between X and Y . The mutual information between predictive, dynamical states thus gauges the error involved in assuming the two systems are independent, i.e., how much predictions could improve by taking into account the dependence. Hence it measures the amount of dynamically-relevant information shared between the two systems. ψ simply normalizes this value, and indicates the degree to which two systems have coordinated patterns of behavior (cf. [10], although this only uses directly observable quantities). 2.1 Reconstruction and Estimation of Effective State Spaces As mentioned, the state space of a deterministic dynamical system can be reconstructed from a sequence of observations. This is the main tool of experimental nonlinear dynamics [8]; but the assumption of determinism is crucial and false, for almost any interesting neural system. While classical state-space reconstruction won’t work on stochastic processes, such processes do have state-space representations [11], and, in the special case of discretevalued, discrete-time series, there are ways to reconstruct the state space. Here we use the CSSR algorithm, introduced in [12] (code available at http://bactra.org/CSSR). This produces causal state models, which are stochastic automata capable of statistically-optimal nonlinear prediction; the state of the machine is a minimal sufﬁcient statistic for the future of the observable process[13].1 The basic idea is to form a set of states which should be (1) Markovian, (2) sufﬁcient statistics for the next observable, and (3) have deterministic transitions (in the automata-theory sense). The algorithm begins with a minimal, one-state, IID model, and checks whether these properties hold, by means of hypothesis tests. If they fail, the model is modiﬁed, generally but not always by adding more states, and the new model is checked again. Each state of the model corresponds to a distinct distribution over future events, i.e., to a statistical pattern of behavior. Under mild conditions, which do not involve prior knowledge of the state space, CSSR converges in probability to the unique causal state model of the data-generating process [12]. In practice, CSSR is quite fast (linear in the data size), and generalizes at least as well as training hidden Markov models with the EM algorithm and using cross-validation for selection, the standard heuristic [12]. One advantage of the causal state approach (which it shares with classical state-space reconstruction) is that state estimation is greatly simpliﬁed. In the general case of nonlinear state estimation, it is necessary to know not just the form of the stochastic dynamics in the state space and the observation function, but also their precise parametric values and the distribution of observation and driving noises. Estimating the state from the observable time series then becomes a computationally-intensive application of Bayes’s Rule [17]. Due to the way causal states are built as statistics of the data, with probability 1 there is a ﬁnite time, t, at which the causal state at time t is certain. This is not just with some degree of belief or conﬁdence: because of the way the states are constructed, it is impossible for the process to be in any other state at that time. Once the causal state has been established, it can be updated recursively, i.e., the causal state at time t + 1 is an explicit function of the causal state at time t and the observation at t + 1. The causal state model can be automatically converted, therefore, into a ﬁnite-state transducer which reads in an observation time series and outputs the corresponding series of states [18, 13]. (Our implementation of CSSR ﬁlters its training data automatically.) The result is a new time series of states, from which all non-predictive components have been ﬁltered out. 2.2 Estimating the Coherence Our algorithm for estimating the matrix of informational coherences is as follows. For each unit, we reconstruct the causal state model, and ﬁlter the observable time series to produce a series of causal states. Then, for each pair of neurons, we construct a joint histogram of 1 Causal state models have the same expressive power as observable operator models [14] or predictive state representations [7], and greater power than variable-length Markov models [15, 16]. a b Figure 1: Rastergrams of neuronal spike-times in the network. Excitatory, pyramidal neurons (numbers 1 to 1000) are shown in green, inhibitory interneurons (numbers 1001 to 1300) in red. During the ﬁrst 10 seconds (a), the current connections among the pyramidal cells are suppressed and a gamma rhythm emerges (left). At t = 10s, those connections become active, leading to a beta rhythm (b, right). the state distribution, estimate the mutual information between the states, and normalize by the single-unit state informations. This gives a symmetric matrix of ψ values. Even if two systems are independent, their estimated IC will, on average, be positive, because, while they should have zero mutual information, the empirical estimate of mutual information is non-negative. Thus, the signiﬁcance of IC values must be assessed against the null hypothesis of system independence. The easiest way to do so is to take the reconstructed state models for the two systems and run them forward, independently of one another, to generate a large number of simulated state sequences; from these calculate values of the IC. This procedure will approximate the sampling distribution of the IC under a null model which preserves the dynamics of each system, but not their interaction. We can then ﬁnd p-values as usual. We omit them here to save space. 2.3 Approximating the Network Multi-Information There is broad agreement [2] that analyses of networks should not just be an analysis of pairs of neurons, averaged over pairs. Ideally, an analysis of information sharing in a network would look at the over-all structure of statistical dependence between the various units, reﬂected in the complete joint probability distribution P of the states. This would then allow us, for instance, to calculate the n-fold multi-information, I[X1 , X2 , . . . Xn ] ≡ D(P ||Q), the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution P and the product of marginal distributions Q, analogous to the pairwise mutual information [19]. Calculated over the predictive states, the multi-information would give the total amount of shared dynamical information in the system. Just as we normalized the mutual information I[X1 , X2 ] by its maximum possible value, min H[X1 ], H[X2 ], we normalize the multiinformation by its maximum, which is the smallest sum of n − 1 marginal entropies: I[X1 ; X2 ; . . . Xn ] ≤ min k H[Xn ] i=k Unfortunately, P is a distribution over a very high dimensional space and so, hard to estimate well without strong parametric constraints. We thus consider approximations. The lowest-order approximation treats all the units as independent; this is the distribution Q. One step up are tree distributions, where the global distribution is a function of the joint distributions of pairs of units. Not every pair of units needs to enter into such a distribution, though every unit must be part of some pair. Graphically, a tree distribution corresponds to a spanning tree, with edges linking units whose interactions enter into the global probability, and conversely spanning trees determine tree distributions. Writing ET for the set of pairs (i, j) and abbreviating X1 = x1 , X2 = x2 , . . . Xn = xn by X = x, one has n T (X = x) = (i,j)∈ET T (Xi = xi , Xj = xj ) T (Xi = xi ) T (Xi = xi )T (Xj = xj ) i=1 (2) where the marginal distributions T (Xi ) and the pair distributions T (Xi , Xj ) are estimated by the empirical marginal and pair distributions. We must now pick edges ET so that T best approximates the true global distribution P . A natural approach is to minimize D(P ||T ), the divergence between P and its tree approximation. Chow and Liu [20] showed that the maximum-weight spanning tree gives the divergence-minimizing distribution, taking an edge’s weight to be the mutual information between the variables it links. There are three advantages to using the Chow-Liu approximation. (1) Estimating T from empirical probabilities gives a consistent maximum likelihood estimator of the ideal ChowLiu tree [20], with reasonable rates of convergence, so T can be reliably known even if P cannot. (2) There are efﬁcient algorithms for constructing maximum-weight spanning trees, such as Prim’s algorithm [21, sec. 23.2], which runs in time O(n2 + n log n). Thus, the approximation is computationally tractable. (3) The KL divergence of the Chow-Liu distribution from Q gives a lower bound on the network multi-information; that bound is just the sum of the mutual informations along the edges in the tree: I[X1 ; X2 ; . . . Xn ] ≥ D(T ||Q) = I[Xi ; Xj ] (3) (i,j)∈ET Even if we knew P exactly, Eq. 3 would be useful as an alternative to calculating D(P ||Q) directly, evaluating log P (x)/Q(x) for all the exponentially-many conﬁgurations x. It is natural to seek higher-order approximations to P , e.g., using three-way interactions not decomposable into pairwise interactions [22, 19]. But it is hard to do so effectively, because ﬁnding the optimal approximation to P when such interactions are allowed is NP [23], and analytical formulas like Eq. 3 generally do not exist [19]. We therefore conﬁne ourselves to the Chow-Liu approximation here. 3 Example: A Model of Gamma and Beta Rhythms We use simulated data as a test case, instead of empirical multiple electrode recordings, which allows us to try the method on a system of over 1000 neurons and compare the measure against expected results. The model, taken from [24], was originally designed to study episodes of gamma (30–80Hz) and beta (12–30Hz) oscillations in the mammalian nervous system, which often occur successively with a spontaneous transition between them. More concretely, the rhythms studied were those displayed by in vitro hippocampal (CA1) slice preparations and by in vivo neocortical EEGs. The model contains two neuron populations: excitatory (AMPA) pyramidal neurons and inhibitory (GABAA ) interneurons, deﬁned by conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-style equations. Simulations were carried out in a network of 1000 pyramidal cells and 300 interneurons. Each cell was modeled as a one-compartment neuron with all-to-all coupling, endowed with the basic sodium and potassium spiking currents, an external applied current, and some Gaussian input noise. The ﬁrst 10 seconds of the simulation correspond to the gamma rhythm, in which only a group of neurons is made to spike via a linearly increasing applied current. The beta rhythm a b c d Figure 2: Heat-maps of coordination for the network, as measured by zero-lag cross-correlation (top row) and informational coherence (bottom), contrasting the gamma rhythm (left column) with the beta (right). Colors run from red (no coordination) through yellow to pale cream (maximum). (subsequent 10 seconds) is obtained by activating pyramidal-pyramidal recurrent connections (potentiated by Hebbian preprocessing as a result of synchrony during the gamma rhythm) and a slow outward after-hyper-polarization (AHP) current (the M-current), suppressed during gamma due to the metabotropic activation used in the generation of the rhythm. During the beta rhythm, pyramidal cells, silent during gamma rhythm, ﬁre on a subset of interneurons cycles (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 compares zero-lag cross-correlation, a second-order method of quantifying coordination, with the informational coherence calculated from the reconstructed states. (In this simulation, we could have calculated the actual states of the model neurons directly, rather than reconstructing them, but for purposes of testing our method we did not.) Crosscorrelation ﬁnds some of the relationships visible in Fig. 1, but is confused by, for instance, the phase shifts between pyramidal cells. (Surface mutual information, not shown, gives similar results.) Informational coherence, however, has no trouble recognizing the two populations as effectively coordinated blocks. The presence of dynamical noise, problematic for ordinary state reconstruction, is not an issue. The average IC is 0.411 (or 0.797 if the inactive, low-numbered neurons are excluded). The tree estimate of the global informational multi-information is 3243.7 bits, with a global coherence of 0.777. The right half of Fig. 2 repeats this analysis for the beta rhythm; in this stage, the average IC is 0.614, and the tree estimate of the global multi-information is 7377.7 bits, though the estimated global coherence falls very slightly to 0.742. This is because low-numbered neurons which were quiescent before are now active, contributing to the global information, but the over-all pattern is somewhat weaker and more noisy (as can be seen from Fig. 1b.) So, as expected, the total information content is higher, but the overall coordination across the network is lower. 4 Conclusion Informational coherence provides a measure of neural information sharing and coordinated activity which accommodates nonlinear, stochastic relationships between extended patterns of spiking. It is robust to dynamical noise and leads to a genuinely multivariate measure of global coordination across networks or regions. Applied to data from multi-electrode recordings, it should be a valuable tool in evaluating hypotheses about distributed neural representation and function. Acknowledgments Thanks to R. Haslinger, E.

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>5 0.51873416 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Off-policy_Learning_with_Options_and_Recognizers.html">144 nips-2005-Off-policy Learning with Options and Recognizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Doina Precup, Cosmin Paduraru, Anna Koop, Richard S. Sutton, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for off-policy temporal-difference learning with function approximation that has lower variance and requires less knowledge of the behavior policy than prior methods. We develop the notion of a recognizer, a ﬁlter on actions that distorts the behavior policy to produce a related target policy with low-variance importance-sampling corrections. We also consider target policies that are deviations from the state distribution of the behavior policy, such as potential temporally abstract options, which further reduces variance. This paper introduces recognizers and their potential advantages, then develops a full algorithm for linear function approximation and proves that its updates are in the same direction as on-policy TD updates, which implies asymptotic convergence. Even though our algorithm is based on importance sampling, we prove that it requires absolutely no knowledge of the behavior policy for the case of state-aggregation function approximators. Off-policy learning is learning about one way of behaving while actually behaving in another way. For example, Q-learning is an off- policy learning method because it learns about the optimal policy while taking actions in a more exploratory fashion, e.g., according to an ε-greedy policy. Off-policy learning is of interest because only one way of selecting actions can be used at any time, but we would like to learn about many different ways of behaving from the single resultant stream of experience. For example, the options framework for temporal abstraction involves considering a variety of different ways of selecting actions. For each such option one would like to learn a model of its possible outcomes suitable for planning and other uses. Such option models have been proposed as fundamental building blocks of grounded world knowledge (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2005). Using off-policy learning, one would be able to learn predictive models for many options at the same time from a single stream of experience. Unfortunately, off-policy learning using temporal-difference methods has proven problematic when used in conjunction with function approximation. Function approximation is essential in order to handle the large state spaces that are inherent in many problem do- mains. Q-learning, for example, has been proven to converge to an optimal policy in the tabular case, but is unsound and may diverge in the case of linear function approximation (Baird, 1996). Precup, Sutton, and Dasgupta (2001) introduced and proved convergence for the ﬁrst off-policy learning algorithm with linear function approximation. They addressed the problem of learning the expected value of a target policy based on experience generated using a different behavior policy. They used importance sampling techniques to reduce the off-policy case to the on-policy case, where existing convergence theorems apply (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Tadic, 2001). There are two important difﬁculties with that approach. First, the behavior policy needs to be stationary and known, because it is needed to compute the importance sampling corrections. Second, the importance sampling weights are often ill-conditioned. In the worst case, the variance could be inﬁnite and convergence would not occur. The conditions required to prevent this were somewhat awkward and, even when they applied and asymptotic convergence was assured, the variance could still be high and convergence could be slow. In this paper we address both of these problems in the context of off-policy learning for options. We introduce the notion of a recognizer. Rather than specifying an explicit target policy (for instance, the policy of an option), about which we want to make predictions, a recognizer speciﬁes a condition on the actions that are selected. For example, a recognizer for the temporally extended action of picking up a cup would not specify which hand is to be used, or what the motion should be at all different positions of the cup. The recognizer would recognize a whole variety of directions of motion and poses as part of picking the cup. The advantage of this strategy is not that one might prefer a multitude of different behaviors, but that the behavior may be based on a variety of different strategies, all of which are relevant, and we would like to learn from any of them. In general, a recognizer is a function that recognizes or accepts a space of different ways of behaving and thus, can learn from a wider range of data. Recognizers have two advantages over direct speciﬁcation of a target policy: 1) they are a natural and easy way to specify a target policy for which importance sampling will be well conditioned, and 2) they do not require the behavior policy to be known. The latter is important because in many cases we may have little knowledge of the behavior policy, or a stationary behavior policy may not even exist. We show that for the case of state aggregation, even if the behavior policy is unknown, convergence to a good model is achieved. 1 Non-sequential example The beneﬁts of using recognizers in off-policy learning can be most easily seen in a nonsequential context with a single continuous action. Suppose you are given a sequence of sample actions ai ∈ [0, 1], selected i.i.d. according to probability density b : [0, 1] → ℜ+ (the behavior density). For example, suppose the behavior density is of the oscillatory form shown as a red line in Figure 1. For each each action, ai , we observe a corresponding outcome, zi ∈ ℜ, a random variable whose distribution depends only on ai . Thus the behavior density induces an outcome density. The on-policy problem is to estimate the mean mb of the outcome density. This problem can be solved simply by averaging the sample outcomes: mb = (1/n) ∑n zi . The off-policy problem is to use this same data to learn what ˆ i=1 the mean would be if actions were selected in some way other than b, for example, if the actions were restricted to a designated range, such as between 0.7 and 0.9. There are two natural ways to pose this off-policy problem. The most straightforward way is to be equally interested in all actions within the designated region. One professes to be interested in actions selected according to a target density π : [0, 1] → ℜ+ , which in the example would be 5.0 between 0.7 and 0.9, and zero elsewhere, as in the dashed line in 12 Probability density functions 1.5 Target policy with recognizer 1 Target policy w/o recognizer without recognizer .5 Behavior policy 0 0 Action 0.7 Empirical variances (average of 200 sample variances) 0.9 1 0 10 with recognizer 100 200 300 400 500 Number of sample actions Figure 1: The left panel shows the behavior policy and the target policies for the formulations of the problem with and without recognizers. The right panel shows empirical estimates of the variances for the two formulations as a function of the number sample actions. The lowest line is for the formulation using empirically-estimated recognition probabilities. Figure 1 (left). The importance- sampling estimate of the mean outcome is 1 n π(ai ) mπ = ∑ ˆ zi . n i=1 b(ai ) (1) This approach is problematic if there are parts of the region of interest where the behavior density is zero or very nearly so, such as near 0.72 and 0.85 in the example. Here the importance sampling ratios are exceedingly large and the estimate is poorly conditioned (large variance). The upper curve in Figure 1 (right) shows the empirical variance of this estimate as a function of the number of samples. The spikes and uncertain decline of the empirical variance indicate that the distribution is very skewed and that the estimates are very poorly conditioned. The second way to pose the problem uses recognizers. One professes to be interested in actions to the extent that they are both selected by b and within the designated region. This leads to the target policy shown in blue in the left panel of Figure 1 (it is taller because it still must sum to 1). For this problem, the variance of (1) is much smaller, as shown in the lower two lines of Figure 1 (right). To make this way of posing the problem clear, we introduce the notion of a recognizer function c : A → ℜ+ . The action space in the example is A = [0, 1] and the recognizer is c(a) = 1 for a between 0.7 and 0.9 and is zero elsewhere. The target policy is deﬁned in general by c(a)b(a) c(a)b(a) = . (2) π(a) = µ ∑x c(x)b(x) where µ = ∑x c(x)b(x) is a constant, equal to the probability of recognizing an action from the behavior policy. Given π, mπ from (1) can be rewritten in terms of the recognizer as ˆ n π(ai ) 1 n c(ai )b(ai ) 1 1 n c(ai ) 1 mπ = ∑ zi ˆ = ∑ zi = ∑ zi (3) n i=1 b(ai ) n i=1 µ b(ai ) n i=1 µ Note that the target density does not appear at all in the last expression and that the behavior distribution appears only in µ, which is independent of the sample action. If this constant is known, then this estimator can be computed with no knowledge of π or b. The constant µ can easily be estimated as the fraction of recognized actions in the sample. The lowest line in Figure 1 (right) shows the variance of the estimator using this fraction in place of the recognition probability. Its variance is low, no worse than that of the exact algorithm, and apparently slightly lower. Because this algorithm does not use the behavior density, it can be applied when the behavior density is unknown or does not even exist. For example, suppose actions were selected in some deterministic, systematic way that in the long run produced an empirical distribution like b. This would be problematic for the other algorithms but would require no modiﬁcation of the recognition-fraction algorithm. 2 Recognizers improve conditioning of off-policy learning The main use of recognizers is in formulating a target density π about which we can successfully learn predictions, based on the current behavior being followed. Here we formalize this intuition. Theorem 1 Let A = {a1 , . . . ak } ⊆ A be a subset of all the possible actions. Consider a ﬁxed behavior policy b and let πA be the class of policies that only choose actions from A, i.e., if π(a) > 0 then a ∈ A. Then the policy induced by b and the binary recognizer cA is the policy with minimum-variance one-step importance sampling corrections, among those in πA : π(ai ) 2 π as given by (2) = arg min Eb (4) π∈πA b(ai ) Proof: Denote π(ai ) = πi , b(ai ) = bi . Then the expected variance of the one-step importance sampling corrections is: Eb πi bi πi bi 2 2 − Eb = ∑ bi i πi bi 2 −1 = ∑ i π2 i − 1, bi where the summation (here and everywhere below) is such that the action ai ∈ A. We want to ﬁnd πi that minimizes this expression, subject to the constraint that ∑i πi = 1. This is a constrained optimization problem. To solve it, we write down the corresponding Lagrangian: π2 L(πi , β) = ∑ i − 1 + β(∑ πi − 1) i i bi We take the partial derivatives wrt πi and β and set them to 0: βbi ∂L 2 = πi + β = 0 ⇒ πi = − ∂πi bi 2 (5) ∂L = πi − 1 = 0 ∂β ∑ i (6) By taking (5) and plugging into (6), we get the following expression for β: − β 2 bi = 1 ⇒ β = − 2∑ ∑i bi i By substituting β into (5) we obtain: πi = bi ∑i b i This is exactly the policy induced by the recognizer deﬁned by c(ai ) = 1 iff ai ∈ A. We also note that it is advantageous, from the point of view of minimizing the variance of the updates, to have recognizers that accept a broad range of actions: Theorem 2 Consider two binary recognizers c1 and c2 , such that µ1 > µ2 . Then the importance sampling corrections for c1 have lower variance than the importance sampling corrections for c2 . Proof: From the previous theorem, we have the variance of a recognizer cA : Var = ∑ i π2 bi i −1 = ∑ bi ∑ j∈A b j i 2 1 1 1 −1 = −1 = −1 bi µ ∑ j∈A b j 3 Formal framework for sequential problems We turn now to the full case of learning about sequential decision processes with function approximation. We use the standard framework in which an agent interacts with a stochastic environment. At each time step t, the agent receives a state st and chooses an action at . We assume for the moment that actions are selected according to a ﬁxed behavior policy, b : S × A → [0, 1] where b(s, a) is the probability of selecting action a in state s. The behavior policy is used to generate a sequence of experience (observations, actions and rewards). The goal is to learn, from this data, predictions about different ways of behaving. In this paper we focus on learning predictions about expected returns, but other predictions can be tackled as well (for instance, predictions of transition models for options (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), or predictions speciﬁed by a TD-network (Sutton & Tanner, 2005; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2006)). We assume that the state space is large or continuous, and function approximation must be used to compute any values of interest. In particular, we assume a space of feature vectors Φ and a mapping φ : S → Φ. We denote by φs the feature vector associated with s. An option is deﬁned as a triple o = I, π, β where I ⊆ S is the set of states in which the option can be initiated, π is the internal policy of the option and β : S → [0, 1] is a stochastic termination condition. In the option work (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), each of these elements has to be explicitly speciﬁed and ﬁxed in order for an option to be well deﬁned. Here, we will instead deﬁne options implicitly, using the notion of a recognizer. A recognizer is deﬁned as a function c : S × A → [0, 1], where c(s, a) indicates to what extent the recognizer allows action a in state s. An important special case, which we treat in this paper, is that of binary recognizers. In this case, c is an indicator function, specifying a subset of actions that are allowed, or recognized, given a particular state. Note that recognizers do not specify policies; instead, they merely give restrictions on the policies that are allowed or recognized. A recognizer c together with a behavior policy b generates a target policy π, where: b(s, a)c(s, a) b(s, a)c(s, a) π(s, a) = (7) = µ(s) ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x) The denominator of this fraction, µ(s) = ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x), is the recognition probability at s, i.e., the probability that an action will be accepted at s when behavior is generated according to b. The policy π is only deﬁned at states for which µ(s) > 0. The numerator gives the probability that action a is produced by the behavior and recognized in s. Note that if the recognizer accepts all state-action pairs, i.e. c(s, a) = 1, ∀s, a, then π is the same as b. Since a recognizer and a behavior policy can specify together a target policy, we can use recognizers as a way to specify policies for options, using (7). An option can only be initiated at a state for which at least one action is recognized, so µ(s) > 0, ∀s ∈ I. Similarly, the termination condition of such an option, β, is deﬁned as β(s) = 1 if µ(s) = 0. In other words, the option must terminate if no actions are recognized at a given state. At all other states, β can be deﬁned between 0 and 1 as desired. We will focus on computing the reward model of an option o, which represents the expected total return. The expected values of different features at the end of the option can be estimated similarly. The quantity that we want to compute is Eo {R(s)} = E{r1 + r2 + . . . + rT |s0 = s, π, β} where s ∈ I, experience is generated according to the policy of the option, π, and T denotes the random variable representing the time step at which the option terminates according to β. We assume that linear function approximation is used to represent these values, i.e. Eo {R(s)} ≈ θT φs where θ is a vector of parameters. 4 Off-policy learning algorithm In this section we present an adaptation of the off-policy learning algorithm of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) to the case of learning about options. Suppose that an option’s policy π was used to generate behavior. In this case, learning the reward model of the option is a special case of temporal-difference learning of value functions. The forward ¯ (n) view of this algorithm is as follows. Let Rt denote the truncated n-step return starting at ¯ (0) time step t and let yt denote the 0-step truncated return, Rt . By the deﬁnition of the n-step truncated return, we have: ¯ (n) ¯ (n−1) Rt = rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 . This is similar to the case of value functions, but it accounts for the possibility of terminating the option at time step t + 1. The λ-return is deﬁned in the usual way: ∞ ¯ (n) ¯ Rtλ = (1 − λ) ∑ λn−1 Rt . n=1 The parameters of the linear function approximator are updated on every time step proportionally to: ¯ ¯ ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 ) · · · (1 − βt ). In our case, however, trajectories are generated according to the behavior policy b. The main idea of the algorithm is to use importance sampling corrections in order to account for the difference in the state distribution of the two policies. Let ρt = (n) Rt , π(st ,at ) b(st ,at ) be the importance sampling ratio at time step t. The truncated n-step return, satisﬁes: (n) (n−1) Rt = ρt [rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 ]. The update to the parameter vector is proportional to: ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt ρ0 (1 − β1 ) · · · ρt−1 (1 − βt ). The following result shows that the expected updates of the on-policy and off-policy algorithms are the same. Theorem 3 For every time step t ≥ 0 and any initial state s, ¯ Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s]. (n) (n) ¯ Proof: First we will show by induction that Eb {Rt |s} = Eπ {Rt |s}, ∀n (which implies ¯ that Eb {Rtλ |s} = Eπ (Rtλ |s}). For n = 0, the statement is trivial. Assuming that it is true for n − 1, we have (n) Eb Rt |s = a ∑b(s, a)∑Pss ρ(s, a) a = s ∑∑ a Pss b(s, a) a s = a ∑π(s, a)∑Pss a (n−1) a rss + (1 − β(s ))Eb Rt+1 |s π(s, a) a ¯ (n−1) r + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s b(s, a) ss a ¯ (n−1) rss + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s ¯ (n) = Eπ Rt |s . s Now we are ready to prove the theorem’s main statement. Deﬁning Ωt to be the set of all trajectory components up to state st , we have: Eb {∆θt |s} = ∑ ω∈Ωt Pb (ω|s)Eb (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω t−1 ∏ ρi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 πi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 bi t−1 = t−1 ∑ ∏ bi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt Eb Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt ∏ i=0 t−1 = ∑ ∏ πi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt = ∑ ω∈Ωt ¯ Eπ Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) i=0 ¯ ¯ Pπ (ω|s)Eπ (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) = Eπ ∆θt |s . Note that we are able to use st and ω interchangeably because of the Markov property. ¯ Since we have shown that Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s] for any state s, it follows that the expected updates will also be equal for any distribution of the initial state s. When learning the model of options with data generated from the behavior policy b, the starting state distribution with respect to which the learning is performed, I0 is determined by the stationary distribution of the behavior policy, as well as the initiation set of the option I. We note also that the importance sampling corrections only have to be performed for the trajectory since the initiation of the updates for the option. No corrections are required for the experience prior to this point. This should generate updates that have signiﬁcantly lower variance than in the case of learning values of policies (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). Because of the termination condition of the option, β, ∆θ can quickly decay to zero. To avoid this problem, we can use a restart function g : S → [0, 1], such that g(st ) speciﬁes the extent to which the updating episode is considered to start at time t. Adding restarts generates a new forward update: t ∆θt = (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt ∑ gi ρi ...ρt−1 (1 − βi+1 )...(1 − βt ), (8) i=0 where Rtλ is the same as above. With an adaptation of the proof in Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001), we can show that we get the same expected value of updates by applying this algorithm from the original starting distribution as we would by applying the algorithm without restarts from a starting distribution deﬁned by I0 and g. We can turn this forward algorithm into an incremental, backward view algorithm in the following way: • Initialize k0 = g0 , e0 = k0 ∇θ y0 • At every time step t: δt = θt+1 = kt+1 = et+1 = ρt (rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )yt+1 ) − yt θt + αδt et ρt kt (1 − βt+1 ) + gt+1 λρt (1 − βt+1 )et + kt+1 ∇θ yt+1 Using a similar technique to that of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) and Sutton & Barto (1998), we can prove that the forward and backward algorithm are equivalent (omitted due to lack of space). This algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the variance of the updates is ﬁnite (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). In the case of options, the termination condition β can be used to ensure that this is the case. 5 Learning when the behavior policy is unknown In this section, we consider the case in which the behavior policy is unknown. This case is generally problematic for importance sampling algorithms, but the use of recognizers will allow us to deﬁne importance sampling corrections, as well as a convergent algorithm. Recall that when using a recognizer, the target policy of the option is deﬁned as: c(s, a)b(s, a) π(s, a) = µ(s) and the recognition probability becomes: π(s, a) c(s, a) = b(s, a) µ(s) Of course, µ(s) depends on b. If b is unknown, instead of µ(s), we will use a maximum likelihood estimate µ : S → [0, 1]. The structure used to compute µ will have to be compatible ˆ ˆ with the feature space used to represent the reward model. We will make this more precise below. Likewise, the recognizer c(s, a) will have to be deﬁned in terms of the features used to represent the model. We will then deﬁne the importance sampling corrections as: c(s, a) ˆ ρ(s, a) = µ(s) ˆ ρ(s, a) = We consider the case in which the function approximator used to model the option is actually a state aggregator. In this case, we will deﬁne recognizers which behave consistently in each partition, i.e., c(s, a) = c(p, a), ∀s ∈ p. This means that an action is either recognized or not recognized in all states of the partition. The recognition probability µ will have one ˆ entry for every partition p of the state space. Its value will be: N(p, c = 1) µ(p) = ˆ N(p) where N(p) is the number of times partition p was visited, and N(p, c = 1) is the number of times the action taken in p was recognized. In the limit, w.p.1, µ converges to ˆ ∑s d b (s|p) ∑a c(p, a)b(s, a) where d b (s|p) is the probability of visiting state s from partiˆ ˆ tion p under the stationary distribution of b. At this limit, π(s, a) = ρ(s, a)b(s, a) will be a ˆ well-deﬁned policy (i.e., ∑a π(s, a) = 1). Using Theorem 3, off-policy updates using imˆ portance sampling corrections ρ will have the same expected value as on-policy updates ˆ ˆ using π. Note though that the learning algorithm never uses π; the only quantities needed ˆ are ρ, which are learned incrementally from data. For the case of general linear function approximation, we conjecture that a similar idea can be used, where the recognition probability is learned using logistic regression. The development of this part is left for future work.

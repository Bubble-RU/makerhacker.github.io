<p>Author: Jason Farquhar, David Hardoon, Hongying Meng, John S. Shawe-taylor, Sándor Szedmák</p><p>Abstract: Kernel methods make it relatively easy to deﬁne complex highdimensional feature spaces. This raises the question of how we can identify the relevant subspaces for a particular learning task. When two views of the same phenomenon are available kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) has been shown to be an effective preprocessing step that can improve the performance of classiﬁcation algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This paper takes this observation to its logical conclusion and proposes a method that combines this two stage learning (KCCA followed by SVM) into a single optimisation termed SVM-2K. We present both experimental and theoretical analysis of the approach showing encouraging results and insights. 1</p><p>3 0.050984539 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Aggregation_by_Mirror_Descent_with_Averaging.html">82 nips-2005-Generalization Error Bounds for Aggregation by Mirror Descent with Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Anatoli Juditsky, Alexander Nazin, Alexandre Tsybakov, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing an aggregated estimator from a ﬁnite class of base functions which approximately minimizes a convex risk functional under the ℓ1 constraint. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic procedure, the mirror descent, which performs gradient descent in the dual space. The generated estimates are additionally averaged in a recursive fashion with speciﬁc weights. Mirror descent algorithms have been developed in different contexts and they are known to be particularly efﬁcient in high dimensional problems. Moreover their implementation is adapted to the online setting. The main result of the paper is the upper bound on the convergence rate for the generalization error. 1</p><p>4 0.045787752 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Inference_with_Minimal_Communication%3A_a_Decision-Theoretic_Variational_Approach.html">96 nips-2005-Inference with Minimal Communication: a Decision-Theoretic Variational Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: O. P. Kreidl, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graphical model with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach leads to a novel message-passing algorithm to be executed ofﬂine, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative examples, (ii) assumptions that guarantee convergence and efﬁciency and (iii) connections to active research areas. 1</p><p>5 0.044380922 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Multiple_Related_Tasks_using_Latent_Independent_Component_Analysis.html">113 nips-2005-Learning Multiple Related Tasks using Latent Independent Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.</p><p>6 0.041867856 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Searching_for_Character_Models.html">171 nips-2005-Searching for Character Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Bhaskar D. Rao, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: Given a redundant dictionary of basis vectors (or atoms), our goal is to ﬁnd maximally sparse representations of signals. Previously, we have argued that a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework is particularly well-suited for this task, showing that it has far fewer local minima than other Bayesian-inspired strategies. In this paper, we provide further evidence for this claim by proving a restricted equivalence condition, based on the distribution of the nonzero generating model weights, whereby the SBL solution will equal the maximally sparse representation. We also prove that if these nonzero weights are drawn from an approximate Jeffreys prior, then with probability approaching one, our equivalence condition is satisﬁed. Finally, we motivate the worst-case scenario for SBL and demonstrate that it is still better than the most widely used sparse representation algorithms. These include Basis Pursuit (BP), which is based on a convex relaxation of the ℓ0 (quasi)-norm, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), a simple greedy strategy that iteratively selects basis vectors most aligned with the current residual. 1</p><p>4 0.52175814 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Spectral_Bounds_for_Sparse_PCA%3A_Exact_and_Greedy_Algorithms.html">180 nips-2005-Spectral Bounds for Sparse PCA: Exact and Greedy Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Baback Moghaddam, Yair Weiss, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA seeks approximate sparse “eigenvectors” whose projections capture the maximal variance of data. As a cardinality-constrained and non-convex optimization problem, it is NP-hard and is encountered in a wide range of applied ﬁelds, from bio-informatics to ﬁnance. Recent progress has focused mainly on continuous approximation and convex relaxation of the hard cardinality constraint. In contrast, we consider an alternative discrete spectral formulation based on variational eigenvalue bounds and provide an effective greedy strategy as well as provably optimal solutions using branch-and-bound search. Moreover, the exact methodology used reveals a simple renormalization step that improves approximate solutions obtained by any continuous method. The resulting performance gain of discrete algorithms is demonstrated on real-world benchmark data and in extensive Monte Carlo evaluation trials. 1</p><p>5 0.51634741 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Online_Discovery_and_Learning_of_Predictive_State_Representations.html">148 nips-2005-Online Discovery and Learning of Predictive State Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Mccracken, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a method of modeling dynamical systems using only observable data, such as actions and observations, to describe their model. PSRs use predictions about the outcome of future tests to summarize the system state. The best existing techniques for discovery and learning of PSRs use a Monte Carlo approach to explicitly estimate these outcome probabilities. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for discovery and learning of PSRs that uses a gradient descent approach to compute the predictions for the current state. The algorithm takes advantage of the large amount of structure inherent in a valid prediction matrix to constrain its predictions. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used online by an agent to constantly improve its prediction quality; something that current state of the art discovery and learning algorithms are unable to do. We give empirical results to show that our constrained gradient algorithm is able to discover core tests using very small amounts of data, and with larger amounts of data can compute accurate predictions of the system dynamics. 1</p><p>6 0.50346428 <a title="62-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-A_Domain_Decomposition_Method_for_Fast_Manifold_Learning.html">9 nips-2005-A Domain Decomposition Method for Fast Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Inna Weiner, Tomer Hertz, Israel Nelken, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to the characterization of complex sensory neurons. One of the main goals of characterizing sensory neurons is to characterize dimensions in stimulus space to which the neurons are highly sensitive (causing large gradients in the neural responses) or alternatively dimensions in stimulus space to which the neuronal response are invariant (deﬁning iso-response manifolds). We formulate this problem as that of learning a geometry on stimulus space that is compatible with the neural responses: the distance between stimuli should be large when the responses they evoke are very different, and small when the responses they evoke are similar. Here we show how to successfully train such distance functions using rather limited amount of information. The data consisted of the responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of anesthetized cats to 32 stimuli derived from natural sounds. For each neuron, a subset of all pairs of stimuli was selected such that the responses of the two stimuli in a pair were either very similar or very dissimilar. The distance function was trained to ﬁt these constraints. The resulting distance functions generalized to predict the distances between the responses of a test stimulus and the trained stimuli. 1</p><p>4 0.5929898 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Multiple_Instance_Boosting_for_Object_Detection.html">131 nips-2005-Multiple Instance Boosting for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cha Zhang, John C. Platt, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: A good image object detection algorithm is accurate, fast, and does not require exact locations of objects in a training set. We can create such an object detector by taking the architecture of the Viola-Jones detector cascade and training it with a new variant of boosting that we call MILBoost. MILBoost uses cost functions from the Multiple Instance Learning literature combined with the AnyBoost framework. We adapt the feature selection criterion of MILBoost to optimize the performance of the Viola-Jones cascade. Experiments show that the detection rate is up to 1.6 times better using MILBoost. This increased detection rate shows the advantage of simultaneously learning the locations and scales of the objects in the training set along with the parameters of the classiﬁer. 1</p><p>5 0.59226525 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose correlations between variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlations. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. This perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and of its convergence in loopy graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.59193027 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Hot_Coupling%3A_A_Particle_Approach_to_Inference_and_Normalization_on_Pairwise_Undirected_Graphs.html">90 nips-2005-Hot Coupling: A Particle Approach to Inference and Normalization on Pairwise Undirected Graphs</a></p>

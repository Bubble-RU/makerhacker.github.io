<p>Author: Vidhya Navalpakkam, Laurent Itti</p><p>Abstract: Survival in the natural world demands the selection of relevant visual cues to rapidly and reliably guide attention towards prey and predators in cluttered environments. We investigate whether our visual system selects cues that guide search in an optimal manner. We formally obtain the optimal cue selection strategy by maximizing the signal to noise ratio (SN R) between a search target and surrounding distractors. This optimal strategy successfully accounts for several phenomena in visual search behavior, including the effect of target-distractor discriminability, uncertainty in target’s features, distractor heterogeneity, and linear separability. Furthermore, the theory generates a new prediction, which we verify through psychophysical experiments with human subjects. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that humans select visual cues so as to maximize SN R between the targets and surrounding clutter.</p><p>3 0.24584982 <a title="141-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-An_exploration-exploitation_model_based_on_norepinepherine_and_dopamine_activity.html">26 nips-2005-An exploration-exploitation model based on norepinepherine and dopamine activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel M. McClure, Mark S. Gilzenrat, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model by which dopamine (DA) and norepinepherine (NE) combine to alternate behavior between relatively exploratory and exploitative modes. The model is developed for a target detection task for which there is extant single neuron recording data available from locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons. An exploration-exploitation trade-off is elicited by regularly switching which of the two stimuli are rewarded. DA functions within the model to change synaptic weights according to a reinforcement learning algorithm. Exploration is mediated by the state of LC firing, with higher tonic and lower phasic activity producing greater response variability. The opposite state of LC function, with lower baseline firing rate and greater phasic responses, favors exploitative behavior. Changes in LC firing mode result from combined measures of response conflict and reward rate, where response conflict is monitored using models of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Increased long-term response conflict and decreased reward rate, which occurs following reward contingency switch, favors the higher tonic state of LC function and NE release. This increases exploration, and facilitates discovery of the new target. 1 In t rod u ct i on A central problem in reinforcement learning is determining how to adaptively move between exploitative and exploratory behaviors in changing environments. We propose a set of neurophysiologic mechanisms whose interaction may mediate this behavioral shift. Empirical work on the midbrain dopamine (DA) system has suggested that this system is particularly well suited for guiding exploitative behaviors. This hypothesis has been reified by a number of studies showing that a temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm accounts for activity in these neurons in a wide variety of behavioral tasks [1,2]. DA release is believed to encode a reward prediction error signal that acts to change synaptic weights relevant for producing behaviors [3]. Through learning, this allows neural pathways to predict future expected reward through the relative strength of their synaptic connections [1]. Decision-making procedures based on these value estimates are necessarily greedy. Including reward bonuses for exploratory choices supports non-greedy actions [4] and accounts for additional data derived from DA neurons [5]. We show that combining a DA learning algorithm with models of response conflict detection [6] and NE function [7] produces an effective annealing procedure for alternating between exploration and exploitation. NE neurons within the LC alternate between two firing modes [8]. In the first mode, known as the phasic mode, NE neurons fire at a low baseline rate but have relatively robust phasic responses to behaviorally salient stimuli. The second mode, called the tonic mode, is associated with a higher baseline firing and absent or attenuated phasic responses. The effects of NE on efferent areas are modulatory in nature, and are well captured as a change in the gain of efferent inputs so that neuronal responses are potentiated in the presence of NE [9]. Thus, in phasic mode, the LC provides transient facilitation in processing, time-locked to the presence of behaviorally salient information in motor or decision areas. Conversely, in tonic mode, higher overall LC discharge rate increases gain generally and hence increases the probability of arbitrary responding. Consistent with this account, for periods when NE neurons are in the phasic mode, monkey performance is nearly perfect. However, when NE neurons are in the tonic mode, performance is more erratic, with increased response times and error rate [8]. These findings have led to a recent characterization of the LC as a dynamic temporal filter, adjusting the system's relative responsivity to salient and irrelevant information [8]. In this way, the LC is ideally positioned to mediate the shift between exploitative and exploratory behavior. The parameters that underlie changes in LC firing mode remain largely unexplored. Based on data from a target detection task by Aston-Jones and colleagues [10], we propose that LC firing mode is determined in part by measures of response conflict and reward rate as calculated by the ACC and OFC, respectively [8]. Together, the ACC and OFC are the principle sources of cortical input to the LC [8]. Activity in the ACC is known, largely through human neuroimaging experiments, to change in accord with response conflict [6]. In brief, relatively equal activity in competing behavioral responses (reflecting uncertainty) produces high conflict. Low conflict results when one behavioral response predominates. We propose that increased long-term response conflict biases the LC towards a tonic firing mode. Increased conflict necessarily follows changes in reward contingency. As the previously rewarded target no longer produces reward, there will be a relative increase in response ambiguity and hence conflict. This relationship between conflict and LC firing is analogous to other modeling work [11], which proposes that increased tonic firing reflects increased environmental uncertainty. As a final component to our model, we hypothesize that the OFC maintains an ongoing estimate in reward rate, and that this estimate of reward rate also influences LC firing mode. As reward rate increases, we assume that the OFC tends to bias the LC in favor of phasic firing to target stimuli. We have aimed to fix model parameters based on previous work using simpler networks. We use parameters derived primarily from a previous model of the LC by Gilzenrat and colleagues [7]. Integration of response conflict by the ACC and its influence on LC firing was borrowed from unpublished work by Gilzenrat and colleagues in which they fit human behavioral data in a diminishing utilities task. Given this approach, we interpret our observed improvement in model performance with combined NE and DA function as validation of a mechanism for automatically switching between exploitative and exploratory action selection. 2 G o- No- G o Task and Core Mod el We have modeled an experiment in which monkeys performed a target detection task [10]. In the task, monkeys were shown either a vertical bar or a horizontal bar and were required to make or omit a motor response appropriately. Initially, the vertical bar was the target stimulus and correctly responding was rewarded with a squirt of fruit juice (r=1 in the model). Responding to the non-target horizontal stimulus resulted in time out punishment (r=-.1; Figure 1A). No responses to either the target or non-target gave zero reward. After the monkeys had fully acquired the task, the experimenters periodically switched the reward contingency such that the previously rewarded stimulus (target) became the distractor, and vice versa. Following such reversals, LC neurons were observed to change from emitting phasic bursts of firing to the target, to tonic firing following the switch, and slowly back to phasic firing for the new target as the new response criteria was obtained [10]. Figure 1: Task and model design. (A) Responses were required for targets in order to obtain reward. Responses to distractors resulted in a minor punishment. No responses gave zero reward. (B) In the model, vertical and horizontal bar inputs (I1 and I 2 ) fed to integrator neurons (X1 and X2 ) which then drove response units (Y1 and Y2 ). Responses were made if Y 1 or Y2 crossed a threshold while input units were active. We have previously modeled this task [7,12] with a three-layer connectionist network in which two input units, I1 and I 2 , corresponding to the vertical and horizontal bars, drive two mutually inhibitory integrator units, X1 and X2 . The integrator units subsequently feed two response units, Y1 and Y2 (Figure 1B). Responses are made whenever output from Y1 or Y2 crosses a threshold level of activity, θ. Relatively weak cross connections from each input unit to the opposite integrator unit (I1 to X2 and I 2 to X1 ) are intended to model stimulus similarity. Both the integrator and response units were modeled as noisy, leaky accumulators: ˙ X i =</p><p>4 0.23993517 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Top-Down_Control_of_Visual_Attention%3A_A_Rational_Account.html">194 nips-2005-Top-Down Control of Visual Attention: A Rational Account</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Shettel, Shaun Vecera, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Theories of visual attention commonly posit that early parallel processes extract conspicuous features such as color contrast and motion from the visual field. These features are then combined into a saliency map, and attention is directed to the most salient regions first. Top-down attentional control is achieved by modulating the contribution of different feature types to the saliency map. A key source of data concerning attentional control comes from behavioral studies in which the effect of recent experience is examined as individuals repeatedly perform a perceptual discrimination task (e.g., “what shape is the odd-colored object?”). The robust finding is that repetition of features of recent trials (e.g., target color) facilitates performance. We view this facilitation as an adaptation to the statistical structure of the environment. We propose a probabilistic model of the environment that is updated after each trial. Under the assumption that attentional control operates so as to make performance more efficient for more likely environmental states, we obtain parsimonious explanations for data from four different experiments. Further, our model provides a rational explanation for why the influence of past experience on attentional control is short lived. 1 INTRODUCTION The brain does not have the computational capacity to fully process the massive quantity of information provided by the eyes. Selective attention operates to filter the spatiotemporal stream to a manageable quantity. Key to understanding the nature of attention is discovering the algorithm governing selection, i.e., understanding what information will be selected and what will be suppressed. Selection is influenced by attributes of the spatiotemporal stream, often referred to as bottom-up contributions to attention. For example, attention is drawn to abrupt onsets, motion, and regions of high contrast in brightness and color. Most theories of attention posit that some visual information processing is performed preattentively and in parallel across the visual field. This processing extracts primitive visual features such as color and motion, which provide the bottom-up cues for attentional guidance. However, attention is not driven willy nilly by these cues. The deployment of attention can be modulated by task instructions, current goals, and domain knowledge, collectively referred to as top-down contributions to attention. How do bottom-up and top-down contributions to attention interact? Most psychologically and neurobiologically motivated models propose a very similar architecture in which information from bottom-up and top-down sources combines in a saliency (or activation) map (e.g., Itti et al., 1998; Koch & Ullman, 1985; Mozer, 1991; Wolfe, 1994). The saliency map indicates, for each location in the visual field, the relative importance of that location. Attention is drawn to the most salient locations first. Figure 1 sketches the basic architecture that incorporates bottom-up and top-down contributions to the saliency map. The visual image is analyzed to extract maps of primitive features such as color and orientation. Associated with each location in a map is a scalar visual image horizontal primitive feature maps vertical green top-down gains red saliency map FIGURE 1. An attentional saliency map constructed from bottom-up and top-down information bottom-up activations FIGURE 2. Sample display from Experiment 1 of Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994) response or activation indicating the presence of a particular feature. Most models assume that responses are stronger at locations with high local feature contrast, consistent with neurophysiological data, e.g., the response of a red feature detector to a red object is stronger if the object is surrounded by green objects. The saliency map is obtained by taking a sum of bottom-up activations from the feature maps. The bottom-up activations are modulated by a top-down gain that specifies the contribution of a particular map to saliency in the current task and environment. Wolfe (1994) describes a heuristic algorithm for determining appropriate gains in a visual search task, where the goal is to detect a target object among distractor objects. Wolfe proposes that maps encoding features that discriminate between target and distractors have higher gains, and to be consistent with the data, he proposes limits on the magnitude of gain modulation and the number of gains that can be modulated. More recently, Wolfe et al. (2003) have been explicit in proposing optimization as a principle for setting gains given the task definition and stimulus environment. One aspect of optimizing attentional control involves configuring the attentional system to perform a given task; for example, in a visual search task for a red vertical target among green vertical and red horizontal distractors, the task definition should result in a higher gain for red and vertical feature maps than for other feature maps. However, there is a more subtle form of gain modulation, which depends on the statistics of display environments. For example, if green vertical distractors predominate, then red is a better discriminative cue than vertical; and if red horizontal distractors predominate, then vertical is a better discriminative cue than red. In this paper, we propose a model that encodes statistics of the environment in order to allow for optimization of attentional control to the structure of the environment. Our model is designed to address a key set of behavioral data, which we describe next. 1.1 Attentional priming phenomena Psychological studies involve a sequence of experimental trials that begin with a stimulus presentation and end with a response from the human participant. Typically, trial order is randomized, and the context preceding a trial is ignored. However, in sequential studies, performance is examined on one trial contingent on the past history of trials. These sequential studies explore how experience influences future performance. Consider a the sequential attentional task of Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994). On each trial, the stimulus display (Figure 2) consists of three notched diamonds, one a singleton in color—either green among red or red among green. The task is to report whether the singleton diamond, referred to as the target, is notched on the left or the right. The task is easy because the singleton pops out, i.e., the time to locate the singleton does not depend on the number of diamonds in the display. Nonetheless, the response time significantly depends on the sequence of trials leading up to the current trial: If the target is the same color on the cur- rent trial as on the previous trial, response time is roughly 100 ms faster than if the target is a different color on the current trial. Considering that response times are on the order of 700 ms, this effect, which we term attentional priming, is gigantic in the scheme of psychological phenomena. 2 ATTENTIONAL CONTROL AS ADAPTATION TO THE STATISTICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT We interpret the phenomenon of attentional priming via a particular perspective on attentional control, which can be summarized in two bullets. • The perceptual system dynamically constructs a probabilistic model of the environment based on its past experience. • Control parameters of the attentional system are tuned so as to optimize performance under the current environmental model. The primary focus of this paper is the environmental model, but we first discuss the nature of performance optimization. The role of attention is to make processing of some stimuli more efficient, and consequently, the processing of other stimuli less efficient. For example, if the gain on the red feature map is turned up, processing will be efficient for red items, but competition from red items will reduce the efficiency for green items. Thus, optimal control should tune the system for the most likely states of the world by minimizing an objective function such as: J(g) = ∑ P ( e )RT g ( e ) (1) e where g is a vector of top-down gains, e is an index over environmental states, P(.) is the probability of an environmental state, and RTg(.) is the expected response time—assuming a constant error rate—to the environmental state under gains g. Determining the optimal gains is a challenge because every gain setting will result in facilitation of responses to some environmental states but hindrance of responses to other states. The optimal control problem could be solved via direct reinforcement learning, but the rapidity of human learning makes this possibility unlikely: In a variety of experimental tasks, evidence suggests that adaptation to a new task or environment can occur in just one or two trials (e.g., Rogers & Monsell, 1996). Model-based reinforcement learning is an attractive alternative, because given a model, optimization can occur without further experience in the real world. Although the number of real-world trials necessary to achieve a given level of performance is comparable for direct and model-based reinforcement learning in stationary environments (Kearns & Singh, 1999), naturalistic environments can be viewed as highly nonstationary. In such a situation, the framework we suggest is well motivated: After each experience, the environment model is updated. The updated environmental model is then used to retune the attentional system. In this paper, we propose a particular model of the environment suitable for visual search tasks. Rather than explicitly modeling the optimization of attentional control by setting gains, we assume that the optimization process will serve to minimize Equation 1. Because any gain adjustment will facilitate performance in some environmental states and hinder performance in others, an optimized control system should obtain faster reaction times for more probable environmental states. This assumption allows us to explain experimental results in a minimal, parsimonious framework. 3 MODELING THE ENVIRONMENT Focusing on the domain of visual search, we characterize the environment in terms of a probability distribution over configurations of target and distractor features. We distinguish three classes of features: defining, reported, and irrelevant. To explain these terms, consider the task of searching a display of size varying, colored, notched diamonds (Figure 2), with the task of detecting the singleton in color and judging the notch location. Color is the defining feature, notch location is the reported feature, and size is an irrelevant feature. To simplify the exposition, we treat all features as having discrete values, an assumption which is true of the experimental tasks we model. We begin by considering displays containing a single target and a single distractor, and shortly generalize to multidistractor displays. We use the framework of Bayesian networks to characterize the environment. Each feature of the target and distractor is a discrete random variable, e.g., Tcolor for target color and Dnotch for the location of the notch on the distractor. The Bayes net encodes the probability distribution over environmental states; in our working example, this distribution is P(Tcolor, Tsize, Tnotch, Dcolor, Dsize, Dnotch). The structure of the Bayes net specifies the relationships among the features. The simplest model one could consider would be to treat the features as independent, illustrated in Figure 3a for singleton-color search task. The opposite extreme would be the full joint distribution, which could be represented by a look up table indexed by the six features, or by the cascading Bayes net architecture in Figure 3b. The architecture we propose, which we’ll refer to as the dominance model (Figure 3c), has an intermediate dependency structure, and expresses the joint distribution as: P(Tcolor)P(Dcolor |Tcolor)P(Tsize |Tcolor)P(Tnotch |Tcolor)P(Dsize |Dcolor)P(Dnotch |Tcolor). The structured model is constructed based on three rules. 1. The defining feature of the target is at the root of the tree. 2. The defining feature of the distractor is conditionally dependent on the defining feature of the target. We refer to this rule as dominance of the target over the distractor. 3. The reported and irrelevant features of target (distractor) are conditionally dependent on the defining feature of the target (distractor). We refer to this rule as dominance of the defining feature over nondefining features. As we will demonstrate, the dominance model produces a parsimonious account of a wide range of experimental data. 3.1 Updating the environment model The model’s parameters are the conditional distributions embodied in the links. In the example of Figure 3c with binary random variables, the model has 11 parameters. However, these parameters are determined by the environment: To be adaptive in nonstationary environments, the model must be updated following each experienced state. We propose a simple exponentially weighted averaging approach. For two variables V and W with observed values v and w on trial t, a conditional distribution, P t ( V = u W = w ) = δ uv , is (a) Tcolor Dcolor Tsize Tnotch (b) Tcolor Dcolor Dsize Tsize Dnotch Tnotch (c) Tcolor Dcolor Dsize Tsize Dsize Dnotch Tnotch Dnotch FIGURE 3. Three models of a visual-search environment with colored, notched, size-varying diamonds. (a) feature-independence model; (b) full-joint model; (c) dominance model. defined, where δ is the Kronecker delta. The distribution representing the environment E following trial t, denoted P t , is then updated as follows: E E P t ( V = u W = w ) = αP t – 1 ( V = u W = w ) + ( 1 – α )P t ( V = u W = w ) (2) for all u, where α is a memory constant. Note that no update is performed for values of W other than w. An analogous update is performed for unconditional distributions. E How the model is initialized—i.e., specifying P 0 —is irrelevant, because all experimental tasks that we model, participants begin the experiment with many dozens of practice trials. E Data is not collected during practice trials. Consequently, any transient effects of P 0 do E not impact the results. In our simulations, we begin with a uniform distribution for P 0 , and include practice trials as in the human studies. Thus far, we’ve assumed a single target and a single distractor. The experiments that we model involve multiple distractors. The simple extension we require to handle multiple distractors is to define a frequentist probability for each distractor feature V, P t ( V = v W = w ) = C vw ⁄ C w , where C vw is the count of co-occurrences of feature values v and w among the distractors, and C w is the count of w. Our model is extremely simple. Given a description of the visual search task and environment, the model has only a single degree of freedom, α . In all simulations, we fix α = 0.75 ; however, the choice of α does not qualitatively impact any result. 4 SIMULATIONS In this section, we show that the model can explain a range of data from four different experiments examining attentional priming. All experiments measure response times of participants. On each trial, the model can be used to obtain a probability of the display configuration (the environmental state) on that trial, given the history of trials to that point. Our critical assumption—as motivated earlier—is that response times monotonically decrease with increasing probability, indicating that visual information processing is better configured for more likely environmental states. The particular relationship we assume is that response times are linear in log probability. This assumption yields long response time tails, as are observed in all human studies. 4.1 Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994, Experiment 5) In this experiment, participants were asked to search for a singleton in color in a display of three red or green diamonds. Each diamond was notched on either the left or right side, and the task was to report the side of the notch on the color singleton. The well-practiced participants made very few errors. Reaction time (RT) was examined as a function of whether the target on a given trial is the same or different color as the target on trial n steps back or ahead. Figure 4 shows the results, with the human RTs in the left panel and the simulation log probabilities in the right panel. The horizontal axis represents n. Both graphs show the same outcome: repetition of target color facilitates performance. This influence lasts only for a half dozen trials, with an exponentially decreasing influence further into the past. In the model, this decreasing influence is due to the exponential decay of recent history (Equation 2). Figure 4 also shows that—as expected—the future has no influence on the current trial. 4.2 Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994, Experiment 8) In the previous experiment, it is impossible to determine whether facilitation is due to repetition of the target’s color or the distractor’s color, because the display contains only two colors, and therefore repetition of target color implies repetition of distractor color. To unconfound these two potential factors, an experiment like the previous one was con- ducted using four distinct colors, allowing one to examine the effect of repeating the target color while varying the distractor color, and vice versa. The sequence of trials was composed of subsequences of up-to-six consecutive trials with either the target or distractor color held constant while the other color was varied trial to trial. Following each subsequence, both target and distractors were changed. Figure 5 shows that for both humans and the simulation, performance improves toward an asymptote as the number of target and distractor repetitions increases; in the model, the asymptote is due to the probability of the repeated color in the environment model approaching 1.0. The performance improvement is greater for target than distractor repetition; in the model, this difference is due to the dominance of the defining feature of the target over the defining feature of the distractor. 4.3 Huang, Holcombe, and Pashler (2004, Experiment 1) Huang et al. (2004) and Hillstrom (2000) conducted studies to determine whether repetitions of one feature facilitate performance independently of repetitions of another feature. In the Huang et al. study, participants searched for a singleton in size in a display consisting of lines that were short and long, slanted left or right, and colored white or black. The reported feature was target slant. Slant, size, and color were uncorrelated. Huang et al. discovered that repeating an irrelevant feature (color or orientation) facilitated performance, but only when the defining feature (size) was repeated. As shown in Figure 6, the model replicates human performance, due to the dominance of the defining feature over the reported and irrelevant features. 4.4 Wolfe, Butcher, Lee, and Hyde (2003, Experiment 1) In an empirical tour-de-force, Wolfe et al. (2003) explored singleton search over a range of environments. The task is to detect the presence or absence of a singleton in displays conHuman data Different Color 600 Different Color 590 580 570 15 13 11 9 7 Past 5 3.2 3 Same Color 2.8 Same Color 560 550 Simulation 3.4 log(P(trial)) Reaction Time (msec) 610 3 1 +1 +3 +5 Future 2.6 +7 15 13 Relative Trial Number 11 9 7 Past 5 3 1 +1 +3 +5 Future +7 Relative Trial Number FIGURE 4.

Target-absent trials were used primarily to ensure participants were searching the display. The experiment examined seven experimental conditions, which varied in the amount of uncertainty as to the target identity. The essential conditions, from least to most uncertainty, are: blocked (e.g., target always red vertical among green horizontals), mixed feature (e.g., target always a color singleton), mixed dimension (e.g., target either red or vertical), and fully mixed (target could be red, green, vertical, or horizontal). With this design, one can ascertain how uncertainty in the environment and in the target definition influence task difficulty. Because the defining feature in this experiment could be either color or orientation, we modeled the environment with two Bayes nets—one color dominant and one orientation dominant—and performed model averaging. A comparison of Figures 7a and 7b show a correspondence between human RTs and model predictions. Less uncertainty in the environment leads to more efficient performance. One interesting result from the model is its prediction that the mixed-feature condition is easier than the fully-mixed condition; that is, search is more efficient when the dimension (i.e., color vs. orientation) of the singleton is known, even though the model has no abstract representation of feature dimensions, only feature values. 4.5 Optimal adaptation constant In all simulations so far, we fixed the memory constant. From the human data, it is clear that memory for recent experience is relatively short lived, on the order of a half dozen trials (e.g., left panel of Figure 4). In this section we provide a rational argument for the short duration of memory in attentional control. Figure 7c shows mean negative log probability in each condition of the Wolfe et al. (2003) experiment, as a function of α . To assess these probabilities, for each experimental condition, the model was initialized so that all of the conditional distributions were uniform, and then a block of trials was run. Log probability for all trials in the block was averaged. The negative log probability (y axis of the Figure) is a measure of the model’s misprediction of the next trial in the sequence. For complex environments, such as the fully-mixed condition, a small memory constant is detrimental: With rapid memory decay, the effective history of trials is a high-variance sample of the distribution of environmental states. For simple environments, a large memory constant is detrimental: With slow memory decay, the model does not transition quickly from the initial environmental model to one that reflects the statistics of a new environment. Thus, the memory constant is constrained by being large enough that the environment model can hold on to sufficient history to represent complex environments, and by being small enough that the model adapts quickly to novel environments. If the conditions in Wolfe et al. give some indication of the range of naturalistic environments an agent encounters, we have a rational account of why attentional priming is so short lived. Whether priming lasts 2 trials or 20, the surprising empirical result is that it does not last 200 or 2000 trials. Our rational argument provides a rough insight into this finding.

Huang et al. (2004) and Hillstrom (2000) propose an episodic account in which a distinct memory trace—representing the complete configuration of features in the display—is laid down for each trial, and priming depends on configural similarity of the current trial to previous trials. Alternatively, Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994) and Wolfe et al. (2003) propose a feature-strengthening account in which detection of a feature on one trial increases its ability to attract attention on subsequent trials, and priming is proportional to the number of overlapping features from one trial to the next. The episodic account corresponds roughly to the full joint model (Figure 3b), and the feature-strengthening account corresponds roughly to the independence model (Figure 3a). Neither account is adequate to explain the range of data we presented. However, an intermediate account, the dominance model (Figure 3c), is not only sufficient, but it offers a parsimonious, rational explanation. Beyond the model’s basic assumptions, it has only one free parameter, and can explain results from diverse experimental paradigms. The model makes a further theoretical contribution. Wolfe et al. distinguish the environments in their experiment in terms of the amount of top-down control available, implying that different mechanisms might be operating in different environments. However, in our account, top-down control is not some substance distributed in different amounts depending on the nature of the environment. Our account treats all environments uniformly, relying on attentional control to adapt to the environment at hand. We conclude with two limitations of the present work. First, our account presumes a particular network architecture, instead of a more elegant Bayesian approach that specifies priors over architectures, and performs automatic model selection via the sequence of trials. We did explore such a Bayesian approach, but it was unable to explain the data. Second, at least one finding in the literature is problematic for the model. Hillstrom (2000) occasionally finds that RTs slow when an irrelevant target feature is repeated but the defining target feature is not. However, because this effect is observed only in some experiments, it is likely that any model would require elaboration to explain the variability.

<p>Author: Inna Weiner, Tomer Hertz, Israel Nelken, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to the characterization of complex sensory neurons. One of the main goals of characterizing sensory neurons is to characterize dimensions in stimulus space to which the neurons are highly sensitive (causing large gradients in the neural responses) or alternatively dimensions in stimulus space to which the neuronal response are invariant (deﬁning iso-response manifolds). We formulate this problem as that of learning a geometry on stimulus space that is compatible with the neural responses: the distance between stimuli should be large when the responses they evoke are very different, and small when the responses they evoke are similar. Here we show how to successfully train such distance functions using rather limited amount of information. The data consisted of the responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of anesthetized cats to 32 stimuli derived from natural sounds. For each neuron, a subset of all pairs of stimuli was selected such that the responses of the two stimuli in a pair were either very similar or very dissimilar. The distance function was trained to ﬁt these constraints. The resulting distance functions generalized to predict the distances between the responses of a test stimulus and the trained stimuli. 1</p><p>6 0.14193091 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Extracting_Dynamical_Structure_Embedded_in_Neural_Activity.html">67 nips-2005-Extracting Dynamical Structure Embedded in Neural Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Experimental data indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in aspects of vigilance and attention. Previously, we considered the function of this neuromodulatory system on a time scale of minutes and longer, and suggested that it signals global uncertainty arising from gross changes in environmental contingencies. However, norepinephrine is also known to be activated phasically by familiar stimuli in welllearned tasks. Here, we extend our uncertainty-based treatment of norepinephrine to this phasic mode, proposing that it is involved in the detection and reaction to state uncertainty within a task. This role of norepinephrine can be understood through the metaphor of neural interrupts. 1</p><p>2 0.8239935 <a title="141-lsi-2" href="./nips-2005-Optimal_cue_selection_strategy.html">149 nips-2005-Optimal cue selection strategy</a></p>
<p>Author: Vidhya Navalpakkam, Laurent Itti</p><p>Abstract: Survival in the natural world demands the selection of relevant visual cues to rapidly and reliably guide attention towards prey and predators in cluttered environments. We investigate whether our visual system selects cues that guide search in an optimal manner. We formally obtain the optimal cue selection strategy by maximizing the signal to noise ratio (SN R) between a search target and surrounding distractors. This optimal strategy successfully accounts for several phenomena in visual search behavior, including the effect of target-distractor discriminability, uncertainty in target’s features, distractor heterogeneity, and linear separability. Furthermore, the theory generates a new prediction, which we verify through psychophysical experiments with human subjects. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that humans select visual cues so as to maximize SN R between the targets and surrounding clutter.</p><p>3 0.75572342 <a title="141-lsi-3" href="./nips-2005-Top-Down_Control_of_Visual_Attention%3A_A_Rational_Account.html">194 nips-2005-Top-Down Control of Visual Attention: A Rational Account</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Shettel, Shaun Vecera, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Theories of visual attention commonly posit that early parallel processes extract conspicuous features such as color contrast and motion from the visual field. These features are then combined into a saliency map, and attention is directed to the most salient regions first. Top-down attentional control is achieved by modulating the contribution of different feature types to the saliency map. A key source of data concerning attentional control comes from behavioral studies in which the effect of recent experience is examined as individuals repeatedly perform a perceptual discrimination task (e.g., “what shape is the odd-colored object?”). The robust finding is that repetition of features of recent trials (e.g., target color) facilitates performance. We view this facilitation as an adaptation to the statistical structure of the environment. We propose a probabilistic model of the environment that is updated after each trial. Under the assumption that attentional control operates so as to make performance more efficient for more likely environmental states, we obtain parsimonious explanations for data from four different experiments. Further, our model provides a rational explanation for why the influence of past experience on attentional control is short lived. 1 INTRODUCTION The brain does not have the computational capacity to fully process the massive quantity of information provided by the eyes. Selective attention operates to filter the spatiotemporal stream to a manageable quantity. Key to understanding the nature of attention is discovering the algorithm governing selection, i.e., understanding what information will be selected and what will be suppressed. Selection is influenced by attributes of the spatiotemporal stream, often referred to as bottom-up contributions to attention. For example, attention is drawn to abrupt onsets, motion, and regions of high contrast in brightness and color. Most theories of attention posit that some visual information processing is performed preattentively and in parallel across the visual field. This processing extracts primitive visual features such as color and motion, which provide the bottom-up cues for attentional guidance. However, attention is not driven willy nilly by these cues. The deployment of attention can be modulated by task instructions, current goals, and domain knowledge, collectively referred to as top-down contributions to attention. How do bottom-up and top-down contributions to attention interact? Most psychologically and neurobiologically motivated models propose a very similar architecture in which information from bottom-up and top-down sources combines in a saliency (or activation) map (e.g., Itti et al., 1998; Koch & Ullman, 1985; Mozer, 1991; Wolfe, 1994). The saliency map indicates, for each location in the visual field, the relative importance of that location. Attention is drawn to the most salient locations first. Figure 1 sketches the basic architecture that incorporates bottom-up and top-down contributions to the saliency map. The visual image is analyzed to extract maps of primitive features such as color and orientation. Associated with each location in a map is a scalar visual image horizontal primitive feature maps vertical green top-down gains red saliency map FIGURE 1. An attentional saliency map constructed from bottom-up and top-down information bottom-up activations FIGURE 2. Sample display from Experiment 1 of Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994) response or activation indicating the presence of a particular feature. Most models assume that responses are stronger at locations with high local feature contrast, consistent with neurophysiological data, e.g., the response of a red feature detector to a red object is stronger if the object is surrounded by green objects. The saliency map is obtained by taking a sum of bottom-up activations from the feature maps. The bottom-up activations are modulated by a top-down gain that specifies the contribution of a particular map to saliency in the current task and environment. Wolfe (1994) describes a heuristic algorithm for determining appropriate gains in a visual search task, where the goal is to detect a target object among distractor objects. Wolfe proposes that maps encoding features that discriminate between target and distractors have higher gains, and to be consistent with the data, he proposes limits on the magnitude of gain modulation and the number of gains that can be modulated. More recently, Wolfe et al. (2003) have been explicit in proposing optimization as a principle for setting gains given the task definition and stimulus environment. One aspect of optimizing attentional control involves configuring the attentional system to perform a given task; for example, in a visual search task for a red vertical target among green vertical and red horizontal distractors, the task definition should result in a higher gain for red and vertical feature maps than for other feature maps. However, there is a more subtle form of gain modulation, which depends on the statistics of display environments. For example, if green vertical distractors predominate, then red is a better discriminative cue than vertical; and if red horizontal distractors predominate, then vertical is a better discriminative cue than red. In this paper, we propose a model that encodes statistics of the environment in order to allow for optimization of attentional control to the structure of the environment. Our model is designed to address a key set of behavioral data, which we describe next. 1.1 Attentional priming phenomena Psychological studies involve a sequence of experimental trials that begin with a stimulus presentation and end with a response from the human participant. Typically, trial order is randomized, and the context preceding a trial is ignored. However, in sequential studies, performance is examined on one trial contingent on the past history of trials. These sequential studies explore how experience influences future performance. Consider a the sequential attentional task of Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994). On each trial, the stimulus display (Figure 2) consists of three notched diamonds, one a singleton in color—either green among red or red among green. The task is to report whether the singleton diamond, referred to as the target, is notched on the left or the right. The task is easy because the singleton pops out, i.e., the time to locate the singleton does not depend on the number of diamonds in the display. Nonetheless, the response time significantly depends on the sequence of trials leading up to the current trial: If the target is the same color on the cur- rent trial as on the previous trial, response time is roughly 100 ms faster than if the target is a different color on the current trial. Considering that response times are on the order of 700 ms, this effect, which we term attentional priming, is gigantic in the scheme of psychological phenomena. 2 ATTENTIONAL CONTROL AS ADAPTATION TO THE STATISTICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT We interpret the phenomenon of attentional priming via a particular perspective on attentional control, which can be summarized in two bullets. • The perceptual system dynamically constructs a probabilistic model of the environment based on its past experience. • Control parameters of the attentional system are tuned so as to optimize performance under the current environmental model. The primary focus of this paper is the environmental model, but we first discuss the nature of performance optimization. The role of attention is to make processing of some stimuli more efficient, and consequently, the processing of other stimuli less efficient. For example, if the gain on the red feature map is turned up, processing will be efficient for red items, but competition from red items will reduce the efficiency for green items. Thus, optimal control should tune the system for the most likely states of the world by minimizing an objective function such as: J(g) = ∑ P ( e )RT g ( e ) (1) e where g is a vector of top-down gains, e is an index over environmental states, P(.) is the probability of an environmental state, and RTg(.) is the expected response time—assuming a constant error rate—to the environmental state under gains g. Determining the optimal gains is a challenge because every gain setting will result in facilitation of responses to some environmental states but hindrance of responses to other states. The optimal control problem could be solved via direct reinforcement learning, but the rapidity of human learning makes this possibility unlikely: In a variety of experimental tasks, evidence suggests that adaptation to a new task or environment can occur in just one or two trials (e.g., Rogers & Monsell, 1996). Model-based reinforcement learning is an attractive alternative, because given a model, optimization can occur without further experience in the real world. Although the number of real-world trials necessary to achieve a given level of performance is comparable for direct and model-based reinforcement learning in stationary environments (Kearns & Singh, 1999), naturalistic environments can be viewed as highly nonstationary. In such a situation, the framework we suggest is well motivated: After each experience, the environment model is updated. The updated environmental model is then used to retune the attentional system. In this paper, we propose a particular model of the environment suitable for visual search tasks. Rather than explicitly modeling the optimization of attentional control by setting gains, we assume that the optimization process will serve to minimize Equation 1. Because any gain adjustment will facilitate performance in some environmental states and hinder performance in others, an optimized control system should obtain faster reaction times for more probable environmental states. This assumption allows us to explain experimental results in a minimal, parsimonious framework. 3 MODELING THE ENVIRONMENT Focusing on the domain of visual search, we characterize the environment in terms of a probability distribution over configurations of target and distractor features. We distinguish three classes of features: defining, reported, and irrelevant. To explain these terms, consider the task of searching a display of size varying, colored, notched diamonds (Figure 2), with the task of detecting the singleton in color and judging the notch location. Color is the defining feature, notch location is the reported feature, and size is an irrelevant feature. To simplify the exposition, we treat all features as having discrete values, an assumption which is true of the experimental tasks we model. We begin by considering displays containing a single target and a single distractor, and shortly generalize to multidistractor displays. We use the framework of Bayesian networks to characterize the environment. Each feature of the target and distractor is a discrete random variable, e.g., Tcolor for target color and Dnotch for the location of the notch on the distractor. The Bayes net encodes the probability distribution over environmental states; in our working example, this distribution is P(Tcolor, Tsize, Tnotch, Dcolor, Dsize, Dnotch). The structure of the Bayes net specifies the relationships among the features. The simplest model one could consider would be to treat the features as independent, illustrated in Figure 3a for singleton-color search task. The opposite extreme would be the full joint distribution, which could be represented by a look up table indexed by the six features, or by the cascading Bayes net architecture in Figure 3b. The architecture we propose, which we’ll refer to as the dominance model (Figure 3c), has an intermediate dependency structure, and expresses the joint distribution as: P(Tcolor)P(Dcolor |Tcolor)P(Tsize |Tcolor)P(Tnotch |Tcolor)P(Dsize |Dcolor)P(Dnotch |Tcolor). The structured model is constructed based on three rules. 1. The defining feature of the target is at the root of the tree. 2. The defining feature of the distractor is conditionally dependent on the defining feature of the target. We refer to this rule as dominance of the target over the distractor. 3. The reported and irrelevant features of target (distractor) are conditionally dependent on the defining feature of the target (distractor). We refer to this rule as dominance of the defining feature over nondefining features. As we will demonstrate, the dominance model produces a parsimonious account of a wide range of experimental data. 3.1 Updating the environment model The model’s parameters are the conditional distributions embodied in the links. In the example of Figure 3c with binary random variables, the model has 11 parameters. However, these parameters are determined by the environment: To be adaptive in nonstationary environments, the model must be updated following each experienced state. We propose a simple exponentially weighted averaging approach. For two variables V and W with observed values v and w on trial t, a conditional distribution, P t ( V = u W = w ) = δ uv , is (a) Tcolor Dcolor Tsize Tnotch (b) Tcolor Dcolor Dsize Tsize Dnotch Tnotch (c) Tcolor Dcolor Dsize Tsize Dsize Dnotch Tnotch Dnotch FIGURE 3. Three models of a visual-search environment with colored, notched, size-varying diamonds. (a) feature-independence model; (b) full-joint model; (c) dominance model. defined, where δ is the Kronecker delta. The distribution representing the environment E following trial t, denoted P t , is then updated as follows: E E P t ( V = u W = w ) = αP t – 1 ( V = u W = w ) + ( 1 – α )P t ( V = u W = w ) (2) for all u, where α is a memory constant. Note that no update is performed for values of W other than w. An analogous update is performed for unconditional distributions. E How the model is initialized—i.e., specifying P 0 —is irrelevant, because all experimental tasks that we model, participants begin the experiment with many dozens of practice trials. E Data is not collected during practice trials. Consequently, any transient effects of P 0 do E not impact the results. In our simulations, we begin with a uniform distribution for P 0 , and include practice trials as in the human studies. Thus far, we’ve assumed a single target and a single distractor. The experiments that we model involve multiple distractors. The simple extension we require to handle multiple distractors is to define a frequentist probability for each distractor feature V, P t ( V = v W = w ) = C vw ⁄ C w , where C vw is the count of co-occurrences of feature values v and w among the distractors, and C w is the count of w. Our model is extremely simple. Given a description of the visual search task and environment, the model has only a single degree of freedom, α . In all simulations, we fix α = 0.75 ; however, the choice of α does not qualitatively impact any result. 4 SIMULATIONS In this section, we show that the model can explain a range of data from four different experiments examining attentional priming. All experiments measure response times of participants. On each trial, the model can be used to obtain a probability of the display configuration (the environmental state) on that trial, given the history of trials to that point. Our critical assumption—as motivated earlier—is that response times monotonically decrease with increasing probability, indicating that visual information processing is better configured for more likely environmental states. The particular relationship we assume is that response times are linear in log probability. This assumption yields long response time tails, as are observed in all human studies. 4.1 Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994, Experiment 5) In this experiment, participants were asked to search for a singleton in color in a display of three red or green diamonds. Each diamond was notched on either the left or right side, and the task was to report the side of the notch on the color singleton. The well-practiced participants made very few errors. Reaction time (RT) was examined as a function of whether the target on a given trial is the same or different color as the target on trial n steps back or ahead. Figure 4 shows the results, with the human RTs in the left panel and the simulation log probabilities in the right panel. The horizontal axis represents n. Both graphs show the same outcome: repetition of target color facilitates performance. This influence lasts only for a half dozen trials, with an exponentially decreasing influence further into the past. In the model, this decreasing influence is due to the exponential decay of recent history (Equation 2). Figure 4 also shows that—as expected—the future has no influence on the current trial. 4.2 Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994, Experiment 8) In the previous experiment, it is impossible to determine whether facilitation is due to repetition of the target’s color or the distractor’s color, because the display contains only two colors, and therefore repetition of target color implies repetition of distractor color. To unconfound these two potential factors, an experiment like the previous one was con- ducted using four distinct colors, allowing one to examine the effect of repeating the target color while varying the distractor color, and vice versa. The sequence of trials was composed of subsequences of up-to-six consecutive trials with either the target or distractor color held constant while the other color was varied trial to trial. Following each subsequence, both target and distractors were changed. Figure 5 shows that for both humans and the simulation, performance improves toward an asymptote as the number of target and distractor repetitions increases; in the model, the asymptote is due to the probability of the repeated color in the environment model approaching 1.0. The performance improvement is greater for target than distractor repetition; in the model, this difference is due to the dominance of the defining feature of the target over the defining feature of the distractor. 4.3 Huang, Holcombe, and Pashler (2004, Experiment 1) Huang et al. (2004) and Hillstrom (2000) conducted studies to determine whether repetitions of one feature facilitate performance independently of repetitions of another feature. In the Huang et al. study, participants searched for a singleton in size in a display consisting of lines that were short and long, slanted left or right, and colored white or black. The reported feature was target slant. Slant, size, and color were uncorrelated. Huang et al. discovered that repeating an irrelevant feature (color or orientation) facilitated performance, but only when the defining feature (size) was repeated. As shown in Figure 6, the model replicates human performance, due to the dominance of the defining feature over the reported and irrelevant features. 4.4 Wolfe, Butcher, Lee, and Hyde (2003, Experiment 1) In an empirical tour-de-force, Wolfe et al. (2003) explored singleton search over a range of environments. The task is to detect the presence or absence of a singleton in displays conHuman data Different Color 600 Different Color 590 580 570 15 13 11 9 7 Past 5 3.2 3 Same Color 2.8 Same Color 560 550 Simulation 3.4 log(P(trial)) Reaction Time (msec) 610 3 1 +1 +3 +5 Future 2.6 +7 15 13 Relative Trial Number 11 9 7 Past 5 3 1 +1 +3 +5 Future +7 Relative Trial Number FIGURE 4.

Target-absent trials were used primarily to ensure participants were searching the display. The experiment examined seven experimental conditions, which varied in the amount of uncertainty as to the target identity. The essential conditions, from least to most uncertainty, are: blocked (e.g., target always red vertical among green horizontals), mixed feature (e.g., target always a color singleton), mixed dimension (e.g., target either red or vertical), and fully mixed (target could be red, green, vertical, or horizontal). With this design, one can ascertain how uncertainty in the environment and in the target definition influence task difficulty. Because the defining feature in this experiment could be either color or orientation, we modeled the environment with two Bayes nets—one color dominant and one orientation dominant—and performed model averaging. A comparison of Figures 7a and 7b show a correspondence between human RTs and model predictions. Less uncertainty in the environment leads to more efficient performance. One interesting result from the model is its prediction that the mixed-feature condition is easier than the fully-mixed condition; that is, search is more efficient when the dimension (i.e., color vs. orientation) of the singleton is known, even though the model has no abstract representation of feature dimensions, only feature values. 4.5 Optimal adaptation constant In all simulations so far, we fixed the memory constant. From the human data, it is clear that memory for recent experience is relatively short lived, on the order of a half dozen trials (e.g., left panel of Figure 4). In this section we provide a rational argument for the short duration of memory in attentional control. Figure 7c shows mean negative log probability in each condition of the Wolfe et al. (2003) experiment, as a function of α . To assess these probabilities, for each experimental condition, the model was initialized so that all of the conditional distributions were uniform, and then a block of trials was run. Log probability for all trials in the block was averaged. The negative log probability (y axis of the Figure) is a measure of the model’s misprediction of the next trial in the sequence. For complex environments, such as the fully-mixed condition, a small memory constant is detrimental: With rapid memory decay, the effective history of trials is a high-variance sample of the distribution of environmental states. For simple environments, a large memory constant is detrimental: With slow memory decay, the model does not transition quickly from the initial environmental model to one that reflects the statistics of a new environment. Thus, the memory constant is constrained by being large enough that the environment model can hold on to sufficient history to represent complex environments, and by being small enough that the model adapts quickly to novel environments. If the conditions in Wolfe et al. give some indication of the range of naturalistic environments an agent encounters, we have a rational account of why attentional priming is so short lived. Whether priming lasts 2 trials or 20, the surprising empirical result is that it does not last 200 or 2000 trials. Our rational argument provides a rough insight into this finding.

Huang et al. (2004) and Hillstrom (2000) propose an episodic account in which a distinct memory trace—representing the complete configuration of features in the display—is laid down for each trial, and priming depends on configural similarity of the current trial to previous trials. Alternatively, Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994) and Wolfe et al. (2003) propose a feature-strengthening account in which detection of a feature on one trial increases its ability to attract attention on subsequent trials, and priming is proportional to the number of overlapping features from one trial to the next. The episodic account corresponds roughly to the full joint model (Figure 3b), and the feature-strengthening account corresponds roughly to the independence model (Figure 3a). Neither account is adequate to explain the range of data we presented. However, an intermediate account, the dominance model (Figure 3c), is not only sufficient, but it offers a parsimonious, rational explanation. Beyond the model’s basic assumptions, it has only one free parameter, and can explain results from diverse experimental paradigms. The model makes a further theoretical contribution. Wolfe et al. distinguish the environments in their experiment in terms of the amount of top-down control available, implying that different mechanisms might be operating in different environments. However, in our account, top-down control is not some substance distributed in different amounts depending on the nature of the environment. Our account treats all environments uniformly, relying on attentional control to adapt to the environment at hand. We conclude with two limitations of the present work. First, our account presumes a particular network architecture, instead of a more elegant Bayesian approach that specifies priors over architectures, and performs automatic model selection via the sequence of trials. We did explore such a Bayesian approach, but it was unable to explain the data. Second, at least one finding in the literature is problematic for the model. Hillstrom (2000) occasionally finds that RTs slow when an irrelevant target feature is repeated but the defining target feature is not. However, because this effect is observed only in some experiments, it is likely that any model would require elaboration to explain the variability.

<p>Author: Samuel M. McClure, Mark S. Gilzenrat, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model by which dopamine (DA) and norepinepherine (NE) combine to alternate behavior between relatively exploratory and exploitative modes. The model is developed for a target detection task for which there is extant single neuron recording data available from locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons. An exploration-exploitation trade-off is elicited by regularly switching which of the two stimuli are rewarded. DA functions within the model to change synaptic weights according to a reinforcement learning algorithm. Exploration is mediated by the state of LC firing, with higher tonic and lower phasic activity producing greater response variability. The opposite state of LC function, with lower baseline firing rate and greater phasic responses, favors exploitative behavior. Changes in LC firing mode result from combined measures of response conflict and reward rate, where response conflict is monitored using models of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Increased long-term response conflict and decreased reward rate, which occurs following reward contingency switch, favors the higher tonic state of LC function and NE release. This increases exploration, and facilitates discovery of the new target. 1 In t rod u ct i on A central problem in reinforcement learning is determining how to adaptively move between exploitative and exploratory behaviors in changing environments. We propose a set of neurophysiologic mechanisms whose interaction may mediate this behavioral shift. Empirical work on the midbrain dopamine (DA) system has suggested that this system is particularly well suited for guiding exploitative behaviors. This hypothesis has been reified by a number of studies showing that a temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm accounts for activity in these neurons in a wide variety of behavioral tasks [1,2]. DA release is believed to encode a reward prediction error signal that acts to change synaptic weights relevant for producing behaviors [3]. Through learning, this allows neural pathways to predict future expected reward through the relative strength of their synaptic connections [1]. Decision-making procedures based on these value estimates are necessarily greedy. Including reward bonuses for exploratory choices supports non-greedy actions [4] and accounts for additional data derived from DA neurons [5]. We show that combining a DA learning algorithm with models of response conflict detection [6] and NE function [7] produces an effective annealing procedure for alternating between exploration and exploitation. NE neurons within the LC alternate between two firing modes [8]. In the first mode, known as the phasic mode, NE neurons fire at a low baseline rate but have relatively robust phasic responses to behaviorally salient stimuli. The second mode, called the tonic mode, is associated with a higher baseline firing and absent or attenuated phasic responses. The effects of NE on efferent areas are modulatory in nature, and are well captured as a change in the gain of efferent inputs so that neuronal responses are potentiated in the presence of NE [9]. Thus, in phasic mode, the LC provides transient facilitation in processing, time-locked to the presence of behaviorally salient information in motor or decision areas. Conversely, in tonic mode, higher overall LC discharge rate increases gain generally and hence increases the probability of arbitrary responding. Consistent with this account, for periods when NE neurons are in the phasic mode, monkey performance is nearly perfect. However, when NE neurons are in the tonic mode, performance is more erratic, with increased response times and error rate [8]. These findings have led to a recent characterization of the LC as a dynamic temporal filter, adjusting the system's relative responsivity to salient and irrelevant information [8]. In this way, the LC is ideally positioned to mediate the shift between exploitative and exploratory behavior. The parameters that underlie changes in LC firing mode remain largely unexplored. Based on data from a target detection task by Aston-Jones and colleagues [10], we propose that LC firing mode is determined in part by measures of response conflict and reward rate as calculated by the ACC and OFC, respectively [8]. Together, the ACC and OFC are the principle sources of cortical input to the LC [8]. Activity in the ACC is known, largely through human neuroimaging experiments, to change in accord with response conflict [6]. In brief, relatively equal activity in competing behavioral responses (reflecting uncertainty) produces high conflict. Low conflict results when one behavioral response predominates. We propose that increased long-term response conflict biases the LC towards a tonic firing mode. Increased conflict necessarily follows changes in reward contingency. As the previously rewarded target no longer produces reward, there will be a relative increase in response ambiguity and hence conflict. This relationship between conflict and LC firing is analogous to other modeling work [11], which proposes that increased tonic firing reflects increased environmental uncertainty. As a final component to our model, we hypothesize that the OFC maintains an ongoing estimate in reward rate, and that this estimate of reward rate also influences LC firing mode. As reward rate increases, we assume that the OFC tends to bias the LC in favor of phasic firing to target stimuli. We have aimed to fix model parameters based on previous work using simpler networks. We use parameters derived primarily from a previous model of the LC by Gilzenrat and colleagues [7]. Integration of response conflict by the ACC and its influence on LC firing was borrowed from unpublished work by Gilzenrat and colleagues in which they fit human behavioral data in a diminishing utilities task. Given this approach, we interpret our observed improvement in model performance with combined NE and DA function as validation of a mechanism for automatically switching between exploitative and exploratory action selection. 2 G o- No- G o Task and Core Mod el We have modeled an experiment in which monkeys performed a target detection task [10]. In the task, monkeys were shown either a vertical bar or a horizontal bar and were required to make or omit a motor response appropriately. Initially, the vertical bar was the target stimulus and correctly responding was rewarded with a squirt of fruit juice (r=1 in the model). Responding to the non-target horizontal stimulus resulted in time out punishment (r=-.1; Figure 1A). No responses to either the target or non-target gave zero reward. After the monkeys had fully acquired the task, the experimenters periodically switched the reward contingency such that the previously rewarded stimulus (target) became the distractor, and vice versa. Following such reversals, LC neurons were observed to change from emitting phasic bursts of firing to the target, to tonic firing following the switch, and slowly back to phasic firing for the new target as the new response criteria was obtained [10]. Figure 1: Task and model design. (A) Responses were required for targets in order to obtain reward. Responses to distractors resulted in a minor punishment. No responses gave zero reward. (B) In the model, vertical and horizontal bar inputs (I1 and I 2 ) fed to integrator neurons (X1 and X2 ) which then drove response units (Y1 and Y2 ). Responses were made if Y 1 or Y2 crossed a threshold while input units were active. We have previously modeled this task [7,12] with a three-layer connectionist network in which two input units, I1 and I 2 , corresponding to the vertical and horizontal bars, drive two mutually inhibitory integrator units, X1 and X2 . The integrator units subsequently feed two response units, Y1 and Y2 (Figure 1B). Responses are made whenever output from Y1 or Y2 crosses a threshold level of activity, θ. Relatively weak cross connections from each input unit to the opposite integrator unit (I1 to X2 and I 2 to X1 ) are intended to model stimulus similarity. Both the integrator and response units were modeled as noisy, leaky accumulators: ˙ X i =</p><p>5 0.48532742 <a title="141-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-How_fast_to_work%3A_Response_vigor%2C_motivation_and_tonic_dopamine.html">91 nips-2005-How fast to work: Response vigor, motivation and tonic dopamine</a></p>
<p>Author: Yael Niv, Nathaniel D. Daw, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning models have long promised to unify computational, psychological and neural accounts of appetitively conditioned behavior. However, the bulk of data on animal conditioning comes from free-operant experiments measuring how fast animals will work for reinforcement. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) models are silent about these tasks, because they lack any notion of vigor. They thus fail to address the simple observation that hungrier animals will work harder for food, as well as stranger facts such as their sometimes greater productivity even when working for irrelevant outcomes such as water. Here, we develop an RL framework for free-operant behavior, suggesting that subjects choose how vigorously to perform selected actions by optimally balancing the costs and beneﬁts of quick responding. Motivational states such as hunger shift these factors, skewing the tradeoff. This accounts normatively for the effects of motivation on response rates, as well as many other classic ﬁndings. Finally, we suggest that tonic levels of dopamine may be involved in the computation linking motivational state to optimal responding, thereby explaining the complex vigor-related effects of pharmacological manipulation of dopamine. 1</p><p>6 0.43627536 <a title="141-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Extracting_Dynamical_Structure_Embedded_in_Neural_Activity.html">67 nips-2005-Extracting Dynamical Structure Embedded in Neural Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Experimental data indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in aspects of vigilance and attention. Previously, we considered the function of this neuromodulatory system on a time scale of minutes and longer, and suggested that it signals global uncertainty arising from gross changes in environmental contingencies. However, norepinephrine is also known to be activated phasically by familiar stimuli in welllearned tasks. Here, we extend our uncertainty-based treatment of norepinephrine to this phasic mode, proposing that it is involved in the detection and reaction to state uncertainty within a task. This role of norepinephrine can be understood through the metaphor of neural interrupts. 1</p><p>2 0.5501076 <a title="141-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Off-policy_Learning_with_Options_and_Recognizers.html">144 nips-2005-Off-policy Learning with Options and Recognizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Doina Precup, Cosmin Paduraru, Anna Koop, Richard S. Sutton, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for off-policy temporal-difference learning with function approximation that has lower variance and requires less knowledge of the behavior policy than prior methods. We develop the notion of a recognizer, a ﬁlter on actions that distorts the behavior policy to produce a related target policy with low-variance importance-sampling corrections. We also consider target policies that are deviations from the state distribution of the behavior policy, such as potential temporally abstract options, which further reduces variance. This paper introduces recognizers and their potential advantages, then develops a full algorithm for linear function approximation and proves that its updates are in the same direction as on-policy TD updates, which implies asymptotic convergence. Even though our algorithm is based on importance sampling, we prove that it requires absolutely no knowledge of the behavior policy for the case of state-aggregation function approximators. Off-policy learning is learning about one way of behaving while actually behaving in another way. For example, Q-learning is an off- policy learning method because it learns about the optimal policy while taking actions in a more exploratory fashion, e.g., according to an ε-greedy policy. Off-policy learning is of interest because only one way of selecting actions can be used at any time, but we would like to learn about many different ways of behaving from the single resultant stream of experience. For example, the options framework for temporal abstraction involves considering a variety of different ways of selecting actions. For each such option one would like to learn a model of its possible outcomes suitable for planning and other uses. Such option models have been proposed as fundamental building blocks of grounded world knowledge (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2005). Using off-policy learning, one would be able to learn predictive models for many options at the same time from a single stream of experience. Unfortunately, off-policy learning using temporal-difference methods has proven problematic when used in conjunction with function approximation. Function approximation is essential in order to handle the large state spaces that are inherent in many problem do- mains. Q-learning, for example, has been proven to converge to an optimal policy in the tabular case, but is unsound and may diverge in the case of linear function approximation (Baird, 1996). Precup, Sutton, and Dasgupta (2001) introduced and proved convergence for the ﬁrst off-policy learning algorithm with linear function approximation. They addressed the problem of learning the expected value of a target policy based on experience generated using a different behavior policy. They used importance sampling techniques to reduce the off-policy case to the on-policy case, where existing convergence theorems apply (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Tadic, 2001). There are two important difﬁculties with that approach. First, the behavior policy needs to be stationary and known, because it is needed to compute the importance sampling corrections. Second, the importance sampling weights are often ill-conditioned. In the worst case, the variance could be inﬁnite and convergence would not occur. The conditions required to prevent this were somewhat awkward and, even when they applied and asymptotic convergence was assured, the variance could still be high and convergence could be slow. In this paper we address both of these problems in the context of off-policy learning for options. We introduce the notion of a recognizer. Rather than specifying an explicit target policy (for instance, the policy of an option), about which we want to make predictions, a recognizer speciﬁes a condition on the actions that are selected. For example, a recognizer for the temporally extended action of picking up a cup would not specify which hand is to be used, or what the motion should be at all different positions of the cup. The recognizer would recognize a whole variety of directions of motion and poses as part of picking the cup. The advantage of this strategy is not that one might prefer a multitude of different behaviors, but that the behavior may be based on a variety of different strategies, all of which are relevant, and we would like to learn from any of them. In general, a recognizer is a function that recognizes or accepts a space of different ways of behaving and thus, can learn from a wider range of data. Recognizers have two advantages over direct speciﬁcation of a target policy: 1) they are a natural and easy way to specify a target policy for which importance sampling will be well conditioned, and 2) they do not require the behavior policy to be known. The latter is important because in many cases we may have little knowledge of the behavior policy, or a stationary behavior policy may not even exist. We show that for the case of state aggregation, even if the behavior policy is unknown, convergence to a good model is achieved. 1 Non-sequential example The beneﬁts of using recognizers in off-policy learning can be most easily seen in a nonsequential context with a single continuous action. Suppose you are given a sequence of sample actions ai ∈ [0, 1], selected i.i.d. according to probability density b : [0, 1] → ℜ+ (the behavior density). For example, suppose the behavior density is of the oscillatory form shown as a red line in Figure 1. For each each action, ai , we observe a corresponding outcome, zi ∈ ℜ, a random variable whose distribution depends only on ai . Thus the behavior density induces an outcome density. The on-policy problem is to estimate the mean mb of the outcome density. This problem can be solved simply by averaging the sample outcomes: mb = (1/n) ∑n zi . The off-policy problem is to use this same data to learn what ˆ i=1 the mean would be if actions were selected in some way other than b, for example, if the actions were restricted to a designated range, such as between 0.7 and 0.9. There are two natural ways to pose this off-policy problem. The most straightforward way is to be equally interested in all actions within the designated region. One professes to be interested in actions selected according to a target density π : [0, 1] → ℜ+ , which in the example would be 5.0 between 0.7 and 0.9, and zero elsewhere, as in the dashed line in 12 Probability density functions 1.5 Target policy with recognizer 1 Target policy w/o recognizer without recognizer .5 Behavior policy 0 0 Action 0.7 Empirical variances (average of 200 sample variances) 0.9 1 0 10 with recognizer 100 200 300 400 500 Number of sample actions Figure 1: The left panel shows the behavior policy and the target policies for the formulations of the problem with and without recognizers. The right panel shows empirical estimates of the variances for the two formulations as a function of the number sample actions. The lowest line is for the formulation using empirically-estimated recognition probabilities. Figure 1 (left). The importance- sampling estimate of the mean outcome is 1 n π(ai ) mπ = ∑ ˆ zi . n i=1 b(ai ) (1) This approach is problematic if there are parts of the region of interest where the behavior density is zero or very nearly so, such as near 0.72 and 0.85 in the example. Here the importance sampling ratios are exceedingly large and the estimate is poorly conditioned (large variance). The upper curve in Figure 1 (right) shows the empirical variance of this estimate as a function of the number of samples. The spikes and uncertain decline of the empirical variance indicate that the distribution is very skewed and that the estimates are very poorly conditioned. The second way to pose the problem uses recognizers. One professes to be interested in actions to the extent that they are both selected by b and within the designated region. This leads to the target policy shown in blue in the left panel of Figure 1 (it is taller because it still must sum to 1). For this problem, the variance of (1) is much smaller, as shown in the lower two lines of Figure 1 (right). To make this way of posing the problem clear, we introduce the notion of a recognizer function c : A → ℜ+ . The action space in the example is A = [0, 1] and the recognizer is c(a) = 1 for a between 0.7 and 0.9 and is zero elsewhere. The target policy is deﬁned in general by c(a)b(a) c(a)b(a) = . (2) π(a) = µ ∑x c(x)b(x) where µ = ∑x c(x)b(x) is a constant, equal to the probability of recognizing an action from the behavior policy. Given π, mπ from (1) can be rewritten in terms of the recognizer as ˆ n π(ai ) 1 n c(ai )b(ai ) 1 1 n c(ai ) 1 mπ = ∑ zi ˆ = ∑ zi = ∑ zi (3) n i=1 b(ai ) n i=1 µ b(ai ) n i=1 µ Note that the target density does not appear at all in the last expression and that the behavior distribution appears only in µ, which is independent of the sample action. If this constant is known, then this estimator can be computed with no knowledge of π or b. The constant µ can easily be estimated as the fraction of recognized actions in the sample. The lowest line in Figure 1 (right) shows the variance of the estimator using this fraction in place of the recognition probability. Its variance is low, no worse than that of the exact algorithm, and apparently slightly lower. Because this algorithm does not use the behavior density, it can be applied when the behavior density is unknown or does not even exist. For example, suppose actions were selected in some deterministic, systematic way that in the long run produced an empirical distribution like b. This would be problematic for the other algorithms but would require no modiﬁcation of the recognition-fraction algorithm. 2 Recognizers improve conditioning of off-policy learning The main use of recognizers is in formulating a target density π about which we can successfully learn predictions, based on the current behavior being followed. Here we formalize this intuition. Theorem 1 Let A = {a1 , . . . ak } ⊆ A be a subset of all the possible actions. Consider a ﬁxed behavior policy b and let πA be the class of policies that only choose actions from A, i.e., if π(a) > 0 then a ∈ A. Then the policy induced by b and the binary recognizer cA is the policy with minimum-variance one-step importance sampling corrections, among those in πA : π(ai ) 2 π as given by (2) = arg min Eb (4) π∈πA b(ai ) Proof: Denote π(ai ) = πi , b(ai ) = bi . Then the expected variance of the one-step importance sampling corrections is: Eb πi bi πi bi 2 2 − Eb = ∑ bi i πi bi 2 −1 = ∑ i π2 i − 1, bi where the summation (here and everywhere below) is such that the action ai ∈ A. We want to ﬁnd πi that minimizes this expression, subject to the constraint that ∑i πi = 1. This is a constrained optimization problem. To solve it, we write down the corresponding Lagrangian: π2 L(πi , β) = ∑ i − 1 + β(∑ πi − 1) i i bi We take the partial derivatives wrt πi and β and set them to 0: βbi ∂L 2 = πi + β = 0 ⇒ πi = − ∂πi bi 2 (5) ∂L = πi − 1 = 0 ∂β ∑ i (6) By taking (5) and plugging into (6), we get the following expression for β: − β 2 bi = 1 ⇒ β = − 2∑ ∑i bi i By substituting β into (5) we obtain: πi = bi ∑i b i This is exactly the policy induced by the recognizer deﬁned by c(ai ) = 1 iff ai ∈ A. We also note that it is advantageous, from the point of view of minimizing the variance of the updates, to have recognizers that accept a broad range of actions: Theorem 2 Consider two binary recognizers c1 and c2 , such that µ1 > µ2 . Then the importance sampling corrections for c1 have lower variance than the importance sampling corrections for c2 . Proof: From the previous theorem, we have the variance of a recognizer cA : Var = ∑ i π2 bi i −1 = ∑ bi ∑ j∈A b j i 2 1 1 1 −1 = −1 = −1 bi µ ∑ j∈A b j 3 Formal framework for sequential problems We turn now to the full case of learning about sequential decision processes with function approximation. We use the standard framework in which an agent interacts with a stochastic environment. At each time step t, the agent receives a state st and chooses an action at . We assume for the moment that actions are selected according to a ﬁxed behavior policy, b : S × A → [0, 1] where b(s, a) is the probability of selecting action a in state s. The behavior policy is used to generate a sequence of experience (observations, actions and rewards). The goal is to learn, from this data, predictions about different ways of behaving. In this paper we focus on learning predictions about expected returns, but other predictions can be tackled as well (for instance, predictions of transition models for options (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), or predictions speciﬁed by a TD-network (Sutton & Tanner, 2005; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2006)). We assume that the state space is large or continuous, and function approximation must be used to compute any values of interest. In particular, we assume a space of feature vectors Φ and a mapping φ : S → Φ. We denote by φs the feature vector associated with s. An option is deﬁned as a triple o = I, π, β where I ⊆ S is the set of states in which the option can be initiated, π is the internal policy of the option and β : S → [0, 1] is a stochastic termination condition. In the option work (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), each of these elements has to be explicitly speciﬁed and ﬁxed in order for an option to be well deﬁned. Here, we will instead deﬁne options implicitly, using the notion of a recognizer. A recognizer is deﬁned as a function c : S × A → [0, 1], where c(s, a) indicates to what extent the recognizer allows action a in state s. An important special case, which we treat in this paper, is that of binary recognizers. In this case, c is an indicator function, specifying a subset of actions that are allowed, or recognized, given a particular state. Note that recognizers do not specify policies; instead, they merely give restrictions on the policies that are allowed or recognized. A recognizer c together with a behavior policy b generates a target policy π, where: b(s, a)c(s, a) b(s, a)c(s, a) π(s, a) = (7) = µ(s) ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x) The denominator of this fraction, µ(s) = ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x), is the recognition probability at s, i.e., the probability that an action will be accepted at s when behavior is generated according to b. The policy π is only deﬁned at states for which µ(s) > 0. The numerator gives the probability that action a is produced by the behavior and recognized in s. Note that if the recognizer accepts all state-action pairs, i.e. c(s, a) = 1, ∀s, a, then π is the same as b. Since a recognizer and a behavior policy can specify together a target policy, we can use recognizers as a way to specify policies for options, using (7). An option can only be initiated at a state for which at least one action is recognized, so µ(s) > 0, ∀s ∈ I. Similarly, the termination condition of such an option, β, is deﬁned as β(s) = 1 if µ(s) = 0. In other words, the option must terminate if no actions are recognized at a given state. At all other states, β can be deﬁned between 0 and 1 as desired. We will focus on computing the reward model of an option o, which represents the expected total return. The expected values of different features at the end of the option can be estimated similarly. The quantity that we want to compute is Eo {R(s)} = E{r1 + r2 + . . . + rT |s0 = s, π, β} where s ∈ I, experience is generated according to the policy of the option, π, and T denotes the random variable representing the time step at which the option terminates according to β. We assume that linear function approximation is used to represent these values, i.e. Eo {R(s)} ≈ θT φs where θ is a vector of parameters. 4 Off-policy learning algorithm In this section we present an adaptation of the off-policy learning algorithm of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) to the case of learning about options. Suppose that an option’s policy π was used to generate behavior. In this case, learning the reward model of the option is a special case of temporal-difference learning of value functions. The forward ¯ (n) view of this algorithm is as follows. Let Rt denote the truncated n-step return starting at ¯ (0) time step t and let yt denote the 0-step truncated return, Rt . By the deﬁnition of the n-step truncated return, we have: ¯ (n) ¯ (n−1) Rt = rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 . This is similar to the case of value functions, but it accounts for the possibility of terminating the option at time step t + 1. The λ-return is deﬁned in the usual way: ∞ ¯ (n) ¯ Rtλ = (1 − λ) ∑ λn−1 Rt . n=1 The parameters of the linear function approximator are updated on every time step proportionally to: ¯ ¯ ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 ) · · · (1 − βt ). In our case, however, trajectories are generated according to the behavior policy b. The main idea of the algorithm is to use importance sampling corrections in order to account for the difference in the state distribution of the two policies. Let ρt = (n) Rt , π(st ,at ) b(st ,at ) be the importance sampling ratio at time step t. The truncated n-step return, satisﬁes: (n) (n−1) Rt = ρt [rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 ]. The update to the parameter vector is proportional to: ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt ρ0 (1 − β1 ) · · · ρt−1 (1 − βt ). The following result shows that the expected updates of the on-policy and off-policy algorithms are the same. Theorem 3 For every time step t ≥ 0 and any initial state s, ¯ Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s]. (n) (n) ¯ Proof: First we will show by induction that Eb {Rt |s} = Eπ {Rt |s}, ∀n (which implies ¯ that Eb {Rtλ |s} = Eπ (Rtλ |s}). For n = 0, the statement is trivial. Assuming that it is true for n − 1, we have (n) Eb Rt |s = a ∑b(s, a)∑Pss ρ(s, a) a = s ∑∑ a Pss b(s, a) a s = a ∑π(s, a)∑Pss a (n−1) a rss + (1 − β(s ))Eb Rt+1 |s π(s, a) a ¯ (n−1) r + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s b(s, a) ss a ¯ (n−1) rss + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s ¯ (n) = Eπ Rt |s . s Now we are ready to prove the theorem’s main statement. Deﬁning Ωt to be the set of all trajectory components up to state st , we have: Eb {∆θt |s} = ∑ ω∈Ωt Pb (ω|s)Eb (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω t−1 ∏ ρi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 πi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 bi t−1 = t−1 ∑ ∏ bi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt Eb Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt ∏ i=0 t−1 = ∑ ∏ πi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt = ∑ ω∈Ωt ¯ Eπ Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) i=0 ¯ ¯ Pπ (ω|s)Eπ (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) = Eπ ∆θt |s . Note that we are able to use st and ω interchangeably because of the Markov property. ¯ Since we have shown that Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s] for any state s, it follows that the expected updates will also be equal for any distribution of the initial state s. When learning the model of options with data generated from the behavior policy b, the starting state distribution with respect to which the learning is performed, I0 is determined by the stationary distribution of the behavior policy, as well as the initiation set of the option I. We note also that the importance sampling corrections only have to be performed for the trajectory since the initiation of the updates for the option. No corrections are required for the experience prior to this point. This should generate updates that have signiﬁcantly lower variance than in the case of learning values of policies (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). Because of the termination condition of the option, β, ∆θ can quickly decay to zero. To avoid this problem, we can use a restart function g : S → [0, 1], such that g(st ) speciﬁes the extent to which the updating episode is considered to start at time t. Adding restarts generates a new forward update: t ∆θt = (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt ∑ gi ρi ...ρt−1 (1 − βi+1 )...(1 − βt ), (8) i=0 where Rtλ is the same as above. With an adaptation of the proof in Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001), we can show that we get the same expected value of updates by applying this algorithm from the original starting distribution as we would by applying the algorithm without restarts from a starting distribution deﬁned by I0 and g. We can turn this forward algorithm into an incremental, backward view algorithm in the following way: • Initialize k0 = g0 , e0 = k0 ∇θ y0 • At every time step t: δt = θt+1 = kt+1 = et+1 = ρt (rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )yt+1 ) − yt θt + αδt et ρt kt (1 − βt+1 ) + gt+1 λρt (1 − βt+1 )et + kt+1 ∇θ yt+1 Using a similar technique to that of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) and Sutton & Barto (1998), we can prove that the forward and backward algorithm are equivalent (omitted due to lack of space). This algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the variance of the updates is ﬁnite (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). In the case of options, the termination condition β can be used to ensure that this is the case. 5 Learning when the behavior policy is unknown In this section, we consider the case in which the behavior policy is unknown. This case is generally problematic for importance sampling algorithms, but the use of recognizers will allow us to deﬁne importance sampling corrections, as well as a convergent algorithm. Recall that when using a recognizer, the target policy of the option is deﬁned as: c(s, a)b(s, a) π(s, a) = µ(s) and the recognition probability becomes: π(s, a) c(s, a) = b(s, a) µ(s) Of course, µ(s) depends on b. If b is unknown, instead of µ(s), we will use a maximum likelihood estimate µ : S → [0, 1]. The structure used to compute µ will have to be compatible ˆ ˆ with the feature space used to represent the reward model. We will make this more precise below. Likewise, the recognizer c(s, a) will have to be deﬁned in terms of the features used to represent the model. We will then deﬁne the importance sampling corrections as: c(s, a) ˆ ρ(s, a) = µ(s) ˆ ρ(s, a) = We consider the case in which the function approximator used to model the option is actually a state aggregator. In this case, we will deﬁne recognizers which behave consistently in each partition, i.e., c(s, a) = c(p, a), ∀s ∈ p. This means that an action is either recognized or not recognized in all states of the partition. The recognition probability µ will have one ˆ entry for every partition p of the state space. Its value will be: N(p, c = 1) µ(p) = ˆ N(p) where N(p) is the number of times partition p was visited, and N(p, c = 1) is the number of times the action taken in p was recognized. In the limit, w.p.1, µ converges to ˆ ∑s d b (s|p) ∑a c(p, a)b(s, a) where d b (s|p) is the probability of visiting state s from partiˆ ˆ tion p under the stationary distribution of b. At this limit, π(s, a) = ρ(s, a)b(s, a) will be a ˆ well-deﬁned policy (i.e., ∑a π(s, a) = 1). Using Theorem 3, off-policy updates using imˆ portance sampling corrections ρ will have the same expected value as on-policy updates ˆ ˆ using π. Note though that the learning algorithm never uses π; the only quantities needed ˆ are ρ, which are learned incrementally from data. For the case of general linear function approximation, we conjecture that a similar idea can be used, where the recognition probability is learned using logistic regression. The development of this part is left for future work.

<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Elon Portugaly, Tamar Flash, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The two-thirds power law, an empirical law stating an inverse non-linear relationship between the tangential hand speed and the curvature of its trajectory during curved motion, is widely acknowledged to be an invariant of upper-limb movement. It has also been shown to exist in eyemotion, locomotion and was even demonstrated in motion perception and prediction. This ubiquity has fostered various attempts to uncover the origins of this empirical relationship. In these it was generally attributed either to smoothness in hand- or joint-space or to the result of mechanisms that damp noise inherent in the motor system to produce the smooth trajectories evident in healthy human motion. We show here that white Gaussian noise also obeys this power-law. Analysis of signal and noise combinations shows that trajectories that were synthetically created not to comply with the power-law are transformed to power-law compliant ones after combination with low levels of noise. Furthermore, there exist colored noise types that drive non-power-law trajectories to power-law compliance and are not affected by smoothing. These results suggest caution when running experiments aimed at verifying the power-law or assuming its underlying existence without proper analysis of the noise. Our results could also suggest that the power-law might be derived not from smoothness or smoothness-inducing mechanisms operating on the noise inherent in our motor system but rather from the correlated noise which is inherent in this motor system. 1</p><p>4 0.54422033 <a title="141-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Bayesian_models_of_human_action_understanding.html">36 nips-2005-Bayesian models of human action understanding</a></p>

Action-understanding is cast as a problem of inverting a probabilistic generative model, which assumes that agents tend to act rationally in order to achieve their goals given the constraints of their environment. Working in a simple sprite-world domain, we show how this model can be used to infer the goal of an agent and predict how the agent will act in novel situations or when environmental constraints change. The model provides a qualitative account of several kinds of inferences that preverbal infants have been shown to perform, and also ﬁts quantitative predictions that adult observers make in a new experiment.</p><p>5 0.54255635 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-From_Weighted_Classification_to_Policy_Search.html">78 nips-2005-From Weighted Classification to Policy Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.54053974 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Logic_and_MRF_Circuitry_for_Labeling_Occluding_and_Thinline_Visual_Contours.html">122 nips-2005-Logic and MRF Circuitry for Labeling Occluding and Thinline Visual Contours</a></p>

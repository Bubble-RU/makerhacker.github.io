<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Johnny Mariethoz, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that the hinge loss can be interpreted as the neg-log-likelihood of a semi-parametric model of posterior probabilities. From this point of view, SVMs represent the parametric component of a semi-parametric model ﬁtted by a maximum a posteriori estimation procedure. This connection enables to derive a mapping from SVM scores to estimated posterior probabilities. Unlike previous proposals, the suggested mapping is interval-valued, providing a set of posterior probabilities compatible with each SVM score. This framework offers a new way to adapt the SVM optimization problem to unbalanced classiﬁcation, when decisions result in unequal (asymmetric) losses. Experiments show improvements over state-of-the-art procedures. 1</p><p>3 0.10784805 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Transfer_learning_for_text_classification.html">195 nips-2005-Transfer learning for text classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuong B. Do, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Linear text classiﬁcation algorithms work by computing an inner product between a test document vector and a parameter vector. In many such algorithms, including naive Bayes and most TFIDF variants, the parameters are determined by some simple, closed-form, function of training set statistics; we call this mapping mapping from statistics to parameters, the parameter function. Much research in text classiﬁcation over the last few decades has consisted of manual efforts to identify better parameter functions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatically learning this function from related classiﬁcation problems. The parameter function found by our algorithm then deﬁnes a new learning algorithm for text classiﬁcation, which we can apply to novel classiﬁcation tasks. We ﬁnd that our learned classiﬁer outperforms existing methods on a variety of multiclass text classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.083758257 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Multiple_Related_Tasks_using_Latent_Independent_Component_Analysis.html">113 nips-2005-Learning Multiple Related Tasks using Latent Independent Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.</p><p>5 0.081594341 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Consistency_of_one-class_SVM_and_related_algorithms.html">47 nips-2005-Consistency of one-class SVM and related algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic limit of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator. 1</p><p>6 0.078926295 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Hyperparameter_and_Kernel_Learning_for_Graph_Based_Semi-Supervised_Classification.html">92 nips-2005-Hyperparameter and Kernel Learning for Graph Based Semi-Supervised Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Mccracken, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a method of modeling dynamical systems using only observable data, such as actions and observations, to describe their model. PSRs use predictions about the outcome of future tests to summarize the system state. The best existing techniques for discovery and learning of PSRs use a Monte Carlo approach to explicitly estimate these outcome probabilities. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for discovery and learning of PSRs that uses a gradient descent approach to compute the predictions for the current state. The algorithm takes advantage of the large amount of structure inherent in a valid prediction matrix to constrain its predictions. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used online by an agent to constantly improve its prediction quality; something that current state of the art discovery and learning algorithms are unable to do. We give empirical results to show that our constrained gradient algorithm is able to discover core tests using very small amounts of data, and with larger amounts of data can compute accurate predictions of the system dynamics. 1</p><p>5 0.45968726 <a title="37-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Two_view_learning%3A_SVM-2K%2C_Theory_and_Practice.html">196 nips-2005-Two view learning: SVM-2K, Theory and Practice</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Farquhar, David Hardoon, Hongying Meng, John S. Shawe-taylor, Sándor Szedmák</p><p>Abstract: Kernel methods make it relatively easy to deﬁne complex highdimensional feature spaces. This raises the question of how we can identify the relevant subspaces for a particular learning task. When two views of the same phenomenon are available kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) has been shown to be an effective preprocessing step that can improve the performance of classiﬁcation algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This paper takes this observation to its logical conclusion and proposes a method that combines this two stage learning (KCCA followed by SVM) into a single optimisation termed SVM-2K. We present both experimental and theoretical analysis of the approach showing encouraging results and insights. 1</p><p>6 0.45833597 <a title="37-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-A_PAC-Bayes_approach_to_the_Set_Covering_Machine.html">12 nips-2005-A PAC-Bayes approach to the Set Covering Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Seung-jean Kim, Alessandro Magnani, Stephen Boyd</p><p>Abstract: Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be sensitive to the problem data. Robust Fisher LDA can systematically alleviate the sensitivity problem by explicitly incorporating a model of data uncertainty in a classiﬁcation problem and optimizing for the worst-case scenario under this model. The main contribution of this paper is show that with general convex uncertainty models on the problem data, robust Fisher LDA can be carried out using convex optimization. For a certain type of product form uncertainty model, robust Fisher LDA can be carried out at a cost comparable to standard Fisher LDA. The method is demonstrated with some numerical examples. Finally, we show how to extend these results to robust kernel Fisher discriminant analysis, i.e., robust Fisher LDA in a high dimensional feature space. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.62022734 <a title="37-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Benchmarking_Non-Parametric_Statistical_Tests.html">37 nips-2005-Benchmarking Non-Parametric Statistical Tests</a></p>

<p>Author: Abdullah Celik, Milutin Stanacevic, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: We present micropower mixed-signal VLSI hardware for real-time blind separation and localization of acoustic sources. Gradient ﬂow representation of the traveling wave signals acquired over a miniature (1cm diameter) array of four microphones yields linearly mixed instantaneous observations of the time-differentiated sources, separated and localized by independent component analysis (ICA). The gradient ﬂow and ICA processors each measure 3mm × 3mm in 0.5 µm CMOS, and consume 54 µW and 180 µW power, respectively, from a 3 V supply at 16 ks/s sampling rate. Experiments demonstrate perceptually clear (12dB) separation and precise localization of two speech sources presented through speakers positioned at 1.5m from the array on a conference room table. Analysis of the multipath residuals shows that they are spectrally diffuse, and void of the direct path.</p><p>4 0.45364532 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose correlations between variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlations. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. This perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and of its convergence in loopy graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.45147642 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-An_Analog_Visual_Pre-Processing_Processor_Employing_Cyclic_Line_Access_in_Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects_Architecture.html">22 nips-2005-An Analog Visual Pre-Processing Processor Employing Cyclic Line Access in Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects Architecture</a></p>

A proof-of-concept chip was fabricated in a 0.35- m 2-poly 3-metal CMOS technology and the edge ﬁltering at a rate of 200 frames/sec. has been experimentally demonstrated.</p><p>6 0.44973835 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-A_General_and_Efficient_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Algorithm.html">10 nips-2005-A General and Efficient Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithm</a></p>

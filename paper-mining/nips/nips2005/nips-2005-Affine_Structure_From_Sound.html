</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Consider a set of acoustic sensors (microphones) for detecting acoustic events in the environment (e. [sent-8, score-1.169]
</p><p>7 The structure from sound (SFS) problem addresses the problem of simultaneously localizing a set of N sensors and a set of M external acoustic events, whose locations and emission times are unknown. [sent-11, score-1.206]
</p><p>8 The SFS problem is relevant to the spatial calibration problem for microphone arrays. [sent-12, score-0.283]
</p><p>9 Classically, microphone arrays are mounted on ﬁxed brackets of known dimensions; hence there is no spatial calibration problem. [sent-13, score-0.275]
</p><p>10 Ad-hoc microphone arrays, however, involve a person placing microphones at arbitrary locations with limited knowledge as to where they are. [sent-14, score-0.457]
</p><p>11 Today’s best practice requires a person to measure the distance between the microphones by hand, and to apply algorithms such as multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) [1] for recovering their locations. [sent-15, score-0.256]
</p><p>12 When sensor networks are deployed from the air [4], manual calibration may not be an option. [sent-16, score-0.34]
</p><p>13 Others require a capability to emit and sense wireless radio signals [5] or sounds [9, 10], which are then used to estimate relative distances between microphones (directly or indirectly, as in [9]). [sent-18, score-0.335]
</p><p>14 Unfortunately, wireless signal strength is a poor estimator of range, and active acoustic and GPS localization techniques are uneconomical in that they consume energy and require additional hardware. [sent-19, score-0.484]
</p><p>15 In contrast, SFS relies on environmental acoustic events such as hand claps, which are not generated by the sensor network. [sent-20, score-0.858]
</p><p>16 A related paper [3] describes a technique for incrementally localizing a microphone relative to a well-calibrated microphone array through external sound events. [sent-22, score-0.687]
</p><p>17 In this paper, the structure from sound (SFS) problem is deﬁned as the simultaneous localization problem of N sound sensors and M acoustic events in the environment detected by these sensors. [sent-23, score-1.289]
</p><p>18 Each event occurs at an unknown time and an unknown location. [sent-24, score-0.159]
</p><p>19 The  sensors are able to measure the detection times of the event. [sent-25, score-0.197]
</p><p>20 We assume that the clocks of the sensors are synchronized (see [6]); that events are spaced sufﬁciently far apart in time to make the association between different sensors unambiguous; and we also assume absence of sound reverberation. [sent-26, score-0.877]
</p><p>21 Under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (iid) Gaussian noise, the SFS problem can be formulated as a least squares problem in a space over three types of variables: the locations of the microphones, the locations of the acoustic events, and their emission times. [sent-28, score-0.871]
</p><p>22 The key transformation involves a far ﬁeld approximation, which presupposes that the sound sources are relatively far away from the sensors. [sent-31, score-0.379]
</p><p>23 This approximation reformulates the problem as one of recovering the incident angle of the acoustic signal, which is the same for all sensors for any ﬁxed acoustic event. [sent-32, score-1.309]
</p><p>24 The resulting optimization problem is still non-linear; however, by relaxing the laws of Euclidean geometry into the more general calculus of afﬁne geometry, the optimization problem can be solved by singular value decomposition (SVD). [sent-33, score-0.264]
</p><p>25 The resulting solution is mapped back into Euclidean space by optimizing a matrix of size 2 × 2, which is easily carried out using gradient descent. [sent-34, score-0.192]
</p><p>26 A subsequent non-linear optimization step overcomes the far ﬁeld approximation and enables the algorithm to recover locations and emission times of the deﬁning acoustic events. [sent-35, score-0.893]
</p><p>27 SFM is of course deﬁned for cameras, not for microphone arrays. [sent-39, score-0.15]
</p><p>28 This paper establishes an afﬁne solution to the structure from sound problem that tends to work well in practice. [sent-41, score-0.292]
</p><p>29 1 Setup We are given N sensors (microphones) located in a 2D plane. [sent-43, score-0.164]
</p><p>30 We shall denote the location of the i-th sensor by (xi yi ), which deﬁned the following sensor location matrix of size N × 2:   X  =      x1 x2 . [sent-44, score-0.781]
</p><p>31 yN  (1)  We assume that the sensor array detects M acoustic events. [sent-50, score-0.737]
</p><p>32 Each event has as unknown coordinate and an unknown emission time. [sent-51, score-0.338]
</p><p>33 The coordinate of the j-th event shall be denoted (aj bj ), providing us with the event location matrix A of size M × 2. [sent-52, score-0.592]
</p><p>34 The emission time of the j-th acoustic event is denoted tj , resulting in the vector T of length M :     a1  A  =   a2  . [sent-53, score-0.703]
</p><p>35 In problems such as sensor calibration, only X is of interest. [sent-63, score-0.255]
</p><p>36 The data establishes the detection times of the acoustic events by the individual sensors. [sent-67, score-0.636]
</p><p>37 dN,M  (3)  aj bj  (4)  Here each di,j denotes the detection time of acoustical event j by sensor i. [sent-80, score-0.75]
</p><p>38 Even if all acoustic events sound alike, the correspondence between different detections is easily established as long as there exists sufﬁciently long time gaps between any two sound events. [sent-82, score-1.007]
</p><p>39 The matrix D is a random ﬁeld induced by the laws of sound propagation (without reverberation). [sent-83, score-0.273]
</p><p>40 In the absence of measurement noise, each di,j is the sum of the corresponding emission time tj , plus the time it takes for sound to travel from (aj bj ) to (xi yi ): di,j  =  xi yi  tj + c−1  −  Here | · | denotes the L2 norm (Euclidean distance), and c denoted the speed of sound. [sent-84, score-0.831]
</p><p>41 This gives us the relative location matrix for the sensors:   x2 − x 1  ¯ X  y2 − y 1 y3 − y 1   . [sent-88, score-0.131]
</p><p>42 =  xN − x 1  (5)  This relative sensor location matrix is of dimension (N − 1) × 2. [sent-94, score-0.386]
</p><p>43 It shall prove convenient to subtract from the arrival time di,j the arrival time d1,j measured by the ﬁrst sensor i = 1. [sent-95, score-0.479]
</p><p>44 In the relative arrival time, the absolute emission times tj cancel out: =  c−1  xi yi  tj + c−1  =  ∆i,j  aj bj  −  xi yi  aj bj  −  − tj − c−1 −  We now deﬁne the matrix of relative arrival times:  ∆  =  d2,1 − d1,1  d3,1 − d1,1  . [sent-97, score-1.577]
</p><p>45 aj bj  aj bj  (6)    d2,M − d1,M d3,M − d1,M   . [sent-107, score-0.804]
</p><p>46 4 Least Squares Formulation The relative sensor locations X and the corresponding locations of the acoustic events A can now be recovered through the following least squares problem. [sent-111, score-1.197]
</p><p>47 N  A∗ , X ∗  =  M  argmin X,A  i=2 j=1  xi yi  −  aj bj  −  aj bj  2  − ∆i,j  (8)  The minimum of this expression is a maximum likelihood solution for the SFS problem under the assumption of iid Gaussian measurement noise. [sent-113, score-1.051]
</p><p>48 If emission times are of interest, they are now easily recovered by the following weighted mean: T∗  =  1 N  N  xi yi  di,j − c  aj bj  −  (9)  i=1  The minimum of Eq. [sent-114, score-0.707]
</p><p>49 This shall not concern us, as we shall be content with any solution of Eq. [sent-117, score-0.188]
</p><p>50 As we shall show experimentally, such gradient algorithms work poorly in practice because of the large number of local minima. [sent-122, score-0.174]
</p><p>51 3  The Far Field Approximation  The essence of our approximation pertains to the fact that for far range acoustic events— i. [sent-123, score-0.524]
</p><p>52 , events that are (inﬁnitely) far away from the sensor array—the incoming sound wave hits each sensor at the same incident angle. [sent-125, score-1.217]
</p><p>53 Put differently, the rays connecting the location of an acoustic event (aj bj ) with each of the perceiving sensors (xi yi ) are approximately parallel for all i (but not for all j! [sent-126, score-0.968]
</p><p>54 Under the far ﬁeld approximation, these incident angles are entirely parallel. [sent-128, score-0.311]
</p><p>55 Thus, all that matters are the incident angle of the acoustic events. [sent-129, score-0.637]
</p><p>56 To derive an equation for this case, it shall prove convenient to write the Euclidean distance between a sensor and an acoustic event as a function of the incident angle α. [sent-130, score-1.057]
</p><p>57 6, this gives us the following expression for ∆i,j : xi yi  aj bj  =  c−1  ≈  c−1  =  ∆i,j  c−1 (cos αj sin αj )  −  − aj − x i bj − y i  (cos αj sin αj )  aj bj −  aj bj  xi yi  (13)  This leads to the following non-linear least squares problem for the desired sensor locations: ∗ ∗ X ∗ , α1 , .

</p><p>58 ,αM  X  cos α1 sin α1  cos α2 sin α2  ··· ···  cos αM sin αM  2  −∆  (14)  The reader many notice that in this formulation of the SFS problem, the locations of the sound events (aj , bj ) have been replaced by αj , the incident angles of the sound waves. [sent-143, score-1.685]
</p><p>59 One might think of this as the “ortho-acoustic” model of sound propagation (in analogy to the orthographic camera model in computer vision). [sent-144, score-0.223]
</p><p>60 Specifically, we know that the matrix ∆ can be decomposed as into three other matrices, U , V , and W : UV W T  =  svd(∆)  (18)  where U is a matrix of size (N − 1) × 2, V a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of size 2 × 2, and W a matrix of size M × 2. [sent-153, score-0.184]
</p><p>61 The key insight is that for any invertible 2 × 2 matrix C, X  U V C −1  =  and  Γ  = CW T  (20)  is equally a solution to the factorization problem in Eq. [sent-163, score-0.136]

</p><p>67 In (tens of thousands of) experiments with synthetic noise-free data, we ﬁnd empirically that gradient descent reliably converges to the globally optimal solution. [sent-193, score-0.251]
</p><p>68 5  Recovering the Acoustic Event Locations and Emission Times  With regards to the acoustic events, the optimization for the far ﬁeld case only yields the incident angles. [sent-194, score-0.686]
</p><p>69 In the near ﬁeld setting, in which the incident angles tend to differ for different sensors, it may be desirable to recover the locations A of the acoustic event and the corresponding emission times T . [sent-195, score-1.086]
</p><p>70 To determine these variables, we use the vector X ∗ from the far ﬁeld case as mere starting points in a subsequent gradient search. [sent-196, score-0.167]
</p><p>71 The event location matrix A is initialized by selecting points sufﬁciently far away along the estimated incident angle for the far ﬁeld approximation to be sound: A ∗  = ∗  kΓ∗ T  (24) ∗  Here Γ = C W with C deﬁned in Eq. [sent-197, score-0.606]

</p><p>79 Clearly, as N and M increase, plain gradient descent tends to diverge, whereas our approach converges. [sent-225, score-0.282]
</p><p>80 Each data point in these graphs was obtained by averaging 1,000 random conﬁgurations, in which sensors were sampled uniformly within an interval of 1×1m; sounds were placed at varying ranges, from 2m to 10m. [sent-226, score-0.235]
</p><p>81 This ﬁgure plots (a) a simulated sensor array consisting of 9 sensors with 9 sound sources arranged in a circle; and (b)-(d) the resulting reconstructions of our three methods. [sent-230, score-0.727]
</p><p>82 An interesting question pertains to the effect of the far ﬁeld approximation in cases where it is clearly violated. [sent-232, score-0.122]
</p><p>83 To examine the robustness of our approach, we ran a series of experiments in which we varied the diameter of the acoustic events relative to the diameter of the sensors. [sent-233, score-0.751]
</p><p>84 If this parameter is 1, the acoustic events are emitted in the same region as the microphones; for values such as 10, the events are far away. [sent-234, score-0.897]
</p><p>85 The further away the acoustic events, the better our results. [sent-237, score-0.427]
</p><p>86 However, even for nearby events, for which the far ﬁeld assumption is clearly invalid, our approach generates results that are no worse than those of the plain gradient descent technique. [sent-238, score-0.347]
</p><p>87 We also implemented our approach using a physical sensor array. [sent-239, score-0.255]

</p><p>91 7  Discussion  This paper considered the structure from sound problem and presented an algorithm for solving it. [sent-251, score-0.248]
</p><p>92 Our approach makes is possible to simultaneously recover the location of a collection of microphones, the locations of external acoustic events detected by these microphones, and the emission times for these events. [sent-252, score-1.036]
</p><p>93 By resorting to afﬁne geometry, our approach overcomes the problem of local minima in the structure from sound problem. [sent-253, score-0.278]
</p><p>94 It shall further be interesting to investigate data association problems in the SFS framework, and to develop parallel algorithms that can be implemented on sensor networks with limited communication resources. [sent-257, score-0.35]

We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events.

Gradient ﬂow representation of the traveling wave signals acquired over a miniature (1cm diameter) array of four microphones yields linearly mixed instantaneous observations of the time-differentiated sources, separated and localized by independent component analysis (ICA). The gradient ﬂow and ICA processors each measure 3mm × 3mm in 0.5 µm CMOS, and consume 54 µW and 180 µW power, respectively, from a 3 V supply at 16 ks/s sampling rate. Experiments demonstrate perceptually clear (12dB) separation and precise localization of two speech sources presented through speakers positioned at 1.5m from the array on a conference room table.

In our system model, a data center acquires data from a bunch of L sensors which each independently encode their noisy observations of an original binary sequence, and transmit their encoded data sequences to the data center at a combined rate R, which is limited. Supposing that the sensors use independent LDGM rate distortion codes, we show that the system performance can be evaluated for any given ﬁnite R when the number of sensors L goes to inﬁnity. The analysis shows how the optimal strategy for the distributed sensing problem changes at critical values of the data rate R or the noise level. 1</p><p>4 0.094212361 <a title="20-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-An_aVLSI_Cricket_Ear_Model.html">25 nips-2005-An aVLSI Cricket Ear Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Andre V. Schaik, Richard Reeve, Craig Jin, Tara Hamilton</p><p>Abstract: Female crickets can locate males by phonotaxis to the mating song they produce. The behaviour and underlying physiology has been studied in some depth showing that the cricket auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. We present an analogue very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of this process and show that results from testing the circuit agree with simulation and what is known from the behaviour and physiology of the cricket auditory system. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway. 1 In trod u ction Understanding how insects carry out complex sensorimotor tasks can help in the design of simple sensory and robotic systems. Often insect sensors have evolved into intricate filters matched to extract highly specific data from the environment which solves a particular problem directly with little or no need for further processing [1]. Examples include head stabilisation in the fly, which uses vision amongst other senses to estimate self-rotation and thus to stabilise its head in flight, and phonotaxis in the cricket. Because of the narrowness of the cricket body (only a few millimetres), the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) for sounds arriving at the two sides of the head is very small (10–20µs). Even with the tympanal membranes (eardrums) located, as they are, on the forelegs of the cricket, the ITD only reaches about 40µs, which is too low to detect directly from timings of neural spikes. Because the wavelength of the cricket calling song is significantly greater than the width of the cricket body the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) is also very low. In the absence of ITD or IID information, the cricket uses phase to determine direction. This is possible because the male cricket produces an almost pure tone for its calling song. * School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. + Figure 1: The cricket auditory system. Four acoustic inputs channel sounds directly or through tracheal tubes onto two tympanal membranes. Sound from contralateral inputs has to pass a (double) central membrane (the medial septum), inducing a phase delay and reduction in gain. The sound transmission from the contralateral tympanum is very weak, making each eardrum effectively a 3 input system. The physics of the cricket auditory system is well understood [2]; the system (see Figure 1) uses a pair of sound receivers with four acoustic inputs, two on the forelegs, which are the external surfaces of the tympana, and two on the body, the prothoracic or acoustic spiracles [3]. The connecting tracheal tubes are such that interference occurs as sounds travel inside the cricket, producing a directional response at the tympana to frequencies near to that of the calling song. The amplitude of vibration of the tympana, and hence the firing rate of the auditory afferent neurons attached to them, vary as a sound source is moved around the cricket and the sounds from the different inputs move in and out of phase. The outputs of the two tympana match when the sound is straight ahead, and the inputs are bilaterally symmetric with respect to the sound source. However, when sound at the calling song frequency is off-centre the phase of signals on the closer side comes better into alignment, and the signal increases on that side, and conversely decreases on the other. It is that crossover of tympanal vibration amplitudes which allows the cricket to track a sound source (see Figure 6 for example). A simplified version of the auditory system using only two acoustic inputs was implemented in hardware [4], and a simple 8-neuron network was all that was required to then direct a robot to carry out phonotaxis towards a species-specific calling song [5]. A simple simulator was also created to model the behaviour of the auditory system of Figure 1 at different frequencies [6]. Data from Michelsen et al. [2] (Figures 5 and 6) were digitised, and used together with average and “typical” values from the paper to choose gains and delays for the simulation. Figure 2 shows the model of the internal auditory system of the cricket from sound arriving at the acoustic inputs through to transmission down auditory receptor fibres. The simulator implements this model up to the summing of the delayed inputs, as well as modelling the external sound transmission. Results from the simulator were used to check the directionality of the system at different frequencies, and to gain a better understanding of its response. It was impractical to check the effect of leg movements or of complex sounds in the simulator due to the necessity of simulating the sound production and transmission. An aVLSI chip was designed to implement the same model, both allowing more complex experiments, such as leg movements to be run, and experiments to be run in the real world. Figure 2: A model of the auditory system of the cricket, used to build the simulator and the aVLSI implementation (shown in boxes). These experiments with the simulator and the circuits are being published in [6] and the reader is referred to those papers for more details. In the present paper we present the details of the circuits used for the aVLSI implementation. 2 Circuits The chip, implementing the aVLSI box in Figure 2, comprises two all-pass delay filters, three gain circuits, a second-order narrow-band band-pass filter, a first-order wide-band band-pass filter, a first-order high-pass filter, as well as supporting circuitry (including reference voltages, currents, etc.). A single aVLSI chip (MOSIS tiny-chip) thus includes half the necessary circuitry to model the complete auditory system of a cricket. The complete model of the auditory system can be obtained by using two appropriately connected chips. Only two all-pass delay filters need to be implemented instead of three as suggested by Figure 2, because it is only the relative delay between the three pathways arriving at the one summing node that counts. The delay circuits were implemented with fully-differential gm-C filters. In order to extend the frequency range of the delay, a first-order all-pass delay circuit was cascaded with a second-order all-pass delay circuit. The resulting addition of the first-order delay and the second-order delay allowed for an approximately flat delay response for a wider bandwidth as the decreased delay around the corner frequency of the first-order filter cancelled with the increased delay of the second-order filter around its resonant frequency. Figure 3 shows the first- and second-order sections of the all-pass delay circuit. Two of these circuits were used and, based on data presented in [2], were designed with delays of 28µs and 62µs, by way of bias current manipulation. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in figure 3 is a standard OTA which includes the common-mode feedback necessary for fully differential designs. The buffers (Figure 3) are simple, cascoded differential pairs. V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ Figure 3: The first-order all-pass delay circuit (left) and the second-order all-pass delay (right). The differential output of the delay circuits is converted into a current which is multiplied by a variable gain implemented as shown in Figure 4. The gain cell includes a differential pair with source degeneration via transistors N4 and N5. The source degeneration improves the linearity of the current. The three gain cells implemented on the aVLSI have default gains of 2, 3 and 0.91 which are set by holding the default input high and appropriately ratioing the bias currents through the value of vbiasp. To correct any on-chip mismatches and/or explore other gain configurations a current splitter cell [7] (p-splitter, figure 4) allows the gain to be programmed by digital means post fabrication. The current splitter takes an input current (Ibias, figure 4) and divides it into branches which recursively halve the current, i.e., the first branch gives ½ Ibias, the second branch ¼ Ibias, the third branch 1/8 Ibias and so on. These currents can be used together with digitally controlled switches as a Digital-to-Analogue converter. By holding default low and setting C5:C0 appropriately, any gain – from 4 to 0.125 – can be set. To save on output pins the program bits (C5:C0) for each of the three gain cells are set via a single 18-bit shift register in bit-serial fashion. Summing the output of the three gain circuits in the current domain simply involves connecting three wires together. Therefore, a natural option for the filters that follow is to use current domain filters. In our case we have chosen to implement log-domain filters using MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Figure 5 shows the basic building blocks for the filters – the Tau Cell [8] and the multiplier cell – and block diagrams showing how these blocks were connected to create the necessary filtering blocks. The Tau Cell is a log-domain filter which has the firstorder response: I out 1 , = I in sτ + 1 where τ = nC aVT Ia and n = the slope factor, VT = thermal voltage, Ca = capacitance, and Ia = bias current. In figure 5, the input currents to the Tau Cell, Imult and A*Ia, are only used when building a second-order filter. The multiplier cell is simply a translinear loop where: I out1 ∗ I mult = I out 2 ∗ AI a or Imult = AIaIout2/Iout1. The configurations of the Tau Cell to get particular responses are covered in [8] along with the corresponding equations. The high frequency filter of Figure 2 is implemented by the high-pass filter in Figure 5 with a corner frequency of 17kHz. The low frequency filter, however, is divided into two parts since the biological filter’s response (see for example Figure 3A in [9]) separates well into a narrow second-order band-pass filter with a 10kHz resonant frequency and a wide band-pass filter made from a first-order high-pass filter with a 3kHz corner frequency followed by a first-order low-pass filter with a 12kHz corner frequency. These filters are then added together to reproduce the biological filter. The filters’ responses can be adjusted post fabrication via their bias currents. This allows for compensation due to processing and matching errors. Figure 4: The Gain Cell above is used to convert the differential voltage input from the delay cells into a single-ended current output. The gain of each cell is controllable via a programmable current cell (p_splitter). An on-chip bias generator [7] was used to create all the necessary current biases on the chip. All the main blocks (delays, gain cells and filters), however, can have their on-chip bias currents overridden through external pins on the chip. The chip was fabricated using the MOSIS AMI 1.6µm technology and designed using the Cadence Custom IC Design Tools (5.0.33). 3 Methods The chip was tested using sound generated on a computer and played through a soundcard to the chip. Responses from the chip were recorded by an oscilloscope, and uploaded back to the computer on completion. Given that the output from the chip and the gain circuits is a current, an external current-sense circuit built with discrete components was used to enable the output to be probed by the oscilloscope. Figure 5: The circuit diagrams for the log-domain filter building blocks – The Tau Cell and The Multiplier – along with the block diagrams for the three filters used in the aVLSI model. Initial experiments were performed to tune the delays and gains. After that, recordings were taken of the directional frequency responses. Sounds were generated by computer for each chip input to simulate moving the forelegs by delaying the sound by the appropriate amount of time; this was a much simpler solution than using microphones and moving them using motors. 4 Results The aVLSI chip was tested to measure its gains and delays, which were successfully tuned to the appropriate values. The chip was then compared with the simulation to check that it was faithfully modelling the system. A result of this test at 4kHz (approximately the cricket calling-song frequency) is shown in Figure 6. Apart from a drop in amplitude of the signal, the response of the circuit was very similar to that of the simulator. The differences were expected because the aVLSI circuit has to deal with real-world noise, whereas the simulated version has perfect signals. Examples of the gain versus frequency response of the two log-domain band-pass filters are shown in Figure 7. Note that the narrow-band filter peaks at 6kHz, which is significantly above the mating song frequency of the cricket which is around 4.5kHz. This is not a mistake, but is observed in real crickets as well. As stated in the introduction, a range of further testing results with both the circuit and the simulator are being published in [6]. 5 D i s c u s s i on The aVLSI auditory sensor in this research models the hearing of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. It is a more faithful model of the cricket auditory system than was previously built in [4], reproducing all the acoustic inputs, as well as the responses to frequencies of both the co specific calling song and bat echolocation chirps. It also generates outputs corresponding to the two sets of behaviourally relevant auditory receptor fibres. Results showed that it matched the biological data well, though there were some inconsistencies due to an error in the specification that will be addressed in a future iteration of the design. A more complete implementation across all frequencies was impractical because of complexity and size issues as well as serving no clear behavioural purpose. Figure 6: Vibration amplitude of the left (dotted) and right (solid) virtual tympana measured in decibels in response to a 4kHz tone in simulation (left) and on the aVLSI chip (right). The plot shows the amplitude of the tympanal responses as the sound source is rotated around the cricket. Figure 7: Frequency-Gain curves for the narrow-band and wide-band bandpass filters. The long-term aim of this work is to better understand simple sensorimotor control loops in crickets and other insects. The next step is to mount this circuitry on a robot to carry out behavioural experiments, which we will compare with existing and new behavioural data (such as that in [10]). This will allow us to refine our models of the neural circuitry involved. Modelling the sensory afferent neurons in hardware is necessary in order to reduce processor load on our robot, so the next revision will include these either onboard, or on a companion chip as we have done before [11]. We will also move both sides of the auditory system onto a single chip to conserve space on the robot. It is our belief and experience that, as a result of this intelligent pre-processing carried out at the sensor level, the neural circuits necessary to accurately model the behaviour will remain simple.

<p>Author: Michael B. Wakin, Marco F. Duarte, Shriram Sarvotham, Dror Baron, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Compressed sensing is an emerging ﬁeld based on the revelation that a small group of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressed sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. We study three simple models for jointly sparse signals, propose algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections, and characterize theoretically and empirically the number of measurements per sensor required for accurate reconstruction. In some sense DCS is a framework for distributed compression of sources with memory, which has remained a challenging problem in information theory for some time. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor networks and arrays. 1</p><p>6 0.086483166 <a title="20-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-A_Domain_Decomposition_Method_for_Fast_Manifold_Learning.html">9 nips-2005-A Domain Decomposition Method for Fast Manifold Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing a set of microphones together with a set of external acoustic events (e.g., hand claps), emitted at unknown times and unknown locations. We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events. The approach is useful for the calibration of ad-hoc microphone arrays and sensor networks. 1</p><p>2 0.67449009 <a title="20-lsi-2" href="./nips-2005-Gradient_Flow_Independent_Component_Analysis_in_Micropower_VLSI.html">88 nips-2005-Gradient Flow Independent Component Analysis in Micropower VLSI</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun-gang Zhang, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Separation of music signals is an interesting but difﬁcult problem. It is helpful for many other music researches such as audio content analysis. In this paper, a new music signal separation method is proposed, which is based on harmonic structure modeling. The main idea of harmonic structure modeling is that the harmonic structure of a music signal is stable, so a music signal can be represented by a harmonic structure model. Accordingly, a corresponding separation algorithm is proposed. The main idea is to learn a harmonic structure model for each music signal in the mixture, and then separate signals by using these models to distinguish harmonic structures of different signals. Experimental results show that the algorithm can separate signals and obtain not only a very high Signalto-Noise Ratio (SNR) but also a rather good subjective audio quality. 1</p><p>4 0.48248041 <a title="20-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Stimulus_Evoked_Independent_Factor_Analysis_of_MEG_Data_with_Large_Background_Activity.html">183 nips-2005-Stimulus Evoked Independent Factor Analysis of MEG Data with Large Background Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing a set of microphones together with a set of external acoustic events (e.g., hand claps), emitted at unknown times and unknown locations. We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events. The approach is useful for the calibration of ad-hoc microphone arrays and sensor networks. 1</p><p>2 0.79358906 <a title="20-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Non-iterative_Estimation_with_Perturbed_Gaussian_Markov_Processes.html">139 nips-2005-Non-iterative Estimation with Perturbed Gaussian Markov Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yunsong Huang, B. Keith Jenkins</p><p>Abstract: We develop an approach for estimation with Gaussian Markov processes that imposes a smoothness prior while allowing for discontinuities. Instead of propagating information laterally between neighboring nodes in a graph, we study the posterior distribution of the hidden nodes as a whole—how it is perturbed by invoking discontinuities, or weakening the edges, in the graph. We show that the resulting computation amounts to feed-forward fan-in operations reminiscent of V1 neurons. Moreover, using suitable matrix preconditioners, the incurred matrix inverse and determinant can be approximated, without iteration, in the same computational style. Simulation results illustrate the merits of this approach.</p><p>3 0.72455049 <a title="20-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Online_Policy_Gradient_Learning_with_SMD_Gain_Vector_Adaptation.html">72 nips-2005-Fast Online Policy Gradient Learning with SMD Gain Vector Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jin Yu, Douglas Aberdeen, Nicol N. Schraudolph</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning by direct policy gradient estimation is attractive in theory but in practice leads to notoriously ill-behaved optimization problems. We improve its robustness and speed of convergence with stochastic meta-descent, a gain vector adaptation method that employs fast Hessian-vector products. In our experiments the resulting algorithms outperform previously employed online stochastic, ofﬂine conjugate, and natural policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>4 0.46565112 <a title="20-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Inference_with_Minimal_Communication%3A_a_Decision-Theoretic_Variational_Approach.html">96 nips-2005-Inference with Minimal Communication: a Decision-Theoretic Variational Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: O. P. Kreidl, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graphical model with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach leads to a novel message-passing algorithm to be executed ofﬂine, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative examples, (ii) assumptions that guarantee convergence and efﬁciency and (iii) connections to active research areas. 1</p><p>5 0.46465304 <a title="20-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Variable_KD-Tree_Algorithms_for_Spatial_Pattern_Search_and_Discovery.html">200 nips-2005-Variable KD-Tree Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Search and Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Kubica, Joseph Masiero, Robert Jedicke, Andrew Connolly, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding sets of points that conform to a given underlying model from within a dense, noisy set of observations. This problem is motivated by the task of efﬁciently linking faint asteroid detections, but is applicable to a range of spatial queries. We survey current tree-based approaches, showing a trade-off exists between single tree and multiple tree algorithms. To this end, we present a new type of multiple tree algorithm that uses a variable number of trees to exploit the advantages of both approaches. We empirically show that this algorithm performs well using both simulated and astronomical data.</p><p>6 0.45438132 <a title="20-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Size_Regularized_Cut_for_Data_Clustering.html">177 nips-2005-Size Regularized Cut for Data Clustering</a></p>

</p><p>2 We give an efﬁcient conversion algorithm from batch to online that is transductive: it uses future unlabeled data. [sent-5, score-0.679]
</p><p>3 This demonstrates the equivalence between what is properly and efﬁciently learnable in a batch model and a transductive online model. [sent-6, score-0.916]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction There are many striking similarities between results in the standard batch learning setting, where labeled examples are assumed to be drawn independently from some distribution, and the more difﬁcult online setting, where labeled examples arrive in an arbitrary sequence. [sent-7, score-0.902]
</p><p>5 Moreover, there are simple procedures that convert any online learning algorithm to an equally good batch learning algorithm [8]. [sent-8, score-0.701]
</p><p>6 It is well-known that the online setting is strictly harder than the batch setting, even for the simple one-dimensioanl class of threshold functions on the interval [0, 1]. [sent-10, score-0.616]
</p><p>7 Hence, we consider the online transductive model of Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour [2]. [sent-11, score-0.5]
</p><p>8 In this model, an arbitrary but unknown sequence of n examples (x1 , y1 ), . [sent-12, score-0.148]
</p><p>9 The set of unlabeled examples is then presented to the learner, Σ = {xi |1 ≤ i ≤ n}. [sent-16, score-0.187]
</p><p>10 The examples are then revealed, in an online manner, to the learner, for i = 1, 2, . [sent-17, score-0.319]
</p><p>11 The learner observes example xi (along with all previous labeled examples (x1 , y1 ), . [sent-21, score-0.32]
</p><p>12 , (xi−1 , yi−1 ) and the unlabeled example set Σ) and must predict yi . [sent-24, score-0.134]
</p><p>13 After this occurs, the learner compares its number of mistakes to the minimum number of mistakes of any of a target class F of functions f : X → {−1, 1} (such as linear threshold functions). [sent-26, score-1.456]
</p><p>14 Note that our results are in this type of agnostic model [7], where we allow for arbitrary labels, unlike the realizable setting, i. [sent-27, score-0.212]
</p><p>15 With this simple transductive knowledge of what unlabeled examples are to come, one can use existing expert algorithms to inefﬁciently learn any class of ﬁnite VC dimension, similar to the batch setting. [sent-30, score-0.782]
</p><p>16 How does one use unlabeled examples efﬁciently to guarantee good online performance? [sent-31, score-0.412]
</p><p>17 Our efﬁcient algorithm A2 converts a proper1 batch algorithm to a proper online algorithm (both in the agnostic setting). [sent-32, score-0.901]
</p><p>18 It then “hallucinates” random examples by taking some number of unlabeled examples and labeling them randomly. [sent-34, score-0.281]
</p><p>19 It appends these examples to those observed so far and predicts according to the batch algorithm that ﬁnds the hypothesis of minimum empirical error on the combined data. [sent-35, score-0.642]
</p><p>20 The idea of “hallucinating” and optimizing has been used for designing efﬁcient online algorithms [6, 5, 1, 10, 4] in situations where exponential weighting schemes were inefﬁcient. [sent-36, score-0.225]
</p><p>21 In the context of transductive learning, it seems to be a natural way to try to use the unlabeled examples in conjunction with a batch learner. [sent-38, score-0.782]
</p><p>22 Let #mistakes(f, σn ) denote the number of mistakes of a function f ∈ F on a particular sequence σn ∈ (X × {−1, 1})n , and #mistakes(A, σn ) denote the same quantity for a transductive online learning algorithm A. [sent-39, score-1.265]
</p><p>23 There is an efﬁcient randomized transductive online algorithm that, for any n > 1 and σn ∈ (X × {−1, 1})n , E[#mistakes(A2 , σn )] ≤ minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ) + 2. [sent-43, score-0.821]
</p><p>24 The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient in the sense that it runs in time poly(n), given an efﬁcient proper batch learning algorithm. [sent-45, score-0.567]
</p><p>25 Consequently, the classes of functions learnable in the batch and transductive online settings are the same. [sent-48, score-0.921]
</p><p>26 The classes of functions properly learnable by computationally efﬁcient algorithms in the proper batch and transductive online settings are identical, as well. [sent-49, score-1.12]
</p><p>27 In addition to the new algorithm, this is interesting because it helps justify a long line of work suggesting that whatever can be done in a batch setting can also be done online. [sent-50, score-0.366]
</p><p>28 Our result is surprising in light of earlier work by Blum showing that a slightly different online model is harder than its batch analog for computational reasons and not informationtheoretic reasons [3]. [sent-51, score-0.545]
</p><p>29 In Section 2, we deﬁne the transductive online model. [sent-52, score-0.5]
</p><p>30 In Section 5, we discuss open problems such as extending the results to improper learning and the efﬁcient realizable case. [sent-57, score-0.134]
</p><p>31 2 Models and deﬁnitions The transductive online model considered by Ben-David, Kushlevitz, and Mansour [2], consists of an instance space X and label set Y which we will always take to be binary Y = {−1, 1}. [sent-58, score-0.522]
</p><p>32 An arbitrary n > 0 and arbitrary sequence of labeled examples (x1 , y1 ), . [sent-59, score-0.232]
</p><p>33 For notational convenience, we deﬁne σi to be the subsequence of ﬁrst i 1  A proper learning algorithm is one that always outputs a hypothesis h ∈ F . [sent-64, score-0.316]
</p><p>34 , (xi , yi ), and Σ to be the set of all unlabeled examples in σn , Σ = {xi | i ∈ {1, 2, . [sent-68, score-0.228]
</p><p>35 The number of mistakes of A on the sequence σn = (x1 , y1 ), . [sent-73, score-0.697]
</p><p>36 , (xn , yn ) is, #mistakes(A, σn ) = |{i | A(n, Σ, xi , σi−1 ) = yi }|. [sent-76, score-0.155]
</p><p>37 Formally, paralleling agnostic learning [7],2 we deﬁne an efﬁcient transductive online learner A for class F to be one for which the learning algorithm runs in time poly(n) and achieves, for any > 0, E[#mistakes(A, σn )] ≤ minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ) + n, for n =poly(1/ ). [sent-79, score-0.969]
</p><p>38 1 Proper learning Proper batch learning requires one to output a hypothesis h ∈ F. [sent-81, score-0.448]
</p><p>39 An efﬁcient proper batch learning algorithm for F is a batch learning algorithm B that, given any > 0, with n = poly(1/ ) many examples from any distribution D, outputs an h ∈ F of expected error E[PrD [h(x) = y]] ≤ minf ∈F PrD [f (x) = y] + and runs in time poly(n). [sent-82, score-1.309]
</p><p>40 Any efﬁcient proper batch learning algorithm B can be converted into an efﬁcient empirical error minimizer M that, for any n, given any data set σn ∈ (X × Y)n , outputs an f ∈ F of minimal empirical error on σn . [sent-84, score-0.881]
</p><p>41 Running B only on σn , B is not guaranteed to output a hypothesis of minimum empirical error. [sent-86, score-0.149]
</p><p>42 If B indeed returns a hypothesis h of error less than 1/n more than the best f ∈ F, it must be a hypothesis of minimum empirical error on σn . [sent-88, score-0.237]
</p><p>43 To deﬁne proper learning in an online setting, it is helpful to think of the following alternative deﬁnition of transductive online learning. [sent-92, score-0.906]
</p><p>44 After the ith hypothesis hi is output, the example (xi , yi ) is revealed, and it is clear whether the learner made an error. [sent-97, score-0.29]
</p><p>45 Formally, the (possibly randomized) algorithm A still takes as input n, Σ, and σi−1 (but 2 It is more common in online learning to bound the total number of mistakes of an online algorithm on an arbitrary sequence. [sent-98, score-1.274]
</p><p>46 We bound its error rate, as is usual for batch learning. [sent-99, score-0.346]
</p><p>47 no longer xi ), and outputs hi : X → {−1, 1} and errs if hi (xi ) = yi . [sent-101, score-0.378]
</p><p>48 To see that this model is equivalent to the previous deﬁnition, note that any algorithm A that outputs hypotheses hi can be used to make predictions hi (xi ) on example i (it errs if hi (xi ) = yi ). [sent-102, score-0.413]
</p><p>49 This is because A can be viewed as outputting hi : X → {−1, 1}, where the function hi is deﬁned by setting hi (x) equal to be the prediction of algorithm A on the sequence σi−1 followed by the example x, for each x ∈ X , i. [sent-104, score-0.395]
</p><p>50 ) A (possibly randomized) transductive online algorithm in this model is deﬁned to be proper for family of functions F if it always outputs hi ∈ F . [sent-108, score-0.846]
</p><p>51 3 Warmup: the realizable case In this section, we consider the realizable special case in which there is some f ∈ F which correctly labels all examples. [sent-109, score-0.214]
</p><p>52 Say there are at most L different ways to label the examples in Σ according to functions f ∈ F, so 1 ≤ L ≤ 2|Σ| . [sent-116, score-0.141]
</p><p>53 In the transductive online model, L is determined by Σ and F only. [sent-117, score-0.5]
</p><p>54 Hence, as long as prediction occurs only on examples x ∈ Σ, there are effectively only L different functions in F that matter, and we can thus pick L such functions that give rise to the L different labelings. [sent-118, score-0.184]
</p><p>55 On the ith example, one could simply take majority vote of fj (xi ) over consistent labelings fj (the so-called halving algorithm), and this would easily ensure at most log2 (L) mistakes, because each mistake eliminates at least half of the consistent labelings. [sent-119, score-0.402]
</p><p>56 One can also use the following proper learning algorithm. [sent-120, score-0.181]
</p><p>57 Proper transductive online learning algorithm in the realizable case: • Preprocessing: Given the set of unlabeled examples Σ, take L functions f1 , f2 , . [sent-121, score-0.887]
</p><p>58 The above randomized proper learning algorithm makes an expected d log(n) mistakes on any sequence of examples of length n ≥ 2, provided that there is some mistake-free f ∈ F. [sent-129, score-1.073]
</p><p>59 Let Vi be the number of labelings fj consistent with the ﬁrst i examples, so that L = V0 ≥ V1 ≥ · · · ≥ Vn ≥ 1 and L ≤ nd , by Sauer’s lemma [11] for n ≥ 2, where d is the VC dimension of F. [sent-131, score-0.286]
</p><p>60 Observe that the number of consistent labelings that make a mistake on the ith example are exactly Vi−1 − Vi . [sent-132, score-0.165]
</p><p>61 Hence, the total expected number of mistakes is, n i=1 4  Vi−1 − Vi ≤ Vi−1  n i=1  1 Vi−1  +  1 Vi−1 − 1  + . [sent-133, score-0.689]
</p><p>62 i  More formally, take L functions with the following properties: for each pair 1 ≤ j, k ≤ L with j = k, there exists x ∈ Σ such that fj (x) = fk (x), and for every f ∈ F , there exists a 1 ≤ j ≤ L with f (x) = fj (x) for all x ∈ Σ. [sent-137, score-0.179]
</p><p>63 Note that, this closely matches what one achieves in the batch setting. [sent-139, score-0.35]
</p><p>64 Like the batch setting, no better bounds can be given up to a constant factor. [sent-140, score-0.339]
</p><p>65 4 General setting We now consider the more difﬁcult unrealizable setting where we have an unconstrained sequence of examples (though we still work in a transductive setting). [sent-141, score-0.525]
</p><p>66 We begin by presenting an known (inefﬁcnet) extension to the halving algorithm of the previous section, that works in the agnostic (unrealizable) setting that is similar to the previous algorithm. [sent-142, score-0.197]
</p><p>67 Inefﬁcient proper transductive online learning algorithm A1 : • Preprocessing: Given the set of unlabeled examples Σ, take L functions f1 , f2 , . [sent-143, score-0.934]
</p><p>68 • Update: for each j for which fj (xi ) = yi , reduce wj , wj := wj 1 −  log L n  . [sent-155, score-0.266]
</p><p>69 Using an analysis very similar to that of Weighted Majority [9], one can show that, for any n > 1 and sequence of examples σn ∈ (X × {−1, 1})n , E[#mistakes(A1 , σn )] = minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ) + 2  dn log n,  where d is the VC dimension of F. [sent-156, score-0.425]
</p><p>70 1 Efﬁcient algorithm We can only hope to get an efﬁcient proper online algorithm when there is an efﬁcient proper batch algorithm. [sent-159, score-0.935]
</p><p>71 1, this means that there is a batch algorithm M that, given any data set, efﬁciently ﬁnds a hypothesis h ∈ F of minimum empirical error. [sent-161, score-0.491]
</p><p>72 (In fact, most proper learning algorithms work this way to begin with. [sent-162, score-0.181]
</p><p>73 Efﬁcient transductive online learning algorithm A2 : • Preprocessing: Given the set of unlabeled examples Σ, create a hallucinated data set τ as follows. [sent-164, score-0.809]
</p><p>74 For each example x ∈ Σ,√ choose integer rx uniformly at random √ such that − 4 n ≤ rx ≤ 4 n. [sent-166, score-0.152]
</p><p>75 • To predict on xi : output hypothesis M (τ σi−1 ) ∈ F, where τ σi−1 is the concatenation of the hallucinated examples and the observed labeled examples so far. [sent-169, score-0.467]
</p><p>76 Let A2 be the algorithm that, for each i, predicts f (xi ) based on f ∈ F which is any empirical minimizer on the concatenated data τ σi , i. [sent-177, score-0.242]
</p><p>77 Then the total number of mistakes of A2 is, #mistakes(A2 , σn ) ≤ minf ∈F #mistakes(f, τ σn ) − minf ∈F #mistakes(f, τ ). [sent-180, score-1.129]
</p><p>78 The above lemma means that if one could use the hypothetical “be the leader” algorithm then one would make no more mistakes than the best f ∈ F . [sent-185, score-0.842]
</p><p>79 The ﬁrst inequality above holds by induction hypothesis, and the second follows from the fact that gt is an empirical minimizer of τ σt . [sent-207, score-0.259]
</p><p>80 The total mistakes of the hypothetical algorithm proposed in the n lemma is i=1 mi , which gives the lemma by rearranging (1) for t = n. [sent-209, score-0.981]
</p><p>81 For any σn , Eτ [minf ∈F #mistakes(f, τ σn )] ≤ Eτ [|τ |/2] + minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ). [sent-211, score-0.22]
</p><p>82 For the ﬁrst part of the lemma, let g = M (σn ) be an empirical minimizer on σn . [sent-215, score-0.17]
</p><p>83 The last inequality holds because, since each example in τ is equally likely to have a ± label, the expected number of mistakes of any ﬁxed g ∈ F on τ is E[|τ |/2]. [sent-217, score-0.708]
</p><p>84 For the second part of the lemma, observe that we can write the number of mistakes of f on τ as, #mistakes(f, τ ) =  |τ | −  n i=1  2  f (xi )ri  . [sent-219, score-0.669]
</p><p>85 For any σn , for any i, with probability at least 1 − n−1/4 over τ , M (τ σi−1 ) is an empirical minimizer of τ σi . [sent-234, score-0.17]
</p><p>86 , if all f ∈ F predict the same sign f (xi ), then the sets of empirical minimizers of τ σi−1 and τ σi are equal and the lemma holds trivially. [sent-240, score-0.166]
</p><p>87 For any sequence π ∈ (X × Y)∗ , deﬁne, s+ (π) = minf ∈F+ #mistakes(f, π) and s− (π) = minf ∈F− #mistakes(f, π). [sent-241, score-0.468]
</p><p>88 If they are equal then f (xi ) can be an empirical minimizer in either. [sent-244, score-0.17]
</p><p>89 It is now clear that if M (τ σi−1 ) is not also an empirical minimizer of τ σi then s+ (τ σi−1 ) = s− (τ σi−1 ). [sent-249, score-0.17]
</p><p>90 If we ﬁx σn and the random choices rx for each x ∈ Σ \ {xi }, as we increase or decrease ri by 1, ∆ correspondingly increases or decreases by 1. [sent-251, score-0.155]
</p><p>91 Combining Lemmas 1 and 2, if on each period i, we used any minimizer of empirical error on the data τ σi , we would have a total number of mistakes of at √ most minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ) + 1. [sent-255, score-1.105]
</p><p>92 Then, its total number of mistakes can only be p larger than this bound. [sent-258, score-0.689]
</p><p>93 By Lemma 3, the expected number p of periods i in which an empirical minimizer of τ σi is not used is ≤ n3/4 . [sent-259, score-0.17]
</p><p>94 Hence, the expected total number of mistakes of A2 is at most, Eτ [#mistakes(A2 , σn )] ≤ minf ∈F #mistakes(f, σn ) + 1. [sent-260, score-0.909]
</p><p>95 The above algorithm is still costly in the sense that we must re-run the batch error minimizer for each prediction we would like to make. [sent-264, score-0.519]
</p><p>96 5 Conclusions and open problems We have given an algorithm for learning in the transductive online setting and established several results between efﬁcient proper batch and transductive online learnability. [sent-269, score-1.588]
</p><p>97 Hence, it is an open question as to whether efﬁcient learnability in the batch and transductive online settings are the same in the realizable case. [sent-271, score-0.956]
</p><p>98 In addition, our computationally efﬁcient algorithm requires polynomially more examples than its inefﬁcient counterpart. [sent-272, score-0.16]
</p><p>99 It would be nice to have the best of both worlds, namely √ computationally efﬁcient algorithm that a achieves a number of mistakes that is at most O( dn log n). [sent-273, score-0.844]
</p><p>100 Additionally, it would be nice to remove the restriction to proper algorithms. [sent-274, score-0.173]

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms are typically fast, memory efﬁcient, and simple to implement. However, many common learning problems ﬁt more naturally in the batch learning setting. The power of online learning algorithms can be exploited in batch settings by using online-to-batch conversions techniques which build a new batch algorithm from an existing online algorithm. We ﬁrst give a uniﬁed overview of three existing online-to-batch conversion techniques which do not use training data in the conversion process.

<p>Author: Y. Altun, D. McAllester, M. Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world classiﬁcation problems involve the prediction of multiple inter-dependent variables forming some structural dependency. Recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on supervised classiﬁcation of such structured variables. In this paper, we investigate structured classiﬁcation in a semi-supervised setting. We present a discriminative approach that utilizes the intrinsic geometry of input patterns revealed by unlabeled data points and we derive a maximum-margin formulation of semi-supervised learning for structured variables. Unlike transductive algorithms, our formulation naturally extends to new test points. 1</p><p>5 0.093673781 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Coarse_sample_complexity_bounds_for_active_learning.html">41 nips-2005-Coarse sample complexity bounds for active learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Sham Kakade, Adam Tauman Kalai</p><p>Abstract: It is well-known that everything that is learnable in the difﬁcult online setting, where an arbitrary sequences of examples must be labeled one at a time, is also learnable in the batch setting, where examples are drawn independently from a distribution. We show a result in the opposite direction. We give an efﬁcient conversion algorithm from batch to online that is transductive: it uses future unlabeled data.

<p>Author: John V. Arthur, Kwabena Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neuromorphic chip that uses binary synapses with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to learn stimulated patterns of activity and to compensate for variability in excitability. Speciﬁcally, STDP preferentially potentiates (turns on) synapses that project from excitable neurons, which spike early, to lethargic neurons, which spike late. The additional excitatory synaptic current makes lethargic neurons spike earlier, thereby causing neurons that belong to the same pattern to spike in synchrony. Once learned, an entire pattern can be recalled by stimulating a subset. 1 Variability in Neural Systems Evidence suggests precise spike timing is important in neural coding, speciﬁcally, in the hippocampus. The hippocampus uses timing in the spike activity of place cells (in addition to rate) to encode location in space [1]. Place cells employ a phase code: the timing at which a neuron spikes relative to the phase of the inhibitory theta rhythm (5-12Hz) conveys information. As an animal approaches a place cell’s preferred location, the place cell not only increases its spike rate, but also spikes at earlier phases in the theta cycle. To implement a phase code, the theta rhythm is thought to prevent spiking until the input synaptic current exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and the decreasing inhibition on the downward phase of the cycle [2]. However, even with identical inputs and common theta inhibition, neurons do not spike in synchrony. Variability in excitability spreads the activity in phase. Lethargic neurons (such as those with high thresholds) spike late in the theta cycle, since their input exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and theta inhibition only after the theta inhibition has had time to decrease. Conversely, excitable neurons (such as those with low thresholds) spike early in the theta cycle. Consequently, variability in excitability translates into variability in timing. We hypothesize that the hippocampus achieves its precise spike timing (about 10ms) through plasticity enhanced phase-coding (PEP). The source of hippocampal timing precision in the presence of variability (and noise) remains unexplained. Synaptic plasticity can compensate for variability in excitability if it increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons in inverse proportion to their excitabilities. Recasting this in a phase-coding framework, we desire a learning rule that increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons directly related to their phases. Neurons that lag require additional synaptic input, whereas neurons that lead 120µm 190µm A B Figure 1: STDP Chip. A The chip has a 16-by-16 array of microcircuits; one microcircuit includes four principal neurons, each with 21 STDP circuits. B The STDP Chip is embedded in a circuit board including DACs, a CPLD, a RAM chip, and a USB chip, which communicates with a PC. require none. The spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) observed in the hippocampus satisﬁes this requirement [3]. It requires repeated pre-before-post spike pairings (within a time window) to potentiate and repeated post-before-pre pairings to depress a synapse. Here we validate our hypothesis with a model implemented in silicon, where variability is as ubiquitous as it is in biology [4]. Section 2 presents our silicon system, including the STDP Chip. Section 3 describes and characterizes the STDP circuit. Section 4 demonstrates that PEP compensates for variability and provides evidence that STDP is the compensation mechanism. Section 5 explores a desirable consequence of PEP: unconventional associative pattern recall. Section 6 discusses the implications of the PEP model, including its beneﬁts and applications in the engineering of neuromorphic systems and in the study of neurobiology. 2 Silicon System We have designed, submitted, and tested a silicon implementation of PEP. The STDP Chip was fabricated through MOSIS in a 1P5M 0.25µm CMOS process, with just under 750,000 transistors in just over 10mm2 of area. It has a 32 by 32 array of excitatory principal neurons commingled with a 16 by 16 array of inhibitory interneurons that are not used here (Figure 1A). Each principal neuron has 21 STDP synapses. The address-event representation (AER) [5] is used to transmit spikes off chip and to receive afferent and recurrent spike input. To conﬁgure the STDP Chip as a recurrent network, we embedded it in a circuit board (Figure 1B). The board has ﬁve primary components: a CPLD (complex programmable logic device), the STDP Chip, a RAM chip, a USB interface chip, and DACs (digital-to-analog converters). The central component in the system is the CPLD. The CPLD handles AER trafﬁc, mediates communication between devices, and implements recurrent connections by accessing a lookup table, stored in the RAM chip. The USB interface chip provides a bidirectional link with a PC. The DACs control the analog biases in the system, including the leak current, which the PC varies in real-time to create the global inhibitory theta rhythm. The principal neuron consists of a refractory period and calcium-dependent potassium circuit (RCK), a synapse circuit, and a soma circuit (Figure 2A). RCK and the synapse are ISOMA Soma Synapse STDP Presyn. Spike PE LPF A Presyn. Spike Raster AH 0 0.1 Spike probability RCK Postsyn.

A A simpliﬁed schematic is shown, including: the synapse, refractory and calcium-dependent potassium channel (RCK), soma, and axon-hillock (AH) circuits, plus their constituent elements, the pulse extender (PE) and the low-pass ﬁlter (LPF). B Spikes (dots) from 81 principal neurons are temporally dispersed, when excited by poisson-like inputs (58Hz) and inhibited by the common 8.3Hz theta rhythm (solid line). The histogram includes spikes from ﬁve theta cycles. composed of two reusable blocks: the low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and the pulse extender (PE). The soma is a modiﬁed version of the LPF, which receives additional input from an axonhillock circuit (AH). RCK is inhibitory to the neuron. It consists of a PE, which models calcium inﬂux during a spike, and a LPF, which models calcium buffering. When AH ﬁres a spike, a packet of charge is dumped onto a capacitor in the PE. The PE’s output activates until the charge decays away, which takes a few milliseconds. Also, while the PE is active, charge accumulates on the LPF’s capacitor, lowering the LPF’s output voltage. Once the PE deactivates, this charge leaks away as well, but this takes tens of milliseconds because the leak is smaller. The PE’s and the LPF’s inhibitory effects on the soma are both described below in terms of the sum (ISHUNT ) of the currents their output voltages produce in pMOS transistors whose sources are at Vdd (see Figure 2A). Note that, in the absence of spikes, these currents decay exponentially, with a time-constant determined by their respective leaks. The synapse circuit is excitatory to the neuron. It is composed of a PE, which represents the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft, and a LPF, which represents the bound neurotransmitter. The synapse circuit is similar to RCK in structure but differs in function: It is activated not by the principal neuron itself but by the STDP circuits (or directly by afferent spikes that bypass these circuits, i.e., ﬁxed synapses). The synapse’s effect on the soma is also described below in terms of the current (ISYN ) its output voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd. The soma circuit is a leaky integrator. It receives excitation from the synapse circuit and shunting inhibition from RCK and has a leak current as well. Its temporal behavior is described by: τ dISOMA ISYN I0 + ISOMA = dt ISHUNT where ISOMA is the current the capacitor’s voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd (see Figure 2A). ISHUNT is the sum of the leak, refractory, and calciumdependent potassium currents. These currents also determine the time constant: τ = C Ut κISHUNT , where I0 and κ are transistor parameters and Ut is the thermal voltage.

A The circuit is composed of three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM. B The circuit potentiates when the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike and depresses when the postsynaptic spike precedes the presynaptic spike. The soma circuit is connected to an AH, the locus of spike generation. The AH consists of model voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channel populations (modiﬁed from [6] by Kai Hynna). It initiates the AER signaling process required to send a spike off chip. To characterize principal neuron variability, we excited 81 neurons with poisson-like 58Hz spike trains (Figure 2B). We made these spike trains poisson-like by starting with a regular 200Hz spike train and dropping spikes randomly, with probability of 0.71. Thus spikes were delivered to neurons that won the coin toss in synchrony every 5ms. However, neurons did not lock onto the input synchrony due to ﬁltering by the synaptic time constant (see Figure 2B). They also received a common inhibitory input at the theta frequency (8.3Hz), via their leak current. Each neuron was prevented from ﬁring more than one spike in a theta cycle by its model calcium-dependent potassium channel population. The principal neurons’ spike times were variable. To quantify the spike variability, we used timing precision, which we deﬁne as twice the standard deviation of spike times accumulated from ﬁve theta cycles. With an input rate of 58Hz the timing precision was 34ms. 3 STDP Circuit The STDP circuit (related to [7]-[8]), for which the STDP Chip is named, is the most abundant, with 21,504 copies on the chip. This circuit is built from three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM (Figure 3A). The decay and integrator are used to implement potentiation, and depression, in a symmetric fashion. The SRAM holds the current binary state of the synapse, either potentiated or depressed. For potentiation, the decay remembers the last presynaptic spike. Its capacitor is charged when that spike occurs and discharges linearly thereafter. A postsynaptic spike samples the charge remaining on the capacitor, passes it through an exponential function, and dumps the resultant charge into the integrator. This charge decays linearly thereafter. At the time of the postsynaptic spike, the SRAM, a cross-coupled inverter pair, reads the voltage on the integrator’s capacitor. If it exceeds a threshold, the SRAM switches state from depressed to potentiated (∼LTD goes high and ∼LTP goes low). The depression side of the STDP circuit is exactly symmetric, except that it responds to postsynaptic activation followed by presynaptic activation and switches the SRAM’s state from potentiated to depressed (∼LTP goes high and ∼LTD goes low). When the SRAM is in the potentiated state, the presynaptic 50 After STDP 83 92 100 Timing precision(ms) Before STDP 75 B Before STDP After STDP 40 30 20 10 0 50 60 70 80 90 Input rate(Hz) 100 50 58 67 text A 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 C Figure 4: Plasticity enhanced phase-coding.

C Each neuron (center box) sends synapses to (dark gray) and receives synapses from (light gray) twenty-one randomly chosen neighbors up to ﬁve nodes away (black indicates both connections). spike activates the principal neuron’s synapse; otherwise the spike has no effect. We characterized the STDP circuit by activating a plastic synapse and a ﬁxed synapse– which elicits a spike at different relative times. We repeated this pairing at 16Hz. We counted the number of pairings required to potentiate (or depress) the synapse. Based on this count, we calculated the efﬁcacy of each pairing as the inverse number of pairings required (Figure 3B). For example, if twenty pairings were required to potentiate the synapse, the efﬁcacy of that pre-before-post time-interval was one twentieth. The efﬁcacy of both potentiation and depression are ﬁt by exponentials with time constants of 11.4ms and 94.9ms, respectively. This behavior is similar to that observed in the hippocampus: potentiation has a shorter time constant and higher maximum efﬁcacy than depression [3]. 4 Recurrent Network We carried out an experiment designed to test the STDP circuit’s ability to compensate for variability in spike timing through PEP. Each neuron received recurrent connections from 21 randomly selected neurons within an 11 by 11 neighborhood centered on itself (see Figure 4C). Conversely, it made recurrent connections to randomly chosen neurons within the same neighborhood. These connections were mediated by STDP circuits, initialized to the depressed state. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons and delivered spikes at a mean rate of 50 to 100Hz to each one (dropping spikes with a probability of 0.75 to 0.5 from a regular 200Hz train) and provided common theta inhibition as before. We compared the variability in spike timing after ﬁve seconds of learning with the initial distribution. Phase coding was enhanced after STDP (Figure 4A). Before STDP, spike timing among neurons was highly variable (except for the very highest input rate). After STDP, variability was virtually eliminated (except for the very lowest input rate). Initially, the variability, characterized by timing precision, was inversely related to the input rate, decreasing from 34 to 13ms. After ﬁve seconds of STDP, variability decreased and was largely independent of input rate, remaining below 11ms.

A Some synapses (dots) become potentiated (light) while others remain depressed (dark) after STDP. B The number of potentiated synapses neurons make (pluses) and receive (circles) is negatively (r = -0.71) and positively (r = 0.76) correlated to their rank in the spiking order, respectively. Comparing the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received with its excitability conﬁrmed the PEP hypothesis (i.e., leading neurons provide additional synaptic current to lagging neurons via potentiated recurrent synapses). In this experiment, to eliminate variability due to noise (as opposed to excitability), we provided a 17 by 17 cluster of neurons with a regular 200Hz excitatory input. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. After 10 seconds of STDP, a large fraction of the synapses were potentiated (Figure 5A). When the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received was plotted versus its rank in spiking order (Figure 5B), a clear correlation emerged (r = -0.71 or 0.76, respectively). As expected, neurons that spiked early made more and received fewer potentiated synapses. In contrast, neurons that spiked late made fewer and received more potentiated synapses. 5 Pattern Completion After STDP, we found that the network could recall an entire pattern given a subset, thus the same mechanisms that compensated for variability and noise could also compensate for lack of information. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons as our pattern and delivered a poisson-like spike train with mean rate of 67Hz to each one as in the ﬁrst experiment. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. Before STDP, we stimulated a subset of the pattern and only neurons in that subset spiked (Figure 6A). After ﬁve seconds of STDP, we stimulated the same subset again. This time they recruited spikes from other neurons in the pattern, completing it (Figure 6B). Upon varying the fraction of the pattern presented, we found that the fraction recalled increased faster than the fraction presented. We selected subsets of the original pattern randomly, varying the fraction of neurons chosen from 0.1 to 1.0 (ten trials for each). We classiﬁed neurons as active if they spiked in the two second period over which we recorded. Thus, we characterized PEP’s pattern-recall performance as a function of the probability that the pattern in question’s neurons are activated (Figure 6C). At a fraction of 0.50 presented, nearly all of the neurons in the pattern are consistently activated (0.91±0.06), showing robust pattern completion. We ﬁtted the recall performance with a sigmoid that reached 0.50 recall fraction with an input fraction of 0.30. No spurious neurons were activated during any trials.

C The fraction of the pattern activated grows faster than the fraction stimulated. 6 Discussion Our results demonstrate that PEP successfully compensates for graded variations in our silicon recurrent network using binary (on–off) synapses (in contrast with [8], where weights are graded). While our chip results are encouraging, variability was not eliminated in every case. In the case of the lowest input (50Hz), we see virtually no change (Figure 4A). We suspect the timing remains imprecise because, with such low input, neurons do not spike every theta cycle and, consequently, provide fewer opportunities for the STDP synapses to potentiate. This shortfall illustrates the system’s limits; it can only compensate for variability within certain bounds, and only for activity appropriate to the PEP model. As expected, STDP is the mechanism responsible for PEP. STDP potentiated recurrent synapses from leading neurons to lagging neurons, reducing the disparity among the diverse population of neurons. Even though the STDP circuits are themselves variable, with different efﬁcacies and time constants, when using timing the sign of the weight-change is always correct (data not shown). For this reason, we chose STDP over other more physiological implementations of plasticity, such as membrane-voltage-dependent plasticity (MVDP), which has the capability to learn with graded voltage signals [9], such as those found in active dendrites, providing more computational power [10]. Previously, we investigated a MVDP circuit, which modeled a voltage-dependent NMDAreceptor-gated synapse [11]. It potentiated when the calcium current analog exceeded a threshold, which was designed to occur only during a dendritic action potential. This circuit produced behavior similar to STDP, implying it could be used in PEP. However, it was sensitive to variability in the NMDA and potentiation thresholds, causing a fraction of the population to potentiate anytime the synapse received an input and another fraction to never potentiate, rendering both subpopulations useless. Therefore, the simpler, less biophysical STDP circuit won out over the MVDP circuit: In our system timing is everything. Associative storage and recall naturally emerge in the PEP network when synapses between neurons coactivated by a pattern are potentiated. These synapses allow neurons to recruit their peers when a subset of the pattern is presented, thereby completing the pattern. However, this form of pattern storage and completion differs from Hopﬁeld’s attractor model [12] . Rather than forming symmetric, recurrent neuronal circuits, our recurrent network forms asymmetric circuits in which neurons make connections exclusively to less excitable neurons in the pattern. In both the poisson-like and regular cases (Figures 4 & 5), only about six percent of potentiated connections were reciprocated, as expected by chance. We plan to investigate the storage capacity of this asymmetric form of associative memory. Our system lends itself to modeling brain regions that use precise spike timing, such as the hippocampus. We plan to extend the work presented to store and recall sequences of patterns, as the hippocampus is hypothesized to do. Place cells that represent different locations spike at different phases of the theta cycle, in relation to the distance to their preferred locations. This sequential spiking will allow us to link patterns representing different locations in the order those locations are visited, thereby realizing episodic memory. We propose PEP as a candidate neural mechanism for information coding and storage in the hippocampal system. Observations from the CA1 region of the hippocampus suggest that basal dendrites (which primarily receive excitation from recurrent connections) support submillisecond timing precision, consistent with PEP [13]. We have shown, in a silicon model, PEP’s ability to exploit such fast recurrent connections to sharpen timing precision as well as to associatively store and recall patterns.

We show a result in the opposite direction. We give an efﬁcient conversion algorithm from batch to online that is transductive: it uses future unlabeled data. This demonstrates the equivalence between what is properly and efﬁciently learnable in a batch model and a transductive online model.</p><p>5 0.69627577 <a title="76-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Variational_Bayesian_Stochastic_Complexity_of_Mixture_Models.html">201 nips-2005-Variational Bayesian Stochastic Complexity of Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: The Variational Bayesian framework has been widely used to approximate the Bayesian learning. In various applications, it has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance. In this paper, we discuss the Variational Bayesian learning of the mixture of exponential families and provide some additional theoretical support by deriving the asymptotic form of the stochastic complexity. The stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum free energy and a lower bound of the marginal likelihood, is a key quantity for model selection. It also enables us to discuss the eﬀect of hyperparameters and the accuracy of the Variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of the true Bayesian learning. 1</p><p>6 0.6585474 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Unbiased_Estimator_of_Shape_Parameter_for_Spiking_Irregularities_under_Changing_Environments.html">197 nips-2005-Unbiased Estimator of Shape Parameter for Spiking Irregularities under Changing Environments</a></p>

<p>Author: Sharon Goldwater, Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Standard statistical models of language fail to capture one of the most striking properties of natural languages: the power-law distribution in the frequencies of word tokens. We present a framework for developing statistical models that generically produce power-laws, augmenting standard generative models with an adaptor that produces the appropriate pattern of token frequencies. We show that taking a particular stochastic process – the Pitman-Yor process – as an adaptor justiﬁes the appearance of type frequencies in formal analyses of natural language, and improves the performance of a model for unsupervised learning of morphology.</p><p>3 0.1276944 <a title="185-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Analysis_of_Spectral_Kernel_Design_based_Semi-supervised_Learning.html">27 nips-2005-Analysis of Spectral Kernel Design based Semi-supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>4 0.1241792 <a title="185-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Searching_for_Character_Models.html">171 nips-2005-Searching for Character Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaety Edwards, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a method to automatically improve character models for a handwritten script without the use of transcriptions and using a minimum of document speciﬁc training data. We show that we can use searches for the words in a dictionary to identify portions of the document whose transcriptions are unambiguous. Using templates extracted from those regions, we retrain our character prediction model to drastically improve our search retrieval performance for words in the document.</p><p>5 0.12358828 <a title="185-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Sequence_and_Tree_Kernels_with_Statistical_Feature_Mining.html">175 nips-2005-Sequence and Tree Kernels with Statistical Feature Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Suzuki, Hideki Isozaki</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to feature selection based on a statistical feature mining technique for sequence and tree kernels. Since natural language data take discrete structures, convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are advantageous for both the concept and accuracy of many natural language processing tasks. However, experiments have shown that the best results can only be achieved when limited small sub-structures are dealt with by these kernels. This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels and then proposes a statistical feature selection that enable us to use larger sub-structures effectively. The proposed method, in order to execute efﬁciently, can be embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments on real NLP tasks conﬁrm the problem in the conventional method and compare the performance of a conventional method to that of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.12022312 <a title="185-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Dynamic_Social_Network_Analysis_using_Latent_Space_Models.html">60 nips-2005-Dynamic Social Network Analysis using Latent Space Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jean-philippe Vert, Robert Thurman, William S. Noble</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchy of motif-based kernels for multiple alignments of biological sequences, particularly suitable to process regulatory regions of genes. The kernels incorporate progressively more information, with the most complex kernel accounting for a multiple alignment of orthologous regions, the phylogenetic tree relating the species, and the prior knowledge that relevant sequence patterns occur in conserved motif blocks. These kernels can be used in the presence of a library of known transcription factor binding sites, or de novo by iterating over all k-mers of a given length. In the latter mode, a discriminative classiﬁer built from such a kernel not only recognizes a given class of promoter regions, but as a side effect simultaneously identiﬁes a collection of relevant, discriminative sequence motifs. We demonstrate the utility of the motif-based multiple alignment kernels by using a collection of aligned promoter regions from ﬁve yeast species to recognize classes of cell-cycle regulated genes.

<p>Author: Xuerui Wang, Natasha Mohanty, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic generative model of entity relationships and their attributes that simultaneously discovers groups among the entities and topics among the corresponding textual attributes. Block-models of relationship data have been studied in social network analysis for some time. Here we simultaneously cluster in several modalities at once, incorporating the attributes (here, words) associated with certain relationships. Signiﬁcantly, joint inference allows the discovery of topics to be guided by the emerging groups, and vice-versa. We present experimental results on two large data sets: sixteen years of bills put before the U.S. Senate, comprising their corresponding text and voting records, and thirteen years of similar data from the United Nations. We show that in comparison with traditional, separate latent-variable models for words, or Blockstructures for votes, the Group-Topic model’s joint inference discovers more cohesive groups and improved topics. 1</p><p>5 0.52489501 <a title="185-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Interpolating_between_types_and_tokens_by_estimating_power-law_generators.html">100 nips-2005-Interpolating between types and tokens by estimating power-law generators</a></p>

<p>Author: Tai-sing Lee, Brian R. Potetz</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores the statistical relationship between natural images and their underlying range (depth) images. We look at how this relationship changes over scale, and how this information can be used to enhance low resolution range data using a full resolution intensity image. Based on our ﬁndings, we propose an extension to an existing technique known as shape recipes [3], and the success of the two methods are compared using images and laser scans of real scenes. Our extension is shown to provide a two-fold improvement over the current method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ideal linear shape-from-shading ﬁlters, when learned from natural scenes, may derive even more strength from shadow cues than from the traditional linear-Lambertian shading cues. 1</p><p>3 0.45140406 <a title="185-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Glenn Fung, Rómer Rosales, Balaji Krishnapuram</p><p>Abstract: We propose efﬁcient algorithms for learning ranking functions from order constraints between sets—i.e. classes—of training samples. Our algorithms may be used for maximizing the generalized Wilcoxon Mann Whitney statistic that accounts for the partial ordering of the classes: special cases include maximizing the area under the ROC curve for binary classiﬁcation and its generalization for ordinal regression. Experiments on public benchmarks indicate that: (a) the proposed algorithm is at least as accurate as the current state-of-the-art; (b) computationally, it is several orders of magnitude faster and—unlike current methods—it is easily able to handle even large datasets with over 20,000 samples. 1</p><p>4 0.45036405 <a title="185-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose correlations between variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlations. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. This perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and of its convergence in loopy graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.4414455 <a title="185-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Consensus_Propagation.html">46 nips-2005-Consensus Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy, Ciamac C. Moallemi</p><p>Abstract: We propose consensus propagation, an asynchronous distributed protocol for averaging numbers across a network. We establish convergence, characterize the convergence rate for regular graphs, and demonstrate that the protocol exhibits better scaling properties than pairwise averaging, an alternative that has received much recent attention. Consensus propagation can be viewed as a special case of belief propagation, and our results contribute to the belief propagation literature. In particular, beyond singly-connected graphs, there are very few classes of relevant problems for which belief propagation is known to converge. 1</p><p>6 0.43743432 <a title="185-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Information_Value_for_Graphical_Models.html">70 nips-2005-Fast Information Value for Graphical Models</a></p>

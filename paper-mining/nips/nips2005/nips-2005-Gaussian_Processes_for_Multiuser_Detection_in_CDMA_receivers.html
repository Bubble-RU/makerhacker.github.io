<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Doru C. Balcan, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Biological sensory systems are faced with the problem of encoding a high-ﬁdelity sensory signal with a population of noisy, low-ﬁdelity neurons. This problem can be expressed in information theoretic terms as coding and transmitting a multi-dimensional, analog signal over a set of noisy channels. Previously, we have shown that robust, overcomplete codes can be learned by minimizing the reconstruction error with a constraint on the channel capacity. Here, we present a theoretical analysis that characterizes the optimal linear coder and decoder for one- and twodimensional data. The analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides a number of important insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions to achieve robustness. We also report numerical solutions for robust coding of highdimensional image data and show that these codes are substantially more robust compared against other image codes such as ICA and wavelets. 1</p><p>3 0.095929436 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Rate_Distortion_Codes_in_Sensor_Networks%3A_A_System-level_Analysis.html">162 nips-2005-Rate Distortion Codes in Sensor Networks: A System-level Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Tatsuto Murayama, Peter Davis</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a system-level analysis of a scalable distributed sensing model for networked sensors. In our system model, a data center acquires data from a bunch of L sensors which each independently encode their noisy observations of an original binary sequence, and transmit their encoded data sequences to the data center at a combined rate R, which is limited. Supposing that the sensors use independent LDGM rate distortion codes, we show that the system performance can be evaluated for any given ﬁnite R when the number of sensors L goes to inﬁnity. The analysis shows how the optimal strategy for the distributed sensing problem changes at critical values of the data rate R or the noise level. 1</p><p>4 0.093413189 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-AER_Building_Blocks_for_Multi-Layer_Multi-Chip_Neuromorphic_Vision_Systems.html">1 nips-2005-AER Building Blocks for Multi-Layer Multi-Chip Neuromorphic Vision Systems</a></p>

The system includes a retina chip, two convolution chips, a 2D winner-take-all chip, a delay line chip, a learning classiﬁer chip, and a set of PCBs for computer interfacing and address space remappings. The components use a mixture of analog and digital computation and will learn to classify trajectories of a moving object.

<p>Author: Ofer Pasternak, Nathan Intrator, Nir Sochen, Yaniv Assaf</p><p>Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI) is a non invasive method for brain neuronal ﬁbers delineation. Here we show a modiﬁcation for DT-MRI that allows delineation of neuronal ﬁbers which are inﬁltrated by edema. We use the Muliple Tensor Variational (MTV) framework which replaces the diffusion model of DT-MRI with a multiple component model and ﬁts it to the signal attenuation with a variational regularization mechanism. In order to reduce free water contamination we estimate the free water compartment volume fraction in each voxel, remove it, and then calculate the anisotropy of the remaining compartment. The variational framework was applied on data collected with conventional clinical parameters, containing only six diffusion directions. By using the variational framework we were able to overcome the highly ill posed ﬁtting. The results show that we were able to ﬁnd ﬁbers that were not found by DT-MRI.</p><p>6 0.0762638 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Stimulus_Evoked_Independent_Factor_Analysis_of_MEG_Data_with_Large_Background_Activity.html">183 nips-2005-Stimulus Evoked Independent Factor Analysis of MEG Data with Large Background Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Misha Ahrens, Liam Paninski, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: Our understanding of the input-output function of single cells has been substantially advanced by biophysically accurate multi-compartmental models. The large number of parameters needing hand tuning in these models has, however, somewhat hampered their applicability and interpretability. Here we propose a simple and well-founded method for automatic estimation of many of these key parameters: 1) the spatial distribution of channel densities on the cell’s membrane; 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input; 3) the channels’ reversal potentials; 4) the intercompartmental conductances; and 5) the noise level in each compartment. We assume experimental access to: a) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite (or some contiguous subpart thereof, e.g. via voltage sensitive imaging techniques), b) an approximate kinetic description of the channels and synapses present in each compartment, and c) the morphology of the part of the neuron under investigation. The key observation is that, given data a)-c), all of the parameters 1)-4) may be simultaneously inferred by a version of constrained linear regression; this regression, in turn, is efﬁciently solved using standard algorithms, without any “local minima” problems despite the large number of parameters and complex dynamics. The noise level 5) may also be estimated by standard techniques. We demonstrate the method’s accuracy on several model datasets, and describe techniques for quantifying the uncertainty in our estimates. 1</p><p>5 0.40305877 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-An_Analog_Visual_Pre-Processing_Processor_Employing_Cyclic_Line_Access_in_Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects_Architecture.html">22 nips-2005-An Analog Visual Pre-Processing Processor Employing Cyclic Line Access in Only-Nearest-Neighbor-Interconnects Architecture</a></p>
<p>Author: Yusuke Nakashita, Yoshio Mita, Tadashi Shibata</p><p>Abstract: An analog focal-plane processor having a 128¢128 photodiode array has been developed for directional edge ﬁltering. It can perform 4¢4-pixel kernel convolution for entire pixels only with 256 steps of simple analog processing. Newly developed cyclic line access and row-parallel processing scheme in conjunction with the “only-nearest-neighbor interconnects” architecture has enabled a very simple implementation. A proof-of-concept chip was fabricated in a 0.35- m 2-poly 3-metal CMOS technology and the edge ﬁltering at a rate of 200 frames/sec. has been experimentally demonstrated.</p><p>6 0.38070866 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-AER_Building_Blocks_for_Multi-Layer_Multi-Chip_Neuromorphic_Vision_Systems.html">1 nips-2005-AER Building Blocks for Multi-Layer Multi-Chip Neuromorphic Vision Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Saund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents representation and logic for labeling contrast edges and ridges in visual scenes in terms of both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, speciﬁcally contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we deﬁne a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy conﬁguration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour ﬁgures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difﬁcult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost.</p><p>3 0.65317011 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-An_Approximate_Inference_Approach_for_the_PCA_Reconstruction_Error.html">24 nips-2005-An Approximate Inference Approach for the PCA Reconstruction Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Manfred Opper</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a resample estimate for the reconstruction error in PCA is reformulated as an inference problem with the help of the replica method. Using the expectation consistent (EC) approximation, the intractable inference problem can be solved efﬁciently using only two variational parameters. A perturbative correction to the result is computed and an alternative simpliﬁed derivation is also presented. 1</p><p>4 0.65099919 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Aggregation_by_Mirror_Descent_with_Averaging.html">82 nips-2005-Generalization Error Bounds for Aggregation by Mirror Descent with Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Anatoli Juditsky, Alexander Nazin, Alexandre Tsybakov, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing an aggregated estimator from a ﬁnite class of base functions which approximately minimizes a convex risk functional under the ℓ1 constraint. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic procedure, the mirror descent, which performs gradient descent in the dual space. The generated estimates are additionally averaged in a recursive fashion with speciﬁc weights. Mirror descent algorithms have been developed in different contexts and they are known to be particularly efﬁcient in high dimensional problems. Moreover their implementation is adapted to the online setting. The main result of the paper is the upper bound on the convergence rate for the generalization error. 1</p><p>5 0.57807475 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Hot_Coupling%3A_A_Particle_Approach_to_Inference_and_Normalization_on_Pairwise_Undirected_Graphs.html">90 nips-2005-Hot Coupling: A Particle Approach to Inference and Normalization on Pairwise Undirected Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Firas Hamze, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new sampling algorithm for approximating functions of variables representable as undirected graphical models of arbitrary connectivity with pairwise potentials, as well as for estimating the notoriously difﬁcult partition function of the graph. The algorithm ﬁts into the framework of sequential Monte Carlo methods rather than the more widely used MCMC, and relies on constructing a sequence of intermediate distributions which get closer to the desired one. While the idea of using “tempered” proposals is known, we construct a novel sequence of target distributions where, rather than dropping a global temperature parameter, we sequentially couple individual pairs of variables that are, initially, sampled exactly from a spanning tree of the variables. We present experimental results on inference and estimation of the partition function for sparse and densely-connected graphs.</p><p>6 0.57342762 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Multiple_Related_Tasks_using_Latent_Independent_Component_Analysis.html">113 nips-2005-Learning Multiple Related Tasks using Latent Independent Component Analysis</a></p>

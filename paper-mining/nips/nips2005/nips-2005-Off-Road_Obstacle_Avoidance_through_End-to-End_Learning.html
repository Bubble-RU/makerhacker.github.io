<p>Author: Antoni B. Chan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: A dynamic texture is a video model that treats a video as a sample from a spatio-temporal stochastic process, speciﬁcally a linear dynamical system. One problem associated with the dynamic texture is that it cannot model video where there are multiple regions of distinct motion. In this work, we introduce the layered dynamic texture model, which addresses this problem. We also introduce a variant of the model, and present the EM algorithm for learning each of the models. Finally, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed model for the tasks of segmentation and synthesis of video.</p><p>3 0.17119521 <a title="143-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-An_Application_of_Markov_Random_Fields_to_Range_Sensing.html">23 nips-2005-An Application of Markov Random Fields to Range Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: James Diebel, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a highly successful application of MRFs to the problem of generating high-resolution range images. A new generation of range sensors combines the capture of low-resolution range images with the acquisition of registered high-resolution camera images. The MRF in this paper exploits the fact that discontinuities in range and coloring tend to co-align. This enables it to generate high-resolution, low-noise range images by integrating regular camera images into the range data. We show that by using such an MRF, we can substantially improve over existing range imaging technology. 1</p><p>4 0.17004913 <a title="143-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Bayesian_models_of_human_action_understanding.html">36 nips-2005-Bayesian models of human action understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Baker, Rebecca Saxe, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework for explaining how people reason about and predict the actions of an intentional agent, based on observing its behavior. Action-understanding is cast as a problem of inverting a probabilistic generative model, which assumes that agents tend to act rationally in order to achieve their goals given the constraints of their environment. Working in a simple sprite-world domain, we show how this model can be used to infer the goal of an agent and predict how the agent will act in novel situations or when environmental constraints change. The model provides a qualitative account of several kinds of inferences that preverbal infants have been shown to perform, and also ﬁts quantitative predictions that adult observers make in a new experiment.</p><p>5 0.16619833 <a title="143-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Shared_Latent_Structure_for_Image_Synthesis_and_Robotic_Imitation.html">115 nips-2005-Learning Shared Latent Structure for Image Synthesis and Robotic Imitation</a></p>

The observation spaces are linked via a single, reduced-dimensionality latent variable space. We present results from two datasets demonstrating the algorithms’s ability to synthesize novel data from learned correspondences. We ﬁrst show that the method can learn the nonlinear mapping between corresponding views of objects, ﬁlling in missing data as needed to synthesize novel views. We then show that the method can learn a mapping between human degrees of freedom and robotic degrees of freedom for a humanoid robot, allowing robotic imitation of human poses from motion capture data. 1</p><p>6 0.14447898 <a title="143-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Fast_biped_walking_with_a_reflexive_controller_and_real-time_policy_searching.html">73 nips-2005-Fast biped walking with a reflexive controller and real-time policy searching</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Geng, Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our design and experiments of a planar biped robot (“RunBot”) under pure reﬂexive neuronal control. The goal of this study is to combine neuronal mechanisms with biomechanics to obtain very fast speed and the on-line learning of circuit parameters. Our controller is built with biologically inspired sensor- and motor-neuron models, including local reﬂexes and not employing any kind of position or trajectory-tracking control algorithm. Instead, this reﬂexive controller allows RunBot to exploit its own natural dynamics during critical stages of its walking gait cycle. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dynamic biped walking is achieved using only a pure reﬂexive controller. In addition, this structure allows using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to tune the parameters of the reﬂexive controller in real-time during walking. This way RunBot can reach a relative speed of 3.5 leg-lengths per second after a few minutes of online learning, which is faster than that of any other biped robot, and is also comparable to the fastest relative speed of human walking. In addition, the stability domain of stable walking is quite large supporting this design strategy. 1</p><p>5 0.56156737 <a title="143-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Layered_Dynamic_Textures.html">108 nips-2005-Layered Dynamic Textures</a></p>

<p>Author: Misha Ahrens, Liam Paninski, Quentin J. Huys</p><p>Abstract: Our understanding of the input-output function of single cells has been substantially advanced by biophysically accurate multi-compartmental models. The large number of parameters needing hand tuning in these models has, however, somewhat hampered their applicability and interpretability. Here we propose a simple and well-founded method for automatic estimation of many of these key parameters: 1) the spatial distribution of channel densities on the cell’s membrane; 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input; 3) the channels’ reversal potentials; 4) the intercompartmental conductances; and 5) the noise level in each compartment. We assume experimental access to: a) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite (or some contiguous subpart thereof, e.g. via voltage sensitive imaging techniques), b) an approximate kinetic description of the channels and synapses present in each compartment, and c) the morphology of the part of the neuron under investigation. The key observation is that, given data a)-c), all of the parameters 1)-4) may be simultaneously inferred by a version of constrained linear regression; this regression, in turn, is efﬁciently solved using standard algorithms, without any “local minima” problems despite the large number of parameters and complex dynamics. The noise level 5) may also be estimated by standard techniques. We demonstrate the method’s accuracy on several model datasets, and describe techniques for quantifying the uncertainty in our estimates. 1</p><p>3 0.77543426 <a title="143-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Nested_sampling_for_Potts_models.html">133 nips-2005-Nested sampling for Potts models</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Zoubin Ghahramani, John Skilling</p><p>Abstract: Nested sampling is a new Monte Carlo method by Skilling [1] intended for general Bayesian computation. Nested sampling provides a robust alternative to annealing-based methods for computing normalizing constants. It can also generate estimates of other quantities such as posterior expectations. The key technical requirement is an ability to draw samples uniformly from the prior subject to a constraint on the likelihood.

The algorithm ﬁts into the framework of sequential Monte Carlo methods rather than the more widely used MCMC, and relies on constructing a sequence of intermediate distributions which get closer to the desired one. While the idea of using “tempered” proposals is known, we construct a novel sequence of target distributions where, rather than dropping a global temperature parameter, we sequentially couple individual pairs of variables that are, initially, sampled exactly from a spanning tree of the variables. We present experimental results on inference and estimation of the partition function for sparse and densely-connected graphs.</p><p>5 0.52307516 <a title="143-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Integrate-and-Fire_models_with_adaptation_are_good_enough.html">99 nips-2005-Integrate-and-Fire models with adaptation are good enough</a></p>
<p>Author: Renaud Jolivet, Alexander Rauch, Hans-rudolf Lüscher, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire-type models are usually criticized because of their simplicity. On the other hand, the Integrate-and-Fire model is the basis of most of the theoretical studies on spiking neuron models. Here, we develop a sequential procedure to quantitatively evaluate an equivalent Integrate-and-Fire-type model based on intracellular recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons. We ﬁnd that the resulting effective model is sufﬁcient to predict the spike train of the real pyramidal neuron with high accuracy. In in vivo-like regimes, predicted and recorded traces are almost indistinguishable and a signiﬁcant part of the spikes can be predicted at the correct timing. Slow processes like spike-frequency adaptation are shown to be a key feature in this context since they are necessary for the model to connect between different driving regimes. 1</p><p>6 0.51525623 <a title="143-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Pattern_Recognition_from_One_Example_by_Chopping.html">151 nips-2005-Pattern Recognition from One Example by Chopping</a></p>

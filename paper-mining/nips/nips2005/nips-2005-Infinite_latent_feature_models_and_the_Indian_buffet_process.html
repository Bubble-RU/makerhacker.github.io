<p>Author: Antonio Torralba, Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the problem of learning to detect and recognize objects with minimal supervision, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic model for the spatial structure of visual scenes. In contrast with most existing models, our approach explicitly captures uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a given image. Our scene model is based on the transformed Dirichlet process (TDP), a novel extension of the hierarchical DP in which a set of stochastically transformed mixture components are shared between multiple groups of data. For visual scenes, mixture components describe the spatial structure of visual features in an object–centered coordinate frame, while transformations model the object positions in a particular image. Learning and inference in the TDP, which has many potential applications beyond computer vision, is based on an empirically effective Gibbs sampler. Applied to a dataset of partially labeled street scenes, we show that the TDP’s inclusion of spatial structure improves detection performance, ﬂexibly exploiting partially labeled training images. 1</p><p>3 0.12650062 <a title="98-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Interpolating_between_types_and_tokens_by_estimating_power-law_generators.html">100 nips-2005-Interpolating between types and tokens by estimating power-law generators</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Loeff, Himanshu Arora, Alexander Sorokin, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for learning templates for recognition and localization of objects drawn from categories. A generative model represents the conﬁguration of multiple object parts with respect to an object coordinate system; these parts in turn generate image features. The complexity of the model in the number of features is low, meaning our model is much more efﬁcient to train than comparative methods. Moreover, a variational approximation is introduced that allows learning to be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches while incorporating many more features. This results in both accuracy and localization improvements. Our model has been carefully tested on standard datasets; we compare with a number of recent template models.

<p>Author: Wei Zhang, Hyejin Yang, Dimitris Samaras, Gregory J. Zelinsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a computational model of human eye movements in an object class detection task. The model combines state-of-the-art computer vision object class detection methods (SIFT features trained using AdaBoost) with a biologically plausible model of human eye movement to produce a sequence of simulated ﬁxations, culminating with the acquisition of a target. We validated the model by comparing its behavior to the behavior of human observers performing the identical object class detection task (looking for a teddy bear among visually complex nontarget objects). We found considerable agreement between the model and human data in multiple eye movement measures, including number of ﬁxations, cumulative probability of ﬁxating the target, and scanpath distance.</p><p>6 0.10508501 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Pattern_Recognition_from_One_Example_by_Chopping.html">151 nips-2005-Pattern Recognition from One Example by Chopping</a></p>

<p>Author: Francois Fleuret, Gilles Blanchard</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the learning of the appearance of an object from a single image of it. Instead of using a large number of pictures of the object to recognize, we use a labeled reference database of pictures of other objects to learn invariance to noise and variations in pose and illumination. This acquired knowledge is then used to predict if two pictures of new objects, which do not appear on the training pictures, actually display the same object. We propose a generic scheme called chopping to address this task. It relies on hundreds of random binary splits of the training set chosen to keep together the images of any given object. Those splits are extended to the complete image space with a simple learning algorithm. Given two images, the responses of the split predictors are combined with a Bayesian rule into a posterior probability of similarity. Experiments with the COIL-100 database and with a database of 150 deA graded LTEX symbols compare our method to a classical learning with several examples of the positive class and to a direct learning of the similarity. 1</p><p>5 0.49216151 <a title="98-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Nearest_Neighbor_Based_Feature_Selection_for_Regression_and_its_Application_to_Neural_Activity.html">132 nips-2005-Nearest Neighbor Based Feature Selection for Regression and its Application to Neural Activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Navot, Lavi Shpigelman, Naftali Tishby, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: We present a non-linear, simple, yet effective, feature subset selection method for regression and use it in analyzing cortical neural activity. Our algorithm involves a feature-weighted version of the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. It is able to capture complex dependency of the target function on its input and makes use of the leave-one-out error as a natural regularization. We explain the characteristics of our algorithm on synthetic problems and use it in the context of predicting hand velocity from spikes recorded in motor cortex of a behaving monkey. By applying feature selection we are able to improve prediction quality and suggest a novel way of exploring neural data.</p><p>6 0.49106392 <a title="98-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Fusion_of_Similarity_Data_in_Clustering.html">79 nips-2005-Fusion of Similarity Data in Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Stephane Lafon, Ioannis Kevrekidis, Ronald R. Coifman</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion based probabilistic interpretation of spectral clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms that use the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. Given the pairwise adjacency matrix of all points, we deﬁne a diffusion distance between any two data points and show that the low dimensional representation of the data by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the corresponding Markov matrix is optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, assuming that data points are random samples from a density p(x) = e−U (x) we identify these eigenvectors as discrete approximations of eigenfunctions of a Fokker-Planck operator in a potential 2U (x) with reﬂecting boundary conditions. Finally, applying known results regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the continuous Fokker-Planck operator, we provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the success of spectral clustering and dimensional reduction algorithms based on these ﬁrst few eigenvectors. This analysis elucidates, in terms of the characteristics of diffusion processes, many empirical ﬁndings regarding spectral clustering algorithms.

<p>Author: Firas Hamze, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new sampling algorithm for approximating functions of variables representable as undirected graphical models of arbitrary connectivity with pairwise potentials, as well as for estimating the notoriously difﬁcult partition function of the graph. The algorithm ﬁts into the framework of sequential Monte Carlo methods rather than the more widely used MCMC, and relies on constructing a sequence of intermediate distributions which get closer to the desired one. While the idea of using “tempered” proposals is known, we construct a novel sequence of target distributions where, rather than dropping a global temperature parameter, we sequentially couple individual pairs of variables that are, initially, sampled exactly from a spanning tree of the variables. We present experimental results on inference and estimation of the partition function for sparse and densely-connected graphs.</p><p>4 0.61802578 <a title="98-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Interpolating_between_types_and_tokens_by_estimating_power-law_generators.html">100 nips-2005-Interpolating between types and tokens by estimating power-law generators</a></p>

Our algorithm is based on multiclass Gaussian processes and is effective whenever the multiplication of the kernel matrix or its inverse with a vector can be computed sufﬁciently fast. This holds, for instance, for certain graph and string kernels. Transduction is achieved by variational inference over the unlabeled data subject to a balancing constraint. 1</p><p>6 0.61533397 <a title="98-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>

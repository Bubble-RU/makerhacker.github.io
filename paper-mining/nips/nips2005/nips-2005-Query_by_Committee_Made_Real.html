<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by “Google™ Sets”, we consider the problem of retrieving items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a modelbased concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufﬁcient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, ﬁnding completions of author sets from the NIPS dataset, and ﬁnding completions of sets of words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google™ Sets and show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions. 1</p><p>4 0.10010153 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Consistency_of_one-class_SVM_and_related_algorithms.html">47 nips-2005-Consistency of one-class SVM and related algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic limit of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator. 1</p><p>5 0.097663991 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Information_Value_for_Graphical_Models.html">70 nips-2005-Fast Information Value for Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Brigham S. Anderson, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Calculations that quantify the dependencies between variables are vital to many operations with graphical models, e.g., active learning and sensitivity analysis. Previously, pairwise information gain calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size. In this work, we show how to perform a similar computation with cost linear in network size. The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming. The message-passing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy. In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.</p><p>6 0.093633384 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_SVMs_with_an_Application_to_Unbalanced_Classification.html">14 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Interpretation of SVMs with an Application to Unbalanced Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongryeol Lee, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: In previous work we presented an efﬁcient approach to computing kernel summations which arise in many machine learning methods such as kernel density estimation. This approach, dual-tree recursion with ﬁnitedifference approximation, generalized existing methods for similar problems arising in computational physics in two ways appropriate for statistical problems: toward distribution sensitivity and general dimension, partly by avoiding series expansions. While this proved to be the fastest practical method for multivariate kernel density estimation at the optimal bandwidth, it is much less efﬁcient at larger-than-optimal bandwidths. In this work, we explore the extent to which the dual-tree approach can be integrated with multipole-like Hermite expansions in order to achieve reasonable efﬁciency across all bandwidth scales, though only for low dimensionalities. In the process, we derive and demonstrate the ﬁrst truly hierarchical fast Gauss transforms, effectively combining the best tools from discrete algorithms and continuous approximation theory. 1 Fast Gaussian Summation Kernel summations are fundamental in both statistics/learning and computational physics. NR e This paper will focus on the common form G(xq ) = −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 i.e. where the ker- r=1 nel is the Gaussian kernel with scaling parameter, or bandwidth h, there are NR reference points xr , and we desire the sum for NQ different query points xq . Such kernel summations appear in a wide array of statistical/learning methods [5], perhaps most obviously in kernel density estimation [11], the most widely used distribution-free method for the fundamental task of density estimation, which will be our main example. Understanding kernel summation algorithms from a recently developed uniﬁed perspective [5] begins with the picture of Figure 1, then separately considers the discrete and continuous aspects. Discrete/geometric aspect. In terms of discrete algorithmic structure, the dual-tree framework of [5], in the context of kernel summation, generalizes all of the well-known algorithms. 1 It was applied to the problem of kernel density estimation in [7] using a simple 1 These include the Barnes-Hut algorithm [2], the Fast Multipole Method [8], Appel’s algorithm [1], and the WSPD [4]: the dual-tree method is a node-node algorithm (considers query regions rather than points), is fully recursive, can use distribution-sensitive data structures such as kd-trees, and is bichromatic (can specialize for differing query and reference sets). Figure 1: The basic idea is to approximate the kernel sum contribution of some subset of the reference points XR , lying in some compact region of space R with centroid xR , to a query point. In more efﬁcient schemes a query region is considered, i.e. the approximate contribution is made to an entire subset of the query points XQ lying in some region of space Q, with centroid xQ . ﬁnite-difference approximation, which is tantamount to a centroid approximation. Partially by avoiding series expansions, which depend explicitly on the dimension, the result was the fastest such algorithm for general dimension, when operating at the optimal bandwidth. Unfortunately, when performing cross-validation to determine the (initially unknown) optimal bandwidth, both suboptimally small and large bandwidths must be evaluated. The ﬁnite-difference-based dual-tree method tends to be efﬁcient at or below the optimal bandwidth, and at very large bandwidths, but for intermediately-large bandwidths it suffers. Continuous/approximation aspect. This motivates investigating a multipole-like series approximation which is appropriate for the Gaussian kernel, as introduced by [9], which can be shown the generalize the centroid approximation. We deﬁne the Hermite functions 2 hn (t) by hn (t) = e−t Hn (t), where the Hermite polynomials Hn (t) are deﬁned by the 2 2 Rodrigues formula: Hn (t) = (−1)n et Dn e−t , t ∈ R1 . After scaling and shifting the argument t appropriately, then taking the product of univariate functions for each dimension, we obtain the multivariate Hermite expansion NR G(xq ) = e −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 NR = r=1 r=1 α≥0 1 α! xr − xR √ 2h2 α hα xq − xR √ 2h2 (1) where we’ve adopted the usual multi-index notation as in [9]. This can be re-written as NR G(xq ) = e r=1 −||xq −xr ||2 2h2 NR = r=1 α≥0 1 hα α! xr − xQ √ 2h2 xq − xQ √ 2h2 α (2) to express the sum as a Taylor (local) expansion about a nearby representative centroid xQ in the query region. We will be using both types of expansions simultaneously. Since series approximations only hold locally, Greengard and Rokhlin [8] showed that it is useful to think in terms of a set of three ‘translation operators’ for converting between expansions centered at different points, in order to create their celebrated hierarchical algorithm. This was done in the context of the Coulombic kernel, but the Gaussian kernel has importantly different mathematical properties. The original Fast Gauss Transform (FGT) [9] was based on a ﬂat grid, and thus provided only one operator (“H2L” of the next section), with an associated error bound (which was unfortunately incorrect). The Improved Fast Gauss Transform (IFGT) [14] was based on a ﬂat set of clusters and provided no operators with a rearranged series approximation, which intended to be more favorable in higher dimensions but had an incorrect error bound. We will show the derivations of all the translation operators and associated error bounds needed to obtain, for the ﬁrst time, a hierarchical algorithm for the Gaussian kernel. 2 Translation Operators and Error Bounds The ﬁrst operator converts a multipole expansion of a reference node to form a local expansion centered at the centroid of the query node, and is our main approximation workhorse. Lemma 2.1. Hermite-to-local (H2L) translation operator for Gaussian kernel (as presented in Lemma 2.2 in [9, 10]): Given a reference node XR , a query node XQ , and the Hermite expansion centered at a centroid xR of XR : G(xq ) = Aα hα α≥0 xq −xR √ 2h2 , the Taylor expansion of the Hermite expansion at the centroid xQ of the query node XQ is given by G(xq ) = Bβ β≥0 xq −xQ √ 2h2 β where Bβ = (−1)|β| β! Aα hα+β α≥0 xQ −xR √ 2h2 . Proof. (sketch) The proof consists of replacing the Hermite function portion of the expansion with its Taylor series. NR Note that we can rewrite G(xq ) = α≥0 r=1 1 α! xr −xR √ 2h2 α hα xq −xR √ 2h2 by interchanging the summation order, such that the term in the brackets depends only on the reference points, and can thus be computed indepedent of any query location – we will call such terms Hermite moments. The next operator allows the efﬁcient pre-computation of the Hermite moments in the reference tree in a bottom-up fashion from its children. Lemma 2.2. Hermite-to-Hermite (H2H) translation operator for Gaussian kernel: Given the Hermite expansion centered at a centroid xR′ in a reference node XR′ : xq −x G(xq ) = A′ hα √2hR′ , this same Hermite expansion shifted to a new locaα 2 α≥0 tion xR of the parent node of XR is given by G(xq ) = Aγ hγ γ≥0 Aγ = 0≤α≤γ 1 ′ (γ−α)! Aα xR′ −xR √ 2h2 xq −xR √ 2h2 where γ−α . Proof. We simply replace the Hermite function part of the expansion by a new Taylor series, as follows: « x q − x R′ √ 2h2 α≥0 „ « X ′ X 1 „ x R − x R′ « β xq − xR √ √ = Aα (−1)|β| hα+β β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 „ «β « „ X X ′ 1 x R − x R′ xq − xR |β| √ √ (−1) hα+β = Aα β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 „ «β „ « X X ′ 1 x R′ − x R xq − xR √ √ Aα = hα+β β! 2h2 2h2 α≥0 β≥0 3 2 «γ−α „ « „ X X 1 x R′ − x R q ′ 5 hγ x√− xR 4 √ = Aα (γ − α)! 2h2 2h2 γ≥0 0≤α≤γ G(xq ) = where γ = α + β. X A′ hα α „ The next operator acts as a “clean-up” routine in a hierarchical algorithm. Since we can approximate at different scales in the query tree, we must somehow combine all the approximations at the end of the computation. By performing a breadth-ﬁrst traversal of the query tree, the L2L operator shifts a node’s local expansion to the centroid of each child. Lemma 2.3. Local-to-local (L2L) translation operator for Gaussian kernel: Given a Taylor expansion centered at a centroid xQ′ of a query node XQ′ : G(xq ) = xq −xQ′ √ 2h2 Bβ β≥0 β , the Taylor expansion obtained by shift- ing this expansion to the new centroid xQ of the child node XQ is G(xq ) = α≥0 β≥α β! α!(β−α)! Bβ β−α xQ −xQ′ √ 2h2 xq −xQ √ 2h2 α . Proof. Applying the multinomial theorem to to expand about the new center xQ yields: G(xq ) = X Bβ β≥0 = „ XX β≥0 α≤β xq − xQ′ √ 2h2 Bβ «β β! α!(β − α)! „ xQ − xQ′ √ 2h2 «β−α „ xq − xQ √ 2h2 «α . whose summation order can be interchanged to achieve the result. Because the Hermite and the Taylor expansion are truncated after taking pD terms, we incur an error in approximation. The original error bounds for the Gaussian kernel in [9, 10] were wrong and corrections were shown in [3]. Here, we will present all necessary three error bounds incurred in performing translation operators. We note that these error bounds place limits on the size of the query node and the reference node. 2 Lemma 2.4. Error Bound for Truncating an Hermite Expansion (as presented in [3]): Suppose we are given an Hermite expansion of a reference node XR about its centroid xR : G(xq ) = Aα hα α≥0 xq −xR √ 2h2 NR where Aα = r=1 1 α! xr −xR √ 2h2 α . For any query point xq , the error due to truncating the series after the ﬁrst pD term is |ǫM (p)| ≤ rp )k rp √ p! NR (1−r)D D−1 k=0 D k (1 − D−k where ∀xr ∈ XR satisﬁes ||xr − xR ||∞ < rh for r < 1. Proof. (sketch) We expand the Hermite expansion as a product of one-dimensional Hermite functions, and utilize a bound on one-dimensional Hermite functions due to [13]: n −x2 1 2 √ 2 e 2 , n ≥ 0, x ∈ R1 . n! |hn (x)| ≤ n! Lemma 2.5. Error Bound for Truncating a Taylor Expansion Converted from an Hermite Expansion of Inﬁnite Order: Suppose we are given the following Taylor expansion about the centroid xQ of a query node G(xq ) = Bβ β≥0 2 xq −xQ √ 2h2 β where `Strainn[12] proposed the interesting idea of using Stirling’s formula (for any non-negative integer ´ ≤ n!) to lift the node size constraint; one might imagine that this could allow approxin: n+1 e mation of larger regions in a tree-based algorithm. Unfortunately, the error bounds developed in [12] were also incorrect. We have derived the three necessary corrected error bounds based on the techniques in [3]. However, due to space, and because using these bounds actually degraded performance slightly, we do not include those lemmas here. (−1)|β| β!

The experiments indicate that the DFGTH method is able to achieve reasonable performance across all bandwidth scales. Unfortunately none of the series approximation-based methods do well on the 5-dimensional data, as expected, highlighting the main weakness of the approach presented. Pursuing corrections to the error bounds necessary to use the intriguing series form of [14] may allow an increase in dimensionality. References [1] A. W. Appel.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms are typically fast, memory efﬁcient, and simple to implement. However, many common learning problems ﬁt more naturally in the batch learning setting. The power of online learning algorithms can be exploited in batch settings by using online-to-batch conversions techniques which build a new batch algorithm from an existing online algorithm. We ﬁrst give a uniﬁed overview of three existing online-to-batch conversion techniques which do not use training data in the conversion process. We then build upon these data-independent conversions to derive and analyze data-driven conversions. Our conversions ﬁnd hypotheses with a small risk by explicitly minimizing datadependent generalization bounds. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and in particular show that the data-driven conversions consistently outperform the data-independent conversions.</p><p>6 0.33009642 <a title="160-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Maximum_Margin_Semi-Supervised_Learning_for_Structured_Variables.html">123 nips-2005-Maximum Margin Semi-Supervised Learning for Structured Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Geng, Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our design and experiments of a planar biped robot (“RunBot”) under pure reﬂexive neuronal control. The goal of this study is to combine neuronal mechanisms with biomechanics to obtain very fast speed and the on-line learning of circuit parameters. Our controller is built with biologically inspired sensor- and motor-neuron models, including local reﬂexes and not employing any kind of position or trajectory-tracking control algorithm. Instead, this reﬂexive controller allows RunBot to exploit its own natural dynamics during critical stages of its walking gait cycle. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dynamic biped walking is achieved using only a pure reﬂexive controller. In addition, this structure allows using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to tune the parameters of the reﬂexive controller in real-time during walking. This way RunBot can reach a relative speed of 3.5 leg-lengths per second after a few minutes of online learning, which is faster than that of any other biped robot, and is also comparable to the fastest relative speed of human walking. In addition, the stability domain of stable walking is quite large supporting this design strategy. 1</p><p>2 0.82233298 <a title="160-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-A_Domain_Decomposition_Method_for_Fast_Manifold_Learning.html">9 nips-2005-A Domain Decomposition Method for Fast Manifold Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenyue Zhang, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast manifold learning algorithm based on the methodology of domain decomposition. Starting with the set of sample points partitioned into two subdomains, we develop the solution of the interface problem that can glue the embeddings on the two subdomains into an embedding on the whole domain. We provide a detailed analysis to assess the errors produced by the gluing process using matrix perturbation theory. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the proposed methods. 1</p><p>3 0.78783625 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Using_%60%60epitomes%27%27_to_model_genetic_diversity%3A_Rational_design_of_HIV_vaccine_cocktails.html">198 nips-2005-Using ``epitomes'' to model genetic diversity: Rational design of HIV vaccine cocktails</a></p>
<p>Author: Nebojsa Jojic, Vladimir Jojic, Christopher Meek, David Heckerman, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new model of genetic diversity which summarizes a large input dataset into an epitome, a short sequence or a small set of short sequences of probability distributions capturing many overlapping subsequences from the dataset. The epitome as a representation has already been used in modeling real-valued signals, such as images and audio. The discrete sequence model we introduce in this paper targets applications in genetics, from multiple alignment to recombination and mutation inference. In our experiments, we concentrate on modeling the diversity of HIV where the epitome emerges as a natural model for producing relatively small vaccines covering a large number of immune system targets known as epitopes. Our experiments show that the epitome includes more epitopes than other vaccine designs of similar length, including cocktails of consensus strains, phylogenetic tree centers, and observed strains. We also discuss epitome designs that take into account uncertainty about Tcell cross reactivity and epitope presentation. In our experiments, we ﬁnd that vaccine optimization is fairly robust to these uncertainties. 1</p><p>4 0.77135724 <a title="160-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees.html">69 nips-2005-Fast Gaussian Process Regression using KD-Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Gergő Orbán, Jozsef Fiser, Richard N. Aslin, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Humans make optimal perceptual decisions in noisy and ambiguous conditions. Computations underlying such optimal behavior have been shown to rely on probabilistic inference according to generative models whose structure is usually taken to be known a priori. We argue that Bayesian model selection is ideal for inferring similar and even more complex model structures from experience. We ﬁnd in experiments that humans learn subtle statistical properties of visual scenes in a completely unsupervised manner. We show that these ﬁndings are well captured by Bayesian model learning within a class of models that seek to explain observed variables by independent hidden causes. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.71027088 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Query_by_Committee_Made_Real.html">160 nips-2005-Query by Committee Made Real</a></p>

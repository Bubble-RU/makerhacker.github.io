<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by “Google™ Sets”, we consider the problem of retrieving items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a modelbased concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufﬁcient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, ﬁnding completions of author sets from the NIPS dataset, and ﬁnding completions of sets of words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google™ Sets and show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions. 1</p><p>4 0.081497081 <a title="18-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Variable_KD-Tree_Algorithms_for_Spatial_Pattern_Search_and_Discovery.html">200 nips-2005-Variable KD-Tree Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Search and Discovery</a></p>

Moore</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding sets of points that conform to a given underlying model from within a dense, noisy set of observations. This problem is motivated by the task of efﬁciently linking faint asteroid detections, but is applicable to a range of spatial queries. We survey current tree-based approaches, showing a trade-off exists between single tree and multiple tree algorithms. To this end, we present a new type of multiple tree algorithm that uses a variable number of trees to exploit the advantages of both approaches. We empirically show that this algorithm performs well using both simulated and astronomical data.</p><p>5 0.079989962 <a title="18-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-An_Alternative_Infinite_Mixture_Of_Gaussian_Process_Experts.html">21 nips-2005-An Alternative Infinite Mixture Of Gaussian Process Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Meeds, Simon Osindero</p><p>Abstract: We present an inﬁnite mixture model in which each component comprises a multivariate Gaussian distribution over an input space, and a Gaussian Process model over an output space. Our model is neatly able to deal with non-stationary covariance functions, discontinuities, multimodality and overlapping output signals. The work is similar to that by Rasmussen and Ghahramani [1]; however, we use a full generative model over input and output space rather than just a conditional model. This allows us to deal with incomplete data, to perform inference over inverse functional mappings as well as for regression, and also leads to a more powerful and consistent Bayesian speciﬁcation of the effective ‘gating network’ for the different experts. 1</p><p>6 0.075788796 <a title="18-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Searching_for_Character_Models.html">171 nips-2005-Searching for Character Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Active learning is the problem in supervised learning to design the locations of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. Existing active learning methods often assume that the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function can be expressed by the model at hand. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulﬁlled. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can be theoretically justiﬁed under slightly weaker condition: the model does not have to be correctly speciﬁed, but slightly misspeciﬁed models are also allowed. However, it turns out that the weakened condition is still restrictive in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose an alternative active learning method which can be theoretically justiﬁed for a wider class of misspeciﬁed models. Thus, the proposed method has a broader range of applications than the existing method. Numerical studies show that the proposed active learning method is robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and is thus reliable. 1 Introduction and Problem Formulation Let us discuss the regression problem of learning a real-valued function Ê from training examples ´Ü Ý µ ´Ü µ · ¯ Ý Ò ´Üµ deﬁned on ½ where ¯ Ò ½ are i.i.d. noise with mean zero and unknown variance ¾. We use the following linear regression model for learning. ´Ü µ ´µ Ô ½ « ³ ´Ü µ where ³ Ü Ô ½ are ﬁxed linearly independent functions and are parameters to be learned. ´ µ « ´«½ «¾ « Ô µ We evaluate the goodness of the learned function Ü by the expected squared test error over test input points and noise (i.e., the generalization error). When the test input points are drawn independently from a distribution with density ÔØ Ü , the generalization error is expressed as ´ µ ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø where ¯ denotes the expectation over the noise ¯ Ò Ô ´Üµ is known1. ½. In the following, we suppose that Ø In a standard setting of regression, the training input points are provided from the environment, i.e., Ü Ò ½ independently follow the distribution with density ÔØ Ü . On the other hand, in some cases, the training input points can be designed by users. In such cases, it is expected that the accuracy of the learning result can be improved if the training input points are chosen appropriately, e.g., by densely locating training input points in the regions of high uncertainty. ´ µ Active learning—also referred to as experimental design—is the problem of optimizing the location of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. In active learning research, it is often assumed that the regression model is correctly speciﬁed [2, 1, 3], i.e., the learning target function Ü can be expressed by the model. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. ´ µ In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can still be theoretically justiﬁed when the model is approximately correct in a strong sense. Then we propose an alternative active learning method which can also be theoretically justiﬁed for approximately correct models, but the condition on the approximate correctness of the models is weaker than that for the existing method. Thus, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. In the following, we suppose that the training input points Ü Ò ½ are independently drawn from a user-deﬁned distribution with density ÔÜ Ü , and discuss the problem of ﬁnding the optimal density function. ´µ 2 Existing Active Learning Method The generalization error deﬁned by Eq.(1) can be decomposed as ·Î is the (squared) bias term and Î is the variance term given by where ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø Î and ¯ ´Üµ   ¯ ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø A standard way to learn the parameters in the regression model (1) is the ordinary leastsquares learning, i.e., parameter vector « is determined as follows. « ÇÄË It is known that «ÇÄË is given by Ö« Ò Ñ « ÇÄË where Ä ÇÄË ´ µ ½ Ò ´Ü µ   Ý ½ Ä ÇÄË ³ ´Ü µ ¾ Ý and Ý ´Ý½ Ý¾ Ý Ò µ Let ÇÄË , ÇÄË and ÎÇÄË be , and Î for the learned function obtained by the ordinary least-squares learning, respectively. Then the following proposition holds. 1 In some application domains such as web page analysis or bioinformatics, a large number of unlabeled samples—input points without output values independently drawn from the distribution with density ÔØ ´Üµ—are easily gathered. In such cases, a reasonably good estimate of ÔØ ´Üµ may be obtained by some standard density estimation method. Therefore, the assumption that ÔØ ´Üµ is known may not be so restrictive. Proposition 1 ([2, 1, 3]) Suppose that the model is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function Ü is expressed as ´µ Ô ´Ü µ Then ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ and ÎÇÄË are expressed as ÇÄË ¼ ÇÄË and Î ¾ ÇÄË Â ÇÄË where ØÖ´ÍÄ Â ÇÄË ÇÄË Ä ÇÄË µ ³ ´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü Í and Ø Therefore, for the correctly speciﬁed model (1), the generalization error as ÇÄË ¾ ÇÄË is expressed Â ÇÄË Based on this expression, the existing active learning method determines the location of training input points Ü Ò ½ (or the training input density ÔÜ Ü ) so that ÂÇÄË is minimized [2, 1, 3]. ´ µ 3 Analysis of Existing Method under Misspeciﬁcation of Models In this section, we investigate the validity of the existing active learning method for misspeciﬁed models. ´ µ Suppose the model does not exactly include the learning target function Ü , but it approximately includes it, i.e., for a scalar Æ such that Æ is small, Ü is expressed as ´ µ ´Ü µ ´Üµ · ÆÖ´Üµ where ´Üµ is the orthogonal projection of ´Üµ onto the span of residual Ö´Üµ is orthogonal to ³ ´Üµ ½ : Ô Ô ´Üµ ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ Ö´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü and In this case, the bias term Ø ¼ for ³ ´Üµ ½¾ Ô and the ½ Ô is expressed as ¾ ´ ´Üµ   ´Üµµ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü is constant which does not depend on the training input density Ô ´Üµ, we subtract ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ô ´Üµ Ü · where Ø Ø Since in the following discussion. Ü Then we have the following lemma2 .

However, for misspeciﬁed models, «ÇÄË is generally biased even asymptotically if Æ ÇÔ . ´½µ The bias of «ÇÄË is actually caused by the covariate shift [5]—the training input density ÔÜ Ü is different from the test input density ÔØ Ü . For correctly speciﬁed models, inﬂuence of the covariate shift can be ignored, as the existing active learning method does. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we should explicitly cope with the covariate shift. ´µ ´ µ Under the covariate shift, it is known that the following weighted least-squares learning is [5]. asymptotically unbiased even if Æ ÇÔ ´½µ Ô ´Ü µ Ô ´Ü µ ½ Ò Ö« Ò Ñ « Ï ÄË ¾ ´Ü µ   Ý Ø Ü Asymptotic unbiasedness of «Ï ÄË would be intuitively understood by the following identity, which is similar in spirit to importance sampling: ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Ü µ Ü ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ø ´µ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ô ´Ü µ Ü Ô ´Üµ Ø Ü Ü In the following, we assume that ÔÜ Ü is strictly positive for all Ü.

Then we have the following lemma.

Therefore, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. The effect of this extension is experimentally investigated in the next section. ´ 5 µ Numerical Examples We evaluate the usefulness of the proposed active learning method through experiments.

Let Ô and the basis functions be ³ Ü Ü  ½ for . Let us consider the following three cases.

We choose the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the Gaussian density with mean and standard , where deviation ¼¾ ¿ ´µ ¼  ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼ ½¼ ´µ ¼ ¼¿ ½¾¿ ¼¾ ¾ We compare the accuracy of the following three methods: (A) Proposed active learning criterion + WLS learning : The training input density is determined so that ÂÏ ÄË is minimized. Following the determined input density, training input points Ü ½¼¼ are created and corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼ ½ ½ are observed. Then WLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (B) Existing active learning criterion + OLS learning [2, 1, 3]: The training input density is determined so that ÂÇÄË is minimized. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (C) Passive learning + OLS learning: The test input density ÔØ Ü is used as the training input density. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. ´ µ First, we evaluate the accuracy of ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË as approximations of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . The means and standard deviations of Ï ÄË , ÂÏ ÄË , ÇÄË , and ÂÇÄË over runs are (“correctly depicted as functions of  in Figure 2. These graphs show that when Æ speciﬁed”), both ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË give accurate estimates of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . When Æ (“approximately correct”), ÂÏ ÄË again works well, while ÂÇÄË tends to be negatively biased for large . This result is surprising since as illustrated in Figure 1, the learning target functions with Æ and Æ are visually quite similar. Therefore, it intuitively seems that the result of Æ is not much different from that of Æ . However, the simulation result shows that this slight difference makes ÂÇÄË unreliable. (“misspeciﬁed”), ÂÏ ÄË is still reasonably accurate, while ÂÇÄË is heavily When Æ biased. ½¼¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼¼ ¼ These results show that as an approximation of the generalization error, ÂÏ ÄË is more robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models than ÂÇÄË , which is in good agreement with the theoretical analyses given in Section 3 and Section 4.

Each data set includes samples, consisting of -dimensional input and -dimensional output values.

For each data set, we repeat this simulation times, by changing the template points Ø ¼ ½ in each run. ½¾ ½¼¼ ½¼¼ The means and standard deviations of the test error over runs are described in Table 2. The proposed method (A) outperforms the existing method (B) for ﬁve data sets, while it is outperformed by (B) for the other three data sets. We conjecture that the model used for learning is almost correct in these three data sets. This result implies that the proposed method (A) is slightly better than the existing method (B). Figure 3 depicts the relative performance of the proposed method (A) and the existing method (B) compared with the passive learning scheme (C). This shows that (A) outperforms (C) for all eight data sets, while (B) is comparable or is outperformed by (C) for ﬁve data sets. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is overall shown to work better than other schemes. 6 Conclusions We argued that active learning is essentially the situation under the covariate shift—the training input density is different from the test input density. When the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, the covariate shift does not matter. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we have to explicitly cope with the covariate shift. In this paper, we proposed a new active learning method based on the weighted least-squares learning. The numerical study showed that the existing method works better than the proposed method if model is correctly speciﬁed. However, the existing method tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. On the other hand, the proposed method overall worked reasonably well and it consistently outperformed the passive learning scheme. Therefore, the proposed method would be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable. The proposed method can be theoretically justiﬁed if the model is approximately correct in a weak sense. However, it is no longer valid for totally misspeciﬁed models. A natural future direction would be therefore to devise an active learning method which has theoretical guarantee with totally misspeciﬁed models. It is also important to notice that when the model is totally misspeciﬁed, even learning with optimal training input points would not be successful anyway. In such cases, it is of course important to carry out model selection. In active learning research—including the present paper, however, the location of training input points are designed for a single model at hand. That is, the model should have been chosen before performing active learning. Devising a method for simultaneously optimizing models and the location of training input points would be a more important and promising future direction.

<p>Author: Miroslav Dudík, Steven J. Phillips, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of maximum entropy density estimation in the presence of known sample selection bias. We propose three bias correction approaches. The ﬁrst one takes advantage of unbiased sufﬁcient statistics which can be obtained from biased samples. The second one estimates the biased distribution and then factors the bias out. The third one approximates the second by only using samples from the sampling distribution. We provide guarantees for the ﬁrst two approaches and evaluate the performance of all three approaches in synthetic experiments and on real data from species habitat modeling, where maxent has been successfully applied and where sample selection bias is a signiﬁcant problem. 1</p><p>4 0.61960989 <a title="18-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Faster_Rates_in_Regression_via_Active_Learning.html">74 nips-2005-Faster Rates in Regression via Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Rebecca Willett, Robert Nowak, Rui M. Castro</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous statistical analysis characterizing regimes in which active learning signiﬁcantly outperforms classical passive learning. Active learning algorithms are able to make queries or select sample locations in an online fashion, depending on the results of the previous queries. In some regimes, this extra ﬂexibility leads to signiﬁcantly faster rates of error decay than those possible in classical passive learning settings. The nature of these regimes is explored by studying fundamental performance limits of active and passive learning in two illustrative nonparametric function classes. In addition to examining the theoretical potential of active learning, this paper describes a practical algorithm capable of exploiting the extra ﬂexibility of the active setting and provably improving upon the classical passive techniques. Our active learning theory and methods show promise in a number of applications, including ﬁeld estimation using wireless sensor networks and fault line detection. 1</p><p>5 0.59333533 <a title="18-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Bayesian_Sets.html">33 nips-2005-Bayesian Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by “Google™ Sets”, we consider the problem of retrieving items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a modelbased concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufﬁcient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, ﬁnding completions of author sets from the NIPS dataset, and ﬁnding completions of sets of words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google™ Sets and show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions. 1</p><p>6 0.57833856 <a title="18-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-A_Bayesian_Spatial_Scan_Statistic.html">4 nips-2005-A Bayesian Spatial Scan Statistic</a></p>

Miller, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We present an efﬁcient algorithm to actively select queries for learning the boundaries separating a function domain into regions where the function is above and below a given threshold. We develop experiment selection methods based on entropy, misclassiﬁcation rate, variance, and their combinations, and show how they perform on a number of data sets. We then show how these algorithms are used to determine simultaneously valid 1 − α conﬁdence intervals for seven cosmological parameters. Experimentation shows that the algorithm reduces the computation necessary for the parameter estimation problem by an order of magnitude.</p><p>2 0.67023277 <a title="18-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Estimating_the_wrong_Markov_random_field%3A_Benefits_in_the_computation-limited_setting.html">65 nips-2005-Estimating the wrong Markov random field: Benefits in the computation-limited setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Consider the problem of joint parameter estimation and prediction in a Markov random ﬁeld: i.e., the model parameters are estimated on the basis of an initial set of data, and then the ﬁtted model is used to perform prediction (e.g., smoothing, denoising, interpolation) on a new noisy observation. Working in the computation-limited setting, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for ﬁtting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the “wrong” model even in the inﬁnite data limit) is provably beneﬁcial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of variational methods. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product. 1 Keywords: Markov random ﬁelds; variational method; message-passing algorithms; sum-product; belief propagation; parameter estimation; learning. 1</p><p>3 0.67005473 <a title="18-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Variable_KD-Tree_Algorithms_for_Spatial_Pattern_Search_and_Discovery.html">200 nips-2005-Variable KD-Tree Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Search and Discovery</a></p>

Moore</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding sets of points that conform to a given underlying model from within a dense, noisy set of observations. This problem is motivated by the task of efﬁciently linking faint asteroid detections, but is applicable to a range of spatial queries. We survey current tree-based approaches, showing a trade-off exists between single tree and multiple tree algorithms. To this end, we present a new type of multiple tree algorithm that uses a variable number of trees to exploit the advantages of both approaches. We empirically show that this algorithm performs well using both simulated and astronomical data.</p><p>4 0.66876495 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Hot_Coupling%3A_A_Particle_Approach_to_Inference_and_Normalization_on_Pairwise_Undirected_Graphs.html">90 nips-2005-Hot Coupling: A Particle Approach to Inference and Normalization on Pairwise Undirected Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Firas Hamze, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new sampling algorithm for approximating functions of variables representable as undirected graphical models of arbitrary connectivity with pairwise potentials, as well as for estimating the notoriously difﬁcult partition function of the graph. The algorithm ﬁts into the framework of sequential Monte Carlo methods rather than the more widely used MCMC, and relies on constructing a sequence of intermediate distributions which get closer to the desired one. While the idea of using “tempered” proposals is known, we construct a novel sequence of target distributions where, rather than dropping a global temperature parameter, we sequentially couple individual pairs of variables that are, initially, sampled exactly from a spanning tree of the variables. We present experimental results on inference and estimation of the partition function for sparse and densely-connected graphs.</p><p>5 0.668091 <a title="18-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_from_Data_of_Variable_Quality.html">117 nips-2005-Learning from Data of Variable Quality</a></p>

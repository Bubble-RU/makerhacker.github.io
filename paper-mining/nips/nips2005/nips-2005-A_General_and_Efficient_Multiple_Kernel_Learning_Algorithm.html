<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.</p><p>3 0.17404701 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Analysis_of_Spectral_Kernel_Design_based_Semi-supervised_Learning.html">27 nips-2005-Analysis of Spectral Kernel Design based Semi-supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>4 0.15693133 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Combining_Graph_Laplacians_for_Semi--Supervised_Learning.html">42 nips-2005-Combining Graph Laplacians for Semi--Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Mark Herbster, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: A foundational problem in semi-supervised learning is the construction of a graph underlying the data. We propose to use a method which optimally combines a number of differently constructed graphs. For each of these graphs we associate a basic graph kernel. We then compute an optimal combined kernel. This kernel solves an extended regularization problem which requires a joint minimization over both the data and the set of graph kernels. We present encouraging results on different OCR tasks where the optimal combined kernel is computed from graphs constructed with a variety of distances functions and the ‘k’ in nearest neighbors. 1</p><p>5 0.1477464 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_SVMs_with_an_Application_to_Unbalanced_Classification.html">14 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Interpretation of SVMs with an Application to Unbalanced Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Johnny Mariethoz, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that the hinge loss can be interpreted as the neg-log-likelihood of a semi-parametric model of posterior probabilities. From this point of view, SVMs represent the parametric component of a semi-parametric model ﬁtted by a maximum a posteriori estimation procedure. This connection enables to derive a mapping from SVM scores to estimated posterior probabilities. Unlike previous proposals, the suggested mapping is interval-valued, providing a set of posterior probabilities compatible with each SVM score. This framework offers a new way to adapt the SVM optimization problem to unbalanced classiﬁcation, when decisions result in unequal (asymmetric) losses. Experiments show improvements over state-of-the-art procedures. 1</p><p>6 0.13338652 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Consistency_of_one-class_SVM_and_related_algorithms.html">47 nips-2005-Consistency of one-class SVM and related algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Suzuki, Hideki Isozaki</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to feature selection based on a statistical feature mining technique for sequence and tree kernels. Since natural language data take discrete structures, convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are advantageous for both the concept and accuracy of many natural language processing tasks. However, experiments have shown that the best results can only be achieved when limited small sub-structures are dealt with by these kernels. This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels and then proposes a statistical feature selection that enable us to use larger sub-structures effectively. The proposed method, in order to execute efﬁciently, can be embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments on real NLP tasks conﬁrm the problem in the conventional method and compare the performance of a conventional method to that of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.63398677 <a title="10-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Kernels_for_gene_regulatory_regions.html">103 nips-2005-Kernels for gene regulatory regions</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean-philippe Vert, Robert Thurman, William S. Noble</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchy of motif-based kernels for multiple alignments of biological sequences, particularly suitable to process regulatory regions of genes. The kernels incorporate progressively more information, with the most complex kernel accounting for a multiple alignment of orthologous regions, the phylogenetic tree relating the species, and the prior knowledge that relevant sequence patterns occur in conserved motif blocks. These kernels can be used in the presence of a library of known transcription factor binding sites, or de novo by iterating over all k-mers of a given length. In the latter mode, a discriminative classiﬁer built from such a kernel not only recognizes a given class of promoter regions, but as a side effect simultaneously identiﬁes a collection of relevant, discriminative sequence motifs. We demonstrate the utility of the motif-based multiple alignment kernels by using a collection of aligned promoter regions from ﬁve yeast species to recognize classes of cell-cycle regulated genes.

<p>Author: Y. Altun, D. McAllester, M. Belkin</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world classiﬁcation problems involve the prediction of multiple inter-dependent variables forming some structural dependency. Recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on supervised classiﬁcation of such structured variables. In this paper, we investigate structured classiﬁcation in a semi-supervised setting. We present a discriminative approach that utilizes the intrinsic geometry of input patterns revealed by unlabeled data points and we derive a maximum-margin formulation of semi-supervised learning for structured variables. Unlike transductive algorithms, our formulation naturally extends to new test points. 1</p><p>6 0.62509102 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-From_Lasso_regression_to_Feature_vector_machine.html">77 nips-2005-From Lasso regression to Feature vector machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>4 0.62687743 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Nearest_Neighbor_Based_Feature_Selection_for_Regression_and_its_Application_to_Neural_Activity.html">132 nips-2005-Nearest Neighbor Based Feature Selection for Regression and its Application to Neural Activity</a></p>

Our algorithm involves a feature-weighted version of the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. It is able to capture complex dependency of the target function on its input and makes use of the leave-one-out error as a natural regularization. We explain the characteristics of our algorithm on synthetic problems and use it in the context of predicting hand velocity from spikes recorded in motor cortex of a behaving monkey.

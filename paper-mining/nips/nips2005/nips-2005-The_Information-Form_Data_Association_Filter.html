</p><p>2 The key innovation is a representation of the data association posterior in information form, in which the “proximity” of objects and tracks are expressed by numerical links. [sent-2, score-0.949]
</p><p>3 The paper derives the algorithm formally and provides comparative results using data obtained by a real-world camera array and by a large-scale sensor network simulation. [sent-4, score-0.324]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction This paper addresses the problem of data association in online object tracking [6]. [sent-5, score-0.745]
</p><p>5 The data association problem arises in a large number of application domains, including computer vision, robotics, and sensor networks. [sent-6, score-0.482]
</p><p>6 The setup is motivated by a camera network which we recently deployed in our lab. [sent-8, score-0.231]
</p><p>7 Here sensor data relates to the color of clothing of individual people, which enables us to identify them. [sent-9, score-0.226]
</p><p>8 We show that the standard probabilistic solution to the discrete data association problem requires exponential update time and exponential memory. [sent-11, score-0.702]
</p><p>9 This is because each data association hypothesis is expressed by a permutation matrix that assigns computer-internal tracks to objects in the physical world. [sent-12, score-1.337]
</p><p>10 An optimal ﬁlter would therefore need to maintain a probability distribution over the space of all permutation matrices, which grows exponentially with N , the number of objects in the world. [sent-13, score-0.543]
</p><p>11 This ﬁlter maintains an information matrix Ω of size N × N , which relates tracks to physical objects in the world. [sent-19, score-0.681]
</p><p>12 The rows of Ω correspond to object identities, the columns to the tracks of the tracker. [sent-20, score-0.504]
</p><p>13 The highlighted ﬁrst column corresponds to track 1 in the tracker. [sent-24, score-0.216]
</p><p>14 43      15  2  (e) Graphical network interpretation of the information form  Figure 1: Illustration of the information form ﬁlter for data association in object tracking  associated with object 3, since the value 10 dominates all other values in this column. [sent-31, score-0.935]
</p><p>15 Thus, looking at column 1 of Ω in isolation would have us conclude that the most likely association of track 1 is object 3. [sent-32, score-0.758]
</p><p>16 However, the most likely permutation matrix is shown in Fig. [sent-33, score-0.49]
</p><p>17 1b; from all possible data association assignments, this matrix receives the highest ˆ score. [sent-34, score-0.539]
</p><p>18 Its score is tr AT Ω = 5 + 12 + 11 + 15 = 43 (here “tr” denotes the trace of a matrix). [sent-35, score-0.203]
</p><p>19 This permutation matrix associates object 3 with track 4, while associating track 1 with object 4. [sent-36, score-1.249]
</p><p>20 As we shall see, the update operations for Ω are simple and parallelizable. [sent-38, score-0.197]
</p><p>21 Suppose we receive a measurement that associates track 2 with object 4 (e. [sent-39, score-0.506]
</p><p>22 , track 2’s hair color appears to be the same as person 4’s hair color in our camera array). [sent-41, score-0.498]
</p><p>23 As a result, our approach adds a value to the element in Ω that links object 4 and track 2, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-42, score-0.415]
</p><p>24 Similarly, suppose our tracker is unable to distinguish between objects 2 and 3, perhaps because these objects are so close together in a camera image that they cannot be tracked individually. [sent-44, score-0.61]
</p><p>25 The exact values in this new information matrix are the result of an exponentiated averaging explained below. [sent-47, score-0.209]
</p><p>26 The exact update and inference rules are based on a probabilistic model that is also discussed below. [sent-49, score-0.257]
</p><p>27 The data association problem has been studied as an ofﬂine problem, in which all data is memorized and inference takes place after data collection. [sent-51, score-0.45]
</p><p>28 The dominant online, or ﬁlter, paradigm involves the selection of K representative samples of the data association matrix, but such algorithms tend to work only for small N [11]. [sent-53, score-0.42]
</p><p>29 The ﬁrst mention of information ﬁlters is in [8], but the update rules there were  computationally less efﬁcient (in O(N 4 )) and required central optimization. [sent-57, score-0.23]
</p><p>30 Our approach can be viewed as a learning algorithm for a Markov network [7] of a special topology, where any track and any object are connected by an edge. [sent-61, score-0.393]
</p><p>31 The ﬁlter update equations manipulate the strength of the edges based on data. [sent-64, score-0.197]
</p><p>32 2 Problem Setup and Bayes Filter Solution We begin with a formal deﬁnition of the data association problem and derive the obvious but inefﬁcient Bayes ﬁlter solution. [sent-65, score-0.39]
</p><p>33 1 Data Association We assume that we are given a tracking algorithm that maintains N internal tracks of the moving objects. [sent-68, score-0.546]
</p><p>34 Due to insufﬁcient information, this assumed tracking algorithm does not always know the exact mapping of identities to internal tracks. [sent-69, score-0.348]
</p><p>35 Hence, the same internal track may correspond to different identities at different times. [sent-70, score-0.34]
</p><p>36 The data association problem is the problem of assigning these N tracks to N objects. [sent-71, score-0.689]
</p><p>37 Each data association hypothesis is characterized by a permutation matrix of the type shown in Fig. [sent-72, score-0.88]
</p><p>38 The columns of this matrix correspond to the internal tracks, and the rows to the objects. [sent-74, score-0.222]
</p><p>39 We will denote the data association matrix by A (not to be confused with the information matrix Ω). [sent-75, score-0.655]
</p><p>40 In our closed world, A is always a permutation matrix; hence all elements are 0 or 1. [sent-76, score-0.359]
</p><p>41 There are exponentially many permutation matrices, which is a reason why data association is considered a hard problem. [sent-77, score-0.763]
</p><p>42 2 Identity Measurement The correct data association matrix A is unobservable. [sent-79, score-0.506]
</p><p>43 Instead, the sensors produce local information about the relation of individual tracks to individual objects. [sent-80, score-0.394]
</p><p>44 Each zj = {zij } speciﬁes a local probability distribution in the corresponding object space: p(xi = yj | zj ) =  zij  zij = 1  with  (1)  i  Here xi is the i-th object in the world, and yj is the j-th track. [sent-82, score-0.84]
</p><p>45 This occurs when zij = α for 1−α some α ≈ 1, and zkj = N −1 for all k = i. [sent-85, score-0.242]
</p><p>46 Such a measurement arises when the tracker receives evidence that a speciﬁc track yj corresponds with high likelihood to a speciﬁc object xi . [sent-86, score-0.748]
</p><p>47 3 State Transitions As time passes by, our tracker may confuse tracks, which is a loss of information with respect to the data association. [sent-89, score-0.277]
</p><p>48 The tracker confusing two objects amounts to a random ﬂip of two columns in the data association matrix A. [sent-90, score-0.906]
</p><p>49 , BM } be a set of permutation matrices, and {β1 , . [sent-95, score-0.33]
</p><p>50 The “true” permutation matrix undergoes a random transition from A to A Bm with probability βm : A  prob=βm  −→  A Bm  (2)  The sets {B1 , . [sent-99, score-0.506]
</p><p>51 1d, in which tracks 2 and 3 merge, the following two permutation matrices will implement such a merge:  1 0 0 0   1 0 0 0  0 1 B1 =  0 0 0  0  0 1 0  0  ; β1 = 0. [sent-107, score-0.712]
</p><p>52 5 0 1  (3)  The ﬁrst such matrix leaves the association unchanged, whereas the second swaps columns 2 and 3. [sent-109, score-0.543]
</p><p>53 4 Inefﬁcient Bayesian Solution For small N , the data association problem now has an obvious Bayes ﬁlter solution. [sent-114, score-0.39]
</p><p>54 Specifically, let A be the space of all permutation matrices. [sent-115, score-0.33]
</p><p>55 The Bayesian ﬁlter solves the identity tracking problem by maintaining a probabilistic belief over the space of all permutation matrices A ∈ A. [sent-116, score-0.699]
</p><p>56 This probability is updated in two different ways, reminiscent of the measurement and state transition updates in DBNs and EKFs. [sent-118, score-0.215]
</p><p>57 The measurement step updates the belief in response to a measurement zj . [sent-119, score-0.365]
</p><p>58 This update is an application of Bayes rule: 1 p(A) aij zij (4) p(A) ←− L i with L  ¯ p(A)  = ¯ A  aij zij ¯  (5)  i  Here aij denotes the ij-th element of the matrix A. [sent-120, score-0.851]
</p><p>59 Because A is a permutation matrix, only one element in the sum over i is non-zero (hence there is not really a summation here). [sent-121, score-0.36]
</p><p>60 The state transition updates the belief in accordance with the permutation matrices Bm and associated probabilities βm (see Eq. [sent-122, score-0.574]
</p><p>61 2): p(A)  T βm p(A Bm )  ←−  (6)  m  We use here that the inverse of a permutation matrix is its transpose. [sent-123, score-0.446]
</p><p>62 This Bayesian ﬁlter is an exact solution to our identity tracking problem. [sent-124, score-0.315]
</p><p>63 permutation matrices A, and we have to compute probabilities for all of them. [sent-126, score-0.444]
</p><p>64 Even if we want to keep track of K ≪ N likely permutations—as attempted by ﬁlters like the multihypothesis EKF or the particle ﬁlter—the required number of tracks K will generally have to scale exponentially with N (albeit at a slower rate). [sent-128, score-0.72]
</p><p>65 This exponential scaling renders the Bayesian ﬁlter ultimately inapplicable to the identity tracking problem with large N . [sent-129, score-0.269]
</p><p>66 3 The Information-Form Solution Our data association ﬁlter represents the posterior in condensed form, using an N × N information matrix. [sent-130, score-0.459]
</p><p>67 As a result, it requires linear update time and quadratic memory, instead of the exponential time and memory requirements of the Bayes ﬁlter. [sent-131, score-0.276]
</p><p>68 Ω induces a probability distribution over the space of all data association matrices  A, through the following deﬁnition: 1 p(A) = exp tr A Ω Z  with  Z =  exp tr A Ω  (7)  A  Here tr is the trace of a matrix, and Z is the partition function. [sent-137, score-1.189]
</p><p>69 2 Measurement Update in Information Form In information form, the measurement update is a local addition of the form:   0···0  Ω  ←−  . [sent-141, score-0.346]
</p><p>70 Of particular interest is the case where one speciﬁc association was afﬁrmed with prob1−α ability zij = α, while all others were true with the error probability zkj = N −1 . [sent-165, score-0.602]
</p><p>71 Then the update is of the form   Ω  ←−       Ω+      0···0 . [sent-166, score-0.197]
</p><p>72 0···0             with  c = log  1−α N −1  (9)  However, since Ω is a non-normalized matrix (it is normalized via the partition function Z in Eq. [sent-226, score-0.206]
</p><p>73 7), we can modify Ω as long as exp tr A Ω is changed by the same factor for any A. [sent-227, score-0.238]
</p><p>74 In particular, we can subtract c from an entire column in Ω; this will affect the result of exp tr A Ω by a factor of exp c, which is independent of A and hence will be subsumed by the normalizer Z. [sent-228, score-0.35]
</p><p>75 This allows us to perform a more efﬁcient update 1−α ωij ←− ωij + log α − log (10) N −1 where ωij is the ij-th element of Ω. [sent-229, score-0.333]
</p><p>76 3 State Transition Update in Information Form The state transition update is also simple, but it is approximate. [sent-234, score-0.257]
</p><p>77 We show that using a Jensen bound, we obtain the following update for the information matrix: Ω  ←−  T βm Bm exp Ω  log  (11)  m  Here the expression “exp Ω” denotes a component-wise exponentiation of the matrix Ω; the result is also a matrix. [sent-235, score-0.515]
</p><p>78 This update implements a “dual” of a geometric mean; here the exponentiation is applied to the individual elements of this mean, and the logarithm is applied to the result. [sent-236, score-0.304]
</p><p>79 It is important to notice that this update only affects elements in Ω that might be affected by a permutation Bm ; all others remain the same. [sent-237, score-0.56]
</p><p>80 A numerical example of this update was given in Fig. [sent-238, score-0.197]
</p><p>81 The values there are the result of applying this update formula. [sent-241, score-0.197]
</p><p>82 The transformations rely heavily on the fact that A and Bm are permutation matrices. [sent-247, score-0.33]
</p><p>83 log p(A)  T βm p(A Bm )  ←− log m  =  T βm exp tr A Bm Ω  const. [sent-249, score-0.344]
</p><p>84 + tr A log  (12)  m  The result is of the form of (the logarithm of) Eq. [sent-254, score-0.251]
</p><p>85 A beneﬁt of this update rule is that it only affects columns in Ω that are affected by a permutation Bm ; all other columns are unchanged. [sent-258, score-0.694]
</p><p>86 As a result, we gain a compact closed-form solution to the update problem, but the state transition step may sacriﬁce information in doing so (as indicated by the “≤” sign). [sent-260, score-0.319]
</p><p>87 We now address the problem of recovering actual data association hypotheses from the information matrix, along with the associated probabilities. [sent-263, score-0.456]
</p><p>88 We consider three cases: the computation of the most likely data association matrix as illustrated in Fig. [sent-264, score-0.581]
</p><p>89 For more  (a) camera  (b) array of 16 ceiling-mounted cameras  (c) camera images  (d) 2 of the tracks  Figure 2: The camera array, part of the common area in the Stanford AI Lab. [sent-283, score-0.749]
</p><p>90 The data association is essentially correct at all times. [sent-285, score-0.39]
</p><p>91 We used 16 cameras to track individuals walking through the lab. [sent-292, score-0.267]
</p><p>92 The tracker uses background subtraction to ﬁnd blobs and uses a color histogram to classify these blobs. [sent-293, score-0.256]
</p><p>93 Only when two or more people come very close to each other might the tracker lose track of individual people. [sent-294, score-0.503]
</p><p>94 We ﬁnd that for N = 5 our method tracks people nearly perfectly, but so does the full-blown Bayesian solution, as well as the K-best multihypothesis method that is popular in the tracking literature. [sent-295, score-0.559]
</p><p>95 6 Conclusion We have provided an information form algorithm for the data association problem in object tracking. [sent-309, score-0.561]
</p><p>96 The key idea of this approach is to maintain a cumulative matrix of information associating computer-internal tracks with physical objects. [sent-310, score-0.626]
</p><p>97 Updating this matrix is easy; furthermore, efﬁcient methods were proposed for extracting concrete data association hypotheses from this representation. [sent-311, score-0.506]
</p><p>98 Also missing is a tight integration of our discrete formulation into continuous-valued traditional tracking algorithms such as EKFs. [sent-315, score-0.198]
</p><p>99 Sampling K good data associations cannot exploit conditional independence in the data association posterior, hence will always require that K is an exponential function of N . [sent-318, score-0.463]

<p>Author: Bo Wen, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mechanism we proposed in which OHC motile forces, through the microanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the degree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes saturation of OHC forces. 1 Silicon Cochleae Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear micromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suffers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This parallel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3]. Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar membrane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling (ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism (ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Oval window organ of Corti BM Round window IHC RL A OHC PhP DC BM Basal @ Stereocilia i -1 i i+1 Apical B Figure 1: The inner ear. A Cutaway showing cochlear ducts (adapted from [6]). B Longitudinal view of cochlear partition (CP) (modiﬁed from [7]-[8]). Each outer hair cell (OHC) tilts toward the base while the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which it sits extends a phalangeal process (PhP) toward the apex. The OHCs’ stereocilia and the PhPs’ apical ends form the reticular lamina (RL). d is the tilt distance, and the segment size. IHC: inner hair cell. model as the basis of cochlear circuit design. Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior. 2 Active Bidirectional Coupling The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The movement of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved. We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process (PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP) is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1. Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk. In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between BM segments in the longitudinal direction.

Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts) are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h (cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall. Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 2 φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 2 denotes the Laplacian operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the x and y directions: Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y. The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion (with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows. ˙ ¨ Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S(x)δ(x) + β(x)δ(x) + M (x)δ(x), (1) where S(x) is the stiffness, β(x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂(φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂t is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density. The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by FOHC (x) = s0 tanh(αγS(x)δ(x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS(x)δ(x + d)/s0 ) , (2) where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level. We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP. 4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a 2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation. 4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level, the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10], we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of nMOS transistors. Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term): ˙ Iin = S(x) Imem dt + β(x)Imem + M (x)I˙mem , (3) where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn, Imem ˙ drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity, δ. The FOHC term is dealt with in Section 4.2. Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is τ1 Is s + Is τ2 Io s + Io Imem = −Iin + Io , = Iin − bIs , = Iin + Is − Io , (4) (5) (6) where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants τ1 and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as: Iin s2 = (b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 Imem . Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs: S(x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 , β(x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 , and M (x) = 1. Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathematical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to Half LPF ( ) + Iout- Iin+ Iout+ Iout Vq Iin+ Iin- C+ B Iin- A Iin+ + - - Iin- + + + C To neighbors Is- Is+ > + > + IT+ IT- + - + From neighbors Io- Io+ + + + + - - + + LPF Iout+ Iout- BM Imem+ Imem- Figure 3: Low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and second-order section circuit design.

It consists of two LPFs and connects to its neighbors through Is and IT . simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon area). 4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with Imem dt to obtain FOHC = rﬀ S(x)T Imem (x − d)dt − rfb S(x)T Imem (x + d)dt , where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, Imem (x − d)dt = −τ1f Isf and Imem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small. We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result: τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ). Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream neighbors of each segment.

A Architecture: Two diffusive grids with embedded BM circuits model the cochlea. B Detail. BM circuits exchange currents with their neighbors. 4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of BM is driven by the pressure difference across it. Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for the BM circuit. It is described by + − + − + − + − + − 2 τ (Iout − Iout )s + (Iout − Iout ) = Iin − Iin and τ Iout Iout s + Iout Iout = Iq , where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output current, and τ sets the time constant. Combining the common-mode constraint with the differential design equation yields the nodal equation for the positive path (the negative path has superscripts + and − swapped): + − + + + − 2 ˙+ C Vout = Iτ (Iin − Iin ) + (Iq /Iout − Iout ) /(Iout + Iout ). + This nodal equation suggests the half-LPF circuit shown in Figure 3A. Vout , the voltage on + the positive capacitor (C ), gates a pMOS transistor to produce the corresponding current + − − signal, Iout (Vout and Iout are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = CuT/κIτ (κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these subcircuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B). The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthesized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat /(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat. 4.4 Chip Architecture We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in 0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema. 5 Chip Measurements We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear positions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea [13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from 1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]). The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology (computed from [13]).

A Amplitude. B Phase. Dashed lines: Biological data (adapted from [13]). Dots mark peaks. We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC. Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a 4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage 178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region (resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies. These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data. 6 Conclusions We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that utilizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear ampliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors.

Responses become broader and show compressive growth. plemented in the log-domain, with Class AB operation, our silicon cochlea shows enhanced frequency responses, with compressive behavior around the CF, when ABC is turned on. These features are desirable in prosthetic applications and automatic speech recognition systems as they capture the properties of the biological cochlea. References [1] Lyon, R.F. & Mead, C.A.

<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: The classical Bayes rule computes the posterior model probability from the prior probability and the data likelihood. We generalize this rule to the case when the prior is a density matrix (symmetric positive deﬁnite and trace one) and the data likelihood a covariance matrix. The classical Bayes rule is retained as the special case when the matrices are diagonal. In the classical setting, the calculation of the probability of the data is an expected likelihood, where the expectation is over the prior distribution. In the generalized setting, this is replaced by an expected variance calculation where the variance is computed along the eigenvectors of the prior density matrix and the expectation is over the eigenvalues of the density matrix (which form a probability vector). The variances along any direction is determined by the covariance matrix. Curiously enough this expected variance calculation is a quantum measurement where the co-variance matrix speciﬁes the instrument and the prior density matrix the mixture state of the particle. We motivate both the classical and the generalized Bayes rule with a minimum relative entropy principle, where the Kullbach-Leibler version gives the classical Bayes rule and Umegaki’s quantum relative entropy the new Bayes rule for density matrices. 1</p><p>4 0.12730536 <a title="192-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Predicting_EMG_Data_from_M1_Neurons_with_Variational_Bayesian_Least_Squares.html">155 nips-2005-Predicting EMG Data from M1 Neurons with Variational Bayesian Least Squares</a></p>
<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Aaron D'souza, Kenji Yamamoto, Toshinori Yoshioka, Donna Hoffman, Shinji Kakei, Lauren Sergio, John Kalaska, Mitsuo Kawato</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of projects in neuroscience requires the statistical analysis of high dimensional data sets, as, for instance, in predicting behavior from neural ﬁring or in operating artiﬁcial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Linear analysis techniques remain prevalent in such cases, but classical linear regression approaches are often numerically too fragile in high dimensions. In this paper, we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed with linear approaches from neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1). To achieve robust data analysis, we develop a full Bayesian approach to linear regression that automatically detects and excludes irrelevant features in the data, regularizing against overﬁtting. In comparison with ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, partial least squares, LASSO regression and a brute force combinatorial search for the most predictive input features in the data, we demonstrate that the new Bayesian method oﬀers a superior mixture of characteristics in terms of regularization against overﬁtting, computational eﬃciency and ease of use, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. As neuroscientiﬁc results, our analyses demonstrate that EMG data can be well predicted from M1 neurons, further opening the path for possible real-time interfaces between brains and machines. 1</p><p>5 0.10575856 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Infinite_latent_feature_models_and_the_Indian_buffet_process.html">98 nips-2005-Infinite latent feature models and the Indian buffet process</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Wen, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mechanism we proposed in which OHC motile forces, through the microanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the degree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes saturation of OHC forces. 1 Silicon Cochleae Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear micromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suffers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This parallel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3]. Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar membrane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling (ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism (ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Oval window organ of Corti BM Round window IHC RL A OHC PhP DC BM Basal @ Stereocilia i -1 i i+1 Apical B Figure 1: The inner ear.

Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior. 2 Active Bidirectional Coupling The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The movement of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved. We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process (PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP) is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1. Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk. In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between BM segments in the longitudinal direction.

Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts) are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h (cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall. Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 2 φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 2 denotes the Laplacian operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the x and y directions: Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y. The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion (with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows. ˙ ¨ Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S(x)δ(x) + β(x)δ(x) + M (x)δ(x), (1) where S(x) is the stiffness, β(x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂(φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂t is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density. The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by FOHC (x) = s0 tanh(αγS(x)δ(x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS(x)δ(x + d)/s0 ) , (2) where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level. We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP. 4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a 2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation. 4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level, the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10], we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of nMOS transistors. Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term): ˙ Iin = S(x) Imem dt + β(x)Imem + M (x)I˙mem , (3) where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn, Imem ˙ drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity, δ. The FOHC term is dealt with in Section 4.2. Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is τ1 Is s + Is τ2 Io s + Io Imem = −Iin + Io , = Iin − bIs , = Iin + Is − Io , (4) (5) (6) where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants τ1 and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as: Iin s2 = (b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 Imem . Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs: S(x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 , β(x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 , and M (x) = 1. Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathematical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to Half LPF ( ) + Iout- Iin+ Iout+ Iout Vq Iin+ Iin- C+ B Iin- A Iin+ + - - Iin- + + + C To neighbors Is- Is+ > + > + IT+ IT- + - + From neighbors Io- Io+ + + + + - - + + LPF Iout+ Iout- BM Imem+ Imem- Figure 3: Low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and second-order section circuit design.

It consists of two LPFs and connects to its neighbors through Is and IT . simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon area). 4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with Imem dt to obtain FOHC = rﬀ S(x)T Imem (x − d)dt − rfb S(x)T Imem (x + d)dt , where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, Imem (x − d)dt = −τ1f Isf and Imem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small. We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result: τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ). Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream neighbors of each segment.

A Architecture: Two diffusive grids with embedded BM circuits model the cochlea. B Detail. BM circuits exchange currents with their neighbors. 4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of BM is driven by the pressure difference across it. Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for the BM circuit. It is described by + − + − + − + − + − 2 τ (Iout − Iout )s + (Iout − Iout ) = Iin − Iin and τ Iout Iout s + Iout Iout = Iq , where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output current, and τ sets the time constant. Combining the common-mode constraint with the differential design equation yields the nodal equation for the positive path (the negative path has superscripts + and − swapped): + − + + + − 2 ˙+ C Vout = Iτ (Iin − Iin ) + (Iq /Iout − Iout ) /(Iout + Iout ). + This nodal equation suggests the half-LPF circuit shown in Figure 3A. Vout , the voltage on + the positive capacitor (C ), gates a pMOS transistor to produce the corresponding current + − − signal, Iout (Vout and Iout are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = CuT/κIτ (κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these subcircuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B). The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthesized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat /(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat. 4.4 Chip Architecture We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in 0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema. 5 Chip Measurements We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear positions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea [13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from 1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]). The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology (computed from [13]).

A Amplitude. B Phase. Dashed lines: Biological data (adapted from [13]). Dots mark peaks. We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC. Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a 4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage 178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region (resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies. These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data. 6 Conclusions We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that utilizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear ampliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors.

Responses become broader and show compressive growth. plemented in the log-domain, with Class AB operation, our silicon cochlea shows enhanced frequency responses, with compressive behavior around the CF, when ABC is turned on. These features are desirable in prosthetic applications and automatic speech recognition systems as they capture the properties of the biological cochlea. References [1] Lyon, R.F. & Mead, C.A.

<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: The classical Bayes rule computes the posterior model probability from the prior probability and the data likelihood. We generalize this rule to the case when the prior is a density matrix (symmetric positive deﬁnite and trace one) and the data likelihood a covariance matrix. The classical Bayes rule is retained as the special case when the matrices are diagonal. In the classical setting, the calculation of the probability of the data is an expected likelihood, where the expectation is over the prior distribution. In the generalized setting, this is replaced by an expected variance calculation where the variance is computed along the eigenvectors of the prior density matrix and the expectation is over the eigenvalues of the density matrix (which form a probability vector). The variances along any direction is determined by the covariance matrix. Curiously enough this expected variance calculation is a quantum measurement where the co-variance matrix speciﬁes the instrument and the prior density matrix the mixture state of the particle. We motivate both the classical and the generalized Bayes rule with a minimum relative entropy principle, where the Kullbach-Leibler version gives the classical Bayes rule and Umegaki’s quantum relative entropy the new Bayes rule for density matrices. 1</p><p>4 0.5182206 <a title="192-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Predicting_EMG_Data_from_M1_Neurons_with_Variational_Bayesian_Least_Squares.html">155 nips-2005-Predicting EMG Data from M1 Neurons with Variational Bayesian Least Squares</a></p>
<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Aaron D'souza, Kenji Yamamoto, Toshinori Yoshioka, Donna Hoffman, Shinji Kakei, Lauren Sergio, John Kalaska, Mitsuo Kawato</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of projects in neuroscience requires the statistical analysis of high dimensional data sets, as, for instance, in predicting behavior from neural ﬁring or in operating artiﬁcial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Linear analysis techniques remain prevalent in such cases, but classical linear regression approaches are often numerically too fragile in high dimensions. In this paper, we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed with linear approaches from neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1). To achieve robust data analysis, we develop a full Bayesian approach to linear regression that automatically detects and excludes irrelevant features in the data, regularizing against overﬁtting. In comparison with ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, partial least squares, LASSO regression and a brute force combinatorial search for the most predictive input features in the data, we demonstrate that the new Bayesian method oﬀers a superior mixture of characteristics in terms of regularization against overﬁtting, computational eﬃciency and ease of use, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. As neuroscientiﬁc results, our analyses demonstrate that EMG data can be well predicted from M1 neurons, further opening the path for possible real-time interfaces between brains and machines. 1</p><p>5 0.42309016 <a title="192-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Fusion_of_Similarity_Data_in_Clustering.html">79 nips-2005-Fusion of Similarity Data in Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Fusing multiple information sources can yield signiﬁcant beneﬁts to successfully accomplish learning tasks. Many studies have focussed on fusing information in supervised learning contexts. We present an approach to utilize multiple information sources in the form of similarity data for unsupervised learning. Based on similarity information, the clustering task is phrased as a non-negative matrix factorization problem of a mixture of similarity measurements. The tradeoff between the informativeness of data sources and the sparseness of their mixture is controlled by an entropy-based weighting mechanism. For the purpose of model selection, a stability-based approach is employed to ensure the selection of the most self-consistent hypothesis. The experiments demonstrate the performance of the method on toy as well as real world data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.41593125 <a title="192-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Infinite_latent_feature_models_and_the_Indian_buffet_process.html">98 nips-2005-Infinite latent feature models and the Indian buffet process</a></p>

<p>Author: Brigham S. Anderson, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Calculations that quantify the dependencies between variables are vital to many operations with graphical models, e.g., active learning and sensitivity analysis. Previously, pairwise information gain calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size. In this work, we show how to perform a similar computation with cost linear in network size. The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming. The message-passing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy. In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.93366498 <a title="192-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-The_Information-Form_Data_Association_Filter.html">192 nips-2005-The Information-Form Data Association Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Brad Schumitsch, Sebastian Thrun, Gary Bradski, Kunle Olukotun</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new ﬁlter for online data association problems in high-dimensional spaces. The key innovation is a representation of the data association posterior in information form, in which the “proximity” of objects and tracks are expressed by numerical links. Updating these links requires linear time, compared to exponential time required for computing the exact posterior probabilities. The paper derives the algorithm formally and provides comparative results using data obtained by a real-world camera array and by a large-scale sensor network simulation.</p><p>3 0.92489451 <a title="192-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_Error_Bounds_for_Aggregation_by_Mirror_Descent_with_Averaging.html">82 nips-2005-Generalization Error Bounds for Aggregation by Mirror Descent with Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Anatoli Juditsky, Alexander Nazin, Alexandre Tsybakov, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing an aggregated estimator from a ﬁnite class of base functions which approximately minimizes a convex risk functional under the ℓ1 constraint. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic procedure, the mirror descent, which performs gradient descent in the dual space. The generated estimates are additionally averaged in a recursive fashion with speciﬁc weights. Mirror descent algorithms have been developed in different contexts and they are known to be particularly efﬁcient in high dimensional problems. Moreover their implementation is adapted to the online setting. The main result of the paper is the upper bound on the convergence rate for the generalization error. 1</p><p>4 0.5801397 <a title="192-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Inference_with_Minimal_Communication%3A_a_Decision-Theoretic_Variational_Approach.html">96 nips-2005-Inference with Minimal Communication: a Decision-Theoretic Variational Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: O. P. Kreidl, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graphical model with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach leads to a novel message-passing algorithm to be executed ofﬂine, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative examples, (ii) assumptions that guarantee convergence and efﬁciency and (iii) connections to active research areas. 1</p><p>5 0.56140679 <a title="192-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Online_Policy_Gradient_Learning_with_SMD_Gain_Vector_Adaptation.html">72 nips-2005-Fast Online Policy Gradient Learning with SMD Gain Vector Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jin Yu, Douglas Aberdeen, Nicol N. Schraudolph</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning by direct policy gradient estimation is attractive in theory but in practice leads to notoriously ill-behaved optimization problems. We improve its robustness and speed of convergence with stochastic meta-descent, a gain vector adaptation method that employs fast Hessian-vector products. In our experiments the resulting algorithms outperform previously employed online stochastic, ofﬂine conjugate, and natural policy gradient methods. 1</p><p>6 0.54450619 <a title="192-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Affine_Structure_From_Sound.html">20 nips-2005-Affine Structure From Sound</a></p>

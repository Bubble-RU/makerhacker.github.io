<p>Author: Rory Sayres, David Ress, Kalanit Grill-spector</p><p>Abstract: The category of visual stimuli has been reliably decoded from patterns of neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex [1]. It has yet to be seen whether object identity can be inferred from this activity. We present fMRI data measuring responses in human extrastriate cortex to a set of 12 distinct object images. We use a simple winner-take-all classifier, using half the data from each recording session as a training set, to evaluate encoding of object identity across fMRI voxels. Since this approach is sensitive to the inclusion of noisy voxels, we describe two methods for identifying subsets of voxels in the data which optimally distinguish object identity. One method characterizes the reliability of each voxel within subsets of the data, while another estimates the mutual information of each voxel with the stimulus set. We find that both metrics can identify subsets of the data which reliably encode object identity, even when noisy measurements are artificially added to the data. The mutual information metric is less efficient at this task, likely due to constraints in fMRI data. 1</p><p>3 0.14744478 <a title="130-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Analyzing_Coupled_Brain_Sources%3A_Distinguishing_True_from_Spurious_Interaction.html">29 nips-2005-Analyzing Coupled Brain Sources: Distinguishing True from Spurious Interaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Guido Nolte, Andreas Ziehe, Frank Meinecke, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When trying to understand the brain, it is of fundamental importance to analyse (e.g. from EEG/MEG measurements) what parts of the cortex interact with each other in order to infer more accurate models of brain activity. Common techniques like Blind Source Separation (BSS) can estimate brain sources and single out artifacts by using the underlying assumption of source signal independence. However, physiologically interesting brain sources typically interact, so BSS will—by construction— fail to characterize them properly. Noting that there are truly interacting sources and signals that only seemingly interact due to effects of volume conduction, this work aims to contribute by distinguishing these effects. For this a new BSS technique is proposed that uses anti-symmetrized cross-correlation matrices and subsequent diagonalization. The resulting decomposition consists of the truly interacting brain sources and suppresses any spurious interaction stemming from volume conduction. Our new concept of interacting source analysis (ISA) is successfully demonstrated on MEG data. 1</p><p>4 0.10582141 <a title="130-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-On_Local_Rewards_and_Scaling_Distributed_Reinforcement_Learning.html">145 nips-2005-On Local Rewards and Scaling Distributed Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Drew Bagnell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the scaling of the number of examples necessary to achieve good performance in distributed, cooperative, multi-agent reinforcement learning, as a function of the the number of agents n. We prove a worstcase lower bound showing that algorithms that rely solely on a global reward signal to learn policies confront a fundamental limit: They require a number of real-world examples that scales roughly linearly in the number of agents. For settings of interest with a very large number of agents, this is impractical. We demonstrate, however, that there is a class of algorithms that, by taking advantage of local reward signals in large distributed Markov Decision Processes, are able to ensure good performance with a number of samples that scales as O(log n). This makes them applicable even in settings with a very large number of agents n. 1</p><p>5 0.091574945 <a title="130-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Principles_of_real-time_computing_with_feedback_applied_to_cortical_microcircuit_models.html">157 nips-2005-Principles of real-time computing with feedback applied to cortical microcircuit models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Prashant Joshi, Eduardo D. Sontag</p><p>Abstract: The network topology of neurons in the brain exhibits an abundance of feedback connections, but the computational function of these feedback connections is largely unknown. We present a computational theory that characterizes the gain in computational power achieved through feedback in dynamical systems with fading memory. It implies that many such systems acquire through feedback universal computational capabilities for analog computing with a non-fading memory. In particular, we show that feedback enables such systems to process time-varying input streams in diverse ways according to rules that are implemented through internal states of the dynamical system. In contrast to previous attractor-based computational models for neural networks, these ﬂexible internal states are high-dimensional attractors of the circuit dynamics, that still allow the circuit state to absorb new information from online input streams. In this way one arrives at novel models for working memory, integration of evidence, and reward expectation in cortical circuits. We show that they are applicable to circuits of conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with high levels of noise that reﬂect experimental data on invivo conditions. 1</p><p>6 0.091388591 <a title="130-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Extracting_Dynamical_Structure_Embedded_in_Neural_Activity.html">67 nips-2005-Extracting Dynamical Structure Embedded in Neural Activity</a></p>

The proposed model is a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with a two-level structure: individual-level and group-level. Individual level models actions of each player, and the group-level models actions of the team as a whole. Experiments on synthetic multi-player games and a multi-party meeting corpus show the effectiveness of the proposed model. 1</p><p>5 0.37649778 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Stimulus_Evoked_Independent_Factor_Analysis_of_MEG_Data_with_Large_Background_Activity.html">183 nips-2005-Stimulus Evoked Independent Factor Analysis of MEG Data with Large Background Activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenneth Hild, Kensuke Sekihara, Hagai T. Attias, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for analyzing electromagnetic imaging data obtained using the stimulus evoked experimental paradigm. The technique is based on a probabilistic graphical model, which describes the data in terms of underlying evoked and interference sources, and explicitly models the stimulus evoked paradigm. A variational Bayesian EM algorithm infers the model from data, suppresses interference sources, and reconstructs the activity of separated individual brain sources. The new algorithm outperforms existing techniques on two real datasets, as well as on simulated data. 1</p><p>6 0.36932275 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Principles_of_real-time_computing_with_feedback_applied_to_cortical_microcircuit_models.html">157 nips-2005-Principles of real-time computing with feedback applied to cortical microcircuit models</a></p>

This ﬁnding provides an independent test for the effect of psychopathology on brain function. In general, we demonstrate that incorporation of computer science principles into functional neuroimaging clinical studies provides a novel approach for probing human brain function.</p><p>2 0.67750168 <a title="130-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Affine_Structure_From_Sound.html">20 nips-2005-Affine Structure From Sound</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing a set of microphones together with a set of external acoustic events (e.g., hand claps), emitted at unknown times and unknown locations. We propose a solution that approximates this problem under a far ﬁeld approximation deﬁned in the calculus of afﬁne geometry, and that relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the afﬁne structure of the problem. We then deﬁne low-dimensional optimization techniques for embedding the solution into Euclidean geometry, and further techniques for recovering the locations and emission times of the acoustic events. The approach is useful for the calibration of ad-hoc microphone arrays and sensor networks. 1</p><p>3 0.52027267 <a title="130-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Glenn Fung, Rómer Rosales, Balaji Krishnapuram</p><p>Abstract: We propose efﬁcient algorithms for learning ranking functions from order constraints between sets—i.e. classes—of training samples. Our algorithms may be used for maximizing the generalized Wilcoxon Mann Whitney statistic that accounts for the partial ordering of the classes: special cases include maximizing the area under the ROC curve for binary classiﬁcation and its generalization for ordinal regression. Experiments on public benchmarks indicate that: (a) the proposed algorithm is at least as accurate as the current state-of-the-art; (b) computationally, it is several orders of magnitude faster and—unlike current methods—it is easily able to handle even large datasets with over 20,000 samples. 1</p><p>4 0.51417935 <a title="130-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-A_Connectionist_Model_for_Constructive_Modal_Reasoning.html">6 nips-2005-A Connectionist Model for Constructive Modal Reasoning</a></p>
<p>Author: Artur Garcez, Luis C. Lamb, Dov M. Gabbay</p><p>Abstract: We present a new connectionist model for constructive, intuitionistic modal reasoning. We use ensembles of neural networks to represent intuitionistic modal theories, and show that for each intuitionistic modal program there exists a corresponding neural network ensemble that computes the program. This provides a massively parallel model for intuitionistic modal reasoning, and sets the scene for integrated reasoning, knowledge representation, and learning of intuitionistic theories in neural networks, since the networks in the ensemble can be trained by examples using standard neural learning algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.51204705 <a title="130-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Information_Value_for_Graphical_Models.html">70 nips-2005-Fast Information Value for Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Brigham S. Anderson, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Calculations that quantify the dependencies between variables are vital to many operations with graphical models, e.g., active learning and sensitivity analysis. Previously, pairwise information gain calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size. In this work, we show how to perform a similar computation with cost linear in network size. The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming. The message-passing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy. In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.</p><p>6 0.50685352 <a title="130-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Message_passing_for_task_redistribution_on_sparse_graphs.html">125 nips-2005-Message passing for task redistribution on sparse graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Verma, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: Humans are extremely adept at learning new skills by imitating the actions of others. A progression of imitative abilities has been observed in children, ranging from imitation of simple body movements to goalbased imitation based on inferring intent. In this paper, we show that the problem of goal-based imitation can be formulated as one of inferring goals and selecting actions using a learned probabilistic graphical model of the environment. We ﬁrst describe algorithms for planning actions to achieve a goal state using probabilistic inference. We then describe how planning can be used to bootstrap the learning of goal-dependent policies by utilizing feedback from the environment. The resulting graphical model is then shown to be powerful enough to allow goal-based imitation. Using a simple maze navigation task, we illustrate how an agent can infer the goals of an observed teacher and imitate the teacher even when the goals are uncertain and the demonstration is incomplete.</p><p>3 0.20937961 <a title="115-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Models.html">80 nips-2005-Gaussian Process Dynamical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jack Wang, Aaron Hertzmann, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (GPDM) for nonlinear time series analysis. A GPDM comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dynamics, and a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed-form, using Gaussian Process (GP) priors for both the dynamics and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We demonstrate the approach on human motion capture data in which each pose is 62-dimensional. Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.

The system is trained from end to end to map raw input images to steering angles.

<p>Author: Tao Geng, Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our design and experiments of a planar biped robot (“RunBot”) under pure reﬂexive neuronal control. The goal of this study is to combine neuronal mechanisms with biomechanics to obtain very fast speed and the on-line learning of circuit parameters. Our controller is built with biologically inspired sensor- and motor-neuron models, including local reﬂexes and not employing any kind of position or trajectory-tracking control algorithm. Instead, this reﬂexive controller allows RunBot to exploit its own natural dynamics during critical stages of its walking gait cycle. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dynamic biped walking is achieved using only a pure reﬂexive controller. In addition, this structure allows using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to tune the parameters of the reﬂexive controller in real-time during walking. This way RunBot can reach a relative speed of 3.5 leg-lengths per second after a few minutes of online learning, which is faster than that of any other biped robot, and is also comparable to the fastest relative speed of human walking. In addition, the stability domain of stable walking is quite large supporting this design strategy. 1</p><p>6 0.49750179 <a title="115-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Bayesian_model_learning_in_human_visual_perception.html">35 nips-2005-Bayesian model learning in human visual perception</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Suzuki, Hideki Isozaki</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to feature selection based on a statistical feature mining technique for sequence and tree kernels. Since natural language data take discrete structures, convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are advantageous for both the concept and accuracy of many natural language processing tasks. However, experiments have shown that the best results can only be achieved when limited small sub-structures are dealt with by these kernels. This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels and then proposes a statistical feature selection that enable us to use larger sub-structures effectively. The proposed method, in order to execute efﬁciently, can be embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments on real NLP tasks conﬁrm the problem in the conventional method and compare the performance of a conventional method to that of the proposed method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91435695 <a title="115-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Shared_Latent_Structure_for_Image_Synthesis_and_Robotic_Imitation.html">115 nips-2005-Learning Shared Latent Structure for Image Synthesis and Robotic Imitation</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Mark Herbster, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: A foundational problem in semi-supervised learning is the construction of a graph underlying the data. We propose to use a method which optimally combines a number of differently constructed graphs. For each of these graphs we associate a basic graph kernel. We then compute an optimal combined kernel. This kernel solves an extended regularization problem which requires a joint minimization over both the data and the set of graph kernels. We present encouraging results on different OCR tasks where the optimal combined kernel is computed from graphs constructed with a variety of distances functions and the ‘k’ in nearest neighbors. 1</p><p>4 0.85757303 <a title="115-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Consensus_Propagation.html">46 nips-2005-Consensus Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy, Ciamac C. Moallemi</p><p>Abstract: We propose consensus propagation, an asynchronous distributed protocol for averaging numbers across a network. We establish convergence, characterize the convergence rate for regular graphs, and demonstrate that the protocol exhibits better scaling properties than pairwise averaging, an alternative that has received much recent attention. Consensus propagation can be viewed as a special case of belief propagation, and our results contribute to the belief propagation literature. In particular, beyond singly-connected graphs, there are very few classes of relevant problems for which belief propagation is known to converge. 1</p><p>5 0.69312966 <a title="115-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-From_Lasso_regression_to_Feature_vector_machine.html">77 nips-2005-From Lasso regression to Feature vector machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Li, Yiming Yang, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Lasso regression tends to assign zero weights to most irrelevant or redundant features, and hence is a promising technique for feature selection. Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels deﬁned on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.</p><p>6 0.66744071 <a title="115-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Laplacian_Score_for_Feature_Selection.html">104 nips-2005-Laplacian Score for Feature Selection</a></p>

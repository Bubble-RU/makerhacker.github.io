<p>Author: David Barber, Felix V. Agakov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple information-theoretic approach to soft clustering based on maximizing the mutual information I(x, y) between the unknown cluster labels y and the training patterns x with respect to parameters of speciﬁcally constrained encoding distributions. The constraints are chosen such that patterns are likely to be clustered similarly if they lie close to speciﬁc unknown vectors in the feature space. The method may be conveniently applied to learning the optimal aﬃnity matrix, which corresponds to learning parameters of the kernelized encoder. The procedure does not require computations of eigenvalues of the Gram matrices, which makes it potentially attractive for clustering large data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.14760016 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Q-Clustering.html">159 nips-2005-Q-Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Mukund Narasimhan, Nebojsa Jojic, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We show that Queyranne’s algorithm for minimizing symmetric submodular functions can be used for clustering with a variety of different objective functions. Two speciﬁc criteria that we consider in this paper are the single linkage and the minimum description length criteria. The ﬁrst criterion tries to maximize the minimum distance between elements of different clusters, and is inherently “discriminative”. It is known that optimal clusterings into k clusters for any given k in polynomial time for this criterion can be computed. The second criterion seeks to minimize the description length of the clusters given a probabilistic generative model. We show that the optimal partitioning into 2 clusters, and approximate partitioning (guaranteed to be within a factor of 2 of the the optimal) for more clusters can be computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a tractable algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal clustering with respect to the MDL criterion for 2 clusters has been given. Besides the optimality result for the MDL criterion, the chief contribution of this paper is to show that the same algorithm can be used to optimize a broad class of criteria, and hence can be used for many application speciﬁc criterion for which efﬁcient algorithm are not known.</p><p>4 0.1382802 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Approach_for_Optimizing_Spectral_Clustering.html">13 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Approach for Optimizing Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Rong Jin, Feng Kang, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering enjoys its success in both data clustering and semisupervised learning. But, most spectral clustering algorithms cannot handle multi-class clustering problems directly. Additional strategies are needed to extend spectral clustering algorithms to multi-class clustering problems. Furthermore, most spectral clustering algorithms employ hard cluster membership, which is likely to be trapped by the local optimum. In this paper, we present a new spectral clustering algorithm, named “Soft Cut”. It improves the normalized cut algorithm by introducing soft membership, and can be efﬁciently computed using a bound optimization algorithm. Our experiments with a variety of datasets have shown the promising performance of the proposed clustering algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.12564869 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>

Unlike usual similarity-based methods, the approach softly assigns data to clusters in a probabilistic way. More importantly, a hierarchical clustering is naturally derived in this framework to gradually merge lower-level clusters into higher-level ones. A random walk analysis indicates that the algorithm exposes clustering structures in various resolutions, i.e., a higher level statistically models a longer-term diffusion on graphs and thus discovers a more global clustering structure. Finally we provide very encouraging experimental results. 1</p><p>6 0.09394259 <a title="84-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Bayesian_Sets.html">33 nips-2005-Bayesian Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Delbert Dueck</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has been approached in many ways. Two general and quite different approaches include iteratively ﬁtting a mixture model (e.g., using EM) and linking together pairs of training cases that have high afﬁnity (e.g., using spectral methods). Pair-wise clustering algorithms need not compute sufﬁcient statistics and avoid poor solutions by directly placing similar examples in the same cluster. However, many applications require that each cluster of data be accurately described by a prototype or model, so afﬁnity-based clustering – and its beneﬁts – cannot be directly realized. We describe a technique called “afﬁnity propagation”, which combines the advantages of both approaches. The method learns a mixture model of the data by recursively propagating afﬁnity messages. We demonstrate afﬁnity propagation on the problems of clustering image patches for image segmentation and learning mixtures of gene expression models from microarray data. We ﬁnd that afﬁnity propagation obtains better solutions than mixtures of Gaussians, the K-medoids algorithm, spectral clustering and hierarchical clustering, and is both able to ﬁnd a pre-speciﬁed number of clusters and is able to automatically determine the number of clusters. Interestingly, afﬁnity propagation can be viewed as belief propagation in a graphical model that accounts for pairwise training case likelihood functions and the identiﬁcation of cluster centers. 1</p><p>6 0.58186257 <a title="84-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Approach_for_Optimizing_Spectral_Clustering.html">13 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Approach for Optimizing Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Afsheen Afshar, Gopal Santhanam, Stephen I. Ryu, Maneesh Sahani, Byron M. Yu, Krishna V. Shenoy</p><p>Abstract: Spiking activity from neurophysiological experiments often exhibits dynamics beyond that driven by external stimulation, presumably reﬂecting the extensive recurrence of neural circuitry. Characterizing these dynamics may reveal important features of neural computation, particularly during internally-driven cognitive operations. For example, the activity of premotor cortex (PMd) neurons during an instructed delay period separating movement-target speciﬁcation and a movementinitiation cue is believed to be involved in motor planning. We show that the dynamics underlying this activity can be captured by a lowdimensional non-linear dynamical systems model, with underlying recurrent structure and stochastic point-process output. We present and validate latent variable methods that simultaneously estimate the system parameters and the trial-by-trial dynamical trajectories. These methods are applied to characterize the dynamics in PMd data recorded from a chronically-implanted 96-electrode array while monkeys perform delayed-reach tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.54103929 <a title="84-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Active_Learning_for_Misspecified_Models.html">19 nips-2005-Active Learning for Misspecified Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Active learning is the problem in supervised learning to design the locations of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. Existing active learning methods often assume that the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function can be expressed by the model at hand. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulﬁlled. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can be theoretically justiﬁed under slightly weaker condition: the model does not have to be correctly speciﬁed, but slightly misspeciﬁed models are also allowed. However, it turns out that the weakened condition is still restrictive in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose an alternative active learning method which can be theoretically justiﬁed for a wider class of misspeciﬁed models. Thus, the proposed method has a broader range of applications than the existing method. Numerical studies show that the proposed active learning method is robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and is thus reliable. 1 Introduction and Problem Formulation Let us discuss the regression problem of learning a real-valued function Ê from training examples ´Ü Ý µ ´Ü µ · ¯ Ý Ò ´Üµ deﬁned on ½ where ¯ Ò ½ are i.i.d. noise with mean zero and unknown variance ¾. We use the following linear regression model for learning. ´Ü µ ´µ Ô ½ « ³ ´Ü µ where ³ Ü Ô ½ are ﬁxed linearly independent functions and are parameters to be learned. ´ µ « ´«½ «¾ « Ô µ We evaluate the goodness of the learned function Ü by the expected squared test error over test input points and noise (i.e., the generalization error). When the test input points are drawn independently from a distribution with density ÔØ Ü , the generalization error is expressed as ´ µ ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø where ¯ denotes the expectation over the noise ¯ Ò Ô ´Üµ is known1. ½. In the following, we suppose that Ø In a standard setting of regression, the training input points are provided from the environment, i.e., Ü Ò ½ independently follow the distribution with density ÔØ Ü . On the other hand, in some cases, the training input points can be designed by users. In such cases, it is expected that the accuracy of the learning result can be improved if the training input points are chosen appropriately, e.g., by densely locating training input points in the regions of high uncertainty. ´ µ Active learning—also referred to as experimental design—is the problem of optimizing the location of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. In active learning research, it is often assumed that the regression model is correctly speciﬁed [2, 1, 3], i.e., the learning target function Ü can be expressed by the model. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. ´ µ In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can still be theoretically justiﬁed when the model is approximately correct in a strong sense. Then we propose an alternative active learning method which can also be theoretically justiﬁed for approximately correct models, but the condition on the approximate correctness of the models is weaker than that for the existing method. Thus, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. In the following, we suppose that the training input points Ü Ò ½ are independently drawn from a user-deﬁned distribution with density ÔÜ Ü , and discuss the problem of ﬁnding the optimal density function. ´µ 2 Existing Active Learning Method The generalization error deﬁned by Eq.(1) can be decomposed as ·Î is the (squared) bias term and Î is the variance term given by where ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø Î and ¯ ´Üµ   ¯ ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø A standard way to learn the parameters in the regression model (1) is the ordinary leastsquares learning, i.e., parameter vector « is determined as follows. « ÇÄË It is known that «ÇÄË is given by Ö« Ò Ñ « ÇÄË where Ä ÇÄË ´ µ ½ Ò ´Ü µ   Ý ½ Ä ÇÄË ³ ´Ü µ ¾ Ý and Ý ´Ý½ Ý¾ Ý Ò µ Let ÇÄË , ÇÄË and ÎÇÄË be , and Î for the learned function obtained by the ordinary least-squares learning, respectively. Then the following proposition holds. 1 In some application domains such as web page analysis or bioinformatics, a large number of unlabeled samples—input points without output values independently drawn from the distribution with density ÔØ ´Üµ—are easily gathered. In such cases, a reasonably good estimate of ÔØ ´Üµ may be obtained by some standard density estimation method. Therefore, the assumption that ÔØ ´Üµ is known may not be so restrictive.

However, for misspeciﬁed models, «ÇÄË is generally biased even asymptotically if Æ ÇÔ . ´½µ The bias of «ÇÄË is actually caused by the covariate shift [5]—the training input density ÔÜ Ü is different from the test input density ÔØ Ü . For correctly speciﬁed models, inﬂuence of the covariate shift can be ignored, as the existing active learning method does. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we should explicitly cope with the covariate shift. ´µ ´ µ Under the covariate shift, it is known that the following weighted least-squares learning is [5]. asymptotically unbiased even if Æ ÇÔ ´½µ Ô ´Ü µ Ô ´Ü µ ½ Ò Ö« Ò Ñ « Ï ÄË ¾ ´Ü µ   Ý Ø Ü Asymptotic unbiasedness of «Ï ÄË would be intuitively understood by the following identity, which is similar in spirit to importance sampling: ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Ü µ Ü ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ø ´µ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ô ´Ü µ Ü Ô ´Üµ Ø Ü Ü In the following, we assume that ÔÜ Ü is strictly positive for all Ü.

Therefore, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. The effect of this extension is experimentally investigated in the next section. ´ 5 µ Numerical Examples We evaluate the usefulness of the proposed active learning method through experiments.

Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation and ¯ . Let ÔØ Ü ½ be the Gaussian density with mean and standard deviation , which is assumed to be known here. Let Ô and the basis functions be ³ Ü Ü  ½ for . Let us consider the following three cases. Æ , where each case corresponds to “correctly speciﬁed”, “approximately correct”, and “misspeciﬁed” (see Figure 1). We choose the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the Gaussian density with mean and standard , where deviation ¼¾ ¿ ´µ ¼  ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼ ½¼ ´µ ¼ ¼¿ ½¾¿ ¼¾ ¾ We compare the accuracy of the following three methods: (A) Proposed active learning criterion + WLS learning : The training input density is determined so that ÂÏ ÄË is minimized. Following the determined input density, training input points Ü ½¼¼ are created and corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼ ½ ½ are observed. Then WLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (B) Existing active learning criterion + OLS learning [2, 1, 3]: The training input density is determined so that ÂÇÄË is minimized. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (C) Passive learning + OLS learning: The test input density ÔØ Ü is used as the training input density. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. ´ µ First, we evaluate the accuracy of ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË as approximations of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . The means and standard deviations of Ï ÄË , ÂÏ ÄË , ÇÄË , and ÂÇÄË over runs are (“correctly depicted as functions of  in Figure 2. These graphs show that when Æ speciﬁed”), both ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË give accurate estimates of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . When Æ (“approximately correct”), ÂÏ ÄË again works well, while ÂÇÄË tends to be negatively biased for large . This result is surprising since as illustrated in Figure 1, the learning target functions with Æ and Æ are visually quite similar. Therefore, it intuitively seems that the result of Æ is not much different from that of Æ . However, the simulation result shows that this slight difference makes ÂÇÄË unreliable. (“misspeciﬁed”), ÂÏ ÄË is still reasonably accurate, while ÂÇÄË is heavily When Æ biased. ½¼¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼¼ ¼ These results show that as an approximation of the generalization error, ÂÏ ÄË is more robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models than ÂÇÄË , which is in good agreement with the theoretical analyses given in Section 3 and Section 4.

When Æ , the existing method (B) works better than the proposed method (A). Actually, in this case, training input densities that approximately minimize Ï ÄË and ÇÄË were found by ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË . Therefore, the difference of the errors is caused by the difference of WLS and OLS: WLS generally has larger variance than OLS. Since bias is zero for both WLS and OLS if Æ , OLS would be more accurate than WLS. Although the proposed method (A) is outperformed by the existing method (B), it still works better than the passive learning scheme (C). When Æ and Æ the proposed method (A) gives signiﬁcantly smaller errors than other methods. ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ Overall, we found that for all three cases, the proposed method (A) works reasonably well and outperforms the passive learning scheme (C). On the other hand, the existing method (B) works excellently in the correctly speciﬁed case, although it tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is found to be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable.

For each run, the test errors of (A) and (B) are normalized by the test error of (C), and then the values are averaged over runs. Note that the error bars were reasonably small so they were omitted. ½¼¼ Realistic Data Set: Here we use eight practical data sets provided by DELVE [4]: Bank8fm, Bank-8fh, Bank-8nm, Bank-8nh, Kin-8fm, Kin-8fh, Kin-8nm, and Kin-8nh. Each data set includes samples, consisting of -dimensional input and -dimensional output values. For convenience, every attribute is normalized into . ½¾ ¼ ½℄ ½¾ ½ Suppose we are given all input points (i.e., unlabeled samples). Note that output values are unknown. From the pool of unlabeled samples, we choose Ò input points Ü ½¼¼¼ for training and observe the corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼¼. The ½ ½ task is to predict the output values of all unlabeled samples. ½¼¼¼ In this experiment, the test input density independent Gaussian density. Ô ´Üµ and ­ Ø ´¾ ­¾ ÅÄ Ô ´Üµ is unknown. Ø µ  ÜÔ    Ü   ¾ ÅÄ So we estimate it using the ¾ ´¾­¾ µ¡ ÅÄ where Å Ä are the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and standard ÅÄ and the basis functions be deviation obtained from all unlabeled samples. Let Ô where Ø ³ ´Üµ ¼ ½   ÜÔ   Ü   Ø ¾ ¡ ¾ ¼ for ½¾ ¼ are template points randomly chosen from the pool of unlabeled samples. ´µ We select the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the independent Gaussian density with mean Å Ä and standard deviation ­Å Ä , where  ¼ ¼ ¼ ¾ In this simulation, we can not create the training input points in an arbitrary location because we only have samples. Therefore, we ﬁrst create temporary input points following the determined training input density, and then choose the input points from the pool of unlabeled samples that are closest to the temporary input points. For each data set, we repeat this simulation times, by changing the template points Ø ¼ ½ in each run. ½¾ ½¼¼ ½¼¼ The means and standard deviations of the test error over runs are described in Table 2. The proposed method (A) outperforms the existing method (B) for ﬁve data sets, while it is outperformed by (B) for the other three data sets. We conjecture that the model used for learning is almost correct in these three data sets. This result implies that the proposed method (A) is slightly better than the existing method (B). Figure 3 depicts the relative performance of the proposed method (A) and the existing method (B) compared with the passive learning scheme (C). This shows that (A) outperforms (C) for all eight data sets, while (B) is comparable or is outperformed by (C) for ﬁve data sets. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is overall shown to work better than other schemes. 6 Conclusions We argued that active learning is essentially the situation under the covariate shift—the training input density is different from the test input density. When the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, the covariate shift does not matter. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we have to explicitly cope with the covariate shift. In this paper, we proposed a new active learning method based on the weighted least-squares learning. The numerical study showed that the existing method works better than the proposed method if model is correctly speciﬁed. However, the existing method tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. On the other hand, the proposed method overall worked reasonably well and it consistently outperformed the passive learning scheme. Therefore, the proposed method would be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable. The proposed method can be theoretically justiﬁed if the model is approximately correct in a weak sense. However, it is no longer valid for totally misspeciﬁed models. A natural future direction would be therefore to devise an active learning method which has theoretical guarantee with totally misspeciﬁed models. It is also important to notice that when the model is totally misspeciﬁed, even learning with optimal training input points would not be successful anyway. In such cases, it is of course important to carry out model selection. In active learning research—including the present paper, however, the location of training input points are designed for a single model at hand. That is, the model should have been chosen before performing active learning. Devising a method for simultaneously optimizing models and the location of training input points would be a more important and promising future direction.

<p>Author: Anatoli Juditsky, Alexander Nazin, Alexandre Tsybakov, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing an aggregated estimator from a ﬁnite class of base functions which approximately minimizes a convex risk functional under the ℓ1 constraint. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic procedure, the mirror descent, which performs gradient descent in the dual space. The generated estimates are additionally averaged in a recursive fashion with speciﬁc weights. Mirror descent algorithms have been developed in different contexts and they are known to be particularly efﬁcient in high dimensional problems. Moreover their implementation is adapted to the online setting.

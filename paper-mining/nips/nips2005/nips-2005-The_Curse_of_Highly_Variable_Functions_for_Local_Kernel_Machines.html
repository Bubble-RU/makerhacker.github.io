<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: To escape from the curse of dimensionality, we claim that one can learn non-local functions, in the sense that the value and shape of the learned function at x must be inferred using examples that may be far from x. With this objective, we present a non-local non-parametric density estimator. It builds upon previously proposed Gaussian mixture models with regularized covariance matrices to take into account the local shape of the manifold. It also builds upon recent work on non-local estimators of the tangent plane of a manifold, which are able to generalize in places with little training data, unlike traditional, local, non-parametric models.</p><p>3 0.21176101 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_to_Unseen_Cases.html">85 nips-2005-Generalization to Unseen Cases</a></p>
<p>Author: Teemu Roos, Peter Grünwald, Petri Myllymäki, Henry Tirri</p><p>Abstract: We analyze classiﬁcation error on unseen cases, i.e. cases that are different from those in the training set. Unlike standard generalization error, this off-training-set error may differ signiﬁcantly from the empirical error with high probability even with large sample sizes. We derive a datadependent bound on the difference between off-training-set and standard generalization error. Our result is based on a new bound on the missing mass, which for small samples is stronger than existing bounds based on Good-Turing estimators. As we demonstrate on UCI data-sets, our bound gives nontrivial generalization guarantees in many practical cases. In light of these results, we show that certain claims made in the No Free Lunch literature are overly pessimistic. 1</p><p>4 0.1825504 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Analysis_of_Spectral_Kernel_Design_based_Semi-supervised_Learning.html">27 nips-2005-Analysis of Spectral Kernel Design based Semi-supervised Learning</a></p>

This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance.

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Mark Herbster, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: A foundational problem in semi-supervised learning is the construction of a graph underlying the data. We propose to use a method which optimally combines a number of differently constructed graphs. For each of these graphs we associate a basic graph kernel. We then compute an optimal combined kernel. This kernel solves an extended regularization problem which requires a joint minimization over both the data and the set of graph kernels. We present encouraging results on different OCR tasks where the optimal combined kernel is computed from graphs constructed with a variety of distances functions and the ‘k’ in nearest neighbors. 1</p><p>6 0.13420354 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Maximum_Margin_Semi-Supervised_Learning_for_Structured_Variables.html">123 nips-2005-Maximum Margin Semi-Supervised Learning for Structured Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Jorge Silva, Jorge Marques, João Lemos</p><p>Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in learning non-linear manifold models to approximate high-dimensional data. Both for computational complexity reasons and for generalization capability, sparsity is a desired feature in such models. This usually means dimensionality reduction, which naturally implies estimating the intrinsic dimension, but it can also mean selecting a subset of the data to use as landmarks, which is especially important because many existing algorithms have quadratic complexity in the number of observations. This paper presents an algorithm for selecting landmarks, based on LASSO regression, which is well known to favor sparse approximations because it uses regularization with an l1 norm. As an added beneﬁt, a continuous manifold parameterization, based on the landmarks, is also found. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.52767366 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Computing_the_Solution_Path_for_the_Regularized_Support_Vector_Regression.html">44 nips-2005-Computing the Solution Path for the Regularized Support Vector Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Michele Rucci</p><p>Abstract: Under natural viewing conditions, small movements of the eye and body prevent the maintenance of a steady direction of gaze. It is known that stimuli tend to fade when they are stabilized on the retina for several seconds. However, it is unclear whether the physiological self-motion of the retinal image serves a visual purpose during the brief periods of natural visual ﬁxation. This study examines the impact of ﬁxational instability on the statistics of visual input to the retina and on the structure of neural activity in the early visual system. Fixational instability introduces ﬂuctuations in the retinal input signals that, in the presence of natural images, lack spatial correlations. These input ﬂuctuations strongly inﬂuence neural activity in a model of the LGN. They decorrelate cell responses, even if the contrast sensitivity functions of simulated cells are not perfectly tuned to counter-balance the power-law spectrum of natural images. A decorrelation of neural activity has been proposed to be beneﬁcial for discarding statistical redundancies in the input signals. Fixational instability might, therefore, contribute to establishing efﬁcient representations of natural stimuli. 1</p><p>3 0.74411225 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Query_by_Committee_Made_Real.html">160 nips-2005-Query by Committee Made Real</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Training a learning algorithm is a costly task. A major goal of active learning is to reduce this cost. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, KQBC, which is capable of actively learning large scale problems by using selective sampling. The algorithm overcomes the costly sampling step of the well known Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm by projecting onto a low dimensional space. KQBC also enables the use of kernels, providing a simple way of extending QBC to the non-linear scenario. Sampling the low dimension space is done using the hit and run random walk. We demonstrate the success of this novel algorithm by applying it to both artiﬁcial and a real world problems.</p><p>4 0.74218923 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees.html">69 nips-2005-Fast Gaussian Process Regression using KD-Trees</a></p>

Ng</p><p>Abstract: The computation required for Gaussian process regression with n training examples is about O(n3 ) during training and O(n) for each prediction. This makes Gaussian process regression too slow for large datasets. In this paper, we present a fast approximation method, based on kd-trees, that signiﬁcantly reduces both the prediction and the training times of Gaussian process regression.</p><p>5 0.73738277 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Walk-Sum_Interpretation_and_Analysis_of_Gaussian_Belief_Propagation.html">204 nips-2005-Walk-Sum Interpretation and Analysis of Gaussian Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Malioutov, Alan S. Willsky, Jason K. Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose correlations between variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlations. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. This perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and of its convergence in loopy graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.73253822 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Multiple_Instance_Boosting_for_Object_Detection.html">131 nips-2005-Multiple Instance Boosting for Object Detection</a></p>

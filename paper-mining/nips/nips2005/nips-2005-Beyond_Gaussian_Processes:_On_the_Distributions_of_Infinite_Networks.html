<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>3 0.17794365 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Convex_Neural_Networks.html">50 nips-2005-Convex Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Nicolas L. Roux, Pascal Vincent, Olivier Delalleau, Patrice Marcotte</p><p>Abstract: Convexity has recently received a lot of attention in the machine learning community, and the lack of convexity has been seen as a major disadvantage of many learning algorithms, such as multi-layer artiﬁcial neural networks. We show that training multi-layer neural networks in which the number of hidden units is learned can be viewed as a convex optimization problem. This problem involves an inﬁnite number of variables, but can be solved by incrementally inserting a hidden unit at a time, each time ﬁnding a linear classiﬁer that minimizes a weighted sum of errors. 1</p><p>4 0.16472502 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Topology_with_the_Generative_Gaussian_Graph_and_the_EM_Algorithm.html">116 nips-2005-Learning Topology with the Generative Gaussian Graph and the EM Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Michaël Aupetit</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of points and a set of prototypes representing them, how to create a graph of the prototypes whose topology accounts for that of the points? This problem had not yet been explored in the framework of statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose a generative model based on the Delaunay graph of the prototypes and the ExpectationMaximization algorithm to learn the parameters. This work is a ﬁrst step towards the construction of a topological model of a set of points grounded on statistics. 1 1.1</p><p>5 0.1619945 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple clustering framework on graphs encoding pairwise data similarities. Unlike usual similarity-based methods, the approach softly assigns data to clusters in a probabilistic way. More importantly, a hierarchical clustering is naturally derived in this framework to gradually merge lower-level clusters into higher-level ones. A random walk analysis indicates that the algorithm exposes clustering structures in various resolutions, i.e., a higher level statistically models a longer-term diffusion on graphs and thus discovers a more global clustering structure. Finally we provide very encouraging experimental results. 1</p><p>6 0.12474994 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Non-Local_Manifold_Parzen_Windows.html">138 nips-2005-Non-Local Manifold Parzen Windows</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We show that linear generalizations of Rescorla-Wagner can perform Maximum Likelihood estimation of the parameters of all generative models for causal reasoning. Our approach involves augmenting variables to deal with conjunctions of causes, similar to the agumented model of Rescorla. Our results involve genericity assumptions on the distributions of causes. If these assumptions are violated, for example for the Cheng causal power theory, then we show that a linear Rescorla-Wagner can estimate the parameters of the model up to a nonlinear transformtion. Moreover, a nonlinear Rescorla-Wagner is able to estimate the parameters directly to within arbitrary accuracy. Previous results can be used to determine convergence and to estimate convergence rates. 1</p><p>4 0.54490793 <a title="38-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Rodeo%3A_Sparse_Nonparametric_Regression_in_High_Dimensions.html">168 nips-2005-Rodeo: Sparse Nonparametric Regression in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Larry Wasserman, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for nonparametric regression that performs bandwidth selection and variable selection simultaneously. The approach is based on the technique of incrementally decreasing the bandwidth in directions where the gradient of the estimator with respect to bandwidth is large. When the unknown function satisﬁes a sparsity condition, our approach avoids the curse of dimensionality, achieving the optimal minimax rate of convergence, up to logarithmic factors, as if the relevant variables were known in advance. The method—called rodeo (regularization of derivative expectation operator)—conducts a sequence of hypothesis tests, and is easy to implement. A modiﬁed version that replaces hard with soft thresholding effectively solves a sequence of lasso problems. 1</p><p>5 0.51071715 <a title="38-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Convergence_and_Consistency_of_Regularized_Boosting_Algorithms_with_Stationary_B-Mixing_Observations.html">49 nips-2005-Convergence and Consistency of Regularized Boosting Algorithms with Stationary B-Mixing Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurelie C. Lozano, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study the statistical convergence and consistency of regularized Boosting methods, where the samples are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) but come from empirical processes of stationary β-mixing sequences. Utilizing a technique that constructs a sequence of independent blocks close in distribution to the original samples, we prove the consistency of the composite classiﬁers resulting from a regularization achieved by restricting the 1-norm of the base classiﬁers’ weights. When compared to the i.i.d. case, the nature of sampling manifests in the consistency result only through generalization of the original condition on the growth of the regularization parameter.</p><p>6 0.46732244 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Non-Local_Manifold_Parzen_Windows.html">138 nips-2005-Non-Local Manifold Parzen Windows</a></p>

This paper gives a rigorous proof of the statistical convergence of kernel CCA and a related method (NOCCO), which provides a theoretical justiﬁcation for these methods.

<p>Author: Daichi Mochihashi, Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: Long-distance language modeling is important not only in speech recognition and machine translation, but also in high-dimensional discrete sequence modeling in general. However, the problem of context length has almost been neglected so far and a na¨ve bag-of-words history has been ı employed in natural language processing. In contrast, in this paper we view topic shifts within a text as a latent stochastic process to give an explicit probabilistic generative model that has partial exchangeability. We propose an online inference algorithm using particle ﬁlters to recognize topic shifts to employ the most appropriate length of context automatically. Experiments on the BNC corpus showed consistent improvement over previous methods involving no chronological order. 1</p><p>3 0.74879956 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-Searching_for_Character_Models.html">171 nips-2005-Searching for Character Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Firas Hamze, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new sampling algorithm for approximating functions of variables representable as undirected graphical models of arbitrary connectivity with pairwise potentials, as well as for estimating the notoriously difﬁcult partition function of the graph. The algorithm ﬁts into the framework of sequential Monte Carlo methods rather than the more widely used MCMC, and relies on constructing a sequence of intermediate distributions which get closer to the desired one. While the idea of using “tempered” proposals is known, we construct a novel sequence of target distributions where, rather than dropping a global temperature parameter, we sequentially couple individual pairs of variables that are, initially, sampled exactly from a spanning tree of the variables. We present experimental results on inference and estimation of the partition function for sparse and densely-connected graphs.</p><p>6 0.62537271 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Convergence_and_Consistency_of_Regularized_Boosting_Algorithms_with_Stationary_B-Mixing_Observations.html">49 nips-2005-Convergence and Consistency of Regularized Boosting Algorithms with Stationary B-Mixing Observations</a></p>

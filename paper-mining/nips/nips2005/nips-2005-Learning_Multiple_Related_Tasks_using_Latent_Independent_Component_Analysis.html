</p><p>5 We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. [sent-8, score-0.112]
</p><p>6 Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising. [sent-9, score-0.094]
</p><p>7 1 Introduction An important problem in machine learning is how to generalize between multiple related tasks. [sent-10, score-0.202]
</p><p>8 For example, given a newswire story, predicting its subject categories as well as the regional categories of reported events based on the same input text is such a problem. [sent-13, score-0.345]
</p><p>9 Much attention in machine learning research has been placed on how to effectively learn multiple tasks, and many approaches have been proposed[1][2][3][4][5][6][10][11]. [sent-15, score-0.193]
</p><p>10 Existing approaches share the basic assumption that tasks are related to each other. [sent-16, score-0.532]
</p><p>11 Under this general assumption, it would be beneﬁcial to learn all tasks jointly and borrow information from each other rather than learn each task independently. [sent-17, score-0.596]
</p><p>12 Previous approaches can be roughly summarized based on how the “relatedness” among tasks is modeled, such as IID tasks[2], a Bayesian prior over tasks[2][6][11], linear mixing factors[5][10], rotation plus shrinkage[3] and structured regularization in kernel methods[4]. [sent-18, score-0.456]
</p><p>13 Like previous approaches, the basic assumption in this paper is that the multiple tasks are related to each other. [sent-19, score-0.58]
</p><p>14 Consider the case where there are K tasks and each task is a binary  classiﬁcation problem from the same input space (e. [sent-20, score-0.432]
</p><p>15 If we were to separately learn a classiﬁer, with parameters θ k for each task k, we would be ignoring relevant information from the other classiﬁers. [sent-23, score-0.162]
</p><p>16 The assumption that the tasks are related suggests that the θk for different tasks should be related to each other. [sent-24, score-0.839]
</p><p>17 In the multi-task learning context, the relatedness of multiple tasks can be explained by the fact that they share certain number of hidden, independent components. [sent-29, score-0.774]
</p><p>18 By controlling the model complexity in terms of those independent components we are able to achieve better generalization capability. [sent-30, score-0.168]
</p><p>19 Furthermore, by using distributions like Laplace we are able to enjoy a sparsity property, which makes the model both parsimonious and robust in terms of identifying the connections with independent sources. [sent-31, score-0.383]
</p><p>20 Our model can be combined with many popular classiﬁers, and as an indispensable part we present scalable algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation, with the later being able to solve high-dimensional tasks. [sent-32, score-0.269]
</p><p>21 Finally, being a probabilistic model it is always convenient to obtain probabilistic scores and conﬁdence which are very helpful in making statistical decisions. [sent-33, score-0.194]
</p><p>22 2 Latent Independent Component Analysis The model we propose for solving multiple related tasks, namely the Latent Independent Component Analysis (LICA) model, is a hierarchical Bayesian model based on the traditional Independent Component Analysis. [sent-35, score-0.237]
</p><p>23 ICA[9] is a promising technique from signal processing and designed to solve the blind source separation problem, whose goal is to extract independent sources given only observed data that are linear combinations of the unknown sources. [sent-36, score-0.439]
</p><p>24 ICA has been successfully applied to blind source separation problem and shows great potential in that area. [sent-37, score-0.111]
</p><p>25 With the help of non-Gaussianity and higher-order statistics it can correctly identify the independent sources, as opposed to technique like Factor Analysis which is only able to remove the correlation in the data due to the intrinsic Gaussian assumption in the corresponding model. [sent-38, score-0.302]
</p><p>26 Unlike the standard Independent Component Analysis where we use observed data to estimate the hidden sources, in LICA the “observed data” for ICA are actually task parameters. [sent-40, score-0.26]
</p><p>27 Consequently, they are latent and themselves need to be learned from the training data of each individual task. [sent-41, score-0.264]
</p><p>28 Below we give the precise deﬁnition of the probabilistic model for LICA. [sent-42, score-0.1]
</p><p>29 , θK to represent the model parameters of K tasks where θk ∈ RF ×1 can be thought as the parameter vector of the k-th individual task. [sent-46, score-0.474]
</p><p>30 This is essentially assuming that the hidden sources s are responsible for all the dependencies among θk ’s, and conditioned on them all θk ’s are independent. [sent-51, score-0.393]
</p><p>31 Generally speaking we can use any member of the exponential families as p(ek ), but in most situations the noise is taken to be a multivariate Gaussian which is convenient. [sent-52, score-0.126]
</p><p>32 1 Probabilistic Discriminative Classiﬁers One building block in the LICA is the probabilistic model for learning each individual task, and in this paper we focus on classiﬁcation tasks. [sent-55, score-0.199]
</p><p>33 We will use the following notation to describe a probabilistic discriminative classiﬁer for task k, and for notation simplicity we omit the task index k below. [sent-56, score-0.316]
</p><p>34 , (xN , yN )} where xi ∈ RF ×1 is the input data vector and yi ∈ {0, 1} is the binary class label, our goal is to seek a probabilistic classiﬁer whose prediction is based on the conditional probability p(y = 1|x) = f (x) ∈ [0, 1]. [sent-60, score-0.095]
</p><p>35 The output class label y can be thought as randomly generated from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter µ(θ T x), and the overall model can be summarized as follows: y ∼ B(µ(θT x )) i  i  t  µ(t)  =  p(z)dz  (2)  −∞  where B(. [sent-62, score-0.147]
</p><p>36 By changing the deﬁnition of random variable Z we are able to specialize the above model into a variety of popular learning methods. [sent-64, score-0.165]
</p><p>37 For example, when p(z) is standard logistic distribution we will get logistic regression classiﬁer; when p(z) is standard Gaussian we get the probit regression. [sent-65, score-0.44]
</p><p>38 In principle any member belonging to the above class of classiﬁers can be plugged in our LICA, or even generative classiﬁers like Naive Bayes. [sent-66, score-0.129]
</p><p>39 We take logistic regression as the basic classiﬁer, and this choice should not affect the main point in this paper. [sent-67, score-0.305]
</p><p>40 Also note that it is straightforward to extend the framework for regression tasks whose likelihood function yi ∼ N (θT xi , σ 2 ) can be solved by simple and efﬁcient algorithms. [sent-68, score-0.449]
</p><p>41 Finally we would like to point out that although shown in the graphical model that all training instances share the same input vector x, this is mainly for notation simplicity and there is indeed no such restriction in our model. [sent-69, score-0.286]
</p><p>42 This is convenient since in reality we may not be able to obtain all the task responses for the same training instance. [sent-70, score-0.266]
</p><p>43 3 Learning and Inference for LICA The basic idea of the inference algorithm for the LICA is to iteratively estimate the task parameters θk , hidden sources sk , and the mixing matrix Λ and noise covariance Ψ. [sent-71, score-0.901]
</p><p>44 Here we present two algorithms, one for the empirical Bayes method, and the other for point estimation which is more suitable for high-dimensional tasks. [sent-72, score-0.176]
</p><p>45 1 Empirical Bayes Method The graphical model shown in Figure 1 is an example of a hierarchical Bayesian model, where the upper levels of the hierarchy model the relation between the tasks. [sent-74, score-0.118]
</p><p>46 We can use an empirical Bayes approach and learn the parameters Ω = {Φ, Λ, Ψ} from the data while treating the variables Z = {θk , sk }K as hidden, random variables. [sent-75, score-0.511]
</p><p>47 To get around the k=1 unidentiﬁability caused by the interaction between Λ and s we assume Φ is of standard parametric form (e. [sent-76, score-0.154]
</p><p>48 The goal ˆ ˆ is to learn point estimators Λ and Ψ as well as obtain posterior distributions over hidden variables given training data. [sent-79, score-0.311]
</p><p>49 Furthermore, for classiﬁcation tasks the likelihood function p(y|x, θ) is typically non-exponential and thus exact calculation becomes intractable. [sent-81, score-0.33]
</p><p>50 E-step: Given the parameter Ωt−1 = {Λ, Ψ}t−1 from the (t − 1)-th step, compute the distribution of hidden variables given Ωt−1 and D: p(Z | Ωt−1 , D) 2. [sent-83, score-0.158]
</p><p>51 Essentially only the ﬁrst and second order 1 Here with a little abuse of notation we ignore the difference of discriminative and generative at the classiﬁer level and use p(D | θk ) to denote the likelihood in general. [sent-86, score-0.093]
</p><p>52 Solve the following Bayesian logistic regression (or other Bayesian classiﬁer): N  q(θ) ← arg max q(θ)  q(θ) log  N (θ; ΛE[s], Ψ) i=1 p(yi |θ, xi ) dθ q(θ)  3. [sent-90, score-0.338]
</p><p>53 Update q(s): q(s) arg max q(s) log ← q(s)  p(s) 1 − Tr Ψ−1 (E[θθT ]+ΛssT ΛT −2E[θ](Λs)T ) q(s) 2  ds  4. [sent-91, score-0.133]
</p><p>54 The central idea is to lower bound the log-likelihood using Jensen’s inequality: log p(D) = log p(D, Z)dZ ≥ q(Z) log p(D,Z) dZ. [sent-96, score-0.204]
</p><p>55 Since given Ω the K tasks are decoupled, we can conduct inference for each task respectively. [sent-98, score-0.432]
</p><p>56 We further assume q(θ k , sk ) = q(θk )q(sk ), which in general is a reasonable simplifying assumption and allows us to do the optimization iteratively. [sent-99, score-0.347]
</p><p>57 First, we assume the form of q(θ) to be multivariate Gaussian, which is a reasonable choice especially considering the fact that only the ﬁrst and second moments are needed in the M-step. [sent-102, score-0.115]
</p><p>58 Finally, we take the parametric form of q(s) to be the product of Laplace distributions with unit variance but known mean, where the ﬁxed variance is intended to remove the unidentiﬁability issue caused by the interaction between scales of s and Λ. [sent-106, score-0.152]
</p><p>59 1 Variational Method for Bayesian Logistic Regression We present an efﬁcient algorithm based on the variational method proposed in[7] to solve step 2 in Algorithm 1, which is guaranteed to converge and known to be efﬁcient for this problem. [sent-111, score-0.102]
</p><p>60 Taking one data point (x, y) as an example, the basic idea is to use an exponential function to approximate the non-exponential likelihood function p(y|x, θ) = (1 + exp(−yθ T x))−1 which in turn makes the Bayes formula tractable. [sent-116, score-0.137]
</p><p>61 2  Again we omit the task index k and use y ∈ {−1, 1} instead of y ∈ {0, 1} to simplify notation. [sent-117, score-0.102]
</p><p>62 By using the inequality p(y|x, θ) ≥ g(ξ) exp (yxT θ − ξ)/2 − λ(ξ)((xT θ)2 − ξ 2 ) = p(y|x, θ, ξ) where g(z) = 1/(1 + exp(−z)) is the logistic function and λ(ξ) = tanh(ξ/2)/4ξ, we can maximize the lower bound of p(y|x) = p(θ)p(y|x, θ)dθ ≥ p(θ)p(y|x, θ, ξ)dθ. [sent-118, score-0.121]
</p><p>63 2 Point Estimation Although the empirical Bayes method is efﬁcient for medium-sized problem, both its computational cost and memory requirement grow as the number of data instances or features increases. [sent-122, score-0.175]
</p><p>64 For example, it can easily happen in text or image domain where the number of features can be more than ten thousand, so we need faster methods. [sent-123, score-0.094]
</p><p>65 We can obtain the point estimation of {θk , sk }K , by treating it as a limiting case of the previous algorithm. [sent-124, score-0.499]
</p><p>66 Furthermore, the solution of the above optimization is sparse in ms . [sent-126, score-0.122]
</p><p>67 This is a particularly nice property since we would only like to consider hidden sources for which the association with tasks are signiﬁcantly supported by evidence. [sent-127, score-0.769]
</p><p>68 4 Experimental Results The LICA model will work most effectively if the tasks we want to learn are very related. [sent-128, score-0.43]
</p><p>69 In our experiments we apply the LICA model to multi-label text classiﬁcation problems, which are the case for many existing text collections including the most popular ones like Reuters-21578 and the new RCV1 corpus. [sent-129, score-0.31]
</p><p>70 Here each individual task is to classify a given document to a particular category, and it is assumed that the multi-label property implies that some of the tasks are related through some latent sources (semantic topics). [sent-130, score-0.961]
</p><p>71 For Reuters-21578 we choose nine categories out of ninety categories, which is based on fact that those categories are often correlated by previous studies[8]. [sent-131, score-0.198]
</p><p>72 After some preprocessing3 we get 3,358 unique features/words, and empirical Bayes method is used to 3  We do stemming, remove stopwords and rare words (words that occur less than three times). [sent-132, score-0.218]
</p><p>73 On the other hand, if we include all the 116 TOPIC categories in RCV1 corpus we get a much larger vocabulary size: 47,236 unique features. [sent-151, score-0.207]
</p><p>74 Bayesian inference is intractable for this high-dimensional case since memory requirement itself is O(F 2 ) to store the full covariance matrix V[θ]. [sent-152, score-0.123]
</p><p>75 As a result we take the point estimation approach which reduces the memory requirement to O(F ). [sent-153, score-0.188]
</p><p>76 Since the effectiveness of learning multiple related tasks jointly should be best demonstrated when we have limited resources, we evaluate our LICA by varying the size of training set. [sent-155, score-0.621]
</p><p>77 In Figure 2 the result “individual” is obtained by using regularized logistic regression for each category individually. [sent-157, score-0.239]
</p><p>78 The number of tasks K is equal to 9 and 116 for the Reuters21578 and the RCV1 respectively, and we set H (the dimension of hidden source) to be the same as K in our experiments. [sent-158, score-0.488]
</p><p>79 We use F1 measure which is preferred to error rate in text classiﬁcation due to the very unbalanced positive/negative document ratio. [sent-159, score-0.094]
</p><p>80 Furthermore, we achieved a sparse solution for the point estimation method. [sent-162, score-0.15]
</p><p>81 In particular, we obtained less than 5 non-zero sources out of 116 for most of the tasks for the RCV1 collection. [sent-163, score-0.531]
</p><p>82 5 Discussions on Related Work By viewing multitask learning as predicting multivariate responses, Breiman and Friedman[3] proposed a method called “Curds and Whey” for regression problems. [sent-164, score-0.26]
</p><p>83 The intuition is to apply shrinkage in a rotated basis instead of the original task basis so that information can be borrowed among tasks. [sent-165, score-0.143]
</p><p>84 By treating tasks as IID generated from some probability space, empirical process theory[2] has been applied to study the bounds and asymptotics of multiple task learning, similar to the case of standard learning. [sent-166, score-0.665]
</p><p>85 On the other hand, from the general Bayesian perspective[2][6] we could treat the problem of learning multiple tasks as learning a Bayesian prior over the task space. [sent-167, score-0.644]
</p><p>86 Despite the generality of above two principles, it is often necessary to assume some speciﬁc structure or parametric form of the task space since the functional space is usually of higher or inﬁnite dimension compared to the input space. [sent-168, score-0.155]
</p><p>87 Our model is related to the recently proposed Semiparametric Latent Factor Model (SLFM) for regression by Teh et. [sent-169, score-0.193]
</p><p>88 It uses Gaussian Processes (GP) to model regression through a latent factor analysis. [sent-172, score-0.289]
</p><p>89 Besides the difference between FA and ICA, its advantage  is that GP is non-parametric and works on the instance space; the disadvantage of that model is that training instances need to be shared for all tasks. [sent-173, score-0.12]
</p><p>90 Furthermore, it is not clear how to explore different task structures in this instance-space viewpoint. [sent-174, score-0.102]
</p><p>91 As pointed out earlier, the exploration of different source models is important in learning related tasks as the prior often plays a more important role than it does in standard learning. [sent-175, score-0.547]
</p><p>92 6 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we proposed a probabilistic framework for learning multiple related tasks, which tries to identify the shared latent independent components that are responsible for the relatedness among those tasks. [sent-176, score-0.77]
</p><p>93 We also presented the corresponding empirical Bayes method as well as point estimation algorithms for learning the model. [sent-177, score-0.221]
</p><p>94 Using non-Gaussian distributions for hidden sources makes it possible to identify independent components instead of just decorrelation, and in particular we enjoyed the sparsity by modeling hidden sources with Laplace distribution. [sent-178, score-0.949]
</p><p>95 Having the sparsity property makes the model not only parsimonious but also more robust since the dependence on latent, independent sources will be shrunk toward zero unless signiﬁcantly supported by evidence from the data. [sent-179, score-0.546]
</p><p>96 By learning those related tasks jointly, we are able to get a better estimation of the latent independent sources and thus achieve a better generalization capability compared to conventional approaches where the learning of each task is done independently. [sent-180, score-1.206]
</p><p>97 Our experimental results in multi-label text classiﬁcation problems show evidence to support our claim. [sent-181, score-0.094]
</p><p>98 Our approach assumes that the underlying structure in the task space is a linear subspace, which can usually capture important information about independent sources. [sent-182, score-0.192]
</p><p>99 However, it is possible to achieve better results if we can incorporate speciﬁc domain knowledge about the relatedness of those tasks into the model and obtain a reliable estimation of the structure. [sent-183, score-0.615]
</p><p>100 For future research, we would like to consider more ﬂexible source models as well as incorporate domain speciﬁc knowledge to specify and learn the underlying structure. [sent-184, score-0.169]

We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result and works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined. 1</p><p>4 0.15491892 <a title="113-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Transfer_learning_for_text_classification.html">195 nips-2005-Transfer learning for text classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuong B. Do, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Linear text classiﬁcation algorithms work by computing an inner product between a test document vector and a parameter vector. In many such algorithms, including naive Bayes and most TFIDF variants, the parameters are determined by some simple, closed-form, function of training set statistics; we call this mapping mapping from statistics to parameters, the parameter function. Much research in text classiﬁcation over the last few decades has consisted of manual efforts to identify better parameter functions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatically learning this function from related classiﬁcation problems. The parameter function found by our algorithm then deﬁnes a new learning algorithm for text classiﬁcation, which we can apply to novel classiﬁcation tasks. We ﬁnd that our learned classiﬁer outperforms existing methods on a variety of multiclass text classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.13765953 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Assessing_Approximations_for_Gaussian_Process_Classification.html">30 nips-2005-Assessing Approximations for Gaussian Process Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are attractive models for probabilistic classiﬁcation but unfortunately exact inference is analytically intractable. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) focusing on marginal likelihood estimates and predictive performance. We explain theoretically and corroborate empirically that EP is superior to Laplace. We also compare to a sophisticated MCMC scheme and show that EP is surprisingly accurate. In recent years models based on Gaussian process (GP) priors have attracted much attention in the machine learning community. Whereas inference in the GP regression model with Gaussian noise can be done analytically, probabilistic classiﬁcation using GPs is analytically intractable. Several approaches to approximate Bayesian inference have been suggested, including Laplace’s approximation, Expectation Propagation (EP), variational approximations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, some of these in conjunction with generalisation bounds, online learning schemes and sparse approximations. Despite the abundance of recent work on probabilistic GP classiﬁers, most experimental studies provide only anecdotal evidence, and no clear picture has yet emerged, as to when and why which algorithm should be preferred. Thus, from a practitioners point of view probabilistic GP classiﬁcation remains a jungle. In this paper, we set out to understand and compare two of the most wide-spread approximations: Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP). We also compare to a sophisticated, but computationally demanding MCMC scheme to examine how close the approximations are to ground truth. We examine two aspects of the approximation schemes: Firstly the accuracy of approximations to the marginal likelihood which is of central importance for model selection and model comparison. In any practical application of GPs in classiﬁcation (usually multiple) parameters of the covariance function (hyperparameters) have to be handled. Bayesian model selection provides a consistent framework for setting such parameters. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the accuracy of the marginal likelihood approximations as a function of the hyperparameters, in order to assess the practical usefulness of the approach Secondly, we need to assess the quality of the approximate probabilistic predictions. In the past, the probabilistic nature of the GP predictions have not received much attention, the focus being mostly on classiﬁcation error rates. This unfortunate state of affairs is caused primarily by typical benchmarking problems being considered outside of a realistic context. The ability of a classiﬁer to produce class probabilities or conﬁdences, have obvious relevance in most areas of application, eg. medical diagnosis. We evaluate the predictive distributions of the approximate methods, and compare to the MCMC gold standard. 1 The Gaussian Process Model for Binary Classiﬁcation Let y ∈ {−1, 1} denote the class label of an input x. Gaussian process classiﬁcation (GPC) is discriminative in modelling p(y|x) for given x by a Bernoulli distribution. The probability of success p(y = 1|x) is related to an unconstrained latent function f (x) which is mapped to the unit interval by a sigmoid transformation, eg. the logit or the probit. For reasons of analytic convenience we exclusively use the probit model p(y = 1|x) = Φ(f (x)), where Φ denotes the cumulative density function of the standard Normal distribution. In the GPC model Bayesian inference is performed about the latent function f in the light of observed data D = {(yi , xi )|i = 1, . . . , m}. Let fi = f (xi ) and f = [f1 , . . . , fm ] be shorthand for the values of the latent function and y = [y1 , . . . , ym ] and X = [x1 , . . . , xm ] collect the class labels and inputs respectively. Given the latent function the class labels are independent Bernoulli variables, so the joint likelihood factories: m m p(yi |fi ) = p(y|f ) = i=1 Φ(yi fi ), i=1 and depends on f only through its value at the observed inputs. We use a zero-mean Gaussian process prior over the latent function f with a covariance function k(x, x |θ), which may depend on hyperparameters θ [1]. The functional form and parameters of the covariance function encodes assumptions about the latent function, and adaptation of these is part of the inference. The posterior distribution over latent function values f at the observed X for given hyperparameters θ becomes: m p(f |D, θ) = N (f |0, K) Φ(yi fi ), p(D|θ) i=1 where p(D|θ) = p(y|f )p(f |X, θ)df , denotes the marginal likelihood. Unfortunately neither the marginal likelihood, nor the posterior itself, or predictions can be computed analytically, so approximations are needed. 2 Approximate Bayesian Inference For the GPC model approximations are either based on a Gaussian approximation to the posterior p(f |D, θ) ≈ q(f |D, θ) = N (f |m, A) or involve Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [2]. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) which are two alternative approaches to ﬁnding parameters m and A of the Gaussian q(f |D, θ). Both methods also allow approximate evaluation of the marginal likelihood, which is useful for ML-II hyperparameter optimisation. Laplace’s approximation (LA) is found by making a second order Taylor approximation of the (un-normalised) log posterior [3]. The mean m is placed at the mode (MAP) and the covariance A equals the negative inverse Hessian of the log posterior density at m. The EP approximation [4] also gives a Gaussian approximation to the posterior. The parameters m and A are found in an iterative scheme by matching the approximate marginal moments of p(fi |D, θ) by the marginals of the approximation N (fi |mi , Aii ). Although we cannot prove the convergence of EP, we conjecture that it always converges for GPC with probit likelihood, and have never encountered an exception. A key insight is that a Gaussian approximation to the GPC posterior is equivalent to a GP approximation to the posterior distribution over latent functions. For a test input x∗ the fi 1 0.16 0.14 0.8 0.6 0.1 fj p(y|f) p(f|y) 0.12 Likelihood p(y|f) Prior p(f) Posterior p(f|y) Laplace q(f|y) EP q(f|y) 0.08 0.4 0.06 0.04 0.2 0.02 0 −4 0 4 8 0 f . (a) (b) Figure 1: Panel (a) provides a one-dimensional illustration of the approximations. The prior N (f |0, 52 ) combined with the probit likelihood (y = 1) results in a skewed posterior. The likelihood uses the right axis, all other curves use the left axis. Laplace’s approximation peaks at the posterior mode, but places far too much mass over negative values of f and too little at large positive values. The EP approximation matches the ﬁrst two posterior moments, which results in a larger mean and a more accurate placement of probability mass compared to Laplace’s approximation. In Panel (b) we caricature a high dimensional zeromean Gaussian prior as an ellipse. The gray shadow indicates that for a high dimensional Gaussian most of the mass lies in a thin shell. For large latent signals (large entries in K), the likelihood essentially cuts off regions which are incompatible with the training labels (hatched area), leaving the upper right orthant as the posterior. The dot represents the mode of the posterior, which remains close to the origin. approximate predictive latent and class probabilities are: 2 q(f∗ |D, θ, x∗ ) = N (µ∗ , σ∗ ), and 2 q(y∗ = 1|D, x∗ ) = Φ(µ∗ / 1 + σ∗ ), 2 where µ∗ = k∗ K−1 m and σ∗ = k(x∗ , x∗ )−k∗ (K−1 − K−1 AK−1 )k∗ , where the vector k∗ = [k(x1 , x∗ ), . . . , k(xm , x∗ )] collects covariances between x∗ and training inputs X. MCMC sampling has the advantage that it becomes exact in the limit of long runs and so provides a gold standard by which to measure the two analytic methods described above. Although MCMC methods can in principle be used to do inference over f and θ jointly [5], we compare to methods using ML-II optimisation over θ, thus we use MCMC to integrate over f only. Good marginal likelihood estimates are notoriously difﬁcult to obtain; in our experiments we use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) [6], combining several Thermodynamic Integration runs into a single (unbiased) estimate of the marginal likelihood. Both analytic approximations have a computational complexity which is cubic O(m3 ) as common among non-sparse GP models due to inversions m × m matrices. In our implementations LA and EP need similar running times, on the order of a few minutes for several hundred data-points. Making AIS work efﬁciently requires some ﬁne-tuning and a single estimate of p(D|θ) can take several hours for data sets of a few hundred examples, but this could conceivably be improved upon. 3 Structural Properties of the Posterior and its Approximations Structural properties of the posterior can best be understood by examining its construction. The prior is a correlated m-dimensional Gaussian N (f |0, K) centred at the origin. Each likelihood term p(yi |fi ) softly truncates the half-space from the prior that is incompatible with the observed label, see Figure 1. The resulting posterior is unimodal and skewed, similar to a multivariate Gaussian truncated to the orthant containing y. The mode of the posterior remains close to the origin, while the mass is placed in accordance with the observed class labels. Additionally, high dimensional Gaussian distributions exhibit the property that most probability mass is contained in a thin ellipsoidal shell – depending on the covariance structure – away from the mean [7, ch. 29.2]. Intuitively this occurs since in high dimensions the volume grows extremely rapidly with the radius. As an effect the mode becomes less representative (typical) for the prior distribution as the dimension increases. For the GPC posterior this property persists: the mode of the posterior distribution stays relatively close to the origin, still being unrepresentative for the posterior distribution, while the mean moves to the mass of the posterior making mean and mode differ signiﬁcantly. We cannot generally assume the posterior to be close to Gaussian, as in the often studied limit of low-dimensional parametric models with large amounts of data. Therefore in GPC we must be aware of making a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. From the properties of the posterior it can be expected that Laplace’s method places m in the right orthant but too close to the origin, such that the approximation will overlap with regions having practically zero posterior mass. As an effect the amplitude of the approximate latent posterior GP will be underestimated systematically, leading to overly cautious predictive distributions. The EP approximation does not rely on a local expansion, but assumes that the marginal distributions can be well approximated by Gaussians. This assumption will be examined empirically below. 4 Experiments In this section we compare and inspect approximations for GPC using various benchmark data sets. The primary focus is not to optimise the absolute performance of GPC models but to compare the relative accuracy of approximations and to validate the arguments given in the previous section. In all experiments we use a covariance function of the form: k(x, x |θ) = σ 2 exp − 1 x − x 2 2 / 2 , (1) such that θ = [σ, ]. We refer to σ 2 as the signal variance and to as the characteristic length-scale. Note that for many classiﬁcation tasks it may be reasonable to use an individual length scale parameter for every input dimension (ARD) or a different kind of covariance function. Nevertheless, for the sake of presentability we use the above covariance function and we believe the conclusions about the accuracy of approximations to be independent of this choice, since it relies on arguments which are independent of the form of the covariance function. As measure of the accuracy of predictive probabilities we use the average information in bits of the predictions about the test targets in excess of that of random guessing. Let p∗ = p(y∗ = 1|D, θ, x∗ ) be the model’s prediction, then we average: I(p∗ , yi ) = i yi +1 2 log2 (p∗ ) + i 1−yi 2 log2 (1 − p∗ ) + H i (2) over all test cases, where H is the entropy of the training labels. The error rate E is equal to the percentage of erroneous class assignments if prediction is understood as a decision problem with symmetric costs. For the ﬁrst set of experiments presented here the well-known USPS digits and the Ionosphere data set were used. A binary sub-problem from the USPS digits is deﬁned by only considering 3’s vs. 5’s (which is probably the hardest of the binary sub-problems) and dividing the data into 767 cases for training and 773 for testing. The Ionosphere data is split into 200 training and 151 test cases. We do an exhaustive investigation on a ﬁne regular grid of values for the log hyperparameters. For each θ on the grid we compute the approximated log marginal likelihood by LA, EP and AIS. Additionally we compute the respective predictive performance (2) on the test set.

The true posterior is approximated by a normalised histogram of 9000 samples of fi obtained by MCMC sampling. Panel (c) shows a histogram of samples of a marginal distribution of a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian. The line describes a Gaussian with mean and variance estimated from the samples. For all three approximation techniques we see an agreement between marginal likelihood estimates and test performance, which justiﬁes the use of ML-II parameter estimation. But the shape of the contours and the values differ between the methods. The contours for Laplace’s method appear to be slanted compared to EP. The marginal likelihood estimates of EP and AIS agree surprisingly well1 , given that the marginal likelihood comes as a 767 respectively 200 dimensional integral. The EP predictions contain as much information about the test cases as the MCMC predictions and signiﬁcantly more than for LA. Note that for small signal variances (roughly ln(σ 2 ) < 1) LA and EP give very similar results. A possible explanation is that for small signal variances the likelihood does not truncate the prior but only down-weights the tail that disagrees with the observation. As an effect the posterior will be less skewed and both approximations will lead to similar results. For the USPS 3’s vs. 5’s we now inspect the marginal distributions p(fi |D, θ) of single latent function values under the posterior approximations for a given value of θ. We have chosen the values ln(σ) = 3.35 and ln( ) = 2.85 which are between the ML-II estimates of EP and LA. Hybrid MCMC was used to generate 9000 samples from the posterior p(f |D, θ). For LA and EP the approximate marginals are q(fi |D, θ) = N (fi |mi , Aii ) where m and A are found by the respective approximation techniques. In general we observe that the marginal distributions of MCMC samples agree very well with the respective marginal distributions of the EP approximation. For Laplace’s approximation we ﬁnd the mean to be underestimated and the marginal distributions to overlap with zero far more than the EP approximations. Figure (3a) displays the marginal distribution and its approximations for which the MCMC samples show maximal skewness. Figure (3b) shows a typical example where the EP approximation agrees very well with the MCMC samples. We show this particular example because under the EP approximation p(yi = 1|D, θ) < 0.1% but LA gives a wrong p(yi = 1|D, θ) ≈ 18%. In the experiment we saw that the marginal distributions of the posterior often agree very 1 Note that the agreement between the two seems to be limited by the accuracy of the MCMC runs, as judged by the regularity of the contour lines; the tolerance is less than one unit on a (natural) log scale. well with a Gaussian approximation. This seems to contradict the description given in the previous section were we argued that the posterior is skewed by construction. In order to inspect the marginals of a truncated high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution we made an additional synthetic experiment. We constructed a 767 dimensional Gaussian N (x|0, C) with a covariance matrix having one eigenvalue of 100 with eigenvector 1, and all other eigenvalues are 1. We then truncate this distribution such that all xi ≥ 0. Note that the mode of the truncated Gaussian is still at zero, whereas the mean moves towards the remaining mass. Figure (3c) shows a normalised histogram of samples from a marginal distribution of one xi . The samples agree very well with a Gaussian approximation. In the previous section we described the somewhat surprising property, that for a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian, resembling the posterior, the mode (used by LA) may not be particularly representative of the distribution. Although the marginal is also truncated, it is still exceptionally well modelled by a Gaussian – however, the Laplace approximation centred on the origin would be completely inappropriate. In a second set of experiments we compare the predictive performance of LA and EP for GPC on several well known benchmark problems. Each data set is randomly split into 10 folds of which one at a time is left out as a test set to measure the predictive performance of a model trained (or selected) on the remaining nine folds. All performance measures are averages over the 10 folds. For GPC we implement model selection by ML-II hyperparameter estimation, reporting results given the θ that maximised the respective approximate marginal likelihoods p(D|θ). In order to get a better picture of the absolute performance we also compare to results obtained by C-SVM classiﬁcation. The kernel we used is equivalent to the covariance function (1) without the signal variance parameter. For each fold the parameters C and are found in an inner loop of 5-fold cross-validation, in which the parameter grids are reﬁned until the performance stabilises. Predictive probabilities for test cases are obtained by mapping the unthresholded output of the SVM to [0, 1] using a sigmoid function [8]. Results are summarised in Table 1. Comparing Laplace’s method to EP the latter shows to be more accurate both in terms of error rate and information. While the error rates are relatively similar the predictive distribution obtained by EP shows to be more informative about the test targets. Note that for GPC the error rate only depends of the sign of the mean µ∗ of the approximated posterior over latent functions and not the entire posterior predictive distribution. As to be expected, the length of the mean vector m shows much larger values for the EP approximations. Comparing EP and SVMs the results are mixed. For the Crabs data set all methods show the same error rate but the information content of the predictive distributions differs dramatically. For some test cases the SVM predicts the wrong class with large certainty. 5 Summary & Conclusions Our experiments reveal serious differences between Laplace’s method and EP when used in GPC models. From the structural properties of the posterior we described why LA systematically underestimates the mean m. The resulting posterior GP over latent functions will have too small amplitude, although the sign of the mean function will be mostly correct. As an effect LA gives over-conservative predictive probabilities, and diminished information about the test labels. This effect has been show empirically on several real world examples. Large resulting discrepancies in the actual posterior probabilities were found, even at the training locations, which renders the predictive class probabilities produced under this approximation grossly inaccurate. Note, the difference becomes less dramatic if we only consider the classiﬁcation error rates obtained by thresholding p∗ at 1/2. For this particular task, we’ve seen the the sign of the latent function tends to be correct (at least at the training locations).

The ﬁrst three columns give the name of the data set, number of observations m and dimension of inputs n. For Laplace’s method and EP the table reports the average error rate E%, the average information I (2) and the average length m of the mean vector of the Gaussian approximation. For SVMs the error rate and the average information about the test targets are reported. Note that for the Crabs data set we use the sex (not the colour) of the crabs as class label. The EP approximation has shown to give results very close to MCMC both in terms of predictive distributions and marginal likelihood estimates. We have shown and explained why the marginal distributions of the posterior can be well approximated by Gaussians. Further, the marginal likelihood values obtained by LA and EP differ systematically which will lead to different results of ML-II hyperparameter estimation. The discrepancies are similar for different tasks. Using AIS we were able to show the accuracy of marginal likelihood estimates, which to the best of our knowledge has never been done before. In summary, we found that EP is the method of choice for approximate inference in binary GPC models, when the computational cost of MCMC is prohibitive. In contrast, the Laplace approximation is so inaccurate that we advise against its use, especially when predictive probabilities are to be taken seriously. Further experiments and a detailed description of the approximation schemes can be found in [2].

<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.</p><p>2 0.67408961 <a title="113-lsi-2" href="./nips-2005-Transfer_learning_for_text_classification.html">195 nips-2005-Transfer learning for text classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuong B. Do, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Linear text classiﬁcation algorithms work by computing an inner product between a test document vector and a parameter vector. In many such algorithms, including naive Bayes and most TFIDF variants, the parameters are determined by some simple, closed-form, function of training set statistics; we call this mapping mapping from statistics to parameters, the parameter function. Much research in text classiﬁcation over the last few decades has consisted of manual efforts to identify better parameter functions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatically learning this function from related classiﬁcation problems. The parameter function found by our algorithm then deﬁnes a new learning algorithm for text classiﬁcation, which we can apply to novel classiﬁcation tasks. We ﬁnd that our learned classiﬁer outperforms existing methods on a variety of multiclass text classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.65626091 <a title="113-lsi-3" href="./nips-2005-Stimulus_Evoked_Independent_Factor_Analysis_of_MEG_Data_with_Large_Background_Activity.html">183 nips-2005-Stimulus Evoked Independent Factor Analysis of MEG Data with Large Background Activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Guido Nolte, Andreas Ziehe, Frank Meinecke, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When trying to understand the brain, it is of fundamental importance to analyse (e.g. from EEG/MEG measurements) what parts of the cortex interact with each other in order to infer more accurate models of brain activity. Common techniques like Blind Source Separation (BSS) can estimate brain sources and single out artifacts by using the underlying assumption of source signal independence. However, physiologically interesting brain sources typically interact, so BSS will—by construction— fail to characterize them properly. Noting that there are truly interacting sources and signals that only seemingly interact due to effects of volume conduction, this work aims to contribute by distinguishing these effects. For this a new BSS technique is proposed that uses anti-symmetrized cross-correlation matrices and subsequent diagonalization. The resulting decomposition consists of the truly interacting brain sources and suppresses any spurious interaction stemming from volume conduction. Our new concept of interacting source analysis (ISA) is successfully demonstrated on MEG data. 1</p><p>5 0.54391557 <a title="113-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Assessing_Approximations_for_Gaussian_Process_Classification.html">30 nips-2005-Assessing Approximations for Gaussian Process Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are attractive models for probabilistic classiﬁcation but unfortunately exact inference is analytically intractable. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) focusing on marginal likelihood estimates and predictive performance. We explain theoretically and corroborate empirically that EP is superior to Laplace. We also compare to a sophisticated MCMC scheme and show that EP is surprisingly accurate. In recent years models based on Gaussian process (GP) priors have attracted much attention in the machine learning community. Whereas inference in the GP regression model with Gaussian noise can be done analytically, probabilistic classiﬁcation using GPs is analytically intractable. Several approaches to approximate Bayesian inference have been suggested, including Laplace’s approximation, Expectation Propagation (EP), variational approximations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, some of these in conjunction with generalisation bounds, online learning schemes and sparse approximations. Despite the abundance of recent work on probabilistic GP classiﬁers, most experimental studies provide only anecdotal evidence, and no clear picture has yet emerged, as to when and why which algorithm should be preferred. Thus, from a practitioners point of view probabilistic GP classiﬁcation remains a jungle. In this paper, we set out to understand and compare two of the most wide-spread approximations: Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP). We also compare to a sophisticated, but computationally demanding MCMC scheme to examine how close the approximations are to ground truth. We examine two aspects of the approximation schemes: Firstly the accuracy of approximations to the marginal likelihood which is of central importance for model selection and model comparison. In any practical application of GPs in classiﬁcation (usually multiple) parameters of the covariance function (hyperparameters) have to be handled. Bayesian model selection provides a consistent framework for setting such parameters. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the accuracy of the marginal likelihood approximations as a function of the hyperparameters, in order to assess the practical usefulness of the approach Secondly, we need to assess the quality of the approximate probabilistic predictions. In the past, the probabilistic nature of the GP predictions have not received much attention, the focus being mostly on classiﬁcation error rates. This unfortunate state of affairs is caused primarily by typical benchmarking problems being considered outside of a realistic context. The ability of a classiﬁer to produce class probabilities or conﬁdences, have obvious relevance in most areas of application, eg. medical diagnosis. We evaluate the predictive distributions of the approximate methods, and compare to the MCMC gold standard. 1 The Gaussian Process Model for Binary Classiﬁcation Let y ∈ {−1, 1} denote the class label of an input x. Gaussian process classiﬁcation (GPC) is discriminative in modelling p(y|x) for given x by a Bernoulli distribution. The probability of success p(y = 1|x) is related to an unconstrained latent function f (x) which is mapped to the unit interval by a sigmoid transformation, eg. the logit or the probit. For reasons of analytic convenience we exclusively use the probit model p(y = 1|x) = Φ(f (x)), where Φ denotes the cumulative density function of the standard Normal distribution. In the GPC model Bayesian inference is performed about the latent function f in the light of observed data D = {(yi , xi )|i = 1, . . . , m}. Let fi = f (xi ) and f = [f1 , . . . , fm ] be shorthand for the values of the latent function and y = [y1 , . . . , ym ] and X = [x1 , . . . , xm ] collect the class labels and inputs respectively. Given the latent function the class labels are independent Bernoulli variables, so the joint likelihood factories: m m p(yi |fi ) = p(y|f ) = i=1 Φ(yi fi ), i=1 and depends on f only through its value at the observed inputs. We use a zero-mean Gaussian process prior over the latent function f with a covariance function k(x, x |θ), which may depend on hyperparameters θ [1]. The functional form and parameters of the covariance function encodes assumptions about the latent function, and adaptation of these is part of the inference. The posterior distribution over latent function values f at the observed X for given hyperparameters θ becomes: m p(f |D, θ) = N (f |0, K) Φ(yi fi ), p(D|θ) i=1 where p(D|θ) = p(y|f )p(f |X, θ)df , denotes the marginal likelihood. Unfortunately neither the marginal likelihood, nor the posterior itself, or predictions can be computed analytically, so approximations are needed. 2 Approximate Bayesian Inference For the GPC model approximations are either based on a Gaussian approximation to the posterior p(f |D, θ) ≈ q(f |D, θ) = N (f |m, A) or involve Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [2]. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) which are two alternative approaches to ﬁnding parameters m and A of the Gaussian q(f |D, θ). Both methods also allow approximate evaluation of the marginal likelihood, which is useful for ML-II hyperparameter optimisation. Laplace’s approximation (LA) is found by making a second order Taylor approximation of the (un-normalised) log posterior [3]. The mean m is placed at the mode (MAP) and the covariance A equals the negative inverse Hessian of the log posterior density at m. The EP approximation [4] also gives a Gaussian approximation to the posterior. The parameters m and A are found in an iterative scheme by matching the approximate marginal moments of p(fi |D, θ) by the marginals of the approximation N (fi |mi , Aii ). Although we cannot prove the convergence of EP, we conjecture that it always converges for GPC with probit likelihood, and have never encountered an exception. A key insight is that a Gaussian approximation to the GPC posterior is equivalent to a GP approximation to the posterior distribution over latent functions.

(a) (b) Figure 1: Panel (a) provides a one-dimensional illustration of the approximations. The prior N (f |0, 52 ) combined with the probit likelihood (y = 1) results in a skewed posterior. The likelihood uses the right axis, all other curves use the left axis. Laplace’s approximation peaks at the posterior mode, but places far too much mass over negative values of f and too little at large positive values. The EP approximation matches the ﬁrst two posterior moments, which results in a larger mean and a more accurate placement of probability mass compared to Laplace’s approximation. In Panel (b) we caricature a high dimensional zeromean Gaussian prior as an ellipse. The gray shadow indicates that for a high dimensional Gaussian most of the mass lies in a thin shell. For large latent signals (large entries in K), the likelihood essentially cuts off regions which are incompatible with the training labels (hatched area), leaving the upper right orthant as the posterior. The dot represents the mode of the posterior, which remains close to the origin. approximate predictive latent and class probabilities are: 2 q(f∗ |D, θ, x∗ ) = N (µ∗ , σ∗ ), and 2 q(y∗ = 1|D, x∗ ) = Φ(µ∗ / 1 + σ∗ ), 2 where µ∗ = k∗ K−1 m and σ∗ = k(x∗ , x∗ )−k∗ (K−1 − K−1 AK−1 )k∗ , where the vector k∗ = [k(x1 , x∗ ), . . . , k(xm , x∗ )] collects covariances between x∗ and training inputs X. MCMC sampling has the advantage that it becomes exact in the limit of long runs and so provides a gold standard by which to measure the two analytic methods described above. Although MCMC methods can in principle be used to do inference over f and θ jointly [5], we compare to methods using ML-II optimisation over θ, thus we use MCMC to integrate over f only. Good marginal likelihood estimates are notoriously difﬁcult to obtain; in our experiments we use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) [6], combining several Thermodynamic Integration runs into a single (unbiased) estimate of the marginal likelihood. Both analytic approximations have a computational complexity which is cubic O(m3 ) as common among non-sparse GP models due to inversions m × m matrices. In our implementations LA and EP need similar running times, on the order of a few minutes for several hundred data-points. Making AIS work efﬁciently requires some ﬁne-tuning and a single estimate of p(D|θ) can take several hours for data sets of a few hundred examples, but this could conceivably be improved upon. 3 Structural Properties of the Posterior and its Approximations Structural properties of the posterior can best be understood by examining its construction. The prior is a correlated m-dimensional Gaussian N (f |0, K) centred at the origin. Each likelihood term p(yi |fi ) softly truncates the half-space from the prior that is incompatible with the observed label, see Figure 1. The resulting posterior is unimodal and skewed, similar to a multivariate Gaussian truncated to the orthant containing y. The mode of the posterior remains close to the origin, while the mass is placed in accordance with the observed class labels. Additionally, high dimensional Gaussian distributions exhibit the property that most probability mass is contained in a thin ellipsoidal shell – depending on the covariance structure – away from the mean [7, ch. 29.2]. Intuitively this occurs since in high dimensions the volume grows extremely rapidly with the radius. As an effect the mode becomes less representative (typical) for the prior distribution as the dimension increases. For the GPC posterior this property persists: the mode of the posterior distribution stays relatively close to the origin, still being unrepresentative for the posterior distribution, while the mean moves to the mass of the posterior making mean and mode differ signiﬁcantly. We cannot generally assume the posterior to be close to Gaussian, as in the often studied limit of low-dimensional parametric models with large amounts of data. Therefore in GPC we must be aware of making a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. From the properties of the posterior it can be expected that Laplace’s method places m in the right orthant but too close to the origin, such that the approximation will overlap with regions having practically zero posterior mass. As an effect the amplitude of the approximate latent posterior GP will be underestimated systematically, leading to overly cautious predictive distributions. The EP approximation does not rely on a local expansion, but assumes that the marginal distributions can be well approximated by Gaussians. This assumption will be examined empirically below. 4 Experiments In this section we compare and inspect approximations for GPC using various benchmark data sets. The primary focus is not to optimise the absolute performance of GPC models but to compare the relative accuracy of approximations and to validate the arguments given in the previous section. In all experiments we use a covariance function of the form: k(x, x |θ) = σ 2 exp − 1 x − x 2 2 / 2 , (1) such that θ = [σ, ]. We refer to σ 2 as the signal variance and to as the characteristic length-scale. Note that for many classiﬁcation tasks it may be reasonable to use an individual length scale parameter for every input dimension (ARD) or a different kind of covariance function. Nevertheless, for the sake of presentability we use the above covariance function and we believe the conclusions about the accuracy of approximations to be independent of this choice, since it relies on arguments which are independent of the form of the covariance function. As measure of the accuracy of predictive probabilities we use the average information in bits of the predictions about the test targets in excess of that of random guessing. Let p∗ = p(y∗ = 1|D, θ, x∗ ) be the model’s prediction, then we average: I(p∗ , yi ) = i yi +1 2 log2 (p∗ ) + i 1−yi 2 log2 (1 − p∗ ) + H i (2) over all test cases, where H is the entropy of the training labels. The error rate E is equal to the percentage of erroneous class assignments if prediction is understood as a decision problem with symmetric costs. For the ﬁrst set of experiments presented here the well-known USPS digits and the Ionosphere data set were used. A binary sub-problem from the USPS digits is deﬁned by only considering 3’s vs. 5’s (which is probably the hardest of the binary sub-problems) and dividing the data into 767 cases for training and 773 for testing. The Ionosphere data is split into 200 training and 151 test cases. We do an exhaustive investigation on a ﬁne regular grid of values for the log hyperparameters. For each θ on the grid we compute the approximated log marginal likelihood by LA, EP and AIS. Additionally we compute the respective predictive performance (2) on the test set.

The true posterior is approximated by a normalised histogram of 9000 samples of fi obtained by MCMC sampling. Panel (c) shows a histogram of samples of a marginal distribution of a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian. The line describes a Gaussian with mean and variance estimated from the samples. For all three approximation techniques we see an agreement between marginal likelihood estimates and test performance, which justiﬁes the use of ML-II parameter estimation. But the shape of the contours and the values differ between the methods. The contours for Laplace’s method appear to be slanted compared to EP. The marginal likelihood estimates of EP and AIS agree surprisingly well1 , given that the marginal likelihood comes as a 767 respectively 200 dimensional integral. The EP predictions contain as much information about the test cases as the MCMC predictions and signiﬁcantly more than for LA. Note that for small signal variances (roughly ln(σ 2 ) < 1) LA and EP give very similar results. A possible explanation is that for small signal variances the likelihood does not truncate the prior but only down-weights the tail that disagrees with the observation. As an effect the posterior will be less skewed and both approximations will lead to similar results. For the USPS 3’s vs. 5’s we now inspect the marginal distributions p(fi |D, θ) of single latent function values under the posterior approximations for a given value of θ. We have chosen the values ln(σ) = 3.35 and ln( ) = 2.85 which are between the ML-II estimates of EP and LA. Hybrid MCMC was used to generate 9000 samples from the posterior p(f |D, θ). For LA and EP the approximate marginals are q(fi |D, θ) = N (fi |mi , Aii ) where m and A are found by the respective approximation techniques. In general we observe that the marginal distributions of MCMC samples agree very well with the respective marginal distributions of the EP approximation. For Laplace’s approximation we ﬁnd the mean to be underestimated and the marginal distributions to overlap with zero far more than the EP approximations. Figure (3a) displays the marginal distribution and its approximations for which the MCMC samples show maximal skewness. Figure (3b) shows a typical example where the EP approximation agrees very well with the MCMC samples. We show this particular example because under the EP approximation p(yi = 1|D, θ) < 0.1% but LA gives a wrong p(yi = 1|D, θ) ≈ 18%. In the experiment we saw that the marginal distributions of the posterior often agree very 1 Note that the agreement between the two seems to be limited by the accuracy of the MCMC runs, as judged by the regularity of the contour lines; the tolerance is less than one unit on a (natural) log scale. well with a Gaussian approximation. This seems to contradict the description given in the previous section were we argued that the posterior is skewed by construction. In order to inspect the marginals of a truncated high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution we made an additional synthetic experiment. We constructed a 767 dimensional Gaussian N (x|0, C) with a covariance matrix having one eigenvalue of 100 with eigenvector 1, and all other eigenvalues are 1. We then truncate this distribution such that all xi ≥ 0. Note that the mode of the truncated Gaussian is still at zero, whereas the mean moves towards the remaining mass. Figure (3c) shows a normalised histogram of samples from a marginal distribution of one xi . The samples agree very well with a Gaussian approximation. In the previous section we described the somewhat surprising property, that for a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian, resembling the posterior, the mode (used by LA) may not be particularly representative of the distribution. Although the marginal is also truncated, it is still exceptionally well modelled by a Gaussian – however, the Laplace approximation centred on the origin would be completely inappropriate. In a second set of experiments we compare the predictive performance of LA and EP for GPC on several well known benchmark problems. Each data set is randomly split into 10 folds of which one at a time is left out as a test set to measure the predictive performance of a model trained (or selected) on the remaining nine folds. All performance measures are averages over the 10 folds. For GPC we implement model selection by ML-II hyperparameter estimation, reporting results given the θ that maximised the respective approximate marginal likelihoods p(D|θ). In order to get a better picture of the absolute performance we also compare to results obtained by C-SVM classiﬁcation. The kernel we used is equivalent to the covariance function (1) without the signal variance parameter. For each fold the parameters C and are found in an inner loop of 5-fold cross-validation, in which the parameter grids are reﬁned until the performance stabilises. Predictive probabilities for test cases are obtained by mapping the unthresholded output of the SVM to [0, 1] using a sigmoid function [8]. Results are summarised in Table 1. Comparing Laplace’s method to EP the latter shows to be more accurate both in terms of error rate and information. While the error rates are relatively similar the predictive distribution obtained by EP shows to be more informative about the test targets. Note that for GPC the error rate only depends of the sign of the mean µ∗ of the approximated posterior over latent functions and not the entire posterior predictive distribution. As to be expected, the length of the mean vector m shows much larger values for the EP approximations. Comparing EP and SVMs the results are mixed. For the Crabs data set all methods show the same error rate but the information content of the predictive distributions differs dramatically. For some test cases the SVM predicts the wrong class with large certainty. 5 Summary & Conclusions Our experiments reveal serious differences between Laplace’s method and EP when used in GPC models. From the structural properties of the posterior we described why LA systematically underestimates the mean m. The resulting posterior GP over latent functions will have too small amplitude, although the sign of the mean function will be mostly correct. As an effect LA gives over-conservative predictive probabilities, and diminished information about the test labels. This effect has been show empirically on several real world examples. Large resulting discrepancies in the actual posterior probabilities were found, even at the training locations, which renders the predictive class probabilities produced under this approximation grossly inaccurate. Note, the difference becomes less dramatic if we only consider the classiﬁcation error rates obtained by thresholding p∗ at 1/2. For this particular task, we’ve seen the the sign of the latent function tends to be correct (at least at the training locations).

The ﬁrst three columns give the name of the data set, number of observations m and dimension of inputs n. For Laplace’s method and EP the table reports the average error rate E%, the average information I (2) and the average length m of the mean vector of the Gaussian approximation. For SVMs the error rate and the average information about the test targets are reported. Note that for the Crabs data set we use the sex (not the colour) of the crabs as class label. The EP approximation has shown to give results very close to MCMC both in terms of predictive distributions and marginal likelihood estimates. We have shown and explained why the marginal distributions of the posterior can be well approximated by Gaussians. Further, the marginal likelihood values obtained by LA and EP differ systematically which will lead to different results of ML-II hyperparameter estimation. The discrepancies are similar for different tasks. Using AIS we were able to show the accuracy of marginal likelihood estimates, which to the best of our knowledge has never been done before. In summary, we found that EP is the method of choice for approximate inference in binary GPC models, when the computational cost of MCMC is prohibitive. In contrast, the Laplace approximation is so inaccurate that we advise against its use, especially when predictive probabilities are to be taken seriously. Further experiments and a detailed description of the approximation schemes can be found in [2].

<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efﬁcient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.</p><p>2 0.99216622 <a title="113-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Inferring_Motor_Programs_from_Images_of_Handwritten_Digits.html">97 nips-2005-Inferring Motor Programs from Images of Handwritten Digits</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinod Nair, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We describe a generative model for handwritten digits that uses two pairs of opposing springs whose stiffnesses are controlled by a motor program. We show how neural networks can be trained to infer the motor programs required to accurately reconstruct the MNIST digits. The inferred motor programs can be used directly for digit classiﬁcation, but they can also be used in other ways. By adding noise to the motor program inferred from an MNIST image we can generate a large set of very different images of the same class, thus enlarging the training set available to other methods. We can also use the motor programs as additional, highly informative outputs which reduce overﬁtting when training a feed-forward classiﬁer. 1 Overview The idea that patterns can be recognized by ﬁguring out how they were generated has been around for at least half a century [1, 2] and one of the ﬁrst proposed applications was the recognition of handwriting using a generative model that involved pairs of opposing springs [3, 4]. The “analysis-by-synthesis” approach is attractive because the true generative model should provide the most natural way to characterize a class of patterns. The handwritten 2’s in ﬁgure 1, for example, are very variable when viewed as pixels but they have very similar motor programs. Despite its obvious merits, analysis-by-synthesis has had few successes, partly because it is computationally expensive to invert non-linear generative models and partly because the underlying parameters of the generative model are unknown for most large data sets. For example, the only source of information about how the MNIST digits were drawn is the images themselves. We describe a simple generative model in which a pen is controlled by two pairs of opposing springs whose stiffnesses are speciﬁed by a motor program. If the sequence of stiffnesses is speciﬁed correctly, the model can produce images which look very like the MNIST digits. Using a separate network for each digit class, we show that backpropagation can be used to learn a “recognition” network that maps images to the motor programs required to produce them. An interesting aspect of this learning is that the network creates its own training data, so it does not require the training images to be labelled with motor programs. Each recognition network starts with a single example of a motor program and grows an “island of competence” around this example, progressively extending the region over which it can map small changes in the image to the corresponding small changes in the motor program (see ﬁgure 2). Figure 1: An MNIST image of a 2 and the additional images that can be generated by inferring the motor program and then adding random noise to it. The pixels are very different, but they are all clearly twos. Fairly good digit recognition can be achieved by using the 10 recognition networks to ﬁnd 10 motor programs for a test image and then scoring each motor program by its squared error in reconstructing the image. The 10 scores are then fed into a softmax classiﬁer. Recognition can be improved by using PCA to model the distribution of motor trajectories for each class and using the distance of a motor trajectory from the relevant PCA hyperplane as an additional score. Each recognition network is solving a difﬁcult global search problem in which the correct motor program must be found by a single, “open-loop” pass through the network. More accurate recognition can be achieved by using this open-loop global search to initialize an iterative, closed-loop local search which uses the error in the reconstructed image to revise the motor program. This requires reconstruction errors in pixel space to be mapped to corrections in the space of spring stiffnesses. We cannot backpropagate errors through the generative model because it is just a hand-coded computer program. So we learn “generative” networks, one per digit class, that emulate the generator. After learning, backpropagation through these generative networks is used to convert pixel reconstruction errors into stiffness corrections. Our ﬁnal system gives 1.82% error on the MNIST test set which is similar to the 1.7% achieved by a very different generative approach [5] but worse than the 1.53% produced by the best backpropagation networks or the 1.4% produced by support vector machines [6]. It is much worse than the 0.4% produced by convolutional neural networks that use cleverly enhanced training sets [7]. Recognition of test images is quite slow because it uses ten different recognition networks followed by iterative local search. There is, however, a much more efﬁcient way to make use of our ability to extract motor programs. They can be treated as additional output labels when using backpropagation to train a single, multilayer, discriminative neural network. These additional labels act as a very informative regularizer that reduces the error rate from 1.53% to 1.27% in a network with two hidden layers of 500 units each. This is a new method of improving performance that can be used in conjunction with other tricks such as preprocessing the images, enhancing the training set or using convolutional neural nets [8, 7]. 2 A simple generative model for drawing digits The generative model uses two pairs of opposing springs at right angles. One end of each spring is attached to a frictionless horizontal or vertical rail that is 39 pixels from the center of the image. The other end is attached to a “pen” that has signiﬁcant mass. The springs themselves are weightless and have zero rest length. The pen starts at the equilibrium position deﬁned by the initial stiffnesses of the four springs. It then follows a trajectory that is determined by the stiffness of each spring at each of the 16 subsequent time steps in the motor program. The mass is large compared with the rate at which the stiffnesses change, so the system is typically far from equilibrium as it follows the smooth trajectory. On each time step, the momentum is multiplied by 0.9 to simulate viscosity. A coarse-grain trajectory is computed by using one step of forward integration for each time step in the motor program, so it contains 17 points. The code is at www.cs.toronto.edu/∼ hinton/code. Figure 2: The training data for each class-speciﬁc recognition network is produced by adding noise to motor programs that are inferred from MNIST images using the current parameters of the recognition network. To initiate this process, the biases of the output units are set by hand so that they represent a prototypical motor program for the class. Given a coarse-grain trajectory, we need a way of assigning an intensity to each pixel. We tried various methods until we hand-evolved one that was able to reproduce the MNIST images fairly accurately, but we suspect that many other methods would be just as good. For each point on the coarse trajectory, we share two units of ink between the the four closest pixels using bilinear interpolation. We also use linear interpolation to add three ﬁne-grain trajectory points between every pair of coarse-grain points. These ﬁne-grain points also contribute ink to the pixels using bilinear interpolation, but the amount of ink they contribute is zero if they are less than one pixel apart and rises linearly to the same amount as the coarse-grain points if they are more than two pixels apart. This generates a thin skeleton with a fairly uniform ink density. To ﬂesh-out the skeleton, we use two “ink parameters”, a a a a a, b, to specify a 3 × 3 kernel of the form b(1 + a)[ 12 , a , 12 ; a , 1 − a, a ; 12 , a , 12 ] which 6 6 6 6 is convolved with the image four times. Finally, the pixel intensities are clipped to lie in the interval [0,1]. The matlab code is at www.cs.toronto.edu/∼ hinton/code. The values of 2a and b/1.5 are additional, logistic outputs of the recognition networks1 . 3 Training the recognition networks The obvious way to learn a recognition network is to use a training set in which the inputs are images and the target outputs are the motor programs that were used to generate those images. If we knew the distribution over motor programs for a given digit class, we could easily produce such a set by running the generator. Unfortunately, the distribution over motor programs is exactly what we want to learn from the data, so we need a way to train 1 We can add all sorts of parameters to the hand-coded generative model and then get the recognition networks to learn to extract the appropriate values for each image. The global mass and viscosity as well as the spacing of the rails that hold the springs can be learned. We can even implement afﬁnelike transformations by attaching the four springs to endpoints whose eight coordinates are given by the recognition networks. These extra parameters make the learning slower and, for the normalized digits, they do not improve discrimination, probably because they help the wrong digit models as much as the right one. the recognition network without knowing this distribution in advance. Generating scribbles from random motor programs will not work because the capacity of the network will be wasted on irrelevant images that are far from the real data. Figure 2 shows how a single, prototype motor program can be used to initialize a learning process that creates its own training data. The prototype consists of a sequence of 4 × 17 spring stiffnesses that are used to set the biases on 68 of the 70 logistic output units of the recognition net. If the weights coming from the 400 hidden units are initially very small, the recognition net will then output a motor program that is a close approximation to the prototype, whatever the input image. Some random noise is then added to this motor program and it is used to generate a training image. So initially, all of the generated training images are very similar to the one produced by the prototype. The recognition net will therefore devote its capacity to modeling the way in which small changes in these images map to small changes in the motor program. Images in the MNIST training set that are close to the prototype will then be given their correct motor programs. This will tend to stretch the distribution of motor programs produced by the network along the directions that correspond to the manifold on which the digits lie. As time goes by, the generated training set will expand along the manifold for that digit class until all of the MNIST training images of that class are well modelled by the recognition network. It takes about 10 hours in matlab on a 3 GHz Xeon to train each recognition network. We use minibatches of size 100, momentum of 0.9, and adaptive learning rates on each connection that increase additively when the sign of the gradient agrees with the sign of the previous weight change and decrease multiplicatively when the signs disagree [9]. The net is generating its own training data, so the objective function is always changing which makes it inadvisable to use optimization methods that go as far as they can in a carefully chosen direction. Figures 3 and 4 show some examples of how well the recognition nets perform after training. Nearly all models achieve an average squared pixel error of less than 15 per image on their validation set (pixel intensities are between 0 and 1 with a preponderance of extreme values). The inferred motor programs are clearly good enough to capture the diverse handwriting styles in the data. They are not good enough, however, to give classiﬁcation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the MNIST database. So we added a series of enhancements to the basic system to improve the classiﬁcation accuracy. 4 Enhancements to the basic system Extra strokes in ones and sevens. One limitation of the basic system is that it draws digits using only a single stroke (i.e. the trajectory is a single, unbroken curve). But when people draw digits, they often add extra strokes to them. Two of the most common examples are the dash at the bottom of ones, and the dash through the middle of sevens (see examples in ﬁgure 5). About 2.2% of ones and 13% of sevens in the MNIST training set are dashed and not modelling the dashes reduces classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly. We model dashed ones and sevens by augmenting their basic motor programs with another motor program to draw the dash. For example, a dashed seven is generated by ﬁrst drawing an ordinary seven using the motor program computed by the seven model, and then drawing the dash with a motor program computed by a separate neural network that models only dashes. Dashes in ones and sevens are modeled with two different networks. Their training proceeds the same way as with the other models, except now there are only 50 hidden units and the training set contains only the dashed cases of the digit. (Separating these cases from the rest of the MNIST training set is easy because they can be quickly spotted by looking at the difference between the images and their reconstructions by the dashless digit model.) The net takes the entire image of a digit as input, and computes the motor program for just the dash. When reconstructing an unlabelled image as say, a seven, we compute both Figure 3: Examples of validation set images reconstructed by their corresponding model. In each case the original image is on the left and the reconstruction is on the right. Superimposed on the original image is the pen trajectory. the dashed and dashless versions of seven and pick the one with the lower squared pixel error to be that image’s reconstruction as a seven. Figure 5 shows examples of images reconstructed using the extra stroke. Local search. When reconstructing an image in its own class, a digit model often produces a sensible, overall approximation of the image. However, some of the ﬁner details of the reconstruction may be slightly wrong and need to be ﬁxed up by an iterative local search that adjusts the motor program to reduce the reconstruction error. We ﬁrst approximate the graphics model with a neural network that contains a single hidden layer of 500 logistic units. We train one such generative network for each of the ten digits and for the dashed version of ones and sevens (for a total of 12 nets). The motor programs used for training are obtained by adding noise to the motor programs inferred from the training data by the relevant, fully trained recognition network. The images produced from these motor programs by the graphics model are used as the targets for the supervised learning of each generative network. Given these targets, the weight updates are computed in the same way as for the recognition networks. Figure 4: To model 4’s we use a single smooth trajectory, but turn off the ink for timesteps 9 and 10. For images in which the pen does not need to leave the paper, the recognition net ﬁnds a trajectory in which points 8 and 11 are close together so that points 9 and 10 are not needed. For 5’s we leave the top until last and turn off the ink for timesteps 13 and 14. Figure 5: Examples of dashed ones and sevens reconstructed using a second stroke. The pen trajectory for the dash is shown in blue, superimposed on the original image. Initial squared pixel error = 33.8 10 iterations, error = 15.2 20 iterations, error = 10.5 30 iterations, error = 9.3 Figure 6: An example of how local search improves the detailed registration of the trajectory found by the correct model. After 30 iterations, the squared pixel error is less than a third of its initial value. Once the generative network is trained, we can use it to iteratively improve the initial motor program computed by the recognition network for an image. The main steps in one iteration are: 1) compute the error between the image and the reconstruction generated from the current motor program by the graphics model; 2) backpropagate the reconstruction error through the generative network to calculate its gradient with respect to the motor program; 3) compute a new motor program by taking a step along the direction of steepest descent plus 0.5 times the previous step. Figure 6 shows an example of how local search improves the reconstruction by the correct model. Local search is usually less effective at improving the ﬁts of the wrong models, so it eliminates about 20% of the classiﬁcation errors on the validation set. PCA model of the image residuals. The sum of squared pixel errors is not the best way of comparing an image with its reconstruction, because it treats the residual pixel errors as independent and zero-mean Gaussian distributed, which they are not. By modelling the structure in the residual vectors, we can get a better estimate of the conditional probability of the image given the motor program. For each digit class, we construct a PCA model of the image residual vectors for the training images. Then, given a test image, we project the image residual vector produced by each inferred motor program onto the relevant PCA hyperplane and compute the squared distance between the residual and its projection. This gives ten scores for the image that measure the quality of its reconstructions by the digit models. We don’t discard the old sum of squared pixel errors as they are still useful for classifying most images correctly. Instead, all twenty scores are used as inputs to the classiﬁer, which decides how to combine both types of scores to achieve high classiﬁcation accuracy. PCA model of trajectories. Classifying an image by comparing its reconstruction errors for the different digit models tacitly relies on the assumption that the incorrect models will reconstruct the image poorly. Since the models have only been trained on images in their Squared error = 24.9, Shape prior score = 31.5 Squared error = 15.0, Shape prior score = 104.2 Figure 7: Reconstruction of a two image by the two model (left box) and by the three model (right box), with the pen trajectory superimposed on the original image. The three model sharply bends the bottom of its trajectory to better explain the ink, but the trajectory prior for three penalizes it with a high score. The two model has a higher squared error, but a much lower prior score, which allows the classiﬁer to correctly label the image. own class, they often do reconstruct images from other classes poorly, but occasionally they ﬁt an image from another class well. For example, ﬁgure 7 shows how the three model reconstructs a two image better than the two model by generating a highly contorted three. This problem becomes even more pronounced with local search which sometimes contorts the wrong model to ﬁt the image really well. The solution is to learn a PCA model of the trajectories that a digit model infers from images in its own class. Given a test image, the trajectory computed by each digit model is scored by its squared distance from the relevant PCA hyperplane. These 10 “prior” scores are then given to the classiﬁer along with the 20 “likelihood” scores described above. The prior scores eliminate many classiﬁcation mistakes such as the one in ﬁgure 7. 5 Classiﬁcation results To classify a test image, we apply multinomial logistic regression to the 30 scores – i.e. we use a neural network with no hidden units, 10 softmax output units and a cross-entropy error. The net is trained by gradient descent using the scores for the validation set images. To illustrate the gain in classiﬁcation accuracy achieved by the enhancements explained above, table 1 gives the percent error on the validation set as each enhancement is added to the system. Together, the enhancements almost halve the number of mistakes. Enhancements None 1 1, 2 1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3, 4 Validation set % error 4.43 3.84 3.01 2.67 2.28 Test set % error 1.82 Table 1: The gain in classiﬁcation accuracy on the validation set as the following enhancements are added: 1) extra stroke for dashed ones and sevens, 2) local search, 3) PCA model of image residual, and 4) PCA trajectory prior. To avoid using the test set for model selection, the performance on the ofﬁcial test set was only measured for the ﬁnal system. 6 Discussion After training a single neural network to output both the class label and the motor program for all classes (as described in section 1) we tried ignoring the label output and classifying the test images by using the cost, under 10 different PCA models, of the trajectory deﬁned by the inferred motor program. Each PCA model was ﬁtted to the trajectories extracted from the training images for a given class. This gave 1.80% errors which is as good as the 1.82% we got using the 10 separate recognition networks and local search. This is quite surprising because the motor programs produced by the single network were simpliﬁed to make them all have the same dimensionality and they produced signiﬁcantly poorer reconstructions. By only using the 10 digit-speciﬁc recognition nets to create the motor programs for the training data, we get much faster recognition of test data because at test time we can use a single recognition network for all classes. It also means we do not need to trade-off prior scores against image residual scores because there is only one image residual. The ability to extract motor programs could also be used to enhance the training set. [7] shows that error rates can be halved by using smooth vector distortion ﬁelds to create extra training data. They argue that these ﬁelds simulate “uncontrolled oscillations of the hand muscles dampened by inertia”. Motor noise may be better modelled by adding noise to an actual motor program as shown in ﬁgure 1. Notice that this produces a wide variety of non-blurry images and it can also change the topology. The techniques we have used for extracting motor programs from digit images may be applicable to speech. There are excellent generative models that can produce almost perfect speech if they are given the right formant parameters [10]. Using one of these generative models we may be able to train a large number of specialized recognition networks to extract formant parameters from speech without requiring labeled training data. Once this has been done, labeled data would be available for training a single feed-forward network that could recover accurate formant parameters which could be used for real-time recognition.

<p>Author: Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Active learning is the problem in supervised learning to design the locations of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. Existing active learning methods often assume that the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function can be expressed by the model at hand. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulﬁlled. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can be theoretically justiﬁed under slightly weaker condition: the model does not have to be correctly speciﬁed, but slightly misspeciﬁed models are also allowed. However, it turns out that the weakened condition is still restrictive in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose an alternative active learning method which can be theoretically justiﬁed for a wider class of misspeciﬁed models. Thus, the proposed method has a broader range of applications than the existing method. Numerical studies show that the proposed active learning method is robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and is thus reliable. 1 Introduction and Problem Formulation Let us discuss the regression problem of learning a real-valued function Ê from training examples ´Ü Ý µ ´Ü µ · ¯ Ý Ò ´Üµ deﬁned on ½ where ¯ Ò ½ are i.i.d. noise with mean zero and unknown variance ¾. We use the following linear regression model for learning. ´Ü µ ´µ Ô ½ « ³ ´Ü µ where ³ Ü Ô ½ are ﬁxed linearly independent functions and are parameters to be learned. ´ µ « ´«½ «¾ « Ô µ We evaluate the goodness of the learned function Ü by the expected squared test error over test input points and noise (i.e., the generalization error). When the test input points are drawn independently from a distribution with density ÔØ Ü , the generalization error is expressed as ´ µ ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø where ¯ denotes the expectation over the noise ¯ Ò Ô ´Üµ is known1. ½. In the following, we suppose that Ø In a standard setting of regression, the training input points are provided from the environment, i.e., Ü Ò ½ independently follow the distribution with density ÔØ Ü . On the other hand, in some cases, the training input points can be designed by users. In such cases, it is expected that the accuracy of the learning result can be improved if the training input points are chosen appropriately, e.g., by densely locating training input points in the regions of high uncertainty. ´ µ Active learning—also referred to as experimental design—is the problem of optimizing the location of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. In active learning research, it is often assumed that the regression model is correctly speciﬁed [2, 1, 3], i.e., the learning target function Ü can be expressed by the model. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. ´ µ In this paper, we ﬁrst show that the existing active learning method can still be theoretically justiﬁed when the model is approximately correct in a strong sense. Then we propose an alternative active learning method which can also be theoretically justiﬁed for approximately correct models, but the condition on the approximate correctness of the models is weaker than that for the existing method. Thus, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. In the following, we suppose that the training input points Ü Ò ½ are independently drawn from a user-deﬁned distribution with density ÔÜ Ü , and discuss the problem of ﬁnding the optimal density function. ´µ 2 Existing Active Learning Method The generalization error deﬁned by Eq.(1) can be decomposed as ·Î is the (squared) bias term and Î is the variance term given by where ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø Î and ¯ ´Üµ   ¯ ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü Ø A standard way to learn the parameters in the regression model (1) is the ordinary leastsquares learning, i.e., parameter vector « is determined as follows. « ÇÄË It is known that «ÇÄË is given by Ö« Ò Ñ « ÇÄË where Ä ÇÄË ´ µ ½ Ò ´Ü µ   Ý ½ Ä ÇÄË ³ ´Ü µ ¾ Ý and Ý ´Ý½ Ý¾ Ý Ò µ Let ÇÄË , ÇÄË and ÎÇÄË be , and Î for the learned function obtained by the ordinary least-squares learning, respectively. Then the following proposition holds. 1 In some application domains such as web page analysis or bioinformatics, a large number of unlabeled samples—input points without output values independently drawn from the distribution with density ÔØ ´Üµ—are easily gathered. In such cases, a reasonably good estimate of ÔØ ´Üµ may be obtained by some standard density estimation method. Therefore, the assumption that ÔØ ´Üµ is known may not be so restrictive. Proposition 1 ([2, 1, 3]) Suppose that the model is correctly speciﬁed, i.e., the learning target function Ü is expressed as ´µ Ô ´Ü µ Then ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ and ÎÇÄË are expressed as ÇÄË ¼ ÇÄË and Î ¾ ÇÄË Â ÇÄË where ØÖ´ÍÄ Â ÇÄË ÇÄË Ä ÇÄË µ ³ ´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü Í and Ø Therefore, for the correctly speciﬁed model (1), the generalization error as ÇÄË ¾ ÇÄË is expressed Â ÇÄË Based on this expression, the existing active learning method determines the location of training input points Ü Ò ½ (or the training input density ÔÜ Ü ) so that ÂÇÄË is minimized [2, 1, 3]. ´ µ 3 Analysis of Existing Method under Misspeciﬁcation of Models In this section, we investigate the validity of the existing active learning method for misspeciﬁed models. ´ µ Suppose the model does not exactly include the learning target function Ü , but it approximately includes it, i.e., for a scalar Æ such that Æ is small, Ü is expressed as ´ µ ´Ü µ ´Üµ · ÆÖ´Üµ where ´Üµ is the orthogonal projection of ´Üµ onto the span of residual Ö´Üµ is orthogonal to ³ ´Üµ ½ : Ô Ô ´Üµ ½ «£ ³ ´Üµ Ö´Üµ³ ´ÜµÔ ´Üµ Ü and In this case, the bias term Ø ¼ for ³ ´Üµ ½¾ Ô and the ½ Ô is expressed as ¾ ´ ´Üµ   ´Üµµ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ü is constant which does not depend on the training input density Ô ´Üµ, we subtract ¯ ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ô ´Üµ Ü · where Ø Ø Since in the following discussion.

However, for misspeciﬁed models, «ÇÄË is generally biased even asymptotically if Æ ÇÔ . ´½µ The bias of «ÇÄË is actually caused by the covariate shift [5]—the training input density ÔÜ Ü is different from the test input density ÔØ Ü . For correctly speciﬁed models, inﬂuence of the covariate shift can be ignored, as the existing active learning method does. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we should explicitly cope with the covariate shift. ´µ ´ µ Under the covariate shift, it is known that the following weighted least-squares learning is [5]. asymptotically unbiased even if Æ ÇÔ ´½µ Ô ´Ü µ Ô ´Ü µ ½ Ò Ö« Ò Ñ « Ï ÄË ¾ ´Ü µ   Ý Ø Ü Asymptotic unbiasedness of «Ï ÄË would be intuitively understood by the following identity, which is similar in spirit to importance sampling: ´Üµ   ´Üµ ¾ Ô ´Ü µ Ü ´Üµ   ´Üµ Ø ´µ ¾ Ô ´Üµ Ô ´Ü µ Ü Ô ´Üµ Ø Ü Ü In the following, we assume that ÔÜ Ü is strictly positive for all Ü.

Then we have the following lemma.

Therefore, the proposed method has a wider range of applications. The effect of this extension is experimentally investigated in the next section. ´ 5 µ Numerical Examples We evaluate the usefulness of the proposed active learning method through experiments.

Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation and ¯ . Let ÔØ Ü ½ be the Gaussian density with mean and standard deviation , which is assumed to be known here. Let Ô and the basis functions be ³ Ü Ü  ½ for . Let us consider the following three cases. Æ , where each case corresponds to “correctly speciﬁed”, “approximately correct”, and “misspeciﬁed” (see Figure 1). We choose the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the Gaussian density with mean and standard , where deviation ¼¾ ¿ ´µ ¼  ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼ ½¼ ´µ ¼ ¼¿ ½¾¿ ¼¾ ¾ We compare the accuracy of the following three methods: (A) Proposed active learning criterion + WLS learning : The training input density is determined so that ÂÏ ÄË is minimized. Following the determined input density, training input points Ü ½¼¼ are created and corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼ ½ ½ are observed. Then WLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (B) Existing active learning criterion + OLS learning [2, 1, 3]: The training input density is determined so that ÂÇÄË is minimized. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. (C) Passive learning + OLS learning: The test input density ÔØ Ü is used as the training input density. OLS learning is used for estimating the parameters. ´ µ First, we evaluate the accuracy of ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË as approximations of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . The means and standard deviations of Ï ÄË , ÂÏ ÄË , ÇÄË , and ÂÇÄË over runs are (“correctly depicted as functions of  in Figure 2. These graphs show that when Æ speciﬁed”), both ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË give accurate estimates of Ï ÄË and ÇÄË . When Æ (“approximately correct”), ÂÏ ÄË again works well, while ÂÇÄË tends to be negatively biased for large . This result is surprising since as illustrated in Figure 1, the learning target functions with Æ and Æ are visually quite similar. Therefore, it intuitively seems that the result of Æ is not much different from that of Æ . However, the simulation result shows that this slight difference makes ÂÇÄË unreliable. (“misspeciﬁed”), ÂÏ ÄË is still reasonably accurate, while ÂÇÄË is heavily When Æ biased. ½¼¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼¼ ¼ These results show that as an approximation of the generalization error, ÂÏ ÄË is more robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models than ÂÇÄË , which is in good agreement with the theoretical analyses given in Section 3 and Section 4.

When Æ , the existing method (B) works better than the proposed method (A). Actually, in this case, training input densities that approximately minimize Ï ÄË and ÇÄË were found by ÂÏ ÄË and ÂÇÄË . Therefore, the difference of the errors is caused by the difference of WLS and OLS: WLS generally has larger variance than OLS. Since bias is zero for both WLS and OLS if Æ , OLS would be more accurate than WLS. Although the proposed method (A) is outperformed by the existing method (B), it still works better than the passive learning scheme (C). When Æ and Æ the proposed method (A) gives signiﬁcantly smaller errors than other methods. ¼ ¼ ¼¼ ¼ Overall, we found that for all three cases, the proposed method (A) works reasonably well and outperforms the passive learning scheme (C). On the other hand, the existing method (B) works excellently in the correctly speciﬁed case, although it tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is found to be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable.

Each data set includes samples, consisting of -dimensional input and -dimensional output values. For convenience, every attribute is normalized into . ½¾ ¼ ½℄ ½¾ ½ Suppose we are given all input points (i.e., unlabeled samples). Note that output values are unknown. From the pool of unlabeled samples, we choose Ò input points Ü ½¼¼¼ for training and observe the corresponding output values Ý ½¼¼¼. The ½ ½ task is to predict the output values of all unlabeled samples. ½¼¼¼ In this experiment, the test input density independent Gaussian density. Ô ´Üµ and ­ Ø ´¾ ­¾ ÅÄ Ô ´Üµ is unknown. Ø µ  ÜÔ    Ü   ¾ ÅÄ So we estimate it using the ¾ ´¾­¾ µ¡ ÅÄ where Å Ä are the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and standard ÅÄ and the basis functions be deviation obtained from all unlabeled samples. Let Ô where Ø ³ ´Üµ ¼ ½   ÜÔ   Ü   Ø ¾ ¡ ¾ ¼ for ½¾ ¼ are template points randomly chosen from the pool of unlabeled samples. ´µ We select the training input density ÔÜ Ü from the independent Gaussian density with mean Å Ä and standard deviation ­Å Ä , where  ¼ ¼ ¼ ¾ In this simulation, we can not create the training input points in an arbitrary location because we only have samples. Therefore, we ﬁrst create temporary input points following the determined training input density, and then choose the input points from the pool of unlabeled samples that are closest to the temporary input points. For each data set, we repeat this simulation times, by changing the template points Ø ¼ ½ in each run. ½¾ ½¼¼ ½¼¼ The means and standard deviations of the test error over runs are described in Table 2. The proposed method (A) outperforms the existing method (B) for ﬁve data sets, while it is outperformed by (B) for the other three data sets. We conjecture that the model used for learning is almost correct in these three data sets. This result implies that the proposed method (A) is slightly better than the existing method (B). Figure 3 depicts the relative performance of the proposed method (A) and the existing method (B) compared with the passive learning scheme (C). This shows that (A) outperforms (C) for all eight data sets, while (B) is comparable or is outperformed by (C) for ﬁve data sets. Therefore, the proposed method (A) is overall shown to work better than other schemes. 6 Conclusions We argued that active learning is essentially the situation under the covariate shift—the training input density is different from the test input density. When the model used for learning is correctly speciﬁed, the covariate shift does not matter. However, for misspeciﬁed models, we have to explicitly cope with the covariate shift. In this paper, we proposed a new active learning method based on the weighted least-squares learning. The numerical study showed that the existing method works better than the proposed method if model is correctly speciﬁed. However, the existing method tends to perform poorly once the correctness of the model is violated. On the other hand, the proposed method overall worked reasonably well and it consistently outperformed the passive learning scheme. Therefore, the proposed method would be robust against the misspeciﬁcation of models and thus it is reliable. The proposed method can be theoretically justiﬁed if the model is approximately correct in a weak sense. However, it is no longer valid for totally misspeciﬁed models. A natural future direction would be therefore to devise an active learning method which has theoretical guarantee with totally misspeciﬁed models. It is also important to notice that when the model is totally misspeciﬁed, even learning with optimal training input points would not be successful anyway. In such cases, it is of course important to carry out model selection. In active learning research—including the present paper, however, the location of training input points are designed for a single model at hand. That is, the model should have been chosen before performing active learning. Devising a method for simultaneously optimizing models and the location of training input points would be a more important and promising future direction.

<p>Author: Jack Wang, Aaron Hertzmann, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (GPDM) for nonlinear time series analysis. A GPDM comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dynamics, and a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed-form, using Gaussian Process (GP) priors for both the dynamics and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We demonstrate the approach on human motion capture data in which each pose is 62-dimensional. Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.

<p>Author: Edward Meeds, Simon Osindero</p><p>Abstract: We present an inﬁnite mixture model in which each component comprises a multivariate Gaussian distribution over an input space, and a Gaussian Process model over an output space. Our model is neatly able to deal with non-stationary covariance functions, discontinuities, multimodality and overlapping output signals. The work is similar to that by Rasmussen and Ghahramani [1]; however, we use a full generative model over input and output space rather than just a conditional model. This allows us to deal with incomplete data, to perform inference over inverse functional mappings as well as for regression, and also leads to a more powerful and consistent Bayesian speciﬁcation of the effective ‘gating network’ for the different experts. 1</p><p>6 0.83971184 <a title="113-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Sparse_Gaussian_Processes_using_Pseudo-inputs.html">179 nips-2005-Sparse Gaussian Processes using Pseudo-inputs</a></p>

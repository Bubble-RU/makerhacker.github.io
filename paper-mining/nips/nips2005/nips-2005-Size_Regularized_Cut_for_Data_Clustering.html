<p>Author: Rong Jin, Feng Kang, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering enjoys its success in both data clustering and semisupervised learning. But, most spectral clustering algorithms cannot handle multi-class clustering problems directly. Additional strategies are needed to extend spectral clustering algorithms to multi-class clustering problems. Furthermore, most spectral clustering algorithms employ hard cluster membership, which is likely to be trapped by the local optimum. In this paper, we present a new spectral clustering algorithm, named “Soft Cut”. It improves the normalized cut algorithm by introducing soft membership, and can be efﬁciently computed using a bound optimization algorithm. Our experiments with a variety of datasets have shown the promising performance of the proposed clustering algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.32695886 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Fixing_two_weaknesses_of_the_Spectral_Method.html">75 nips-2005-Fixing two weaknesses of the Spectral Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Lang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss two intrinsic weaknesses of the spectral graph partitioning method, both of which have practical consequences. The ﬁrst is that spectral embeddings tend to hide the best cuts from the commonly used hyperplane rounding method. Rather than cleaning up the resulting suboptimal cuts with local search, we recommend the adoption of ﬂow-based rounding. The second weakness is that for many “power law” graphs, the spectral method produces cuts that are highly unbalanced, thus decreasing the usefulness of the method for visualization (see ﬁgure 4(b)) or as a basis for divide-and-conquer algorithms. These balance problems, which occur even though the spectral method’s quotient-style objective function does encourage balance, can be ﬁxed with a stricter balance constraint that turns the spectral mathematical program into an SDP that can be solved for million-node graphs by a method of Burer and Monteiro. 1 Background Graph partitioning is the NP-hard problem of ﬁnding a small graph cut subject to the constraint that neither side of the resulting partitioning of the nodes is “too small”. We will be dealing with several versions: the graph bisection problem, which requires perfect 1 : 1 2 2 balance; the β-balanced cut problem (with β a fraction such as 1 ), which requires at least 3 β : (1 − β) balance; and the quotient cut problem, which requires the small side to be large enough to “pay for” the edges in the cut. The quotient cut metric is c/ min(a, b), where c is the cutsize and a and b are the sizes of the two sides of the cut. All of the well-known variants of the quotient cut metric (e.g. normalized cut [15]) have similar behavior with respect to the issues discussed in this paper. The spectral method for graph partitioning was introduced in 1973 by Fiedler and Donath & Hoffman [6]. In the mid-1980’s Alon & Milman [1] proved that spectral cuts can be at worst quadratically bad; in the mid 1990’s Guattery & Miller [10] proved that this analysis is tight by exhibiting a family of n-node graphs whose spectral bisections cut O(n 2/3 ) edges versus the optimal O(n1/3 ) edges. On the other hand, Spielman & Teng [16] have proved stronger performance guarantees for the special case of spacelike graphs. The spectral method can be derived by relaxing a quadratic integer program which encodes the graph bisection problem (see section 3.1). The solution to this relaxation is the “Fiedler vector”, or second smallest eigenvector of the graph’s discrete Laplacian matrix, whose elements xi can be interpreted as an embedding of the graph on the line. To obtain a (A) Graph with nearly balanced 8-cut (B) Spectral Embedding (C) Notional Flow-based Embedding Figure 1: The spectral embedding hides the best solution from hyperplane rounding. speciﬁc cut, one must apply a “rounding method” to this embedding. The hyperplane rounding method chooses one of the n − 1 cuts which separate the nodes whose x i values lie above and below some split value x. ˆ 2 Using ﬂow to ﬁnd cuts that are hidden from hyperplane rounding Theorists have long known that the spectral method cannot distinguish between deep cuts and long paths, and that this confusion can cause it to cut a graph in the wrong direction thereby producing the spectral method’s worst-case behavior [10]. In this section we will show by example that even when the spectral method is not fooled into cutting in the wrong direction, the resulting embedding can hide the best cuts from the hyperplane rounding method. This is a possible explanation for the frequently made empirical observation (see e.g. [12]) that hyperplane roundings of spectral embeddings are noisy and therefore beneﬁt from cleanup with a local search method such as Fiduccia-Matheyses [8]. Consider the graph in ﬁgure 1(a), which has a near-bisection cutting 8 edges. For this graph the spectral method produces the embedding shown in ﬁgure 1(b), and recommends that we make a vertical cut (across the horizontal dimension which is based on the Fiedler vector). This is correct in a generalized sense, but it is obvious that no hyperplane (or vertical line in this picture) can possibly extract the optimal 8-edge cut. Some insight into why spectral embeddings tend to have this problem can be obtained from the spectral method’s electrical interpretation. In this view the graph is represented by a resistor network [7]. Current ﬂowing in this network causes voltage drops across the resistors, thus determining the nodes’ voltages and hence their positions. When current ﬂows through a long series of resistors, it induces a progressive voltage drop. This is what causes the excessive length of the embeddings of the horizontal girder-like structures which are blocking all vertical hyperplane cuts in ﬁgure 1(b). If the embedding method were somehow not based on current, but rather on ﬂow, which does not distinguish between a pipe and a series of pipes, then the long girders could retract into the two sides of the embedding, as suggested by ﬁgure 1(c), and the best cut would be revealed. Because theoretical ﬂow-like embedding methods such as [14] are currently not practical, we point out that in cases like ﬁgure 1(b), where the spectral method has not chosen an incorrect direction for the cut, one can use an S-T max ﬂow problem with the ﬂow running in the recommended direction (horizontally for this embedding) to extract the good cut even though it is hidden from all hyperplanes. We currently use two different ﬂow-based rounding methods. A method called MQI looks for quotient cuts, and is already described in [13]. Another method, that we shall call Midﬂow, looks for β-balanced cuts. The input to Midﬂow is a graph and an ordering of its nodes (obtained e.g. from a spectral embedding or from the projection of any embedding onto a line). We divide the graph’s nodes into 3 sets F, L, and U. The sets F and L respectively contain the ﬁrst βn and last βn nodes in the ordering, and U contains the remaining 50-50 balance ng s ro un di Hy pe r pl an e neg-pos split quotient cut score (cutsize / size of small side) 0.01 ctor r ve iedle of F 0.004 0.003 0.00268 0.00232 Best hyperplane rounding of Fiedler Vector Best improvement with local search 0.002 0.00138 0.001 60000 80000 Midflow rounding beta = 1/4 100000 120000 0.00145 140000 Midflow rounding of Fiedler Vector beta = 1/3 160000 180000 200000 220000 240000 number of nodes on ’left’ side of cut (out of 324800) Figure 2: A typical example (see section 2.1) where ﬂow-based rounding beats hyperplane rounding, even when the hyperplane cuts are improved with Fiduccia-Matheyses search. Note that for this spacelike graph, the best quotient cuts have reasonably good balance. U = n − 2βn nodes, which are “up for grabs”. We set up an S-T max ﬂow problem with one node for every graph node plus 2 new nodes for the source and sink. For each graph edge there are two arcs, one in each direction, with unit capacity. Finally, the nodes in F are pinned to the source and the nodes in L are pinned to sink by inﬁnite capacity arcs. This max-ﬂow problem can be solved by a good implementation of the push-relabel algorithm (such as Goldberg and Cherkassky’s hi pr [4]) in time that empirically is nearly linear with a very good constant factor. Figure 6 shows that solving a MidFlow problem with hi pr can be 1000 times cheaper than ﬁnding a spectral embedding with ARPACK. When the goal is ﬁnding good β-balanced cuts, MidFlow rounding is strictly more powerful than hyperplane rounding; from a given node ordering hyperplane rounding chooses the best of U + 1 candidate cuts, while MidFlow rounding chooses the best of 2U candidates, including all of those considered by hyperplane rounding. [Similarly, MQI rounding is strictly more powerful than hyperplane rounding for the task of ﬁnding good quotient cuts.] 2.1 A concrete example The plot in ﬁgure 2 shows a number of cuts in a 324,800 node nearly planar graph derived from a 700x464 pixel downward-looking view of some clouds over some mountains.1 The y-axis of the plot is quotient cut score; smaller values are better. We note in passing that the commonly used split point x = 0 does not yield the best hyperplane cut. Our main ˆ point is that the two cuts generated by MidFlow rounding of the Fiedler vector (with β = 1 3 and β = 1 ) are nearly twice as good as the best hyperplane cut. Even after the best 4 hyperplane cut has been improved by taking the best result of 100 runs of a version of Fiduccia-Matheyses local search, it is still much worse than the cuts obtained by ﬂowbased rounding. 1 The graph’s edges are unweighted but are chosen by a randomized rule which is more likely to include an edge between two neighboring pixels if they have a similar grey value. Good cuts in the graph tend to run along discontinuities in the image, as one would expect. quotient cut score 1 SDP-LB (smaller is better) 0.1 Scatter plot showing cuts in a</p><p>4 0.18580393 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple clustering framework on graphs encoding pairwise data similarities. Unlike usual similarity-based methods, the approach softly assigns data to clusters in a probabilistic way. More importantly, a hierarchical clustering is naturally derived in this framework to gradually merge lower-level clusters into higher-level ones. A random walk analysis indicates that the algorithm exposes clustering structures in various resolutions, i.e., a higher level statistically models a longer-term diffusion on graphs and thus discovers a more global clustering structure. Finally we provide very encouraging experimental results. 1</p><p>5 0.17546603 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Q-Clustering.html">159 nips-2005-Q-Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Mukund Narasimhan, Nebojsa Jojic, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We show that Queyranne’s algorithm for minimizing symmetric submodular functions can be used for clustering with a variety of different objective functions. Two speciﬁc criteria that we consider in this paper are the single linkage and the minimum description length criteria. The ﬁrst criterion tries to maximize the minimum distance between elements of different clusters, and is inherently “discriminative”. It is known that optimal clusterings into k clusters for any given k in polynomial time for this criterion can be computed. The second criterion seeks to minimize the description length of the clusters given a probabilistic generative model. We show that the optimal partitioning into 2 clusters, and approximate partitioning (guaranteed to be within a factor of 2 of the the optimal) for more clusters can be computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a tractable algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal clustering with respect to the MDL criterion for 2 clusters has been given. Besides the optimality result for the MDL criterion, the chief contribution of this paper is to show that the same algorithm can be used to optimize a broad class of criteria, and hence can be used for many application speciﬁc criterion for which efﬁcient algorithm are not known.</p><p>6 0.17237915 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Kernelized_Infomax_Clustering.html">102 nips-2005-Kernelized Infomax Clustering</a></p>

The quotient cut metric is c/ min(a, b), where c is the cutsize and a and b are the sizes of the two sides of the cut. All of the well-known variants of the quotient cut metric (e.g. normalized cut [15]) have similar behavior with respect to the issues discussed in this paper.

In this section we will show by example that even when the spectral method is not fooled into cutting in the wrong direction, the resulting embedding can hide the best cuts from the hyperplane rounding method. This is a possible explanation for the frequently made empirical observation (see e.g. [12]) that hyperplane roundings of spectral embeddings are noisy and therefore beneﬁt from cleanup with a local search method such as Fiduccia-Matheyses [8]. Consider the graph in ﬁgure 1(a), which has a near-bisection cutting 8 edges. For this graph the spectral method produces the embedding shown in ﬁgure 1(b), and recommends that we make a vertical cut (across the horizontal dimension which is based on the Fiedler vector). This is correct in a generalized sense, but it is obvious that no hyperplane (or vertical line in this picture) can possibly extract the optimal 8-edge cut. Some insight into why spectral embeddings tend to have this problem can be obtained from the spectral method’s electrical interpretation. In this view the graph is represented by a resistor network [7]. Current ﬂowing in this network causes voltage drops across the resistors, thus determining the nodes’ voltages and hence their positions. When current ﬂows through a long series of resistors, it induces a progressive voltage drop. This is what causes the excessive length of the embeddings of the horizontal girder-like structures which are blocking all vertical hyperplane cuts in ﬁgure 1(b). If the embedding method were somehow not based on current, but rather on ﬂow, which does not distinguish between a pipe and a series of pipes, then the long girders could retract into the two sides of the embedding, as suggested by ﬁgure 1(c), and the best cut would be revealed. Because theoretical ﬂow-like embedding methods such as [14] are currently not practical, we point out that in cases like ﬁgure 1(b), where the spectral method has not chosen an incorrect direction for the cut, one can use an S-T max ﬂow problem with the ﬂow running in the recommended direction (horizontally for this embedding) to extract the good cut even though it is hidden from all hyperplanes. We currently use two different ﬂow-based rounding methods. A method called MQI looks for quotient cuts, and is already described in [13]. Another method, that we shall call Midﬂow, looks for β-balanced cuts. The input to Midﬂow is a graph and an ordering of its nodes (obtained e.g. from a spectral embedding or from the projection of any embedding onto a line).

We set up an S-T max ﬂow problem with one node for every graph node plus 2 new nodes for the source and sink. For each graph edge there are two arcs, one in each direction, with unit capacity. Finally, the nodes in F are pinned to the source and the nodes in L are pinned to sink by inﬁnite capacity arcs. This max-ﬂow problem can be solved by a good implementation of the push-relabel algorithm (such as Goldberg and Cherkassky’s hi pr [4]) in time that empirically is nearly linear with a very good constant factor. Figure 6 shows that solving a MidFlow problem with hi pr can be 1000 times cheaper than ﬁnding a spectral embedding with ARPACK. When the goal is ﬁnding good β-balanced cuts, MidFlow rounding is strictly more powerful than hyperplane rounding; from a given node ordering hyperplane rounding chooses the best of U + 1 candidate cuts, while MidFlow rounding chooses the best of 2U candidates, including all of those considered by hyperplane rounding. [Similarly, MQI rounding is strictly more powerful than hyperplane rounding for the task of ﬁnding good quotient cuts.] 2.1 A concrete example The plot in ﬁgure 2 shows a number of cuts in a 324,800 node nearly planar graph derived from a 700x464 pixel downward-looking view of some clouds over some mountains.1 The y-axis of the plot is quotient cut score; smaller values are better. We note in passing that the commonly used split point x = 0 does not yield the best hyperplane cut. Our main ˆ point is that the two cuts generated by MidFlow rounding of the Fiedler vector (with β = 1 3 and β = 1 ) are nearly twice as good as the best hyperplane cut. Even after the best 4 hyperplane cut has been improved by taking the best result of 100 runs of a version of Fiduccia-Matheyses local search, it is still much worse than the cuts obtained by ﬂowbased rounding. 1 The graph’s edges are unweighted but are chosen by a randomized rule which is more likely to include an edge between two neighboring pixels if they have a similar grey value.

<p>Author: Mukund Narasimhan, Nebojsa Jojic, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We show that Queyranne’s algorithm for minimizing symmetric submodular functions can be used for clustering with a variety of different objective functions. Two speciﬁc criteria that we consider in this paper are the single linkage and the minimum description length criteria. The ﬁrst criterion tries to maximize the minimum distance between elements of different clusters, and is inherently “discriminative”. It is known that optimal clusterings into k clusters for any given k in polynomial time for this criterion can be computed. The second criterion seeks to minimize the description length of the clusters given a probabilistic generative model. We show that the optimal partitioning into 2 clusters, and approximate partitioning (guaranteed to be within a factor of 2 of the the optimal) for more clusters can be computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a tractable algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal clustering with respect to the MDL criterion for 2 clusters has been given. Besides the optimality result for the MDL criterion, the chief contribution of this paper is to show that the same algorithm can be used to optimize a broad class of criteria, and hence can be used for many application speciﬁc criterion for which efﬁcient algorithm are not known.</p><p>5 0.50461841 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre V. Schaik, Richard Reeve, Craig Jin, Tara Hamilton</p><p>Abstract: Female crickets can locate males by phonotaxis to the mating song they produce. The behaviour and underlying physiology has been studied in some depth showing that the cricket auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. We present an analogue very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of this process and show that results from testing the circuit agree with simulation and what is known from the behaviour and physiology of the cricket auditory system. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway. 1 In trod u ction Understanding how insects carry out complex sensorimotor tasks can help in the design of simple sensory and robotic systems. Often insect sensors have evolved into intricate filters matched to extract highly specific data from the environment which solves a particular problem directly with little or no need for further processing [1]. Examples include head stabilisation in the fly, which uses vision amongst other senses to estimate self-rotation and thus to stabilise its head in flight, and phonotaxis in the cricket. Because of the narrowness of the cricket body (only a few millimetres), the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) for sounds arriving at the two sides of the head is very small (10–20µs). Even with the tympanal membranes (eardrums) located, as they are, on the forelegs of the cricket, the ITD only reaches about 40µs, which is too low to detect directly from timings of neural spikes. Because the wavelength of the cricket calling song is significantly greater than the width of the cricket body the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) is also very low. In the absence of ITD or IID information, the cricket uses phase to determine direction. This is possible because the male cricket produces an almost pure tone for its calling song. * School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. + Figure 1: The cricket auditory system. Four acoustic inputs channel sounds directly or through tracheal tubes onto two tympanal membranes. Sound from contralateral inputs has to pass a (double) central membrane (the medial septum), inducing a phase delay and reduction in gain. The sound transmission from the contralateral tympanum is very weak, making each eardrum effectively a 3 input system. The physics of the cricket auditory system is well understood [2]; the system (see Figure 1) uses a pair of sound receivers with four acoustic inputs, two on the forelegs, which are the external surfaces of the tympana, and two on the body, the prothoracic or acoustic spiracles [3]. The connecting tracheal tubes are such that interference occurs as sounds travel inside the cricket, producing a directional response at the tympana to frequencies near to that of the calling song. The amplitude of vibration of the tympana, and hence the firing rate of the auditory afferent neurons attached to them, vary as a sound source is moved around the cricket and the sounds from the different inputs move in and out of phase. The outputs of the two tympana match when the sound is straight ahead, and the inputs are bilaterally symmetric with respect to the sound source. However, when sound at the calling song frequency is off-centre the phase of signals on the closer side comes better into alignment, and the signal increases on that side, and conversely decreases on the other. It is that crossover of tympanal vibration amplitudes which allows the cricket to track a sound source (see Figure 6 for example). A simplified version of the auditory system using only two acoustic inputs was implemented in hardware [4], and a simple 8-neuron network was all that was required to then direct a robot to carry out phonotaxis towards a species-specific calling song [5]. A simple simulator was also created to model the behaviour of the auditory system of Figure 1 at different frequencies [6]. Data from Michelsen et al. [2] (Figures 5 and 6) were digitised, and used together with average and “typical” values from the paper to choose gains and delays for the simulation. Figure 2 shows the model of the internal auditory system of the cricket from sound arriving at the acoustic inputs through to transmission down auditory receptor fibres. The simulator implements this model up to the summing of the delayed inputs, as well as modelling the external sound transmission. Results from the simulator were used to check the directionality of the system at different frequencies, and to gain a better understanding of its response. It was impractical to check the effect of leg movements or of complex sounds in the simulator due to the necessity of simulating the sound production and transmission. An aVLSI chip was designed to implement the same model, both allowing more complex experiments, such as leg movements to be run, and experiments to be run in the real world. Figure 2: A model of the auditory system of the cricket, used to build the simulator and the aVLSI implementation (shown in boxes). These experiments with the simulator and the circuits are being published in [6] and the reader is referred to those papers for more details. In the present paper we present the details of the circuits used for the aVLSI implementation. 2 Circuits The chip, implementing the aVLSI box in Figure 2, comprises two all-pass delay filters, three gain circuits, a second-order narrow-band band-pass filter, a first-order wide-band band-pass filter, a first-order high-pass filter, as well as supporting circuitry (including reference voltages, currents, etc.). A single aVLSI chip (MOSIS tiny-chip) thus includes half the necessary circuitry to model the complete auditory system of a cricket. The complete model of the auditory system can be obtained by using two appropriately connected chips. Only two all-pass delay filters need to be implemented instead of three as suggested by Figure 2, because it is only the relative delay between the three pathways arriving at the one summing node that counts. The delay circuits were implemented with fully-differential gm-C filters. In order to extend the frequency range of the delay, a first-order all-pass delay circuit was cascaded with a second-order all-pass delay circuit. The resulting addition of the first-order delay and the second-order delay allowed for an approximately flat delay response for a wider bandwidth as the decreased delay around the corner frequency of the first-order filter cancelled with the increased delay of the second-order filter around its resonant frequency. Figure 3 shows the first- and second-order sections of the all-pass delay circuit. Two of these circuits were used and, based on data presented in [2], were designed with delays of 28µs and 62µs, by way of bias current manipulation. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in figure 3 is a standard OTA which includes the common-mode feedback necessary for fully differential designs. The buffers (Figure 3) are simple, cascoded differential pairs. V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ Figure 3: The first-order all-pass delay circuit (left) and the second-order all-pass delay (right). The differential output of the delay circuits is converted into a current which is multiplied by a variable gain implemented as shown in Figure 4. The gain cell includes a differential pair with source degeneration via transistors N4 and N5. The source degeneration improves the linearity of the current. The three gain cells implemented on the aVLSI have default gains of 2, 3 and 0.91 which are set by holding the default input high and appropriately ratioing the bias currents through the value of vbiasp. To correct any on-chip mismatches and/or explore other gain configurations a current splitter cell [7] (p-splitter, figure 4) allows the gain to be programmed by digital means post fabrication. The current splitter takes an input current (Ibias, figure 4) and divides it into branches which recursively halve the current, i.e., the first branch gives ½ Ibias, the second branch ¼ Ibias, the third branch 1/8 Ibias and so on. These currents can be used together with digitally controlled switches as a Digital-to-Analogue converter. By holding default low and setting C5:C0 appropriately, any gain – from 4 to 0.125 – can be set. To save on output pins the program bits (C5:C0) for each of the three gain cells are set via a single 18-bit shift register in bit-serial fashion. Summing the output of the three gain circuits in the current domain simply involves connecting three wires together. Therefore, a natural option for the filters that follow is to use current domain filters. In our case we have chosen to implement log-domain filters using MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Figure 5 shows the basic building blocks for the filters – the Tau Cell [8] and the multiplier cell – and block diagrams showing how these blocks were connected to create the necessary filtering blocks. The Tau Cell is a log-domain filter which has the firstorder response: I out 1 , = I in sτ + 1 where τ = nC aVT Ia and n = the slope factor, VT = thermal voltage, Ca = capacitance, and Ia = bias current. In figure 5, the input currents to the Tau Cell, Imult and A*Ia, are only used when building a second-order filter. The multiplier cell is simply a translinear loop where: I out1 ∗ I mult = I out 2 ∗ AI a or Imult = AIaIout2/Iout1. The configurations of the Tau Cell to get particular responses are covered in [8] along with the corresponding equations. The high frequency filter of Figure 2 is implemented by the high-pass filter in Figure 5 with a corner frequency of 17kHz. The low frequency filter, however, is divided into two parts since the biological filter’s response (see for example Figure 3A in [9]) separates well into a narrow second-order band-pass filter with a 10kHz resonant frequency and a wide band-pass filter made from a first-order high-pass filter with a 3kHz corner frequency followed by a first-order low-pass filter with a 12kHz corner frequency. These filters are then added together to reproduce the biological filter. The filters’ responses can be adjusted post fabrication via their bias currents. This allows for compensation due to processing and matching errors. Figure 4: The Gain Cell above is used to convert the differential voltage input from the delay cells into a single-ended current output. The gain of each cell is controllable via a programmable current cell (p_splitter). An on-chip bias generator [7] was used to create all the necessary current biases on the chip. All the main blocks (delays, gain cells and filters), however, can have their on-chip bias currents overridden through external pins on the chip. The chip was fabricated using the MOSIS AMI 1.6µm technology and designed using the Cadence Custom IC Design Tools (5.0.33). 3 Methods The chip was tested using sound generated on a computer and played through a soundcard to the chip. Responses from the chip were recorded by an oscilloscope, and uploaded back to the computer on completion. Given that the output from the chip and the gain circuits is a current, an external current-sense circuit built with discrete components was used to enable the output to be probed by the oscilloscope. Figure 5: The circuit diagrams for the log-domain filter building blocks – The Tau Cell and The Multiplier – along with the block diagrams for the three filters used in the aVLSI model. Initial experiments were performed to tune the delays and gains. After that, recordings were taken of the directional frequency responses. Sounds were generated by computer for each chip input to simulate moving the forelegs by delaying the sound by the appropriate amount of time; this was a much simpler solution than using microphones and moving them using motors. 4 Results The aVLSI chip was tested to measure its gains and delays, which were successfully tuned to the appropriate values. The chip was then compared with the simulation to check that it was faithfully modelling the system. A result of this test at 4kHz (approximately the cricket calling-song frequency) is shown in Figure 6. Apart from a drop in amplitude of the signal, the response of the circuit was very similar to that of the simulator. The differences were expected because the aVLSI circuit has to deal with real-world noise, whereas the simulated version has perfect signals. Examples of the gain versus frequency response of the two log-domain band-pass filters are shown in Figure 7. Note that the narrow-band filter peaks at 6kHz, which is significantly above the mating song frequency of the cricket which is around 4.5kHz. This is not a mistake, but is observed in real crickets as well. As stated in the introduction, a range of further testing results with both the circuit and the simulator are being published in [6]. 5 D i s c u s s i on The aVLSI auditory sensor in this research models the hearing of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. It is a more faithful model of the cricket auditory system than was previously built in [4], reproducing all the acoustic inputs, as well as the responses to frequencies of both the co specific calling song and bat echolocation chirps. It also generates outputs corresponding to the two sets of behaviourally relevant auditory receptor fibres. Results showed that it matched the biological data well, though there were some inconsistencies due to an error in the specification that will be addressed in a future iteration of the design. A more complete implementation across all frequencies was impractical because of complexity and size issues as well as serving no clear behavioural purpose. Figure 6: Vibration amplitude of the left (dotted) and right (solid) virtual tympana measured in decibels in response to a 4kHz tone in simulation (left) and on the aVLSI chip (right). The plot shows the amplitude of the tympanal responses as the sound source is rotated around the cricket. Figure 7: Frequency-Gain curves for the narrow-band and wide-band bandpass filters. The long-term aim of this work is to better understand simple sensorimotor control loops in crickets and other insects. The next step is to mount this circuitry on a robot to carry out behavioural experiments, which we will compare with existing and new behavioural data (such as that in [10]). This will allow us to refine our models of the neural circuitry involved. Modelling the sensory afferent neurons in hardware is necessary in order to reduce processor load on our robot, so the next revision will include these either onboard, or on a companion chip as we have done before [11]. We will also move both sides of the auditory system onto a single chip to conserve space on the robot. It is our belief and experience that, as a result of this intelligent pre-processing carried out at the sensor level, the neural circuits necessary to accurately model the behaviour will remain simple.

<p>Author: Yixin Chen, Ya Zhang, Xiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel spectral clustering method that enables users to incorporate prior knowledge of the size of clusters into the clustering process. The cost function, which is named size regularized cut (SRcut), is deﬁned as the sum of the inter-cluster similarity and a regularization term measuring the relative size of two clusters. Finding a partition of the data set to minimize SRcut is proved to be NP-complete. An approximation algorithm is proposed to solve a relaxed version of the optimization problem as an eigenvalue problem. Evaluations over different data sets demonstrate that the method is not sensitive to outliers and performs better than normalized cut. 1</p><p>3 0.65860045 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Approach_for_Optimizing_Spectral_Clustering.html">13 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Approach for Optimizing Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>5 0.64383304 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>

A random walk analysis indicates that the algorithm exposes clustering structures in various resolutions, i.e., a higher level statistically models a longer-term diffusion on graphs and thus discovers a more global clustering structure. Finally we provide very encouraging experimental results. 1</p><p>6 0.64216673 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Off-policy_Learning_with_Options_and_Recognizers.html">144 nips-2005-Off-policy Learning with Options and Recognizers</a></p>

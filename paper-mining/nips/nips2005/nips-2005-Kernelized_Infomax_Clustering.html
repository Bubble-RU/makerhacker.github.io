<p>Author: Rong Jin, Feng Kang, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering enjoys its success in both data clustering and semisupervised learning. But, most spectral clustering algorithms cannot handle multi-class clustering problems directly. Additional strategies are needed to extend spectral clustering algorithms to multi-class clustering problems. Furthermore, most spectral clustering algorithms employ hard cluster membership, which is likely to be trapped by the local optimum. In this paper, we present a new spectral clustering algorithm, named “Soft Cut”. It improves the normalized cut algorithm by introducing soft membership, and can be efﬁciently computed using a bound optimization algorithm. Our experiments with a variety of datasets have shown the promising performance of the proposed clustering algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.34102148 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Q-Clustering.html">159 nips-2005-Q-Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Mukund Narasimhan, Nebojsa Jojic, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We show that Queyranne’s algorithm for minimizing symmetric submodular functions can be used for clustering with a variety of different objective functions. Two speciﬁc criteria that we consider in this paper are the single linkage and the minimum description length criteria. The ﬁrst criterion tries to maximize the minimum distance between elements of different clusters, and is inherently “discriminative”. It is known that optimal clusterings into k clusters for any given k in polynomial time for this criterion can be computed. The second criterion seeks to minimize the description length of the clusters given a probabilistic generative model. We show that the optimal partitioning into 2 clusters, and approximate partitioning (guaranteed to be within a factor of 2 of the the optimal) for more clusters can be computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a tractable algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal clustering with respect to the MDL criterion for 2 clusters has been given. Besides the optimality result for the MDL criterion, the chief contribution of this paper is to show that the same algorithm can be used to optimize a broad class of criteria, and hence can be used for many application speciﬁc criterion for which efﬁcient algorithm are not known.</p><p>4 0.31747806 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple clustering framework on graphs encoding pairwise data similarities. Unlike usual similarity-based methods, the approach softly assigns data to clusters in a probabilistic way. More importantly, a hierarchical clustering is naturally derived in this framework to gradually merge lower-level clusters into higher-level ones. A random walk analysis indicates that the algorithm exposes clustering structures in various resolutions, i.e., a higher level statistically models a longer-term diffusion on graphs and thus discovers a more global clustering structure. Finally we provide very encouraging experimental results. 1</p><p>5 0.2583282 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Analysis_of_Spectral_Kernel_Design_based_Semi-supervised_Learning.html">27 nips-2005-Analysis of Spectral Kernel Design based Semi-supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang, Rie Kubota Ando</p><p>Abstract: We consider a framework for semi-supervised learning using spectral decomposition based un-supervised kernel design. This approach subsumes a class of previously proposed semi-supervised learning methods on data graphs. We examine various theoretical properties of such methods. In particular, we derive a generalization performance bound, and obtain the optimal kernel design by minimizing the bound. Based on the theoretical analysis, we are able to demonstrate why spectral kernel design based methods can often improve the predictive performance. Experiments are used to illustrate the main consequences of our analysis.</p><p>6 0.20893785 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Fusion_of_Similarity_Data_in_Clustering.html">79 nips-2005-Fusion of Similarity Data in Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Krupka, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We argue that when objects are characterized by many attributes, clustering them on the basis of a relatively small random subset of these attributes can capture information on the unobserved attributes as well. Moreover, we show that under mild technical conditions, clustering the objects on the basis of such a random subset performs almost as well as clustering with the full attribute set. We prove a ﬁnite sample generalization theorems for this novel learning scheme that extends analogous results from the supervised learning setting. The scheme is demonstrated for collaborative ﬁltering of users with movies rating as attributes. 1</p><p>5 0.81487048 <a title="102-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-A_Probabilistic_Approach_for_Optimizing_Spectral_Clustering.html">13 nips-2005-A Probabilistic Approach for Optimizing Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Amy Greenwald, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: Although variants of value iteration have been proposed for ﬁnding Nash or correlated equilibria in general-sum Markov games, these variants have not been shown to be effective in general. In this paper, we demonstrate by construction that existing variants of value iteration cannot ﬁnd stationary equilibrium policies in arbitrary general-sum Markov games. Instead, we propose an alternative interpretation of the output of value iteration based on a new (non-stationary) equilibrium concept that we call “cyclic equilibria.” We prove that value iteration identiﬁes cyclic equilibria in a class of games in which it fails to ﬁnd stationary equilibria. We also demonstrate empirically that value iteration ﬁnds cyclic equilibria in nearly all examples drawn from a random distribution of Markov games. 1</p><p>2 0.86939967 <a title="102-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Improved_risk_tail_bounds_for_on-line_algorithms.html">95 nips-2005-Improved risk tail bounds for on-line algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeremy Kubica, Joseph Masiero, Robert Jedicke, Andrew Connolly, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding sets of points that conform to a given underlying model from within a dense, noisy set of observations. This problem is motivated by the task of efﬁciently linking faint asteroid detections, but is applicable to a range of spatial queries. We survey current tree-based approaches, showing a trade-off exists between single tree and multiple tree algorithms. To this end, we present a new type of multiple tree algorithm that uses a variable number of trees to exploit the advantages of both approaches. We empirically show that this algorithm performs well using both simulated and astronomical data.</p><p>5 0.75484127 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-From_Weighted_Classification_to_Policy_Search.html">78 nips-2005-From Weighted Classification to Policy Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.75344229 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Estimating_the_wrong_Markov_random_field%3A_Benefits_in_the_computation-limited_setting.html">65 nips-2005-Estimating the wrong Markov random field: Benefits in the computation-limited setting</a></p>

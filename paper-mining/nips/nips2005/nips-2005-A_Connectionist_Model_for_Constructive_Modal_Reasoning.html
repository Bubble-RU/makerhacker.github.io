<p>Author: Viren Jain, Valentin Zhigulin, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: There is little consensus about the computational function of top-down synaptic connections in the visual system. Here we explore the hypothesis that top-down connections, like bottom-up connections, reﬂect partwhole relationships. We analyze a recurrent network with bidirectional synaptic interactions between a layer of neurons representing parts and a layer of neurons representing wholes. Within each layer, there is lateral inhibition. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. The network behaviors are illustrated by recreating Rumelhart and McClelland’s “interactive activation” model [7]. In neural network models of visual object recognition [2, 6, 8], patterns of synaptic connectivity often reﬂect part-whole relationships between the features that are represented by neurons. For example, the connections of Figure 1 reﬂect the fact that feature B both contains simpler features A1, A2, and A3, and is contained in more complex features C1, C2, and C3. Such connectivity allows neurons to follow the rule that existence of the part is evidence for existence of the whole. By combining synaptic input from multiple sources of evidence for a feature, a neuron can “decide” whether that feature is present. 1 The synapses shown in Figure 1 are purely bottom-up, directed from simple to complex features. However, there are also top-down connections in the visual system, and there is little consensus about their function. One possibility is that top-down connections also reﬂect part-whole relationships. They allow feature detectors to make decisions using the rule that existence of the whole is evidence for existence of its parts. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a recurrent network in which part-whole relationships are stored as bidirectional synaptic interactions, rather than the unidirectional interactions of Figure 1. The network has a number of interesting computational capabilities. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships 1 Synaptic connectivity may reﬂect other relationships besides part-whole. For example, invariances can be implemented by connecting detectors of several instances of the same feature to the same target, which is consequently an invariant detector of the feature. C1 C2 C3 B A1 A2 A3 Figure 1: The synaptic connections (arrows) of neuron B represent part-whole relationships. Feature B both contains simpler features and is contained in more complex features. The synaptic interactions are drawn one-way, as in most models of visual object recognition. Existence of the part is regarded as evidence for existence of the whole. This paper makes the interactions bidirectional, allowing the existence of the whole to be evidence for the existence of its parts. by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the recently developed theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. Our model is closely related to the interactive activation model of word recognition, which was proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart to explain the word superiority effect studied by visual psychologists [7]. Here our concern is not to model a psychological effect, but to characterize mathematically how computations involving part-whole relationships can be carried out by a recurrent network. 1 Network model Suppose that we are given a set of part-whole relationships speciﬁed by a ξi = 1, if part i is contained in whole a 0, otherwise We assume that every whole contains at least one part, and every part is contained in at least one whole. The stimulus drives a layer of neurons that detect parts. These neurons also interact with a layer of neurons that detect wholes. We will refer to part-detectors as “P-neurons” and whole-detectors as “W-neurons.” The part-whole relationships are directly stored in the synaptic connections between P and a W neurons. If ξi = 1, the ith neuron in the P layer and the ath neuron in the W layer have a an excitatory interaction of strength γ. If ξi = 0, the neurons have an inhibitory interaction of strength σ. Furthermore, the P-neurons inhibit each other with strength β, and the Wneurons inhibit each other with strength α. All of these interactions are symmetric, and all activation functions are the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity [z]+ = max{z, 0}. Then the dynamics of the network takes the form  ˙ Wa + Wa a Pi ξ i − σ = γ i + a (1 − ξi )Pi − α i Wb  , +  ˙ Pi + Pi (1) b=a a Wa ξ i − σ = γ a a (1 − ξi )Wa − β a Pj + B i  . j=i (2) where Bi is the input to the P layer from the stimulus. Figure 2 shows an example of a network with two wholes. Each whole contains two parts. One of the parts is contained in both wholes. -α Wa excitation γ -σ inhibition P1 B1 -β } W layer Wb -σ P2 -β B2 P3 } P layer B3 Figure 2: Model in example conﬁguration: ξ = {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1)}. When a stimulus is presented, it activates some of the P-neurons, which activate some of the W-neurons. The network eventually converges to a stable steady state. We will assume that α > 1. In the Appendix, we prove that this leads to unconditional winner-take-all behavior in the W layer. In other words, no more than one W-neuron can be active at a stable steady state. If a single W-neuron is active, then a whole has been detected. Potentially there are also many P-neurons active, indicating detection of parts. This representation may have different properties, depending on the choice of parameters β, γ, and σ. As discussed below, these include rigorous enforcement of part-whole relationships, completion of wholes by “ﬁlling in” missing parts, and non-recognition of parts that do not conform to a whole. 2 Enforcement of part-whole relationships Suppose that a single W-neuron is active at a stable steady state, so that a whole has been detected. Part-whole relationships are said to be enforced if the network always ignores parts that are not contained in the detected whole, despite potentially strong bottom-up evidence for them. It can be shown that enforcement follows from the inequality σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ > 1. (3) which guarantees that neuron i in the P layer is inactive, if neuron a in the W layer is a active and ξi = 0. When part-whole relations are enforced, prior knowledge about legal combinations of parts strictly constrains what may be perceived. This result is proven in the Appendix, and only an intuitive explanation is given here. Enforcement is easiest to understand when there is interlayer inhibition (σ > 0). In this case, the active W-neuron directly inhibits the forbidden P-neurons. The case of σ = 0 is more subtle. Then enforcement is mediated by lateral inhibition in the P layer. Excitatory feedback from the W-neuron has the effect of counteracting the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, these P-neurons become strongly activated enough to inhibit the rest of the P layer. 3 Completion of wholes by ﬁlling in missing parts If a W-neuron is active, it excites the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, even if one of these P-neurons receives no bottom-up input (Bi = 0), it is still active. We call this phenomenon “completion,” and it is guaranteed to happen when (4) γ> β The network may thus “imagine” parts that are consistent with the recognized whole, but are not actually present in the stimulus. As with enforcement, this condition depends on top-down connections. √ In the special case γ = β, the interlayer excitation between a W-neuron and its P-neurons exactly cancels out the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons at a steady state. So the recurrent connections effectively vanish, letting the activity of the P-neurons be determined by their feedforward inputs. When the interlayer excitation is stronger than this, the inequality (4) holds, and completion occurs. 4 Non-recognition of a whole If there is no interlayer inhibition (σ = 0), then a single W-neuron is always active, assuming that there is some activity in the P layer. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that all the W-neurons are inactive. Then they receive no inhibition to counteract the excitation from the P layer. This means some of them must be active, which contradicts our assumption. This means that the network always recognizes a whole, even if the stimulus is very different from any part-whole combination that is stored in the network. However, if interlayer inhibition is sufﬁciently strong (large σ), the network may refuse to recognize a whole. Neurons in the P layer are activated, but there is no activity in the W layer. Formal conditions on σ can be derived, but are not given here because of space limitations. In case of non-recognition, constraints on the P-layer are not enforced. It is possible for the network to detect a conﬁguration of parts that is not consistent with any stored whole. 5 Example: Interactive Activation model To illustrate the computational capabilities of our network, we use it to recreate the interactive activation (IA) model of McClelland and Rumelhart. Figure 3 shows numerical simulations of a network containing three layers of neurons representing strokes, letters, and words, respectively. There are 16 possible strokes in each of four letter positions. For each stroke, there are two neurons, one signaling the presence of the stroke and the other signaling its absence. Letter neurons represent each letter of the alphabet in each of four positions. Word neurons represent each of 1200 common four letter words. The letter and word layers correspond to the P and W layers that were introduced previously. There are bidirectional interactions between the letter and word layers, and lateral inhibition within the layers. The letter neurons also receive input from the stroke neurons, but this interaction is unidirectional. Our network differs in two ways from the original IA model. First, all interactions involving letter and word neurons are symmetric. In the original model, the interactions between the letter and word layers were asymmetric. In particular, inhibitory connections only ran from letter neurons to word neurons, and not vice versa. Second, the only nonlinearity in our model is rectiﬁcation. These two aspects allow us to apply the full machinery of the theory of permitted and forbidden sets. Figure 3 shows the result of presenting the stimulus “MO M” for four different settings of parameters. In each of the four cases, the word layer of the network converges to the same result, detecting the word “MOON”, which is the closest stored word to the stimulus. However, the activity in the letter layer is different in the four cases. input: P layer reconstruction W layer P layer reconstruction W layer completion noncompletion enforcement non-enforcement Figure 3: Simulation of 4 different parameter regimes in a letter- word recognition network. Within each panel, the middle column presents a feature- layer reconstruction based on the letter activity shown in the left column. W layer activity is shown in the right column. The top row shows the network state after 10 iterations of the dynamics. The bottom row shows the steady state. In the left column, the parameters obey the inequality (3), so that part- whole relationships are enforced. The activity of the letter layer is visualized by activating the strokes corresponding to each active letter neuron. The activated letters are part of the word “MOON”. In the top left, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom left, completion does not occur. In the simulations of the right column, parameters are such that part- whole relationships are not enforced. Consequently, the word layer is much more active. Bottom- up input provides evidence for several other letters, which is not suppressed. In the top right, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom right, the “O” neuron is not activated in the third position, so there is no completion. However, some letter neurons for the third position are activated, due to the input from neurons that indicate the absence of strokes. input: non-recognition event multi-stability Figure 4: Simulation of a non- recognition event and example of multistability. Figure 4 shows simulations for large σ, deep in the enforcement regime where non- recognition is a possibility. From one initial condition, the network converges to a state in which no W neurons are active, a non- recognition. From another initial condition, the network detects the word “NORM”. Deep in the enforcement regime, the top- down feedback can be so strong that the network has multiple stable states, many of which bear little resemblance to the stimulus at all. This is a problematic aspect of this network. It can be prevented by setting parameters at the edge of the enforcement regime. 6 Discussion We have analyzed a recurrent network that performs computations involving part- whole relationships. The network can ﬁll in missing parts and suppress parts that do not belong. These two computations are distinct and can be dissociated from each other, as shown in Figure 3. While these two computations can also be performed by associative memory models, they are not typically dissociable in these models. For example, in the Hopﬁeld model pattern completion and noise suppression are both the result of recall of one of a ﬁnite number of stereotyped activity patterns. We believe that our model is more appropriate for perceptual systems, because its behavior is piecewise linear, due its reliance on rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. Therefore, analog aspects of computation are able to coexist with the part-whole relationships. Furthermore, in our model the stimulus is encoded in maintained synaptic input to the network, rather than as an initial condition of the dynamics. A Appendix: Permitted and forbidden sets Our mathematical results depend on the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4], which is summarized brieﬂy here. The theory is applicable to neural networks with rectiﬁcation nonlinearity, of the form xi + xi = [bi + j Wij xj ]+ . Neuron i is said to be active when ˙ xi > 0. For a network of N neurons, there are 2N possible sets of active neurons. For each active set, consider the submatrix of Wij corresponding to the synapses between active neurons. If all eigenvalues of this submatrix have real parts less than or equal to unity, then the active set is said to be permitted. Otherwise the active set is said to be forbidden. A set is permitted if and only if there exists an input vector b such that those neurons are active at a stable steady state. Permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections Wij . If Wij is a symmetric matrix, the nesting property holds: every subset of a permitted set is permitted, and every superset of a forbidden set is forbidden. The present model can be seen as a general method for storing permitted sets in a recurrent network. This method introduces a neuron for each permitted set, relying on a unary or “grandmother cell” representation. In contrast, Xie et al.[9] used lateral inhibition in a single layer of neurons to store permitted sets. By introducing extra neurons, the present model achieves superior storage capacity, much as unary models of associative memory [1] surpass distributed models [5]. A.1 Unconditional winner-take-all in the W layer The synapses between two W-neurons have strengths 0 −α −α 0 The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±α. Therefore two W-neurons constitute a forbidden set if α > 1. By the nesting property, it follows more than two W-neurons is also a forbidden set, and that the W layer has the unconditional winner-take-all property. A.2 Part-whole combinations as permitted sets Theorem 1. Suppose that β < 1. If γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k then any combination of k ≥ 1 parts consistent with a whole corresponds to a permitted set. Proof. Consider k parts belonging to a whole. They are represented by one W-neuron and k P-neurons, with synaptic connections given by the (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix M= −β(11T − I) γ1 , γ1T 0 (5) where 1 is the k- dimensional vector whose elements are all equal to one. Two eigenvectors of M are of the form (1T c), and have the same eigenvalues as the 2 × 2 matrix −β(k − 1) γk γ 0 This matrix has eigenvalues less than one when γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k and β(k − 1) + 2 > 0. The other k − 1 eigenvectors are of the form (dT , 0), where dT 1 = 0. These have eigenvalues β. Therefore all eigenvalues of W are less than one if the condition of the theorem is satisﬁed. A.3 Constraints on combining parts Here, we derive conditions under which the network can enforce the constraint that steady state activity be conﬁned to parts that constitute a whole. Theorem 2. Suppose that β > 0 and σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1 If a W- neuron is active, then only P- neurons corresponding to parts contained in the relevant whole can be active at a stable steady state. Proof. Consider P- neurons Pi , Pj , and W- neuron Wa . Supa a pose that ξi = 1 but ξj = 0. As shown in Figure 5, the matrix of connections is given by: W = 0 −β γ −β 0 −σ γ −σ 0 (6) Wa γ Pi -σ -β Pj Figure 5: A set of one W- neuron and two P- neurons is forbidden if one part belongs to the whole and the other does not. This set is permitted if all eigenvalues of W − I have negative real parts. The characteristic equation of I − W is λ3 + b1 λ2 + b2 λ + b3 = 0, where b1 = 3, b2 = 3 − σ 2 − β 2 − γ 2 and b3 = 1−2σβγ−σ 2 −β 2 −γ 2 . According to the Routh- Hurwitz theorem, all the eigenvalues have negative real parts if and only if b1 > 0, b3 > 0 and b1 b2 > b3 . Clearly, the ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is more restrictive than the third. It is satisﬁed only when σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ < 1. Hence, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part when this condition is broken, i.e., when σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1. By the nesting property, any larger set of P- neurons inconsistent with the W- neuron is also forbidden. A.4 Completion of wholes √ Theorem 3. If γ > β and a single W- neuron a is active at a steady state, then Pi > 0 a for all i such that ξi = 1. Proof. Suppose that the detected whole has k parts. At the steady state Pi = a ξi Bi − (β − γ 2 )Ptot 1−β + where Ptot = Pi = i 1 1 − β + (β − γ 2 )k k a B i ξi i=1 (7) A.5 Preventing runaway If feedback loops cause the network activity to diverge, then the preceding analyses are not relevant. Here we give a sufﬁcient condition guaranteeing that runaway instability does not happen. It is not a necessary condition. Interestingly, the condition implies the condition of Theorem 1. Theorem 4. Suppose that P and W obey the dynamics of Eqs. (1) and (2), and deﬁne the objective function E 1−α 2 = − 2 Wa a α + 2 Wa a 1−β + 2 a Pi Wa ξi + σ Bi Pi − γ i 2 ia Pi2 i 2 β + 2 Pi i a (1 − ξi )Pi Wa .

(sketch) Differentiation of E with respect to time shows that that E is nonincreasing in the nonnegative orthant and constant only at steady states of the network dynamics. We must also show that E is radially unbounded, which is true if the quadratic part of E is copositive deﬁnite. Note that the last term of E is lower-bounded by zero and the previous term is upper bounded by γ ia Pi Wa . We assume α > 1.

<p>Author: Matthias Oster, Shih-Chii Liu</p><p>Abstract: Recurrent networks that perform a winner-take-all computation have been studied extensively. Although some of these studies include spiking networks, they consider only analog input rates. We present results of this winner-take-all computation on a network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons which receives spike trains as inputs. We show how we can conﬁgure the connectivity in the network so that the winner is selected after a pre-determined number of input spikes. We discuss spiking inputs with both regular frequencies and Poisson-distributed rates. The robustness of the computation was tested by implementing the winner-take-all network on an analog VLSI array of 64 integrate-and-ﬁre neurons which have an innate variance in their operating parameters. 1</p><p>4 0.11957983 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Efficient_estimation_of_hidden_state_dynamics_from_spike_trains.html">64 nips-2005-Efficient estimation of hidden state dynamics from spike trains</a></p>
<p>Author: Marton G. Danoczy, Richard H. R. Hahnloser</p><p>Abstract: Neurons can have rapidly changing spike train statistics dictated by the underlying network excitability or behavioural state of an animal. To estimate the time course of such state dynamics from single- or multiple neuron recordings, we have developed an algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of observed spike trains by optimizing the state lifetimes and the state-conditional interspike-interval (ISI) distributions. Our nonparametric algorithm is free of time-binning and spike-counting problems and has the computational complexity of a Mixed-state Markov Model operating on a state sequence of length equal to the total number of recorded spikes. As an example, we ﬁt a two-state model to paired recordings of premotor neurons in the sleeping songbird. We ﬁnd that the two state-conditional ISI functions are highly similar to the ones measured during waking and singing, respectively. 1</p><p>5 0.11940181 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Integrate-and-Fire_models_with_adaptation_are_good_enough.html">99 nips-2005-Integrate-and-Fire models with adaptation are good enough</a></p>
<p>Author: Renaud Jolivet, Alexander Rauch, Hans-rudolf Lüscher, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire-type models are usually criticized because of their simplicity. On the other hand, the Integrate-and-Fire model is the basis of most of the theoretical studies on spiking neuron models. Here, we develop a sequential procedure to quantitatively evaluate an equivalent Integrate-and-Fire-type model based on intracellular recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons. We ﬁnd that the resulting effective model is sufﬁcient to predict the spike train of the real pyramidal neuron with high accuracy. In in vivo-like regimes, predicted and recorded traces are almost indistinguishable and a signiﬁcant part of the spikes can be predicted at the correct timing. Slow processes like spike-frequency adaptation are shown to be a key feature in this context since they are necessary for the model to connect between different driving regimes. 1</p><p>6 0.11069497 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>

We use ensembles of neural networks to represent intuitionistic modal theories, and show that for each intuitionistic modal program there exists a corresponding neural network ensemble that computes the program.

<p>Author: Viren Jain, Valentin Zhigulin, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: There is little consensus about the computational function of top-down synaptic connections in the visual system. Here we explore the hypothesis that top-down connections, like bottom-up connections, reﬂect partwhole relationships. We analyze a recurrent network with bidirectional synaptic interactions between a layer of neurons representing parts and a layer of neurons representing wholes. Within each layer, there is lateral inhibition. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. The network behaviors are illustrated by recreating Rumelhart and McClelland’s “interactive activation” model [7]. In neural network models of visual object recognition [2, 6, 8], patterns of synaptic connectivity often reﬂect part-whole relationships between the features that are represented by neurons. For example, the connections of Figure 1 reﬂect the fact that feature B both contains simpler features A1, A2, and A3, and is contained in more complex features C1, C2, and C3. Such connectivity allows neurons to follow the rule that existence of the part is evidence for existence of the whole. By combining synaptic input from multiple sources of evidence for a feature, a neuron can “decide” whether that feature is present. 1 The synapses shown in Figure 1 are purely bottom-up, directed from simple to complex features. However, there are also top-down connections in the visual system, and there is little consensus about their function. One possibility is that top-down connections also reﬂect part-whole relationships. They allow feature detectors to make decisions using the rule that existence of the whole is evidence for existence of its parts. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a recurrent network in which part-whole relationships are stored as bidirectional synaptic interactions, rather than the unidirectional interactions of Figure 1. The network has a number of interesting computational capabilities. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships 1 Synaptic connectivity may reﬂect other relationships besides part-whole. For example, invariances can be implemented by connecting detectors of several instances of the same feature to the same target, which is consequently an invariant detector of the feature. C1 C2 C3 B A1 A2 A3 Figure 1: The synaptic connections (arrows) of neuron B represent part-whole relationships. Feature B both contains simpler features and is contained in more complex features. The synaptic interactions are drawn one-way, as in most models of visual object recognition. Existence of the part is regarded as evidence for existence of the whole. This paper makes the interactions bidirectional, allowing the existence of the whole to be evidence for the existence of its parts. by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the recently developed theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. Our model is closely related to the interactive activation model of word recognition, which was proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart to explain the word superiority effect studied by visual psychologists [7]. Here our concern is not to model a psychological effect, but to characterize mathematically how computations involving part-whole relationships can be carried out by a recurrent network. 1 Network model Suppose that we are given a set of part-whole relationships speciﬁed by a ξi = 1, if part i is contained in whole a 0, otherwise We assume that every whole contains at least one part, and every part is contained in at least one whole. The stimulus drives a layer of neurons that detect parts. These neurons also interact with a layer of neurons that detect wholes. We will refer to part-detectors as “P-neurons” and whole-detectors as “W-neurons.” The part-whole relationships are directly stored in the synaptic connections between P and a W neurons. If ξi = 1, the ith neuron in the P layer and the ath neuron in the W layer have a an excitatory interaction of strength γ. If ξi = 0, the neurons have an inhibitory interaction of strength σ. Furthermore, the P-neurons inhibit each other with strength β, and the Wneurons inhibit each other with strength α. All of these interactions are symmetric, and all activation functions are the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity [z]+ = max{z, 0}. Then the dynamics of the network takes the form  ˙ Wa + Wa a Pi ξ i − σ = γ i + a (1 − ξi )Pi − α i Wb  , +  ˙ Pi + Pi (1) b=a a Wa ξ i − σ = γ a a (1 − ξi )Wa − β a Pj + B i  . j=i (2) where Bi is the input to the P layer from the stimulus. Figure 2 shows an example of a network with two wholes. Each whole contains two parts. One of the parts is contained in both wholes. -α Wa excitation γ -σ inhibition P1 B1 -β } W layer Wb -σ P2 -β B2 P3 } P layer B3 Figure 2: Model in example conﬁguration: ξ = {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1)}. When a stimulus is presented, it activates some of the P-neurons, which activate some of the W-neurons. The network eventually converges to a stable steady state. We will assume that α > 1. In the Appendix, we prove that this leads to unconditional winner-take-all behavior in the W layer. In other words, no more than one W-neuron can be active at a stable steady state. If a single W-neuron is active, then a whole has been detected. Potentially there are also many P-neurons active, indicating detection of parts. This representation may have different properties, depending on the choice of parameters β, γ, and σ. As discussed below, these include rigorous enforcement of part-whole relationships, completion of wholes by “ﬁlling in” missing parts, and non-recognition of parts that do not conform to a whole. 2 Enforcement of part-whole relationships Suppose that a single W-neuron is active at a stable steady state, so that a whole has been detected. Part-whole relationships are said to be enforced if the network always ignores parts that are not contained in the detected whole, despite potentially strong bottom-up evidence for them. It can be shown that enforcement follows from the inequality σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ > 1. (3) which guarantees that neuron i in the P layer is inactive, if neuron a in the W layer is a active and ξi = 0. When part-whole relations are enforced, prior knowledge about legal combinations of parts strictly constrains what may be perceived. This result is proven in the Appendix, and only an intuitive explanation is given here. Enforcement is easiest to understand when there is interlayer inhibition (σ > 0). In this case, the active W-neuron directly inhibits the forbidden P-neurons. The case of σ = 0 is more subtle. Then enforcement is mediated by lateral inhibition in the P layer. Excitatory feedback from the W-neuron has the effect of counteracting the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, these P-neurons become strongly activated enough to inhibit the rest of the P layer. 3 Completion of wholes by ﬁlling in missing parts If a W-neuron is active, it excites the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, even if one of these P-neurons receives no bottom-up input (Bi = 0), it is still active. We call this phenomenon “completion,” and it is guaranteed to happen when (4) γ> β The network may thus “imagine” parts that are consistent with the recognized whole, but are not actually present in the stimulus. As with enforcement, this condition depends on top-down connections. √ In the special case γ = β, the interlayer excitation between a W-neuron and its P-neurons exactly cancels out the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons at a steady state. So the recurrent connections effectively vanish, letting the activity of the P-neurons be determined by their feedforward inputs. When the interlayer excitation is stronger than this, the inequality (4) holds, and completion occurs. 4 Non-recognition of a whole If there is no interlayer inhibition (σ = 0), then a single W-neuron is always active, assuming that there is some activity in the P layer. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that all the W-neurons are inactive. Then they receive no inhibition to counteract the excitation from the P layer. This means some of them must be active, which contradicts our assumption. This means that the network always recognizes a whole, even if the stimulus is very different from any part-whole combination that is stored in the network. However, if interlayer inhibition is sufﬁciently strong (large σ), the network may refuse to recognize a whole. Neurons in the P layer are activated, but there is no activity in the W layer. Formal conditions on σ can be derived, but are not given here because of space limitations. In case of non-recognition, constraints on the P-layer are not enforced. It is possible for the network to detect a conﬁguration of parts that is not consistent with any stored whole. 5 Example: Interactive Activation model To illustrate the computational capabilities of our network, we use it to recreate the interactive activation (IA) model of McClelland and Rumelhart. Figure 3 shows numerical simulations of a network containing three layers of neurons representing strokes, letters, and words, respectively. There are 16 possible strokes in each of four letter positions. For each stroke, there are two neurons, one signaling the presence of the stroke and the other signaling its absence. Letter neurons represent each letter of the alphabet in each of four positions. Word neurons represent each of 1200 common four letter words. The letter and word layers correspond to the P and W layers that were introduced previously. There are bidirectional interactions between the letter and word layers, and lateral inhibition within the layers. The letter neurons also receive input from the stroke neurons, but this interaction is unidirectional. Our network differs in two ways from the original IA model. First, all interactions involving letter and word neurons are symmetric. In the original model, the interactions between the letter and word layers were asymmetric. In particular, inhibitory connections only ran from letter neurons to word neurons, and not vice versa. Second, the only nonlinearity in our model is rectiﬁcation. These two aspects allow us to apply the full machinery of the theory of permitted and forbidden sets. Figure 3 shows the result of presenting the stimulus “MO M” for four different settings of parameters. In each of the four cases, the word layer of the network converges to the same result, detecting the word “MOON”, which is the closest stored word to the stimulus. However, the activity in the letter layer is different in the four cases. input: P layer reconstruction W layer P layer reconstruction W layer completion noncompletion enforcement non-enforcement Figure 3: Simulation of 4 different parameter regimes in a letter- word recognition network. Within each panel, the middle column presents a feature- layer reconstruction based on the letter activity shown in the left column. W layer activity is shown in the right column. The top row shows the network state after 10 iterations of the dynamics. The bottom row shows the steady state. In the left column, the parameters obey the inequality (3), so that part- whole relationships are enforced. The activity of the letter layer is visualized by activating the strokes corresponding to each active letter neuron. The activated letters are part of the word “MOON”. In the top left, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom left, completion does not occur. In the simulations of the right column, parameters are such that part- whole relationships are not enforced. Consequently, the word layer is much more active. Bottom- up input provides evidence for several other letters, which is not suppressed. In the top right, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom right, the “O” neuron is not activated in the third position, so there is no completion. However, some letter neurons for the third position are activated, due to the input from neurons that indicate the absence of strokes. input: non-recognition event multi-stability Figure 4: Simulation of a non- recognition event and example of multistability. Figure 4 shows simulations for large σ, deep in the enforcement regime where non- recognition is a possibility. From one initial condition, the network converges to a state in which no W neurons are active, a non- recognition. From another initial condition, the network detects the word “NORM”. Deep in the enforcement regime, the top- down feedback can be so strong that the network has multiple stable states, many of which bear little resemblance to the stimulus at all. This is a problematic aspect of this network. It can be prevented by setting parameters at the edge of the enforcement regime. 6 Discussion We have analyzed a recurrent network that performs computations involving part- whole relationships. The network can ﬁll in missing parts and suppress parts that do not belong. These two computations are distinct and can be dissociated from each other, as shown in Figure 3. While these two computations can also be performed by associative memory models, they are not typically dissociable in these models. For example, in the Hopﬁeld model pattern completion and noise suppression are both the result of recall of one of a ﬁnite number of stereotyped activity patterns. We believe that our model is more appropriate for perceptual systems, because its behavior is piecewise linear, due its reliance on rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. Therefore, analog aspects of computation are able to coexist with the part-whole relationships. Furthermore, in our model the stimulus is encoded in maintained synaptic input to the network, rather than as an initial condition of the dynamics. A Appendix: Permitted and forbidden sets Our mathematical results depend on the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4], which is summarized brieﬂy here. The theory is applicable to neural networks with rectiﬁcation nonlinearity, of the form xi + xi = [bi + j Wij xj ]+ . Neuron i is said to be active when ˙ xi > 0. For a network of N neurons, there are 2N possible sets of active neurons. For each active set, consider the submatrix of Wij corresponding to the synapses between active neurons. If all eigenvalues of this submatrix have real parts less than or equal to unity, then the active set is said to be permitted. Otherwise the active set is said to be forbidden. A set is permitted if and only if there exists an input vector b such that those neurons are active at a stable steady state. Permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections Wij . If Wij is a symmetric matrix, the nesting property holds: every subset of a permitted set is permitted, and every superset of a forbidden set is forbidden. The present model can be seen as a general method for storing permitted sets in a recurrent network. This method introduces a neuron for each permitted set, relying on a unary or “grandmother cell” representation. In contrast, Xie et al.[9] used lateral inhibition in a single layer of neurons to store permitted sets. By introducing extra neurons, the present model achieves superior storage capacity, much as unary models of associative memory [1] surpass distributed models [5]. A.1 Unconditional winner-take-all in the W layer The synapses between two W-neurons have strengths 0 −α −α 0 The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±α. Therefore two W-neurons constitute a forbidden set if α > 1. By the nesting property, it follows more than two W-neurons is also a forbidden set, and that the W layer has the unconditional winner-take-all property. A.2 Part-whole combinations as permitted sets Theorem 1. Suppose that β < 1. If γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k then any combination of k ≥ 1 parts consistent with a whole corresponds to a permitted set. Proof. Consider k parts belonging to a whole. They are represented by one W-neuron and k P-neurons, with synaptic connections given by the (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix M= −β(11T − I) γ1 , γ1T 0 (5) where 1 is the k- dimensional vector whose elements are all equal to one. Two eigenvectors of M are of the form (1T c), and have the same eigenvalues as the 2 × 2 matrix −β(k − 1) γk γ 0 This matrix has eigenvalues less than one when γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k and β(k − 1) + 2 > 0. The other k − 1 eigenvectors are of the form (dT , 0), where dT 1 = 0. These have eigenvalues β. Therefore all eigenvalues of W are less than one if the condition of the theorem is satisﬁed. A.3 Constraints on combining parts Here, we derive conditions under which the network can enforce the constraint that steady state activity be conﬁned to parts that constitute a whole. Theorem 2. Suppose that β > 0 and σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1 If a W- neuron is active, then only P- neurons corresponding to parts contained in the relevant whole can be active at a stable steady state. Proof. Consider P- neurons Pi , Pj , and W- neuron Wa . Supa a pose that ξi = 1 but ξj = 0. As shown in Figure 5, the matrix of connections is given by: W = 0 −β γ −β 0 −σ γ −σ 0 (6) Wa γ Pi -σ -β Pj Figure 5: A set of one W- neuron and two P- neurons is forbidden if one part belongs to the whole and the other does not. This set is permitted if all eigenvalues of W − I have negative real parts. The characteristic equation of I − W is λ3 + b1 λ2 + b2 λ + b3 = 0, where b1 = 3, b2 = 3 − σ 2 − β 2 − γ 2 and b3 = 1−2σβγ−σ 2 −β 2 −γ 2 . According to the Routh- Hurwitz theorem, all the eigenvalues have negative real parts if and only if b1 > 0, b3 > 0 and b1 b2 > b3 . Clearly, the ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is more restrictive than the third. It is satisﬁed only when σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ < 1. Hence, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part when this condition is broken, i.e., when σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1. By the nesting property, any larger set of P- neurons inconsistent with the W- neuron is also forbidden. A.4 Completion of wholes √ Theorem 3. If γ > β and a single W- neuron a is active at a steady state, then Pi > 0 a for all i such that ξi = 1. Proof. Suppose that the detected whole has k parts. At the steady state Pi = a ξi Bi − (β − γ 2 )Ptot 1−β + where Ptot = Pi = i 1 1 − β + (β − γ 2 )k k a B i ξi i=1 (7) A.5 Preventing runaway If feedback loops cause the network activity to diverge, then the preceding analyses are not relevant. Here we give a sufﬁcient condition guaranteeing that runaway instability does not happen. It is not a necessary condition. Interestingly, the condition implies the condition of Theorem 1. Theorem 4. Suppose that P and W obey the dynamics of Eqs. (1) and (2), and deﬁne the objective function E 1−α 2 = − 2 Wa a α + 2 Wa a 1−β + 2 a Pi Wa ξi + σ Bi Pi − γ i 2 ia Pi2 i 2 β + 2 Pi i a (1 − ξi )Pi Wa .

(sketch) Differentiation of E with respect to time shows that that E is nonincreasing in the nonnegative orthant and constant only at steady states of the network dynamics. We must also show that E is radially unbounded, which is true if the quadratic part of E is copositive deﬁnite. Note that the last term of E is lower-bounded by zero and the previous term is upper bounded by γ ia Pi Wa . We assume α > 1.

Although some of these studies include spiking networks, they consider only analog input rates. We present results of this winner-take-all computation on a network of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons which receives spike trains as inputs. We show how we can conﬁgure the connectivity in the network so that the winner is selected after a pre-determined number of input spikes. We discuss spiking inputs with both regular frequencies and Poisson-distributed rates.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Prashant Joshi, Eduardo D. Sontag</p><p>Abstract: The network topology of neurons in the brain exhibits an abundance of feedback connections, but the computational function of these feedback connections is largely unknown. We present a computational theory that characterizes the gain in computational power achieved through feedback in dynamical systems with fading memory. It implies that many such systems acquire through feedback universal computational capabilities for analog computing with a non-fading memory. In particular, we show that feedback enables such systems to process time-varying input streams in diverse ways according to rules that are implemented through internal states of the dynamical system. In contrast to previous attractor-based computational models for neural networks, these ﬂexible internal states are high-dimensional attractors of the circuit dynamics, that still allow the circuit state to absorb new information from online input streams. In this way one arrives at novel models for working memory, integration of evidence, and reward expectation in cortical circuits. We show that they are applicable to circuits of conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with high levels of noise that reﬂect experimental data on invivo conditions. 1</p><p>6 0.45313737 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-Efficient_estimation_of_hidden_state_dynamics_from_spike_trains.html">64 nips-2005-Efficient estimation of hidden state dynamics from spike trains</a></p>

<p>Author: Artur Garcez, Luis C. Lamb, Dov M. Gabbay</p><p>Abstract: We present a new connectionist model for constructive, intuitionistic modal reasoning. We use ensembles of neural networks to represent intuitionistic modal theories, and show that for each intuitionistic modal program there exists a corresponding neural network ensemble that computes the program. This provides a massively parallel model for intuitionistic modal reasoning, and sets the scene for integrated reasoning, knowledge representation, and learning of intuitionistic theories in neural networks, since the networks in the ensemble can be trained by examples using standard neural learning algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.75658154 <a title="6-lda-2" href="./nips-2005-Message_passing_for_task_redistribution_on_sparse_graphs.html">125 nips-2005-Message passing for task redistribution on sparse graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Teemu Roos, Peter Grünwald, Petri Myllymäki, Henry Tirri</p><p>Abstract: We analyze classiﬁcation error on unseen cases, i.e. cases that are different from those in the training set. Unlike standard generalization error, this off-training-set error may differ signiﬁcantly from the empirical error with high probability even with large sample sizes. We derive a datadependent bound on the difference between off-training-set and standard generalization error. Our result is based on a new bound on the missing mass, which for small samples is stronger than existing bounds based on Good-Turing estimators. As we demonstrate on UCI data-sets, our bound gives nontrivial generalization guarantees in many practical cases. In light of these results, we show that certain claims made in the No Free Lunch literature are overly pessimistic. 1</p><p>4 0.68662161 <a title="6-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Mixture_Modeling_by_Affinity_Propagation.html">127 nips-2005-Mixture Modeling by Affinity Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Delbert Dueck</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has been approached in many ways. Two general and quite different approaches include iteratively ﬁtting a mixture model (e.g., using EM) and linking together pairs of training cases that have high afﬁnity (e.g., using spectral methods). Pair-wise clustering algorithms need not compute sufﬁcient statistics and avoid poor solutions by directly placing similar examples in the same cluster. However, many applications require that each cluster of data be accurately described by a prototype or model, so afﬁnity-based clustering – and its beneﬁts – cannot be directly realized. We describe a technique called “afﬁnity propagation”, which combines the advantages of both approaches. The method learns a mixture model of the data by recursively propagating afﬁnity messages. We demonstrate afﬁnity propagation on the problems of clustering image patches for image segmentation and learning mixtures of gene expression models from microarray data. We ﬁnd that afﬁnity propagation obtains better solutions than mixtures of Gaussians, the K-medoids algorithm, spectral clustering and hierarchical clustering, and is both able to ﬁnd a pre-speciﬁed number of clusters and is able to automatically determine the number of clusters. Interestingly, afﬁnity propagation can be viewed as belief propagation in a graphical model that accounts for pairwise training case likelihood functions and the identiﬁcation of cluster centers. 1</p><p>5 0.63570648 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_Rankings_via_Convex_Hull_Separation.html">114 nips-2005-Learning Rankings via Convex Hull Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Glenn Fung, Rómer Rosales, Balaji Krishnapuram</p><p>Abstract: We propose efﬁcient algorithms for learning ranking functions from order constraints between sets—i.e. classes—of training samples. Our algorithms may be used for maximizing the generalized Wilcoxon Mann Whitney statistic that accounts for the partial ordering of the classes: special cases include maximizing the area under the ROC curve for binary classiﬁcation and its generalization for ordinal regression. Experiments on public benchmarks indicate that: (a) the proposed algorithm is at least as accurate as the current state-of-the-art; (b) computationally, it is several orders of magnitude faster and—unlike current methods—it is easily able to handle even large datasets with over 20,000 samples. 1</p><p>6 0.62575042 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Correlated_Topic_Models.html">52 nips-2005-Correlated Topic Models</a></p>

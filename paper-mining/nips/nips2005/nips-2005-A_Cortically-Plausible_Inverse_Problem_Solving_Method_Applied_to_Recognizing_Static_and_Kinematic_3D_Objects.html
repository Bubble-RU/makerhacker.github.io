[sent-5, score-0.368]
</p><p>2 If the common architecture and circuitry of the cortices is taken to imply a common computation across multiple perceptual and cognitive modalities, this visual-motor interaction might be expected to have a unified computational basis. [sent-6, score-0.162]
</p><p>3 The recently developed map-seeking method provides a mathematically tractable, cortically-plausible solution to these and a variety of other inverse problems which can be posed as the discovery of a composition of transformations between two patterns. [sent-8, score-0.485]
</p><p>4 The method relies on an ordering property of superpositions and on decomposition of the transformation spaces inherent in the generating processes of the problem. [sent-9, score-0.456]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction A variety of "brain tasks" can be tersely posed as transformation-discovery problems. [sent-10, score-0.068]
</p><p>6 The problem of recognizing the 2D projection of a known 3D object is an inverse problem of finding both the visual and pose transformations relating the image and the 3D model of the object. [sent-12, score-0.825]
</p><p>7 When the object in the image may be one of many known objects another step is added to the inverse problem, because there are multiple  candidates each of which must be mapped to the input image with possibly different transformations. [sent-13, score-0.416]
</p><p>8 When the known object is not rigid, the determination of articulations and/or morphings is added to the inverse problem. [sent-14, score-0.35]
</p><p>9 This includes the general problem of recognition of biological articulation and motion, a task recently attributed to a neuronal mirror-system linking visual and motor cortical areas [1]. [sent-15, score-0.398]
</p><p>10 Though the aggregate transformation space implicit in such problems is vast, a recently developed method for exploring vast transformation spaces has allowed some significant progress with a simple unified approach. [sent-16, score-0.565]
</p><p>11 The map-seeking method [2,4] is a general purpose mathematical procedure for finding the decomposition of the aggregate transformation between two patterns, even when that aggregate transformation space is vast and there is no prior information is available to restrict the search space. [sent-17, score-0.54]
</p><p>12 " The generality of the method is due to the fact that only the mappings are specialized to the task. [sent-20, score-0.112]
</p><p>13 The mathematics of the search, whether expressed in an algorithm or in a neuronal or electronic circuit, do not change. [sent-21, score-0.139]
</p><p>14 From an evolutionary biological point of view this is a satisfying characteristic for a model of cortical function because only the connectivity which implements the mappings must be varied to specialize a cortex to a task. [sent-22, score-0.25]
</p><p>15 All the rest - organization and dynamics - would remain the same across cortical areas. [sent-23, score-0.075]
</p><p>16 :::J  w t  Cortical neuroanatomy offers emphatic hints about the characteristics of its solution in the vast neuronal resources allocated to creating reciprocal top-down and bottomup pathways. [sent-29, score-0.292]
</p><p>17 More specifically, recent evidence suggests this reciprocal pathway architecture appears to be organized with reciprocal, co-centered fan outs in the opposing directions [3], quite possibly implementing inverse mappings. [sent-30, score-0.215]
</p><p>18 The data flow of map-seeking computations, seen in Figure I, is architecturally compatibility with these features of cortical organization. [sent-31, score-0.178]
</p><p>19 Though not within the scope of this discussion, it has been demonstrated [4] that the mathematical expression of the map-seeking method, seen in equations 6-9 below, has an isomorphic implementation in neuronal circuitry with reasonably realistic dendritic architecture and dynamics (e.

</p><p>22 3  These unifying formulations are only useful, however, if there is a tractable method of solving for the various transformations. [sent-40, score-0.036]
</p><p>23 Abstractly the problem is the discovery of a composition of transformations between two patterns. [sent-42, score-0.302]

</p><p>31 5  The indices x specify the sequence of transformations that best correspondence between vectors rand w. [sent-61, score-0.248]
</p><p>32 The problem is that C is too large a space to search for x by conventional means. [sent-62, score-0.037]
</p><p>33 Instead, a continuous embedding of C permits a search with resources proportional to the sum of sizes of the dimensions of C instead of their product. [sent-63, score-0.037]

</p><p>40 The price for moving the problem into superposition dot product space is that collusions of components of the superpositions can result in better matches for incorrect mappings than for the mappings of the correct solution. [sent-75, score-0.693]
</p><p>41 This is a consequence of the ordering property of superpositions (OPS) [2,4], which, as applied here, describes the characteristics of the surface Q. [sent-77, score-0.331]

</p><p>60 In layer 0 these hypotheses are used to gate the input image. [sent-149, score-0.306]

</p><p>74 The surface of the articulated cylinder is mapped from an axial spine. [sent-168, score-0.156]
</p><p>75 The points where that surface is tangent to the viewpoint vectors define the occluding contours which, projected in 2D, become the object silhouette. [sent-169, score-0.589]
</p><p>76 The problem is to find the articulations, segment lengths (and optionally segment diameter) which account for the occluding contour matching the silhouette in the input image. [sent-170, score-0.386]
</p><p>77 In the MSC solution, the initial state all possible articulations of the snake spine are superposed, and all the occluding contours from a range of viewing angles are projected into 2D. [sent-171, score-0.748]
</p><p>78 The latter superposition serves as the backward input to the visual space map-seeking circuit. [sent-172, score-0.479]
</p><p>79 Since the snake surfaceis determined by all of the layers of the kinematic circuit, these are projected in  parallel to form the backward (biologically top-down) 2D input to the visual transformation-discovery circuit. [sent-173, score-0.776]

The proposed operation is based on Shannon's self-information measure and is achieved in a neural circuit, which is demonstrated as having close ties with the circuitry existent in the primate visual cortex. It is further shown that the proposed saliency measure may be extended to address issues that currently elude explanation in the domain of saliency based models.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Prashant Joshi, Eduardo D. Sontag</p><p>Abstract: The network topology of neurons in the brain exhibits an abundance of feedback connections, but the computational function of these feedback connections is largely unknown. We present a computational theory that characterizes the gain in computational power achieved through feedback in dynamical systems with fading memory. It implies that many such systems acquire through feedback universal computational capabilities for analog computing with a non-fading memory. In particular, we show that feedback enables such systems to process time-varying input streams in diverse ways according to rules that are implemented through internal states of the dynamical system. In contrast to previous attractor-based computational models for neural networks, these ﬂexible internal states are high-dimensional attractors of the circuit dynamics, that still allow the circuit state to absorb new information from online input streams. In this way one arrives at novel models for working memory, integration of evidence, and reward expectation in cortical circuits. We show that they are applicable to circuits of conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with high levels of noise that reﬂect experimental data on invivo conditions. 1</p><p>4 0.096744031 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Logic_and_MRF_Circuitry_for_Labeling_Occluding_and_Thinline_Visual_Contours.html">122 nips-2005-Logic and MRF Circuitry for Labeling Occluding and Thinline Visual Contours</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric Saund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents representation and logic for labeling contrast edges and ridges in visual scenes in terms of both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, speciﬁcally contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we deﬁne a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy conﬁguration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour ﬁgures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difﬁcult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost.</p><p>5 0.096206114 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Representing_Part-Whole_Relationships_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">164 nips-2005-Representing Part-Whole Relationships in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Viren Jain, Valentin Zhigulin, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: There is little consensus about the computational function of top-down synaptic connections in the visual system. Here we explore the hypothesis that top-down connections, like bottom-up connections, reﬂect partwhole relationships. We analyze a recurrent network with bidirectional synaptic interactions between a layer of neurons representing parts and a layer of neurons representing wholes. Within each layer, there is lateral inhibition. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. The network behaviors are illustrated by recreating Rumelhart and McClelland’s “interactive activation” model [7]. In neural network models of visual object recognition [2, 6, 8], patterns of synaptic connectivity often reﬂect part-whole relationships between the features that are represented by neurons. For example, the connections of Figure 1 reﬂect the fact that feature B both contains simpler features A1, A2, and A3, and is contained in more complex features C1, C2, and C3. Such connectivity allows neurons to follow the rule that existence of the part is evidence for existence of the whole. By combining synaptic input from multiple sources of evidence for a feature, a neuron can “decide” whether that feature is present. 1 The synapses shown in Figure 1 are purely bottom-up, directed from simple to complex features. However, there are also top-down connections in the visual system, and there is little consensus about their function. One possibility is that top-down connections also reﬂect part-whole relationships. They allow feature detectors to make decisions using the rule that existence of the whole is evidence for existence of its parts. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a recurrent network in which part-whole relationships are stored as bidirectional synaptic interactions, rather than the unidirectional interactions of Figure 1. The network has a number of interesting computational capabilities. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships 1 Synaptic connectivity may reﬂect other relationships besides part-whole. For example, invariances can be implemented by connecting detectors of several instances of the same feature to the same target, which is consequently an invariant detector of the feature. C1 C2 C3 B A1 A2 A3 Figure 1: The synaptic connections (arrows) of neuron B represent part-whole relationships. Feature B both contains simpler features and is contained in more complex features. The synaptic interactions are drawn one-way, as in most models of visual object recognition. Existence of the part is regarded as evidence for existence of the whole. This paper makes the interactions bidirectional, allowing the existence of the whole to be evidence for the existence of its parts. by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the recently developed theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. Our model is closely related to the interactive activation model of word recognition, which was proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart to explain the word superiority effect studied by visual psychologists [7]. Here our concern is not to model a psychological effect, but to characterize mathematically how computations involving part-whole relationships can be carried out by a recurrent network. 1 Network model Suppose that we are given a set of part-whole relationships speciﬁed by a ξi = 1, if part i is contained in whole a 0, otherwise We assume that every whole contains at least one part, and every part is contained in at least one whole. The stimulus drives a layer of neurons that detect parts. These neurons also interact with a layer of neurons that detect wholes. We will refer to part-detectors as “P-neurons” and whole-detectors as “W-neurons.” The part-whole relationships are directly stored in the synaptic connections between P and a W neurons. If ξi = 1, the ith neuron in the P layer and the ath neuron in the W layer have a an excitatory interaction of strength γ. If ξi = 0, the neurons have an inhibitory interaction of strength σ. Furthermore, the P-neurons inhibit each other with strength β, and the Wneurons inhibit each other with strength α. All of these interactions are symmetric, and all activation functions are the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity [z]+ = max{z, 0}. Then the dynamics of the network takes the form  ˙ Wa + Wa a Pi ξ i − σ = γ i + a (1 − ξi )Pi − α i Wb  , +  ˙ Pi + Pi (1) b=a a Wa ξ i − σ = γ a a (1 − ξi )Wa − β a Pj + B i  . j=i (2) where Bi is the input to the P layer from the stimulus. Figure 2 shows an example of a network with two wholes. Each whole contains two parts. One of the parts is contained in both wholes. -α Wa excitation γ -σ inhibition P1 B1 -β } W layer Wb -σ P2 -β B2 P3 } P layer B3 Figure 2: Model in example conﬁguration: ξ = {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1)}. When a stimulus is presented, it activates some of the P-neurons, which activate some of the W-neurons. The network eventually converges to a stable steady state. We will assume that α > 1. In the Appendix, we prove that this leads to unconditional winner-take-all behavior in the W layer. In other words, no more than one W-neuron can be active at a stable steady state. If a single W-neuron is active, then a whole has been detected. Potentially there are also many P-neurons active, indicating detection of parts. This representation may have different properties, depending on the choice of parameters β, γ, and σ. As discussed below, these include rigorous enforcement of part-whole relationships, completion of wholes by “ﬁlling in” missing parts, and non-recognition of parts that do not conform to a whole. 2 Enforcement of part-whole relationships Suppose that a single W-neuron is active at a stable steady state, so that a whole has been detected. Part-whole relationships are said to be enforced if the network always ignores parts that are not contained in the detected whole, despite potentially strong bottom-up evidence for them. It can be shown that enforcement follows from the inequality σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ > 1. (3) which guarantees that neuron i in the P layer is inactive, if neuron a in the W layer is a active and ξi = 0. When part-whole relations are enforced, prior knowledge about legal combinations of parts strictly constrains what may be perceived. This result is proven in the Appendix, and only an intuitive explanation is given here. Enforcement is easiest to understand when there is interlayer inhibition (σ > 0). In this case, the active W-neuron directly inhibits the forbidden P-neurons. The case of σ = 0 is more subtle. Then enforcement is mediated by lateral inhibition in the P layer. Excitatory feedback from the W-neuron has the effect of counteracting the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, these P-neurons become strongly activated enough to inhibit the rest of the P layer. 3 Completion of wholes by ﬁlling in missing parts If a W-neuron is active, it excites the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, even if one of these P-neurons receives no bottom-up input (Bi = 0), it is still active. We call this phenomenon “completion,” and it is guaranteed to happen when (4) γ> β The network may thus “imagine” parts that are consistent with the recognized whole, but are not actually present in the stimulus. As with enforcement, this condition depends on top-down connections. √ In the special case γ = β, the interlayer excitation between a W-neuron and its P-neurons exactly cancels out the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons at a steady state. So the recurrent connections effectively vanish, letting the activity of the P-neurons be determined by their feedforward inputs. When the interlayer excitation is stronger than this, the inequality (4) holds, and completion occurs. 4 Non-recognition of a whole If there is no interlayer inhibition (σ = 0), then a single W-neuron is always active, assuming that there is some activity in the P layer. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that all the W-neurons are inactive. Then they receive no inhibition to counteract the excitation from the P layer. This means some of them must be active, which contradicts our assumption. This means that the network always recognizes a whole, even if the stimulus is very different from any part-whole combination that is stored in the network. However, if interlayer inhibition is sufﬁciently strong (large σ), the network may refuse to recognize a whole. Neurons in the P layer are activated, but there is no activity in the W layer. Formal conditions on σ can be derived, but are not given here because of space limitations. In case of non-recognition, constraints on the P-layer are not enforced. It is possible for the network to detect a conﬁguration of parts that is not consistent with any stored whole. 5 Example: Interactive Activation model To illustrate the computational capabilities of our network, we use it to recreate the interactive activation (IA) model of McClelland and Rumelhart. Figure 3 shows numerical simulations of a network containing three layers of neurons representing strokes, letters, and words, respectively. There are 16 possible strokes in each of four letter positions. For each stroke, there are two neurons, one signaling the presence of the stroke and the other signaling its absence. Letter neurons represent each letter of the alphabet in each of four positions. Word neurons represent each of 1200 common four letter words. The letter and word layers correspond to the P and W layers that were introduced previously. There are bidirectional interactions between the letter and word layers, and lateral inhibition within the layers. The letter neurons also receive input from the stroke neurons, but this interaction is unidirectional. Our network differs in two ways from the original IA model. First, all interactions involving letter and word neurons are symmetric. In the original model, the interactions between the letter and word layers were asymmetric. In particular, inhibitory connections only ran from letter neurons to word neurons, and not vice versa. Second, the only nonlinearity in our model is rectiﬁcation. These two aspects allow us to apply the full machinery of the theory of permitted and forbidden sets. Figure 3 shows the result of presenting the stimulus “MO M” for four different settings of parameters. In each of the four cases, the word layer of the network converges to the same result, detecting the word “MOON”, which is the closest stored word to the stimulus. However, the activity in the letter layer is different in the four cases. input: P layer reconstruction W layer P layer reconstruction W layer completion noncompletion enforcement non-enforcement Figure 3: Simulation of 4 different parameter regimes in a letter- word recognition network. Within each panel, the middle column presents a feature- layer reconstruction based on the letter activity shown in the left column. W layer activity is shown in the right column. The top row shows the network state after 10 iterations of the dynamics. The bottom row shows the steady state. In the left column, the parameters obey the inequality (3), so that part- whole relationships are enforced. The activity of the letter layer is visualized by activating the strokes corresponding to each active letter neuron. The activated letters are part of the word “MOON”. In the top left, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom left, completion does not occur. In the simulations of the right column, parameters are such that part- whole relationships are not enforced. Consequently, the word layer is much more active. Bottom- up input provides evidence for several other letters, which is not suppressed. In the top right, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom right, the “O” neuron is not activated in the third position, so there is no completion. However, some letter neurons for the third position are activated, due to the input from neurons that indicate the absence of strokes. input: non-recognition event multi-stability Figure 4: Simulation of a non- recognition event and example of multistability. Figure 4 shows simulations for large σ, deep in the enforcement regime where non- recognition is a possibility. From one initial condition, the network converges to a state in which no W neurons are active, a non- recognition. From another initial condition, the network detects the word “NORM”. Deep in the enforcement regime, the top- down feedback can be so strong that the network has multiple stable states, many of which bear little resemblance to the stimulus at all. This is a problematic aspect of this network. It can be prevented by setting parameters at the edge of the enforcement regime. 6 Discussion We have analyzed a recurrent network that performs computations involving part- whole relationships. The network can ﬁll in missing parts and suppress parts that do not belong. These two computations are distinct and can be dissociated from each other, as shown in Figure 3. While these two computations can also be performed by associative memory models, they are not typically dissociable in these models. For example, in the Hopﬁeld model pattern completion and noise suppression are both the result of recall of one of a ﬁnite number of stereotyped activity patterns. We believe that our model is more appropriate for perceptual systems, because its behavior is piecewise linear, due its reliance on rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. Therefore, analog aspects of computation are able to coexist with the part-whole relationships. Furthermore, in our model the stimulus is encoded in maintained synaptic input to the network, rather than as an initial condition of the dynamics. A Appendix: Permitted and forbidden sets Our mathematical results depend on the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4], which is summarized brieﬂy here. The theory is applicable to neural networks with rectiﬁcation nonlinearity, of the form xi + xi = [bi + j Wij xj ]+ . Neuron i is said to be active when ˙ xi > 0. For a network of N neurons, there are 2N possible sets of active neurons. For each active set, consider the submatrix of Wij corresponding to the synapses between active neurons. If all eigenvalues of this submatrix have real parts less than or equal to unity, then the active set is said to be permitted. Otherwise the active set is said to be forbidden. A set is permitted if and only if there exists an input vector b such that those neurons are active at a stable steady state. Permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections Wij . If Wij is a symmetric matrix, the nesting property holds: every subset of a permitted set is permitted, and every superset of a forbidden set is forbidden. The present model can be seen as a general method for storing permitted sets in a recurrent network. This method introduces a neuron for each permitted set, relying on a unary or “grandmother cell” representation. In contrast, Xie et al.[9] used lateral inhibition in a single layer of neurons to store permitted sets. By introducing extra neurons, the present model achieves superior storage capacity, much as unary models of associative memory [1] surpass distributed models [5]. A.1 Unconditional winner-take-all in the W layer The synapses between two W-neurons have strengths 0 −α −α 0 The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±α. Therefore two W-neurons constitute a forbidden set if α > 1. By the nesting property, it follows more than two W-neurons is also a forbidden set, and that the W layer has the unconditional winner-take-all property. A.2 Part-whole combinations as permitted sets Theorem 1. Suppose that β < 1. If γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k then any combination of k ≥ 1 parts consistent with a whole corresponds to a permitted set. Proof. Consider k parts belonging to a whole. They are represented by one W-neuron and k P-neurons, with synaptic connections given by the (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix M= −β(11T − I) γ1 , γ1T 0 (5) where 1 is the k- dimensional vector whose elements are all equal to one. Two eigenvectors of M are of the form (1T c), and have the same eigenvalues as the 2 × 2 matrix −β(k − 1) γk γ 0 This matrix has eigenvalues less than one when γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k and β(k − 1) + 2 > 0. The other k − 1 eigenvectors are of the form (dT , 0), where dT 1 = 0. These have eigenvalues β. Therefore all eigenvalues of W are less than one if the condition of the theorem is satisﬁed. A.3 Constraints on combining parts Here, we derive conditions under which the network can enforce the constraint that steady state activity be conﬁned to parts that constitute a whole. Theorem 2. Suppose that β > 0 and σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1 If a W- neuron is active, then only P- neurons corresponding to parts contained in the relevant whole can be active at a stable steady state. Proof. Consider P- neurons Pi , Pj , and W- neuron Wa . Supa a pose that ξi = 1 but ξj = 0. As shown in Figure 5, the matrix of connections is given by: W = 0 −β γ −β 0 −σ γ −σ 0 (6) Wa γ Pi -σ -β Pj Figure 5: A set of one W- neuron and two P- neurons is forbidden if one part belongs to the whole and the other does not. This set is permitted if all eigenvalues of W − I have negative real parts. The characteristic equation of I − W is λ3 + b1 λ2 + b2 λ + b3 = 0, where b1 = 3, b2 = 3 − σ 2 − β 2 − γ 2 and b3 = 1−2σβγ−σ 2 −β 2 −γ 2 . According to the Routh- Hurwitz theorem, all the eigenvalues have negative real parts if and only if b1 > 0, b3 > 0 and b1 b2 > b3 . Clearly, the ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is more restrictive than the third. It is satisﬁed only when σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ < 1. Hence, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part when this condition is broken, i.e., when σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1. By the nesting property, any larger set of P- neurons inconsistent with the W- neuron is also forbidden. A.4 Completion of wholes √ Theorem 3. If γ > β and a single W- neuron a is active at a steady state, then Pi > 0 a for all i such that ξi = 1. Proof. Suppose that the detected whole has k parts. At the steady state Pi = a ξi Bi − (β − γ 2 )Ptot 1−β + where Ptot = Pi = i 1 1 − β + (β − γ 2 )k k a B i ξi i=1 (7) A.5 Preventing runaway If feedback loops cause the network activity to diverge, then the preceding analyses are not relevant. Here we give a sufﬁcient condition guaranteeing that runaway instability does not happen. It is not a necessary condition. Interestingly, the condition implies the condition of Theorem 1. Theorem 4. Suppose that P and W obey the dynamics of Eqs. (1) and (2), and deﬁne the objective function E 1−α 2 = − 2 Wa a α + 2 Wa a 1−β + 2 a Pi Wa ξi + σ Bi Pi − γ i 2 ia Pi2 i 2 β + 2 Pi i a (1 − ξi )Pi Wa .

(sketch) Differentiation of E with respect to time shows that that E is nonincreasing in the nonnegative orthant and constant only at steady states of the network dynamics. We must also show that E is radially unbounded, which is true if the quadratic part of E is copositive deﬁnite. Note that the last term of E is lower-bounded by zero and the previous term is upper bounded by γ ia Pi Wa . We assume α > 1.

<p>Author: Viren Jain, Valentin Zhigulin, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: There is little consensus about the computational function of top-down synaptic connections in the visual system. Here we explore the hypothesis that top-down connections, like bottom-up connections, reﬂect partwhole relationships. We analyze a recurrent network with bidirectional synaptic interactions between a layer of neurons representing parts and a layer of neurons representing wholes. Within each layer, there is lateral inhibition. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. The network behaviors are illustrated by recreating Rumelhart and McClelland’s “interactive activation” model [7]. In neural network models of visual object recognition [2, 6, 8], patterns of synaptic connectivity often reﬂect part-whole relationships between the features that are represented by neurons. For example, the connections of Figure 1 reﬂect the fact that feature B both contains simpler features A1, A2, and A3, and is contained in more complex features C1, C2, and C3. Such connectivity allows neurons to follow the rule that existence of the part is evidence for existence of the whole. By combining synaptic input from multiple sources of evidence for a feature, a neuron can “decide” whether that feature is present. 1 The synapses shown in Figure 1 are purely bottom-up, directed from simple to complex features. However, there are also top-down connections in the visual system, and there is little consensus about their function. One possibility is that top-down connections also reﬂect part-whole relationships. They allow feature detectors to make decisions using the rule that existence of the whole is evidence for existence of its parts. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a recurrent network in which part-whole relationships are stored as bidirectional synaptic interactions, rather than the unidirectional interactions of Figure 1. The network has a number of interesting computational capabilities. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships 1 Synaptic connectivity may reﬂect other relationships besides part-whole. For example, invariances can be implemented by connecting detectors of several instances of the same feature to the same target, which is consequently an invariant detector of the feature. C1 C2 C3 B A1 A2 A3 Figure 1: The synaptic connections (arrows) of neuron B represent part-whole relationships. Feature B both contains simpler features and is contained in more complex features. The synaptic interactions are drawn one-way, as in most models of visual object recognition. Existence of the part is regarded as evidence for existence of the whole. This paper makes the interactions bidirectional, allowing the existence of the whole to be evidence for the existence of its parts. by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the recently developed theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. Our model is closely related to the interactive activation model of word recognition, which was proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart to explain the word superiority effect studied by visual psychologists [7]. Here our concern is not to model a psychological effect, but to characterize mathematically how computations involving part-whole relationships can be carried out by a recurrent network. 1 Network model Suppose that we are given a set of part-whole relationships speciﬁed by a ξi = 1, if part i is contained in whole a 0, otherwise We assume that every whole contains at least one part, and every part is contained in at least one whole. The stimulus drives a layer of neurons that detect parts. These neurons also interact with a layer of neurons that detect wholes. We will refer to part-detectors as “P-neurons” and whole-detectors as “W-neurons.” The part-whole relationships are directly stored in the synaptic connections between P and a W neurons. If ξi = 1, the ith neuron in the P layer and the ath neuron in the W layer have a an excitatory interaction of strength γ. If ξi = 0, the neurons have an inhibitory interaction of strength σ. Furthermore, the P-neurons inhibit each other with strength β, and the Wneurons inhibit each other with strength α. All of these interactions are symmetric, and all activation functions are the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity [z]+ = max{z, 0}. Then the dynamics of the network takes the form  ˙ Wa + Wa a Pi ξ i − σ = γ i + a (1 − ξi )Pi − α i Wb  , +  ˙ Pi + Pi (1) b=a a Wa ξ i − σ = γ a a (1 − ξi )Wa − β a Pj + B i  . j=i (2) where Bi is the input to the P layer from the stimulus. Figure 2 shows an example of a network with two wholes. Each whole contains two parts. One of the parts is contained in both wholes. -α Wa excitation γ -σ inhibition P1 B1 -β } W layer Wb -σ P2 -β B2 P3 } P layer B3 Figure 2: Model in example conﬁguration: ξ = {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1)}. When a stimulus is presented, it activates some of the P-neurons, which activate some of the W-neurons. The network eventually converges to a stable steady state. We will assume that α > 1. In the Appendix, we prove that this leads to unconditional winner-take-all behavior in the W layer. In other words, no more than one W-neuron can be active at a stable steady state. If a single W-neuron is active, then a whole has been detected. Potentially there are also many P-neurons active, indicating detection of parts. This representation may have different properties, depending on the choice of parameters β, γ, and σ. As discussed below, these include rigorous enforcement of part-whole relationships, completion of wholes by “ﬁlling in” missing parts, and non-recognition of parts that do not conform to a whole. 2 Enforcement of part-whole relationships Suppose that a single W-neuron is active at a stable steady state, so that a whole has been detected. Part-whole relationships are said to be enforced if the network always ignores parts that are not contained in the detected whole, despite potentially strong bottom-up evidence for them. It can be shown that enforcement follows from the inequality σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ > 1. (3) which guarantees that neuron i in the P layer is inactive, if neuron a in the W layer is a active and ξi = 0. When part-whole relations are enforced, prior knowledge about legal combinations of parts strictly constrains what may be perceived. This result is proven in the Appendix, and only an intuitive explanation is given here. Enforcement is easiest to understand when there is interlayer inhibition (σ > 0). In this case, the active W-neuron directly inhibits the forbidden P-neurons. The case of σ = 0 is more subtle. Then enforcement is mediated by lateral inhibition in the P layer. Excitatory feedback from the W-neuron has the effect of counteracting the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, these P-neurons become strongly activated enough to inhibit the rest of the P layer. 3 Completion of wholes by ﬁlling in missing parts If a W-neuron is active, it excites the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, even if one of these P-neurons receives no bottom-up input (Bi = 0), it is still active. We call this phenomenon “completion,” and it is guaranteed to happen when (4) γ> β The network may thus “imagine” parts that are consistent with the recognized whole, but are not actually present in the stimulus. As with enforcement, this condition depends on top-down connections. √ In the special case γ = β, the interlayer excitation between a W-neuron and its P-neurons exactly cancels out the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons at a steady state. So the recurrent connections effectively vanish, letting the activity of the P-neurons be determined by their feedforward inputs. When the interlayer excitation is stronger than this, the inequality (4) holds, and completion occurs. 4 Non-recognition of a whole If there is no interlayer inhibition (σ = 0), then a single W-neuron is always active, assuming that there is some activity in the P layer. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that all the W-neurons are inactive. Then they receive no inhibition to counteract the excitation from the P layer. This means some of them must be active, which contradicts our assumption. This means that the network always recognizes a whole, even if the stimulus is very different from any part-whole combination that is stored in the network. However, if interlayer inhibition is sufﬁciently strong (large σ), the network may refuse to recognize a whole. Neurons in the P layer are activated, but there is no activity in the W layer. Formal conditions on σ can be derived, but are not given here because of space limitations. In case of non-recognition, constraints on the P-layer are not enforced. It is possible for the network to detect a conﬁguration of parts that is not consistent with any stored whole. 5 Example: Interactive Activation model To illustrate the computational capabilities of our network, we use it to recreate the interactive activation (IA) model of McClelland and Rumelhart. Figure 3 shows numerical simulations of a network containing three layers of neurons representing strokes, letters, and words, respectively. There are 16 possible strokes in each of four letter positions. For each stroke, there are two neurons, one signaling the presence of the stroke and the other signaling its absence. Letter neurons represent each letter of the alphabet in each of four positions. Word neurons represent each of 1200 common four letter words. The letter and word layers correspond to the P and W layers that were introduced previously. There are bidirectional interactions between the letter and word layers, and lateral inhibition within the layers. The letter neurons also receive input from the stroke neurons, but this interaction is unidirectional. Our network differs in two ways from the original IA model. First, all interactions involving letter and word neurons are symmetric. In the original model, the interactions between the letter and word layers were asymmetric. In particular, inhibitory connections only ran from letter neurons to word neurons, and not vice versa. Second, the only nonlinearity in our model is rectiﬁcation. These two aspects allow us to apply the full machinery of the theory of permitted and forbidden sets. Figure 3 shows the result of presenting the stimulus “MO M” for four different settings of parameters. In each of the four cases, the word layer of the network converges to the same result, detecting the word “MOON”, which is the closest stored word to the stimulus. However, the activity in the letter layer is different in the four cases. input: P layer reconstruction W layer P layer reconstruction W layer completion noncompletion enforcement non-enforcement Figure 3: Simulation of 4 different parameter regimes in a letter- word recognition network. Within each panel, the middle column presents a feature- layer reconstruction based on the letter activity shown in the left column. W layer activity is shown in the right column. The top row shows the network state after 10 iterations of the dynamics. The bottom row shows the steady state. In the left column, the parameters obey the inequality (3), so that part- whole relationships are enforced. The activity of the letter layer is visualized by activating the strokes corresponding to each active letter neuron. The activated letters are part of the word “MOON”. In the top left, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom left, completion does not occur. In the simulations of the right column, parameters are such that part- whole relationships are not enforced. Consequently, the word layer is much more active. Bottom- up input provides evidence for several other letters, which is not suppressed. In the top right, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom right, the “O” neuron is not activated in the third position, so there is no completion. However, some letter neurons for the third position are activated, due to the input from neurons that indicate the absence of strokes. input: non-recognition event multi-stability Figure 4: Simulation of a non- recognition event and example of multistability. Figure 4 shows simulations for large σ, deep in the enforcement regime where non- recognition is a possibility. From one initial condition, the network converges to a state in which no W neurons are active, a non- recognition. From another initial condition, the network detects the word “NORM”. Deep in the enforcement regime, the top- down feedback can be so strong that the network has multiple stable states, many of which bear little resemblance to the stimulus at all. This is a problematic aspect of this network. It can be prevented by setting parameters at the edge of the enforcement regime. 6 Discussion We have analyzed a recurrent network that performs computations involving part- whole relationships. The network can ﬁll in missing parts and suppress parts that do not belong. These two computations are distinct and can be dissociated from each other, as shown in Figure 3. While these two computations can also be performed by associative memory models, they are not typically dissociable in these models. For example, in the Hopﬁeld model pattern completion and noise suppression are both the result of recall of one of a ﬁnite number of stereotyped activity patterns. We believe that our model is more appropriate for perceptual systems, because its behavior is piecewise linear, due its reliance on rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. Therefore, analog aspects of computation are able to coexist with the part-whole relationships. Furthermore, in our model the stimulus is encoded in maintained synaptic input to the network, rather than as an initial condition of the dynamics. A Appendix: Permitted and forbidden sets Our mathematical results depend on the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4], which is summarized brieﬂy here. The theory is applicable to neural networks with rectiﬁcation nonlinearity, of the form xi + xi = [bi + j Wij xj ]+ . Neuron i is said to be active when ˙ xi > 0. For a network of N neurons, there are 2N possible sets of active neurons. For each active set, consider the submatrix of Wij corresponding to the synapses between active neurons. If all eigenvalues of this submatrix have real parts less than or equal to unity, then the active set is said to be permitted. Otherwise the active set is said to be forbidden. A set is permitted if and only if there exists an input vector b such that those neurons are active at a stable steady state. Permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections Wij . If Wij is a symmetric matrix, the nesting property holds: every subset of a permitted set is permitted, and every superset of a forbidden set is forbidden. The present model can be seen as a general method for storing permitted sets in a recurrent network. This method introduces a neuron for each permitted set, relying on a unary or “grandmother cell” representation. In contrast, Xie et al.[9] used lateral inhibition in a single layer of neurons to store permitted sets. By introducing extra neurons, the present model achieves superior storage capacity, much as unary models of associative memory [1] surpass distributed models [5]. A.1 Unconditional winner-take-all in the W layer The synapses between two W-neurons have strengths 0 −α −α 0 The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±α. Therefore two W-neurons constitute a forbidden set if α > 1. By the nesting property, it follows more than two W-neurons is also a forbidden set, and that the W layer has the unconditional winner-take-all property. A.2 Part-whole combinations as permitted sets Theorem 1. Suppose that β < 1. If γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k then any combination of k ≥ 1 parts consistent with a whole corresponds to a permitted set. Proof. Consider k parts belonging to a whole. They are represented by one W-neuron and k P-neurons, with synaptic connections given by the (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix M= −β(11T − I) γ1 , γ1T 0 (5) where 1 is the k- dimensional vector whose elements are all equal to one. Two eigenvectors of M are of the form (1T c), and have the same eigenvalues as the 2 × 2 matrix −β(k − 1) γk γ 0 This matrix has eigenvalues less than one when γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k and β(k − 1) + 2 > 0. The other k − 1 eigenvectors are of the form (dT , 0), where dT 1 = 0. These have eigenvalues β. Therefore all eigenvalues of W are less than one if the condition of the theorem is satisﬁed. A.3 Constraints on combining parts Here, we derive conditions under which the network can enforce the constraint that steady state activity be conﬁned to parts that constitute a whole. Theorem 2. Suppose that β > 0 and σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1 If a W- neuron is active, then only P- neurons corresponding to parts contained in the relevant whole can be active at a stable steady state. Proof. Consider P- neurons Pi , Pj , and W- neuron Wa . Supa a pose that ξi = 1 but ξj = 0. As shown in Figure 5, the matrix of connections is given by: W = 0 −β γ −β 0 −σ γ −σ 0 (6) Wa γ Pi -σ -β Pj Figure 5: A set of one W- neuron and two P- neurons is forbidden if one part belongs to the whole and the other does not. This set is permitted if all eigenvalues of W − I have negative real parts. The characteristic equation of I − W is λ3 + b1 λ2 + b2 λ + b3 = 0, where b1 = 3, b2 = 3 − σ 2 − β 2 − γ 2 and b3 = 1−2σβγ−σ 2 −β 2 −γ 2 . According to the Routh- Hurwitz theorem, all the eigenvalues have negative real parts if and only if b1 > 0, b3 > 0 and b1 b2 > b3 . Clearly, the ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is more restrictive than the third. It is satisﬁed only when σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ < 1. Hence, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part when this condition is broken, i.e., when σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1. By the nesting property, any larger set of P- neurons inconsistent with the W- neuron is also forbidden. A.4 Completion of wholes √ Theorem 3. If γ > β and a single W- neuron a is active at a steady state, then Pi > 0 a for all i such that ξi = 1. Proof. Suppose that the detected whole has k parts. At the steady state Pi = a ξi Bi − (β − γ 2 )Ptot 1−β + where Ptot = Pi = i 1 1 − β + (β − γ 2 )k k a B i ξi i=1 (7) A.5 Preventing runaway If feedback loops cause the network activity to diverge, then the preceding analyses are not relevant. Here we give a sufﬁcient condition guaranteeing that runaway instability does not happen. It is not a necessary condition. Interestingly, the condition implies the condition of Theorem 1. Theorem 4. Suppose that P and W obey the dynamics of Eqs. (1) and (2), and deﬁne the objective function E 1−α 2 = − 2 Wa a α + 2 Wa a 1−β + 2 a Pi Wa ξi + σ Bi Pi − γ i 2 ia Pi2 i 2 β + 2 Pi i a (1 − ξi )Pi Wa .

(sketch) Differentiation of E with respect to time shows that that E is nonincreasing in the nonnegative orthant and constant only at steady states of the network dynamics. We must also show that E is radially unbounded, which is true if the quadratic part of E is copositive deﬁnite. Note that the last term of E is lower-bounded by zero and the previous term is upper bounded by γ ia Pi Wa . We assume α > 1.

The proposed operation is based on Shannon's self-information measure and is achieved in a neural circuit, which is demonstrated as having close ties with the circuitry existent in the primate visual cortex. It is further shown that the proposed saliency measure may be extended to address issues that currently elude explanation in the domain of saliency based models.

<p>Author: Eric Saund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents representation and logic for labeling contrast edges and ridges in visual scenes in terms of both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, speciﬁcally contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we deﬁne a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy conﬁguration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour ﬁgures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difﬁcult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost.</p><p>6 0.50786024 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-CMOL_CrossNets%3A_Possible_Neuromorphic_Nanoelectronic_Circuits.html">40 nips-2005-CMOL CrossNets: Possible Neuromorphic Nanoelectronic Circuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are attractive models for probabilistic classiﬁcation but unfortunately exact inference is analytically intractable. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) focusing on marginal likelihood estimates and predictive performance. We explain theoretically and corroborate empirically that EP is superior to Laplace. We also compare to a sophisticated MCMC scheme and show that EP is surprisingly accurate. In recent years models based on Gaussian process (GP) priors have attracted much attention in the machine learning community. Whereas inference in the GP regression model with Gaussian noise can be done analytically, probabilistic classiﬁcation using GPs is analytically intractable. Several approaches to approximate Bayesian inference have been suggested, including Laplace’s approximation, Expectation Propagation (EP), variational approximations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, some of these in conjunction with generalisation bounds, online learning schemes and sparse approximations. Despite the abundance of recent work on probabilistic GP classiﬁers, most experimental studies provide only anecdotal evidence, and no clear picture has yet emerged, as to when and why which algorithm should be preferred. Thus, from a practitioners point of view probabilistic GP classiﬁcation remains a jungle. In this paper, we set out to understand and compare two of the most wide-spread approximations: Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP). We also compare to a sophisticated, but computationally demanding MCMC scheme to examine how close the approximations are to ground truth. We examine two aspects of the approximation schemes: Firstly the accuracy of approximations to the marginal likelihood which is of central importance for model selection and model comparison. In any practical application of GPs in classiﬁcation (usually multiple) parameters of the covariance function (hyperparameters) have to be handled. Bayesian model selection provides a consistent framework for setting such parameters. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the accuracy of the marginal likelihood approximations as a function of the hyperparameters, in order to assess the practical usefulness of the approach Secondly, we need to assess the quality of the approximate probabilistic predictions. In the past, the probabilistic nature of the GP predictions have not received much attention, the focus being mostly on classiﬁcation error rates. This unfortunate state of affairs is caused primarily by typical benchmarking problems being considered outside of a realistic context. The ability of a classiﬁer to produce class probabilities or conﬁdences, have obvious relevance in most areas of application, eg. medical diagnosis. We evaluate the predictive distributions of the approximate methods, and compare to the MCMC gold standard. 1 The Gaussian Process Model for Binary Classiﬁcation Let y ∈ {−1, 1} denote the class label of an input x. Gaussian process classiﬁcation (GPC) is discriminative in modelling p(y|x) for given x by a Bernoulli distribution. The probability of success p(y = 1|x) is related to an unconstrained latent function f (x) which is mapped to the unit interval by a sigmoid transformation, eg. the logit or the probit. For reasons of analytic convenience we exclusively use the probit model p(y = 1|x) = Φ(f (x)), where Φ denotes the cumulative density function of the standard Normal distribution. In the GPC model Bayesian inference is performed about the latent function f in the light of observed data D = {(yi , xi )|i = 1, . . . , m}. Let fi = f (xi ) and f = [f1 , . . . , fm ] be shorthand for the values of the latent function and y = [y1 , . . . , ym ] and X = [x1 , . . . , xm ] collect the class labels and inputs respectively. Given the latent function the class labels are independent Bernoulli variables, so the joint likelihood factories: m m p(yi |fi ) = p(y|f ) = i=1 Φ(yi fi ), i=1 and depends on f only through its value at the observed inputs. We use a zero-mean Gaussian process prior over the latent function f with a covariance function k(x, x |θ), which may depend on hyperparameters θ [1]. The functional form and parameters of the covariance function encodes assumptions about the latent function, and adaptation of these is part of the inference. The posterior distribution over latent function values f at the observed X for given hyperparameters θ becomes: m p(f |D, θ) = N (f |0, K) Φ(yi fi ), p(D|θ) i=1 where p(D|θ) = p(y|f )p(f |X, θ)df , denotes the marginal likelihood. Unfortunately neither the marginal likelihood, nor the posterior itself, or predictions can be computed analytically, so approximations are needed. 2 Approximate Bayesian Inference For the GPC model approximations are either based on a Gaussian approximation to the posterior p(f |D, θ) ≈ q(f |D, θ) = N (f |m, A) or involve Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [2]. We compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation (EP) which are two alternative approaches to ﬁnding parameters m and A of the Gaussian q(f |D, θ). Both methods also allow approximate evaluation of the marginal likelihood, which is useful for ML-II hyperparameter optimisation. Laplace’s approximation (LA) is found by making a second order Taylor approximation of the (un-normalised) log posterior [3]. The mean m is placed at the mode (MAP) and the covariance A equals the negative inverse Hessian of the log posterior density at m. The EP approximation [4] also gives a Gaussian approximation to the posterior. The parameters m and A are found in an iterative scheme by matching the approximate marginal moments of p(fi |D, θ) by the marginals of the approximation N (fi |mi , Aii ). Although we cannot prove the convergence of EP, we conjecture that it always converges for GPC with probit likelihood, and have never encountered an exception. A key insight is that a Gaussian approximation to the GPC posterior is equivalent to a GP approximation to the posterior distribution over latent functions. For a test input x∗ the fi 1 0.16 0.14 0.8 0.6 0.1 fj p(y|f) p(f|y) 0.12 Likelihood p(y|f) Prior p(f) Posterior p(f|y) Laplace q(f|y) EP q(f|y) 0.08 0.4 0.06 0.04 0.2 0.02 0 −4 0 4 8 0 f . (a) (b) Figure 1: Panel (a) provides a one-dimensional illustration of the approximations. The prior N (f |0, 52 ) combined with the probit likelihood (y = 1) results in a skewed posterior. The likelihood uses the right axis, all other curves use the left axis. Laplace’s approximation peaks at the posterior mode, but places far too much mass over negative values of f and too little at large positive values. The EP approximation matches the ﬁrst two posterior moments, which results in a larger mean and a more accurate placement of probability mass compared to Laplace’s approximation. In Panel (b) we caricature a high dimensional zeromean Gaussian prior as an ellipse. The gray shadow indicates that for a high dimensional Gaussian most of the mass lies in a thin shell. For large latent signals (large entries in K), the likelihood essentially cuts off regions which are incompatible with the training labels (hatched area), leaving the upper right orthant as the posterior. The dot represents the mode of the posterior, which remains close to the origin. approximate predictive latent and class probabilities are: 2 q(f∗ |D, θ, x∗ ) = N (µ∗ , σ∗ ), and 2 q(y∗ = 1|D, x∗ ) = Φ(µ∗ / 1 + σ∗ ), 2 where µ∗ = k∗ K−1 m and σ∗ = k(x∗ , x∗ )−k∗ (K−1 − K−1 AK−1 )k∗ , where the vector k∗ = [k(x1 , x∗ ), . . . , k(xm , x∗ )] collects covariances between x∗ and training inputs X. MCMC sampling has the advantage that it becomes exact in the limit of long runs and so provides a gold standard by which to measure the two analytic methods described above. Although MCMC methods can in principle be used to do inference over f and θ jointly [5], we compare to methods using ML-II optimisation over θ, thus we use MCMC to integrate over f only. Good marginal likelihood estimates are notoriously difﬁcult to obtain; in our experiments we use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) [6], combining several Thermodynamic Integration runs into a single (unbiased) estimate of the marginal likelihood. Both analytic approximations have a computational complexity which is cubic O(m3 ) as common among non-sparse GP models due to inversions m × m matrices. In our implementations LA and EP need similar running times, on the order of a few minutes for several hundred data-points. Making AIS work efﬁciently requires some ﬁne-tuning and a single estimate of p(D|θ) can take several hours for data sets of a few hundred examples, but this could conceivably be improved upon. 3 Structural Properties of the Posterior and its Approximations Structural properties of the posterior can best be understood by examining its construction. The prior is a correlated m-dimensional Gaussian N (f |0, K) centred at the origin. Each likelihood term p(yi |fi ) softly truncates the half-space from the prior that is incompatible with the observed label, see Figure 1. The resulting posterior is unimodal and skewed, similar to a multivariate Gaussian truncated to the orthant containing y. The mode of the posterior remains close to the origin, while the mass is placed in accordance with the observed class labels. Additionally, high dimensional Gaussian distributions exhibit the property that most probability mass is contained in a thin ellipsoidal shell – depending on the covariance structure – away from the mean [7, ch. 29.2]. Intuitively this occurs since in high dimensions the volume grows extremely rapidly with the radius. As an effect the mode becomes less representative (typical) for the prior distribution as the dimension increases. For the GPC posterior this property persists: the mode of the posterior distribution stays relatively close to the origin, still being unrepresentative for the posterior distribution, while the mean moves to the mass of the posterior making mean and mode differ signiﬁcantly. We cannot generally assume the posterior to be close to Gaussian, as in the often studied limit of low-dimensional parametric models with large amounts of data. Therefore in GPC we must be aware of making a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. From the properties of the posterior it can be expected that Laplace’s method places m in the right orthant but too close to the origin, such that the approximation will overlap with regions having practically zero posterior mass. As an effect the amplitude of the approximate latent posterior GP will be underestimated systematically, leading to overly cautious predictive distributions. The EP approximation does not rely on a local expansion, but assumes that the marginal distributions can be well approximated by Gaussians. This assumption will be examined empirically below. 4 Experiments In this section we compare and inspect approximations for GPC using various benchmark data sets. The primary focus is not to optimise the absolute performance of GPC models but to compare the relative accuracy of approximations and to validate the arguments given in the previous section. In all experiments we use a covariance function of the form: k(x, x |θ) = σ 2 exp − 1 x − x 2 2 / 2 , (1) such that θ = [σ, ]. We refer to σ 2 as the signal variance and to as the characteristic length-scale. Note that for many classiﬁcation tasks it may be reasonable to use an individual length scale parameter for every input dimension (ARD) or a different kind of covariance function. Nevertheless, for the sake of presentability we use the above covariance function and we believe the conclusions about the accuracy of approximations to be independent of this choice, since it relies on arguments which are independent of the form of the covariance function. As measure of the accuracy of predictive probabilities we use the average information in bits of the predictions about the test targets in excess of that of random guessing. Let p∗ = p(y∗ = 1|D, θ, x∗ ) be the model’s prediction, then we average: I(p∗ , yi ) = i yi +1 2 log2 (p∗ ) + i 1−yi 2 log2 (1 − p∗ ) + H i (2) over all test cases, where H is the entropy of the training labels. The error rate E is equal to the percentage of erroneous class assignments if prediction is understood as a decision problem with symmetric costs. For the ﬁrst set of experiments presented here the well-known USPS digits and the Ionosphere data set were used. A binary sub-problem from the USPS digits is deﬁned by only considering 3’s vs. 5’s (which is probably the hardest of the binary sub-problems) and dividing the data into 767 cases for training and 773 for testing. The Ionosphere data is split into 200 training and 151 test cases. We do an exhaustive investigation on a ﬁne regular grid of values for the log hyperparameters. For each θ on the grid we compute the approximated log marginal likelihood by LA, EP and AIS. Additionally we compute the respective predictive performance (2) on the test set.

The true posterior is approximated by a normalised histogram of 9000 samples of fi obtained by MCMC sampling. Panel (c) shows a histogram of samples of a marginal distribution of a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian. The line describes a Gaussian with mean and variance estimated from the samples. For all three approximation techniques we see an agreement between marginal likelihood estimates and test performance, which justiﬁes the use of ML-II parameter estimation. But the shape of the contours and the values differ between the methods. The contours for Laplace’s method appear to be slanted compared to EP. The marginal likelihood estimates of EP and AIS agree surprisingly well1 , given that the marginal likelihood comes as a 767 respectively 200 dimensional integral. The EP predictions contain as much information about the test cases as the MCMC predictions and signiﬁcantly more than for LA. Note that for small signal variances (roughly ln(σ 2 ) < 1) LA and EP give very similar results. A possible explanation is that for small signal variances the likelihood does not truncate the prior but only down-weights the tail that disagrees with the observation. As an effect the posterior will be less skewed and both approximations will lead to similar results. For the USPS 3’s vs. 5’s we now inspect the marginal distributions p(fi |D, θ) of single latent function values under the posterior approximations for a given value of θ. We have chosen the values ln(σ) = 3.35 and ln( ) = 2.85 which are between the ML-II estimates of EP and LA. Hybrid MCMC was used to generate 9000 samples from the posterior p(f |D, θ). For LA and EP the approximate marginals are q(fi |D, θ) = N (fi |mi , Aii ) where m and A are found by the respective approximation techniques. In general we observe that the marginal distributions of MCMC samples agree very well with the respective marginal distributions of the EP approximation. For Laplace’s approximation we ﬁnd the mean to be underestimated and the marginal distributions to overlap with zero far more than the EP approximations. Figure (3a) displays the marginal distribution and its approximations for which the MCMC samples show maximal skewness. Figure (3b) shows a typical example where the EP approximation agrees very well with the MCMC samples. We show this particular example because under the EP approximation p(yi = 1|D, θ) < 0.1% but LA gives a wrong p(yi = 1|D, θ) ≈ 18%. In the experiment we saw that the marginal distributions of the posterior often agree very 1 Note that the agreement between the two seems to be limited by the accuracy of the MCMC runs, as judged by the regularity of the contour lines; the tolerance is less than one unit on a (natural) log scale. well with a Gaussian approximation. This seems to contradict the description given in the previous section were we argued that the posterior is skewed by construction. In order to inspect the marginals of a truncated high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution we made an additional synthetic experiment. We constructed a 767 dimensional Gaussian N (x|0, C) with a covariance matrix having one eigenvalue of 100 with eigenvector 1, and all other eigenvalues are 1. We then truncate this distribution such that all xi ≥ 0. Note that the mode of the truncated Gaussian is still at zero, whereas the mean moves towards the remaining mass. Figure (3c) shows a normalised histogram of samples from a marginal distribution of one xi . The samples agree very well with a Gaussian approximation. In the previous section we described the somewhat surprising property, that for a truncated high-dimensional Gaussian, resembling the posterior, the mode (used by LA) may not be particularly representative of the distribution. Although the marginal is also truncated, it is still exceptionally well modelled by a Gaussian – however, the Laplace approximation centred on the origin would be completely inappropriate. In a second set of experiments we compare the predictive performance of LA and EP for GPC on several well known benchmark problems. Each data set is randomly split into 10 folds of which one at a time is left out as a test set to measure the predictive performance of a model trained (or selected) on the remaining nine folds. All performance measures are averages over the 10 folds. For GPC we implement model selection by ML-II hyperparameter estimation, reporting results given the θ that maximised the respective approximate marginal likelihoods p(D|θ). In order to get a better picture of the absolute performance we also compare to results obtained by C-SVM classiﬁcation. The kernel we used is equivalent to the covariance function (1) without the signal variance parameter. For each fold the parameters C and are found in an inner loop of 5-fold cross-validation, in which the parameter grids are reﬁned until the performance stabilises. Predictive probabilities for test cases are obtained by mapping the unthresholded output of the SVM to [0, 1] using a sigmoid function [8]. Results are summarised in Table 1. Comparing Laplace’s method to EP the latter shows to be more accurate both in terms of error rate and information. While the error rates are relatively similar the predictive distribution obtained by EP shows to be more informative about the test targets. Note that for GPC the error rate only depends of the sign of the mean µ∗ of the approximated posterior over latent functions and not the entire posterior predictive distribution. As to be expected, the length of the mean vector m shows much larger values for the EP approximations. Comparing EP and SVMs the results are mixed. For the Crabs data set all methods show the same error rate but the information content of the predictive distributions differs dramatically. For some test cases the SVM predicts the wrong class with large certainty. 5 Summary & Conclusions Our experiments reveal serious differences between Laplace’s method and EP when used in GPC models. From the structural properties of the posterior we described why LA systematically underestimates the mean m. The resulting posterior GP over latent functions will have too small amplitude, although the sign of the mean function will be mostly correct. As an effect LA gives over-conservative predictive probabilities, and diminished information about the test labels. This effect has been show empirically on several real world examples. Large resulting discrepancies in the actual posterior probabilities were found, even at the training locations, which renders the predictive class probabilities produced under this approximation grossly inaccurate. Note, the difference becomes less dramatic if we only consider the classiﬁcation error rates obtained by thresholding p∗ at 1/2. For this particular task, we’ve seen the the sign of the latent function tends to be correct (at least at the training locations).

The ﬁrst three columns give the name of the data set, number of observations m and dimension of inputs n. For Laplace’s method and EP the table reports the average error rate E%, the average information I (2) and the average length m of the mean vector of the Gaussian approximation. For SVMs the error rate and the average information about the test targets are reported. Note that for the Crabs data set we use the sex (not the colour) of the crabs as class label. The EP approximation has shown to give results very close to MCMC both in terms of predictive distributions and marginal likelihood estimates. We have shown and explained why the marginal distributions of the posterior can be well approximated by Gaussians. Further, the marginal likelihood values obtained by LA and EP differ systematically which will lead to different results of ML-II hyperparameter estimation. The discrepancies are similar for different tasks. Using AIS we were able to show the accuracy of marginal likelihood estimates, which to the best of our knowledge has never been done before. In summary, we found that EP is the method of choice for approximate inference in binary GPC models, when the computational cost of MCMC is prohibitive. In contrast, the Laplace approximation is so inaccurate that we advise against its use, especially when predictive probabilities are to be taken seriously. Further experiments and a detailed description of the approximation schemes can be found in [2].

Shenoy</p><p>Abstract: Spiking activity from neurophysiological experiments often exhibits dynamics beyond that driven by external stimulation, presumably reﬂecting the extensive recurrence of neural circuitry. Characterizing these dynamics may reveal important features of neural computation, particularly during internally-driven cognitive operations. For example, the activity of premotor cortex (PMd) neurons during an instructed delay period separating movement-target speciﬁcation and a movementinitiation cue is believed to be involved in motor planning. We show that the dynamics underlying this activity can be captured by a lowdimensional non-linear dynamical systems model, with underlying recurrent structure and stochastic point-process output. We present and validate latent variable methods that simultaneously estimate the system parameters and the trial-by-trial dynamical trajectories. These methods are applied to characterize the dynamics in PMd data recorded from a chronically-implanted 96-electrode array while monkeys perform delayed-reach tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.45743906 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Variable_KD-Tree_Algorithms_for_Spatial_Pattern_Search_and_Discovery.html">200 nips-2005-Variable KD-Tree Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Search and Discovery</a></p>

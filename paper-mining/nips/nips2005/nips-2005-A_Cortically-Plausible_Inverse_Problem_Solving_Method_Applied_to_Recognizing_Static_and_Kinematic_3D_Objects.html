<p>Author: Antoni B. Chan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: A dynamic texture is a video model that treats a video as a sample from a spatio-temporal stochastic process, speciﬁcally a linear dynamical system. One problem associated with the dynamic texture is that it cannot model video where there are multiple regions of distinct motion. In this work, we introduce the layered dynamic texture model, which addresses this problem. We also introduce a variant of the model, and present the EM algorithm for learning each of the models.

The proposed operation is based on Shannon's self-information measure and is achieved in a neural circuit, which is demonstrated as having close ties with the circuitry existent in the primate visual cortex. It is further shown that the proposed saliency measure may be extended to address issues that currently elude explanation in the domain of saliency based models.

<p>Author: Wolfgang Maass, Prashant Joshi, Eduardo D. Sontag</p><p>Abstract: The network topology of neurons in the brain exhibits an abundance of feedback connections, but the computational function of these feedback connections is largely unknown. We present a computational theory that characterizes the gain in computational power achieved through feedback in dynamical systems with fading memory. It implies that many such systems acquire through feedback universal computational capabilities for analog computing with a non-fading memory. In particular, we show that feedback enables such systems to process time-varying input streams in diverse ways according to rules that are implemented through internal states of the dynamical system. In contrast to previous attractor-based computational models for neural networks, these ﬂexible internal states are high-dimensional attractors of the circuit dynamics, that still allow the circuit state to absorb new information from online input streams. In this way one arrives at novel models for working memory, integration of evidence, and reward expectation in cortical circuits. We show that they are applicable to circuits of conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with high levels of noise that reﬂect experimental data on invivo conditions. 1</p><p>5 0.15182973 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Representing_Part-Whole_Relationships_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">164 nips-2005-Representing Part-Whole Relationships in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Viren Jain, Valentin Zhigulin, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: There is little consensus about the computational function of top-down synaptic connections in the visual system. Here we explore the hypothesis that top-down connections, like bottom-up connections, reﬂect partwhole relationships. We analyze a recurrent network with bidirectional synaptic interactions between a layer of neurons representing parts and a layer of neurons representing wholes. Within each layer, there is lateral inhibition. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. The network behaviors are illustrated by recreating Rumelhart and McClelland’s “interactive activation” model [7]. In neural network models of visual object recognition [2, 6, 8], patterns of synaptic connectivity often reﬂect part-whole relationships between the features that are represented by neurons. For example, the connections of Figure 1 reﬂect the fact that feature B both contains simpler features A1, A2, and A3, and is contained in more complex features C1, C2, and C3. Such connectivity allows neurons to follow the rule that existence of the part is evidence for existence of the whole. By combining synaptic input from multiple sources of evidence for a feature, a neuron can “decide” whether that feature is present. 1 The synapses shown in Figure 1 are purely bottom-up, directed from simple to complex features. However, there are also top-down connections in the visual system, and there is little consensus about their function. One possibility is that top-down connections also reﬂect part-whole relationships. They allow feature detectors to make decisions using the rule that existence of the whole is evidence for existence of its parts. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a recurrent network in which part-whole relationships are stored as bidirectional synaptic interactions, rather than the unidirectional interactions of Figure 1. The network has a number of interesting computational capabilities. When the network detects a whole, it can rigorously enforce part-whole relationships 1 Synaptic connectivity may reﬂect other relationships besides part-whole. For example, invariances can be implemented by connecting detectors of several instances of the same feature to the same target, which is consequently an invariant detector of the feature. C1 C2 C3 B A1 A2 A3 Figure 1: The synaptic connections (arrows) of neuron B represent part-whole relationships. Feature B both contains simpler features and is contained in more complex features. The synaptic interactions are drawn one-way, as in most models of visual object recognition. Existence of the part is regarded as evidence for existence of the whole. This paper makes the interactions bidirectional, allowing the existence of the whole to be evidence for the existence of its parts. by ignoring parts that do not belong. The network can complete the whole by ﬁlling in missing parts. The network can refuse to recognize a whole, if the activated parts do not conform to a stored part-whole relationship. Parameter regimes in which these behaviors happen are identiﬁed using the recently developed theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4]. Our model is closely related to the interactive activation model of word recognition, which was proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart to explain the word superiority effect studied by visual psychologists [7]. Here our concern is not to model a psychological effect, but to characterize mathematically how computations involving part-whole relationships can be carried out by a recurrent network. 1 Network model Suppose that we are given a set of part-whole relationships speciﬁed by a ξi = 1, if part i is contained in whole a 0, otherwise We assume that every whole contains at least one part, and every part is contained in at least one whole. The stimulus drives a layer of neurons that detect parts. These neurons also interact with a layer of neurons that detect wholes. We will refer to part-detectors as “P-neurons” and whole-detectors as “W-neurons.” The part-whole relationships are directly stored in the synaptic connections between P and a W neurons. If ξi = 1, the ith neuron in the P layer and the ath neuron in the W layer have a an excitatory interaction of strength γ. If ξi = 0, the neurons have an inhibitory interaction of strength σ. Furthermore, the P-neurons inhibit each other with strength β, and the Wneurons inhibit each other with strength α. All of these interactions are symmetric, and all activation functions are the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity [z]+ = max{z, 0}. Then the dynamics of the network takes the form  ˙ Wa + Wa a Pi ξ i − σ = γ i + a (1 − ξi )Pi − α i Wb  , +  ˙ Pi + Pi (1) b=a a Wa ξ i − σ = γ a a (1 − ξi )Wa − β a Pj + B i  . j=i (2) where Bi is the input to the P layer from the stimulus. Figure 2 shows an example of a network with two wholes. Each whole contains two parts. One of the parts is contained in both wholes. -α Wa excitation γ -σ inhibition P1 B1 -β } W layer Wb -σ P2 -β B2 P3 } P layer B3 Figure 2: Model in example conﬁguration: ξ = {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1)}. When a stimulus is presented, it activates some of the P-neurons, which activate some of the W-neurons. The network eventually converges to a stable steady state. We will assume that α > 1. In the Appendix, we prove that this leads to unconditional winner-take-all behavior in the W layer. In other words, no more than one W-neuron can be active at a stable steady state. If a single W-neuron is active, then a whole has been detected. Potentially there are also many P-neurons active, indicating detection of parts. This representation may have different properties, depending on the choice of parameters β, γ, and σ. As discussed below, these include rigorous enforcement of part-whole relationships, completion of wholes by “ﬁlling in” missing parts, and non-recognition of parts that do not conform to a whole. 2 Enforcement of part-whole relationships Suppose that a single W-neuron is active at a stable steady state, so that a whole has been detected. Part-whole relationships are said to be enforced if the network always ignores parts that are not contained in the detected whole, despite potentially strong bottom-up evidence for them. It can be shown that enforcement follows from the inequality σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ > 1. (3) which guarantees that neuron i in the P layer is inactive, if neuron a in the W layer is a active and ξi = 0. When part-whole relations are enforced, prior knowledge about legal combinations of parts strictly constrains what may be perceived. This result is proven in the Appendix, and only an intuitive explanation is given here. Enforcement is easiest to understand when there is interlayer inhibition (σ > 0). In this case, the active W-neuron directly inhibits the forbidden P-neurons. The case of σ = 0 is more subtle. Then enforcement is mediated by lateral inhibition in the P layer. Excitatory feedback from the W-neuron has the effect of counteracting the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, these P-neurons become strongly activated enough to inhibit the rest of the P layer. 3 Completion of wholes by ﬁlling in missing parts If a W-neuron is active, it excites the P-neurons that belong to the whole. As a result, even if one of these P-neurons receives no bottom-up input (Bi = 0), it is still active. We call this phenomenon “completion,” and it is guaranteed to happen when (4) γ> β The network may thus “imagine” parts that are consistent with the recognized whole, but are not actually present in the stimulus. As with enforcement, this condition depends on top-down connections. √ In the special case γ = β, the interlayer excitation between a W-neuron and its P-neurons exactly cancels out the lateral inhibition between the P-neurons at a steady state. So the recurrent connections effectively vanish, letting the activity of the P-neurons be determined by their feedforward inputs. When the interlayer excitation is stronger than this, the inequality (4) holds, and completion occurs. 4 Non-recognition of a whole If there is no interlayer inhibition (σ = 0), then a single W-neuron is always active, assuming that there is some activity in the P layer. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that all the W-neurons are inactive. Then they receive no inhibition to counteract the excitation from the P layer. This means some of them must be active, which contradicts our assumption. This means that the network always recognizes a whole, even if the stimulus is very different from any part-whole combination that is stored in the network. However, if interlayer inhibition is sufﬁciently strong (large σ), the network may refuse to recognize a whole. Neurons in the P layer are activated, but there is no activity in the W layer. Formal conditions on σ can be derived, but are not given here because of space limitations. In case of non-recognition, constraints on the P-layer are not enforced. It is possible for the network to detect a conﬁguration of parts that is not consistent with any stored whole. 5 Example: Interactive Activation model To illustrate the computational capabilities of our network, we use it to recreate the interactive activation (IA) model of McClelland and Rumelhart. Figure 3 shows numerical simulations of a network containing three layers of neurons representing strokes, letters, and words, respectively. There are 16 possible strokes in each of four letter positions. For each stroke, there are two neurons, one signaling the presence of the stroke and the other signaling its absence. Letter neurons represent each letter of the alphabet in each of four positions. Word neurons represent each of 1200 common four letter words. The letter and word layers correspond to the P and W layers that were introduced previously. There are bidirectional interactions between the letter and word layers, and lateral inhibition within the layers. The letter neurons also receive input from the stroke neurons, but this interaction is unidirectional. Our network differs in two ways from the original IA model. First, all interactions involving letter and word neurons are symmetric. In the original model, the interactions between the letter and word layers were asymmetric. In particular, inhibitory connections only ran from letter neurons to word neurons, and not vice versa. Second, the only nonlinearity in our model is rectiﬁcation. These two aspects allow us to apply the full machinery of the theory of permitted and forbidden sets. Figure 3 shows the result of presenting the stimulus “MO M” for four different settings of parameters. In each of the four cases, the word layer of the network converges to the same result, detecting the word “MOON”, which is the closest stored word to the stimulus. However, the activity in the letter layer is different in the four cases. input: P layer reconstruction W layer P layer reconstruction W layer completion noncompletion enforcement non-enforcement Figure 3: Simulation of 4 different parameter regimes in a letter- word recognition network. Within each panel, the middle column presents a feature- layer reconstruction based on the letter activity shown in the left column. W layer activity is shown in the right column. The top row shows the network state after 10 iterations of the dynamics. The bottom row shows the steady state. In the left column, the parameters obey the inequality (3), so that part- whole relationships are enforced. The activity of the letter layer is visualized by activating the strokes corresponding to each active letter neuron. The activated letters are part of the word “MOON”. In the top left, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom left, completion does not occur. In the simulations of the right column, parameters are such that part- whole relationships are not enforced. Consequently, the word layer is much more active. Bottom- up input provides evidence for several other letters, which is not suppressed. In the top right, the inequality (4) is satisﬁed, so that the missing “O” in the stimulus is ﬁlled in. In the bottom right, the “O” neuron is not activated in the third position, so there is no completion. However, some letter neurons for the third position are activated, due to the input from neurons that indicate the absence of strokes. input: non-recognition event multi-stability Figure 4: Simulation of a non- recognition event and example of multistability. Figure 4 shows simulations for large σ, deep in the enforcement regime where non- recognition is a possibility. From one initial condition, the network converges to a state in which no W neurons are active, a non- recognition. From another initial condition, the network detects the word “NORM”. Deep in the enforcement regime, the top- down feedback can be so strong that the network has multiple stable states, many of which bear little resemblance to the stimulus at all. This is a problematic aspect of this network. It can be prevented by setting parameters at the edge of the enforcement regime. 6 Discussion We have analyzed a recurrent network that performs computations involving part- whole relationships. The network can ﬁll in missing parts and suppress parts that do not belong. These two computations are distinct and can be dissociated from each other, as shown in Figure 3. While these two computations can also be performed by associative memory models, they are not typically dissociable in these models. For example, in the Hopﬁeld model pattern completion and noise suppression are both the result of recall of one of a ﬁnite number of stereotyped activity patterns. We believe that our model is more appropriate for perceptual systems, because its behavior is piecewise linear, due its reliance on rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. Therefore, analog aspects of computation are able to coexist with the part-whole relationships. Furthermore, in our model the stimulus is encoded in maintained synaptic input to the network, rather than as an initial condition of the dynamics. A Appendix: Permitted and forbidden sets Our mathematical results depend on the theory of permitted and forbidden sets [3, 4], which is summarized brieﬂy here. The theory is applicable to neural networks with rectiﬁcation nonlinearity, of the form xi + xi = [bi + j Wij xj ]+ . Neuron i is said to be active when ˙ xi > 0. For a network of N neurons, there are 2N possible sets of active neurons. For each active set, consider the submatrix of Wij corresponding to the synapses between active neurons. If all eigenvalues of this submatrix have real parts less than or equal to unity, then the active set is said to be permitted. Otherwise the active set is said to be forbidden. A set is permitted if and only if there exists an input vector b such that those neurons are active at a stable steady state. Permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections Wij . If Wij is a symmetric matrix, the nesting property holds: every subset of a permitted set is permitted, and every superset of a forbidden set is forbidden. The present model can be seen as a general method for storing permitted sets in a recurrent network. This method introduces a neuron for each permitted set, relying on a unary or “grandmother cell” representation. In contrast, Xie et al.[9] used lateral inhibition in a single layer of neurons to store permitted sets. By introducing extra neurons, the present model achieves superior storage capacity, much as unary models of associative memory [1] surpass distributed models [5]. A.1 Unconditional winner-take-all in the W layer The synapses between two W-neurons have strengths 0 −α −α 0 The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±α. Therefore two W-neurons constitute a forbidden set if α > 1. By the nesting property, it follows more than two W-neurons is also a forbidden set, and that the W layer has the unconditional winner-take-all property. A.2 Part-whole combinations as permitted sets Theorem 1. Suppose that β < 1. If γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k then any combination of k ≥ 1 parts consistent with a whole corresponds to a permitted set. Proof. Consider k parts belonging to a whole. They are represented by one W-neuron and k P-neurons, with synaptic connections given by the (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix M= −β(11T − I) γ1 , γ1T 0 (5) where 1 is the k- dimensional vector whose elements are all equal to one. Two eigenvectors of M are of the form (1T c), and have the same eigenvalues as the 2 × 2 matrix −β(k − 1) γk γ 0 This matrix has eigenvalues less than one when γ 2 < β + (1 − β)/k and β(k − 1) + 2 > 0. The other k − 1 eigenvectors are of the form (dT , 0), where dT 1 = 0. These have eigenvalues β. Therefore all eigenvalues of W are less than one if the condition of the theorem is satisﬁed. A.3 Constraints on combining parts Here, we derive conditions under which the network can enforce the constraint that steady state activity be conﬁned to parts that constitute a whole. Theorem 2. Suppose that β > 0 and σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1 If a W- neuron is active, then only P- neurons corresponding to parts contained in the relevant whole can be active at a stable steady state. Proof. Consider P- neurons Pi , Pj , and W- neuron Wa . Supa a pose that ξi = 1 but ξj = 0. As shown in Figure 5, the matrix of connections is given by: W = 0 −β γ −β 0 −σ γ −σ 0 (6) Wa γ Pi -σ -β Pj Figure 5: A set of one W- neuron and two P- neurons is forbidden if one part belongs to the whole and the other does not. This set is permitted if all eigenvalues of W − I have negative real parts. The characteristic equation of I − W is λ3 + b1 λ2 + b2 λ + b3 = 0, where b1 = 3, b2 = 3 − σ 2 − β 2 − γ 2 and b3 = 1−2σβγ−σ 2 −β 2 −γ 2 . According to the Routh- Hurwitz theorem, all the eigenvalues have negative real parts if and only if b1 > 0, b3 > 0 and b1 b2 > b3 . Clearly, the ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is more restrictive than the third. It is satisﬁed only when σ 2 + β 2 + γ 2 + 2σβγ < 1. Hence, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part when this condition is broken, i.e., when σ 2 +β 2 +γ 2 +2σβγ > 1. By the nesting property, any larger set of P- neurons inconsistent with the W- neuron is also forbidden. A.4 Completion of wholes √ Theorem 3. If γ > β and a single W- neuron a is active at a steady state, then Pi > 0 a for all i such that ξi = 1. Proof. Suppose that the detected whole has k parts. At the steady state Pi = a ξi Bi − (β − γ 2 )Ptot 1−β + where Ptot = Pi = i 1 1 − β + (β − γ 2 )k k a B i ξi i=1 (7) A.5 Preventing runaway If feedback loops cause the network activity to diverge, then the preceding analyses are not relevant. Here we give a sufﬁcient condition guaranteeing that runaway instability does not happen. It is not a necessary condition. Interestingly, the condition implies the condition of Theorem 1. Theorem 4. Suppose that P and W obey the dynamics of Eqs. (1) and (2), and deﬁne the objective function E 1−α 2 = − 2 Wa a α + 2 Wa a 1−β + 2 a Pi Wa ξi + σ Bi Pi − γ i 2 ia Pi2 i 2 β + 2 Pi i a (1 − ξi )Pi Wa .

(sketch) Differentiation of E with respect to time shows that that E is nonincreasing in the nonnegative orthant and constant only at steady states of the network dynamics. We must also show that E is radially unbounded, which is true if the quadratic part of E is copositive deﬁnite. Note that the last term of E is lower-bounded by zero and the previous term is upper bounded by γ ia Pi Wa . We assume α > 1.

<p>Author: J. I. Alvarez-hamelin, Luca Dall'asta, Alain Barrat, Alessandro Vespignani</p><p>Abstract: We use the k-core decomposition to develop algorithms for the analysis of large scale complex networks. This decomposition, based on a recursive pruning of the least connected vertices, allows to disentangle the hierarchical structure of networks by progressively focusing on their central cores. By using this strategy we develop a general visualization algorithm that can be used to compare the structural properties of various networks and highlight their hierarchical structure. The low computational complexity of the algorithm, O(n + e), where n is the size of the network, and e is the number of edges, makes it suitable for the visualization of very large sparse networks. We show how the proposed visualization tool allows to ﬁnd speciﬁc structural ﬁngerprints of networks. 1</p><p>4 0.55246794 <a title="7-lsi-4" href="./nips-2005-Logic_and_MRF_Circuitry_for_Labeling_Occluding_and_Thinline_Visual_Contours.html">122 nips-2005-Logic and MRF Circuitry for Labeling Occluding and Thinline Visual Contours</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric Saund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents representation and logic for labeling contrast edges and ridges in visual scenes in terms of both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, speciﬁcally contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we deﬁne a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy conﬁguration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour ﬁgures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difﬁcult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost.</p><p>5 0.54190671 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Saliency_Based_on_Information_Maximization.html">169 nips-2005-Saliency Based on Information Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Wen, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mechanism we proposed in which OHC motile forces, through the microanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the degree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes saturation of OHC forces. 1 Silicon Cochleae Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear micromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suffers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This parallel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3]. Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar membrane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling (ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism (ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Oval window organ of Corti BM Round window IHC RL A OHC PhP DC BM Basal @ Stereocilia i -1 i i+1 Apical B Figure 1: The inner ear.

Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior. 2 Active Bidirectional Coupling The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The movement of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved. We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process (PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP) is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1. Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk. In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between BM segments in the longitudinal direction.

Only the resistive component is shown; dot marks peak location. forces on the BM and the RL, the motion of BM segment i − 1 reinforces that of segment i while the motion of segment i + 1 opposes that of segment i, as described in detail in [4]. 3 The 2D Nonlinear Active Model To provide a blueprint for the cochlear circuit design, we formulate a 2D model of the cochlea that includes ABC. Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts) are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h (cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall. Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 2 φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 2 denotes the Laplacian operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the x and y directions: Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y. The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion (with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows. ˙ ¨ Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S(x)δ(x) + β(x)δ(x) + M (x)δ(x), (1) where S(x) is the stiffness, β(x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂(φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂t is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density. The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by FOHC (x) = s0 tanh(αγS(x)δ(x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS(x)δ(x + d)/s0 ) , (2) where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level. We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP. 4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a 2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation. 4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level, the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10], we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of nMOS transistors. Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term): ˙ Iin = S(x) Imem dt + β(x)Imem + M (x)I˙mem , (3) where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn, Imem ˙ drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity, δ. The FOHC term is dealt with in Section 4.2. Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is τ1 Is s + Is τ2 Io s + Io Imem = −Iin + Io , = Iin − bIs , = Iin + Is − Io , (4) (5) (6) where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants τ1 and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as: Iin s2 = (b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 Imem . Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs: S(x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 , β(x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 , and M (x) = 1. Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathematical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to Half LPF ( ) + Iout- Iin+ Iout+ Iout Vq Iin+ Iin- C+ B Iin- A Iin+ + - - Iin- + + + C To neighbors Is- Is+ > + > + IT+ IT- + - + From neighbors Io- Io+ + + + + - - + + LPF Iout+ Iout- BM Imem+ Imem- Figure 3: Low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and second-order section circuit design.

It consists of two LPFs and connects to its neighbors through Is and IT . simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon area). 4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with Imem dt to obtain FOHC = rﬀ S(x)T Imem (x − d)dt − rfb S(x)T Imem (x + d)dt , where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, Imem (x − d)dt = −τ1f Isf and Imem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small. We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result: τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ). Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream neighbors of each segment.

A Architecture: Two diffusive grids with embedded BM circuits model the cochlea. B Detail. BM circuits exchange currents with their neighbors. 4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of BM is driven by the pressure difference across it. Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for the BM circuit. It is described by + − + − + − + − + − 2 τ (Iout − Iout )s + (Iout − Iout ) = Iin − Iin and τ Iout Iout s + Iout Iout = Iq , where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output current, and τ sets the time constant. Combining the common-mode constraint with the differential design equation yields the nodal equation for the positive path (the negative path has superscripts + and − swapped): + − + + + − 2 ˙+ C Vout = Iτ (Iin − Iin ) + (Iq /Iout − Iout ) /(Iout + Iout ). + This nodal equation suggests the half-LPF circuit shown in Figure 3A. Vout , the voltage on + the positive capacitor (C ), gates a pMOS transistor to produce the corresponding current + − − signal, Iout (Vout and Iout are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = CuT/κIτ (κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these subcircuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B). The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthesized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat /(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat. 4.4 Chip Architecture We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in 0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema. 5 Chip Measurements We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear positions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea [13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from 1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]). The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology (computed from [13]).

A Amplitude. B Phase. Dashed lines: Biological data (adapted from [13]). Dots mark peaks. We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC. Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a 4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage 178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region (resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies. These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data. 6 Conclusions We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that utilizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear ampliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors.

Responses become broader and show compressive growth. plemented in the log-domain, with Class AB operation, our silicon cochlea shows enhanced frequency responses, with compressive behavior around the CF, when ABC is turned on. These features are desirable in prosthetic applications and automatic speech recognition systems as they capture the properties of the biological cochlea. References [1] Lyon, R.F. & Mead, C.A.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: The Perceptron algorithm, despite its simplicity, often performs well on online classiﬁcation tasks. The Perceptron becomes especially effective when it is used in conjunction with kernels. However, a common difﬁculty encountered when implementing kernel-based online algorithms is the amount of memory required to store the online hypothesis, which may grow unboundedly. In this paper we present and analyze the Forgetron algorithm for kernel-based online learning on a ﬁxed memory budget. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst online learning algorithm which, on one hand, maintains a strict limit on the number of examples it stores while, on the other hand, entertains a relative mistake bound. In addition to the formal results, we also present experiments with real datasets which underscore the merits of our approach.</p><p>4 0.95344853 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Goal-Based_Imitation_as_Probabilistic_Inference_over_Graphical_Models.html">87 nips-2005-Goal-Based Imitation as Probabilistic Inference over Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Deepak Verma, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: Humans are extremely adept at learning new skills by imitating the actions of others. A progression of imitative abilities has been observed in children, ranging from imitation of simple body movements to goalbased imitation based on inferring intent. In this paper, we show that the problem of goal-based imitation can be formulated as one of inferring goals and selecting actions using a learned probabilistic graphical model of the environment. We ﬁrst describe algorithms for planning actions to achieve a goal state using probabilistic inference. We then describe how planning can be used to bootstrap the learning of goal-dependent policies by utilizing feedback from the environment. The resulting graphical model is then shown to be powerful enough to allow goal-based imitation. Using a simple maze navigation task, we illustrate how an agent can infer the goals of an observed teacher and imitate the teacher even when the goals are uncertain and the demonstration is incomplete.</p><p>5 0.9264667 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Nonparametric_inference_of_prior_probabilities_from_Bayes-optimal_behavior.html">140 nips-2005-Nonparametric inference of prior probabilities from Bayes-optimal behavior</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a method for obtaining a subject’s a priori beliefs from his/her behavior in a psychophysics context, under the assumption that the behavior is (nearly) optimal from a Bayesian perspective. The method is nonparametric in the sense that we do not assume that the prior belongs to any ﬁxed class of distributions (e.g., Gaussian). Despite this increased generality, the method is relatively simple to implement, being based in the simplest case on a linear programming algorithm, and more generally on a straightforward maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori formulation, which turns out to be a convex optimization problem (with no non-global local maxima) in many important cases. In addition, we develop methods for analyzing the uncertainty of these estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method in a simple simulated coin-ﬂipping setting; in particular, the method is able to precisely track the evolution of the subject’s posterior distribution as more and more data are observed. We close by brieﬂy discussing an interesting connection to recent models of neural population coding.</p><p>6 0.9150328 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Soft_Clustering_on_Graphs.html">178 nips-2005-Soft Clustering on Graphs</a></p>

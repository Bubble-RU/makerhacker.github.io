Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider approximate value iteration with a parameterized approximator in which the state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go function over each partition is approximated by a constant. We establish performance loss bounds for policies derived from approximations associated with ﬁxed points. These bounds identify beneﬁts to having projection weights equal to the invariant distribution of the resulting policy. Such projection weighting leads to the same ﬁxed points as TD(0). Our analysis also leads to the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average cost objective. 1 Preliminaries Consider a discrete-time communicating Markov decision process (MDP) with a ﬁnite state space S = {1, . . . , |S|}. At each state x ∈ S, there is a ﬁnite set Ux of admissible actions. If the current state is x and an action u ∈ Ux is selected, a cost of gu (x) is incurred, and the system transitions to a state y ∈ S with probability pxy (u). For any x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , y∈S pxy (u) = 1. Costs are discounted at a rate of α ∈ (0, 1) per period. Each instance of such an MDP is deﬁned by a quintuple (S, U, g, p, α). A (stationary deterministic) policy is a mapping µ that assigns an action u ∈ Ux to each state x ∈ S. If actions are selected based on a policy µ, the state follows a Markov process with transition matrix Pµ , where each (x, y)th entry is equal to pxy (µ(x)). The restriction to communicating MDPs ensures that it is possible to reach any state from any other state. Each policy µ is associated with a cost-to-go function Jµ ∈ |S| , deﬁned by Jµ = ∞ t t −1 gµ , where, with some abuse of notation, gµ (x) = gµ(x) (x) t=0 α Pµ gµ = (I − αPµ ) for each x ∈ S. A policy µ is said to be greedy with respect to a function J if µ(x) ∈ argmin(gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)) for all x ∈ S. u∈Ux The optimal cost-to-go function J ∗ ∈ |S| is deﬁned by J ∗ (x) = minµ Jµ (x), for all x ∈ S. A policy µ∗ is said to be optimal if Jµ∗ = J ∗ . It is well-known that an optimal policy exists. Further, a policy µ∗ is optimal if and only if it is greedy with respect to J ∗ . Hence, given the optimal cost-to-go function, optimal actions can computed be minimizing the right-hand side of the above inclusion. Value iteration generates a sequence J converging to J ∗ according to J +1 = T J , where T is the dynamic programming operator, deﬁned by (T J)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)), for all x ∈ S and J ∈ |S| . This sequence converges to J ∗ for any initialization of J0 . 2 Approximate Value Iteration The state spaces of relevant MDPs are typically so large that computation and storage of a cost-to-go function is infeasible. One approach to dealing with this obstacle involves partitioning the state space S into a manageable number K of disjoint subsets S1 , . . . , SK and approximating the optimal cost-to-go function with a function that is constant over each partition. This can be thought of as a form of state aggregation – all states within a given partition are assumed to share a common optimal cost-to-go. To represent an approximation, we deﬁne a matrix Φ ∈ |S|×K such that each kth column is an indicator function for the kth partition Sk . Hence, for any r ∈ K , k, and x ∈ Sk , (Φr)(x) = rk . In this paper, we study variations of value iteration, each of which computes a vector r so that Φr approximates J ∗ . The use of such a policy µr which is greedy with respect to Φr is justiﬁed by the following result (see [10] for a proof): ˜ Theorem 1 If µ is a greedy policy with respect to a function J ∈ Jµ − J ∗ ≤ ∞ 2α ˜ J∗ − J 1−α |S| then ∞. One common way of approximating a function J ∈ |S| with a function of the form Φr involves projection with respect to a weighted Euclidean norm · π . The weighted Euclidean 1/2 |S| 2 norm: J 2,π = . Here, π ∈ + is a vector of weights that assign x∈S π(x)J (x) relative emphasis among states. The projection Ππ J is the function Φr that attains the minimum of J −Φr 2,π ; if there are multiple functions Φr that attain the minimum, they must form an afﬁne space, and the projection is taken to be the one with minimal norm Φr 2,π . Note that in our context, where each kth column of Φ represents an indicator function for the kth partition, for any π, J, and x ∈ Sk , (Ππ J)(x) = y∈Sk π(y)J(y)/ y∈Sk π(y). Approximate value iteration begins with a function Φr(0) and generates a sequence according to Φr( +1) = Ππ T Φr( ) . It is well-known that the dynamic programming operator T is a contraction mapping with respect to the maximum norm. Further, Ππ is maximum-norm nonexpansive [16, 7, 8]. (This is not true for general Φ, but is true in our context in which columns of Φ are indicator functions for partitions.) It follows that the composition Ππ T is a contraction mapping. By the contraction mapping theorem, Ππ T has a unique ﬁxed point Φ˜, which is the limit of the sequence Φr( ) . Further, the following result holds: r Theorem 2 For any MDP, partition, and weights π with support intersecting every partition, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ then r r Φ˜ − J ∗ r ∞ ≤ 2 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K and (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ ≤ ∞, 4α min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞. The ﬁrst inequality of the theorem is an approximation error bound, established in [16, 7, 8] for broader classes of approximators that include state aggregation as a special case. The second is a performance loss bound, derived by simply combining the approximation error bound and Theorem 1. Note that Jµr (x) ≥ J ∗ (x) for all x, so the left-hand side of the performance loss bound ˜ is the maximal increase in cost-to-go, normalized by 1 − α. This normalization is natural, since a cost-to-go function is a linear combination of expected future costs, with coefﬁcients 1, α, α2 , . . ., which sum to 1/(1 − α). Our motivation of the normalizing constant begs the question of whether, for ﬁxed MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and ﬁxed Φ, minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ also grows with 1/(1 − α). It turns out that minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ = O(1). To see why, note that for any µ, Jµ = (I − αPµ )−1 gµ = 1 λ µ + hµ , 1−α where λµ (x) is the expected average cost if the process starts in state x and is controlled by policy µ, τ −1 1 t λµ = lim Pµ gµ , τ →∞ τ t=0 and hµ is the discounted differential cost function hµ = (I − αPµ )−1 (gµ − λµ ). Both λµ and hµ converge to ﬁnite vectors as α approaches 1 [3]. For an optimal policy µ∗ , limα↑1 λµ∗ (x) does not depend on x (in our context of a communicating MDP). Since constant functions lie in the range of Φ, lim min J ∗ − Φr α↑1 r∈ K ∞ ≤ lim hµ∗ α↑1 ∞ < ∞. The performance loss bound still exhibits an undesirable dependence on α through the coefﬁcient 4α/(1 − α). In most relevant contexts, α is close to 1; a representative value might be 0.99. Consequently, 4α/(1 − α) can be very large. Unfortunately, the bound is sharp, as expressed by the following theorem. We will denote by 1 the vector with every component equal to 1. Theorem 3 For any δ > 0, α ∈ (0, 1), and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ r r with π = 1, 4α min J ∗ − Φr ∞ − δ. (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ∞ ≥ ˜ 1 − α r∈ K This theorem is established through an example in [22]. The choice of uniform weights (π = 1) is meant to point out that even for such a simple, perhaps natural, choice of weights, the performance loss bound is sharp. Based on Theorems 2 and 3, one might expect that there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that, with π = 1, (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ =Θ 1 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞ . In other words, that the performance loss is both lower and upper bounded by 1/(1 − α) times the smallest possible approximation error. It turns out that this is not true, at least if we restrict to a ﬁnite state space. However, as the following theorem establishes, the coefﬁcient multiplying minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ can grow arbitrarily large as α increases, keeping all else ﬁxed. Theorem 4 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r lim inf (1 − α) (Jµr (x) − J ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. This Theorem is also established through an example [22]. For any µ and x, lim ((1 − α)Jµ (x) − λµ (x)) = lim(1 − α)hµ (x) = 0. α↑1 α↑1 Combined with Theorem 4, this yields the following corollary. Corollary 1 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r ∗ lim inf (λµr (x) − λµ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. 3 Using the Invariant Distribution In the previous section, we considered an approximation Φ˜ that solves Ππ T Φ˜ = Φ˜ for r r r some arbitrary pre-selected weights π. We now turn to consider use of an invariant state distribution πr of Pµr as the weight vector.1 This leads to a circular deﬁnition: the weights ˜ ˜ are used in deﬁning r and now we are deﬁning the weights in terms of r. What we are ˜ ˜ really after here is a vector r that satisﬁes Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜. The following theorem captures ˜ r r ˜ the associated beneﬁts. (Due to space limitations, we omit the proof, which is provided in the full length version of this paper [22].) Theorem 5 For any MDP and partition, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and πr has support intersecting r r ˜ ˜ T every partition, (1 − α)πr (Jµr − J ∗ ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ ˜ When α is close to 1, which is typical, the right-hand side of our new performance loss bound is far less than that of Theorem 2. The primary improvement is in the omission of a factor of 1 − α from the denominator. But for the bounds to be compared in a meaningful way, we must also relate the left-hand-side expressions. A relation can be based on the fact that for all µ, limα↑1 (1 − α)Jµ − λµ ∞ = 0, as explained in Section 2. In particular, based on this, we have lim(1 − α) Jµ − J ∗ ∞ = |λµ − λ∗ | = λµ − λ∗ = lim π T (Jµ − J ∗ ), α↑1 α↑1 for all policies µ and probability distributions π. Hence, the left-hand-side expressions from the two performance bounds become directly comparable as α approaches 1. Another interesting comparison can be made by contrasting Corollary 1 against the following immediate consequence of Theorem 5. Corollary 2 For all MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and partitions, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and r r ˜ lim inf α↑1 x∈Sk πr (x) > 0 for all k, ˜ lim sup λµr − λµ∗ ∞ ≤ 2 lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K The comparison suggests that solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ is strongly preferable to solving r r ˜ Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1. r r 1 By an invariant state distribution of a transition matrix P , we mean any probability distribution π such that π T P = π T . In the event that Pµr has multiple invariant distributions, πr denotes an ˜ ˜ arbitrary choice. 4 Exploration If a vector r solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and the support of πr intersects every partition, Theorem ˜ r r ˜ ˜ 5 promises a desirable bound. However, there are two signiﬁcant shortcomings to this solution concept, which we will address in this section. First, in some cases, the equation Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜ does not have a solution. It is easy to produce examples of this; though r r ˜ no example has been documented for the particular class of approximators we are using here, [2] offers an example involving a different linearly parameterized approximator that captures the spirit of what can happen. Second, it would be nice to relax the requirement that the support of πr intersect every partition. ˜ To address these shortcomings, we introduce stochastic policies. A stochastic policy µ maps state-action pairs to probabilities. For each x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , µ(x, u) is the probability of taking action u when in state x. Hence, µ(x, u) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , and u∈Ux µ(x, u) = 1 for all x ∈ S. Given a scalar > 0 and a function J, the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to J is deﬁned by µ(x, u) = e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e For any > 0 and r, let µr denote the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr. Further, we deﬁne a modiﬁed dynamic programming operator that incorporates Boltzmann exploration: (T J)(x) = u∈Ux e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e (Tu J)(x) . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e As approaches 0, -greedy Boltzmann exploration policies become greedy and the modiﬁed dynamic programming operators become the dynamic programming operator. More precisely, for all r, x, and J, lim ↓0 µr (x, µr (x)) = 1 and lim ↓1 T J = T J. These are immediate consequences of the following result (see [4] for a proof). Lemma 1 For any n, v ∈ mini vi . n , mini vi + ≥ i e−vi (n−1)/ e vi / i e−vi (n−1)/ e ≥ Because we are only concerned with communicating MDPs, there is a unique invariant state distribution associated with each -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy µr and the support of this distribution is S. Let πr denote this distribution. We consider a vector r that ˜ solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. For any > 0, there exists a solution to this equation (this is an r r ˜ immediate extension of Theorem 5.1 from [4]). We have the following performance loss bound, which parallels Theorem 5 but with an equation for which a solution is guaranteed to exist and without any requirement on the resulting invariant distribution. (Again, we omit the proof, which is available in [22].) Theorem 6 For any MDP, partition, and > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ then (1 − r r ˜ T ∗ ∗ α)(πr ) (Jµr − J ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J − Φr ∞ + . ˜ ˜ 5 Computation: TD(0) Though computation is not a focus of this paper, we offer a brief discussion here. First, we describe a simple algorithm from [16], which draws on ideas from temporal-difference learning [11, 12] and Q-learning [23, 24] to solve Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. It requires an abilr r ity to sample a sequence of states x(0) , x(1) , x(2) , . . ., each independent and identically distributed according to π. Also required is a way to efﬁciently compute (T Φr)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)(Φr)(y)), for any given x and r. This is typically possible when the action set Ux and the support of px· (u) (i.e., the set of states that can follow x if action u is selected) are not too large. The algorithm generates a sequence of vectors r( ) according to r( +1) = r( ) + γ φ(x( ) ) (T Φr( ) )(x( ) ) − (Φr( ) )(x( ) ) , where γ is a step size and φ(x) denotes the column vector made up of components from the xth row of Φ. In [16], using results from [15, 9], it is shown that under appropriate assumptions on the step size sequence, r( ) converges to a vector r that solves Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. ˜ r r The equation Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ may have no solution. Further, the requirement that states r r are sampled independently from the invariant distribution may be impractical. However, a natural extension of the above algorithm leads to an easily implementable version of TD(0) that aims at solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. The algorithm requires simulation of a trajectory r r ˜ x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . of the MDP, with each action ut ∈ Uxt generated by the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr(t) . The sequence of vectors r(t) is generated according to r(t+1) = r(t) + γt φ(xt ) (T Φr(t) )(xt ) − (Φr(t) )(xt ) . Under suitable conditions on the step size sequence, if this algorithm converges, the limit satisﬁes Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. Whether such an algorithm converges and whether there are r r ˜ other algorithms that can effectively solve Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ for broad classes of relevant r r ˜ problems remain open issues. 6 Extensions and Open Issues Our results demonstrate that weighting a Euclidean norm projection by the invariant distribution of a greedy (or approximately greedy) policy can lead to a dramatic performance gain. It is intriguing that temporal-difference learning implicitly carries out such a projection, and consequently, any limit of convergence obeys the stronger performance loss bound. This is not the ﬁrst time that the invariant distribution has been shown to play a critical role in approximate value iteration and temporal-difference learning. In prior work involving approximation of a cost-to-go function for a ﬁxed policy (no control) and a general linearly parameterized approximator (arbitrary matrix Φ), it was shown that weighting by the invariant distribution is key to ensuring convergence and an approximation error bound [17, 18]. Earlier empirical work anticipated this [13, 14]. The temporal-difference learning algorithm presented in Section 5 is a version of TD(0), This is a special case of TD(λ), which is parameterized by λ ∈ [0, 1]. It is not known whether the results of this paper can be extended to the general case of λ ∈ [0, 1]. Prior research has suggested that larger values of λ lead to superior results. In particular, an example of [1] and the approximation error bounds of [17, 18], both of which are restricted to the case of a ﬁxed policy, suggest that approximation error is ampliﬁed by a factor of 1/(1 − α) as λ is changed from 1 to 0. The results of Sections 3 and 4 suggest that this factor vanishes if one considers a controlled process and performance loss rather than approximation error. Whether the results of this paper can be extended to accommodate approximate value iteration with general linearly parameterized approximators remains an open issue. In this broader context, error and performance loss bounds of the kind offered by Theorem 2 are unavailable, even when the invariant distribution is used to weight the projection. Such error and performance bounds are available, on the other hand, for the solution to a certain linear program [5, 6]. Whether a factor of 1/(1 − α) can similarly be eliminated from these bounds is an open issue. Our results can be extended to accommodate an average cost objective, assuming that the MDP is communicating. With Boltzmann exploration, the equation of interest becomes Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1). r r ˜ ˜ ˜ The variables include an estimate λ ∈ of the minimal average cost λ∗ ∈ and an approximation Φ˜ of the optimal differential cost function h∗ . The discount factor α is set r to 1 in computing an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy as well as T . There is an average-cost version of temporal-difference learning for which any limit of convergence ˜ ˜ (λ, r) satisﬁes this equation [19, 20, 21]. Generalization of Theorem 2 does not lead to a useful result because the right-hand side of the bound becomes inﬁnite as α approaches 1. On the other hand, generalization of Theorem 6 yields the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average-cost objective: Theorem 7 For any communicating MDP with an average-cost objective, partition, and r ˜ > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1) then r ˜ λµr − λ∗ ≤ 2 min h∗ − Φr ˜ r∈ K ∞ + . Here, λµr ∈ denotes the average cost under policy µr , which is well-deﬁned because the ˜ ˜ process is irreducible under an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy. This theorem can be proved by taking limits on the left and right-hand sides of the bound of Theorem 6. It is easy to see that the limit of the left-hand side is λµr − λ∗ . The limit of minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ ˜ on the right-hand side is minr∈ K h∗ − Φr ∞ . (This follows from the analysis of [3].)

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider approximate value iteration with a parameterized approximator in which the state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go function over each partition is approximated by a constant. We establish performance loss bounds for policies derived from approximations associated with ﬁxed points. These bounds identify beneﬁts to having projection weights equal to the invariant distribution of the resulting policy. Such projection weighting leads to the same ﬁxed points as TD(0). Our analysis also leads to the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average cost objective. 1 Preliminaries Consider a discrete-time communicating Markov decision process (MDP) with a ﬁnite state space S = {1, . . . , |S|}. At each state x ∈ S, there is a ﬁnite set Ux of admissible actions. If the current state is x and an action u ∈ Ux is selected, a cost of gu (x) is incurred, and the system transitions to a state y ∈ S with probability pxy (u). For any x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , y∈S pxy (u) = 1. Costs are discounted at a rate of α ∈ (0, 1) per period. Each instance of such an MDP is deﬁned by a quintuple (S, U, g, p, α). A (stationary deterministic) policy is a mapping µ that assigns an action u ∈ Ux to each state x ∈ S. If actions are selected based on a policy µ, the state follows a Markov process with transition matrix Pµ , where each (x, y)th entry is equal to pxy (µ(x)). The restriction to communicating MDPs ensures that it is possible to reach any state from any other state. Each policy µ is associated with a cost-to-go function Jµ ∈ |S| , deﬁned by Jµ = ∞ t t −1 gµ , where, with some abuse of notation, gµ (x) = gµ(x) (x) t=0 α Pµ gµ = (I − αPµ ) for each x ∈ S. A policy µ is said to be greedy with respect to a function J if µ(x) ∈ argmin(gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)) for all x ∈ S. u∈Ux The optimal cost-to-go function J ∗ ∈ |S| is deﬁned by J ∗ (x) = minµ Jµ (x), for all x ∈ S. A policy µ∗ is said to be optimal if Jµ∗ = J ∗ . It is well-known that an optimal policy exists. Further, a policy µ∗ is optimal if and only if it is greedy with respect to J ∗ . Hence, given the optimal cost-to-go function, optimal actions can computed be minimizing the right-hand side of the above inclusion. Value iteration generates a sequence J converging to J ∗ according to J +1 = T J , where T is the dynamic programming operator, deﬁned by (T J)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)), for all x ∈ S and J ∈ |S| . This sequence converges to J ∗ for any initialization of J0 . 2 Approximate Value Iteration The state spaces of relevant MDPs are typically so large that computation and storage of a cost-to-go function is infeasible. One approach to dealing with this obstacle involves partitioning the state space S into a manageable number K of disjoint subsets S1 , . . . , SK and approximating the optimal cost-to-go function with a function that is constant over each partition. This can be thought of as a form of state aggregation – all states within a given partition are assumed to share a common optimal cost-to-go. To represent an approximation, we deﬁne a matrix Φ ∈ |S|×K such that each kth column is an indicator function for the kth partition Sk . Hence, for any r ∈ K , k, and x ∈ Sk , (Φr)(x) = rk . In this paper, we study variations of value iteration, each of which computes a vector r so that Φr approximates J ∗ . The use of such a policy µr which is greedy with respect to Φr is justiﬁed by the following result (see [10] for a proof): ˜ Theorem 1 If µ is a greedy policy with respect to a function J ∈ Jµ − J ∗ ≤ ∞ 2α ˜ J∗ − J 1−α |S| then ∞. One common way of approximating a function J ∈ |S| with a function of the form Φr involves projection with respect to a weighted Euclidean norm · π . The weighted Euclidean 1/2 |S| 2 norm: J 2,π = . Here, π ∈ + is a vector of weights that assign x∈S π(x)J (x) relative emphasis among states. The projection Ππ J is the function Φr that attains the minimum of J −Φr 2,π ; if there are multiple functions Φr that attain the minimum, they must form an afﬁne space, and the projection is taken to be the one with minimal norm Φr 2,π . Note that in our context, where each kth column of Φ represents an indicator function for the kth partition, for any π, J, and x ∈ Sk , (Ππ J)(x) = y∈Sk π(y)J(y)/ y∈Sk π(y). Approximate value iteration begins with a function Φr(0) and generates a sequence according to Φr( +1) = Ππ T Φr( ) . It is well-known that the dynamic programming operator T is a contraction mapping with respect to the maximum norm. Further, Ππ is maximum-norm nonexpansive [16, 7, 8]. (This is not true for general Φ, but is true in our context in which columns of Φ are indicator functions for partitions.) It follows that the composition Ππ T is a contraction mapping. By the contraction mapping theorem, Ππ T has a unique ﬁxed point Φ˜, which is the limit of the sequence Φr( ) . Further, the following result holds: r Theorem 2 For any MDP, partition, and weights π with support intersecting every partition, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ then r r Φ˜ − J ∗ r ∞ ≤ 2 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K and (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ ≤ ∞, 4α min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞. The ﬁrst inequality of the theorem is an approximation error bound, established in [16, 7, 8] for broader classes of approximators that include state aggregation as a special case. The second is a performance loss bound, derived by simply combining the approximation error bound and Theorem 1. Note that Jµr (x) ≥ J ∗ (x) for all x, so the left-hand side of the performance loss bound ˜ is the maximal increase in cost-to-go, normalized by 1 − α. This normalization is natural, since a cost-to-go function is a linear combination of expected future costs, with coefﬁcients 1, α, α2 , . . ., which sum to 1/(1 − α). Our motivation of the normalizing constant begs the question of whether, for ﬁxed MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and ﬁxed Φ, minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ also grows with 1/(1 − α). It turns out that minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ = O(1). To see why, note that for any µ, Jµ = (I − αPµ )−1 gµ = 1 λ µ + hµ , 1−α where λµ (x) is the expected average cost if the process starts in state x and is controlled by policy µ, τ −1 1 t λµ = lim Pµ gµ , τ →∞ τ t=0 and hµ is the discounted differential cost function hµ = (I − αPµ )−1 (gµ − λµ ). Both λµ and hµ converge to ﬁnite vectors as α approaches 1 [3]. For an optimal policy µ∗ , limα↑1 λµ∗ (x) does not depend on x (in our context of a communicating MDP). Since constant functions lie in the range of Φ, lim min J ∗ − Φr α↑1 r∈ K ∞ ≤ lim hµ∗ α↑1 ∞ < ∞. The performance loss bound still exhibits an undesirable dependence on α through the coefﬁcient 4α/(1 − α). In most relevant contexts, α is close to 1; a representative value might be 0.99. Consequently, 4α/(1 − α) can be very large. Unfortunately, the bound is sharp, as expressed by the following theorem. We will denote by 1 the vector with every component equal to 1. Theorem 3 For any δ > 0, α ∈ (0, 1), and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ r r with π = 1, 4α min J ∗ − Φr ∞ − δ. (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ∞ ≥ ˜ 1 − α r∈ K This theorem is established through an example in [22]. The choice of uniform weights (π = 1) is meant to point out that even for such a simple, perhaps natural, choice of weights, the performance loss bound is sharp. Based on Theorems 2 and 3, one might expect that there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that, with π = 1, (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ =Θ 1 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞ . In other words, that the performance loss is both lower and upper bounded by 1/(1 − α) times the smallest possible approximation error. It turns out that this is not true, at least if we restrict to a ﬁnite state space. However, as the following theorem establishes, the coefﬁcient multiplying minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ can grow arbitrarily large as α increases, keeping all else ﬁxed. Theorem 4 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r lim inf (1 − α) (Jµr (x) − J ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. This Theorem is also established through an example [22]. For any µ and x, lim ((1 − α)Jµ (x) − λµ (x)) = lim(1 − α)hµ (x) = 0. α↑1 α↑1 Combined with Theorem 4, this yields the following corollary. Corollary 1 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r ∗ lim inf (λµr (x) − λµ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. 3 Using the Invariant Distribution In the previous section, we considered an approximation Φ˜ that solves Ππ T Φ˜ = Φ˜ for r r r some arbitrary pre-selected weights π. We now turn to consider use of an invariant state distribution πr of Pµr as the weight vector.1 This leads to a circular deﬁnition: the weights ˜ ˜ are used in deﬁning r and now we are deﬁning the weights in terms of r. What we are ˜ ˜ really after here is a vector r that satisﬁes Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜. The following theorem captures ˜ r r ˜ the associated beneﬁts. (Due to space limitations, we omit the proof, which is provided in the full length version of this paper [22].) Theorem 5 For any MDP and partition, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and πr has support intersecting r r ˜ ˜ T every partition, (1 − α)πr (Jµr − J ∗ ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ ˜ When α is close to 1, which is typical, the right-hand side of our new performance loss bound is far less than that of Theorem 2. The primary improvement is in the omission of a factor of 1 − α from the denominator. But for the bounds to be compared in a meaningful way, we must also relate the left-hand-side expressions. A relation can be based on the fact that for all µ, limα↑1 (1 − α)Jµ − λµ ∞ = 0, as explained in Section 2. In particular, based on this, we have lim(1 − α) Jµ − J ∗ ∞ = |λµ − λ∗ | = λµ − λ∗ = lim π T (Jµ − J ∗ ), α↑1 α↑1 for all policies µ and probability distributions π. Hence, the left-hand-side expressions from the two performance bounds become directly comparable as α approaches 1. Another interesting comparison can be made by contrasting Corollary 1 against the following immediate consequence of Theorem 5. Corollary 2 For all MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and partitions, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and r r ˜ lim inf α↑1 x∈Sk πr (x) > 0 for all k, ˜ lim sup λµr − λµ∗ ∞ ≤ 2 lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K The comparison suggests that solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ is strongly preferable to solving r r ˜ Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1. r r 1 By an invariant state distribution of a transition matrix P , we mean any probability distribution π such that π T P = π T . In the event that Pµr has multiple invariant distributions, πr denotes an ˜ ˜ arbitrary choice. 4 Exploration If a vector r solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and the support of πr intersects every partition, Theorem ˜ r r ˜ ˜ 5 promises a desirable bound. However, there are two signiﬁcant shortcomings to this solution concept, which we will address in this section. First, in some cases, the equation Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜ does not have a solution. It is easy to produce examples of this; though r r ˜ no example has been documented for the particular class of approximators we are using here, [2] offers an example involving a different linearly parameterized approximator that captures the spirit of what can happen. Second, it would be nice to relax the requirement that the support of πr intersect every partition. ˜ To address these shortcomings, we introduce stochastic policies. A stochastic policy µ maps state-action pairs to probabilities. For each x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , µ(x, u) is the probability of taking action u when in state x. Hence, µ(x, u) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , and u∈Ux µ(x, u) = 1 for all x ∈ S. Given a scalar > 0 and a function J, the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to J is deﬁned by µ(x, u) = e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e For any > 0 and r, let µr denote the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr. Further, we deﬁne a modiﬁed dynamic programming operator that incorporates Boltzmann exploration: (T J)(x) = u∈Ux e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e (Tu J)(x) . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e As approaches 0, -greedy Boltzmann exploration policies become greedy and the modiﬁed dynamic programming operators become the dynamic programming operator. More precisely, for all r, x, and J, lim ↓0 µr (x, µr (x)) = 1 and lim ↓1 T J = T J. These are immediate consequences of the following result (see [4] for a proof). Lemma 1 For any n, v ∈ mini vi . n , mini vi + ≥ i e−vi (n−1)/ e vi / i e−vi (n−1)/ e ≥ Because we are only concerned with communicating MDPs, there is a unique invariant state distribution associated with each -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy µr and the support of this distribution is S. Let πr denote this distribution. We consider a vector r that ˜ solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. For any > 0, there exists a solution to this equation (this is an r r ˜ immediate extension of Theorem 5.1 from [4]). We have the following performance loss bound, which parallels Theorem 5 but with an equation for which a solution is guaranteed to exist and without any requirement on the resulting invariant distribution. (Again, we omit the proof, which is available in [22].) Theorem 6 For any MDP, partition, and > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ then (1 − r r ˜ T ∗ ∗ α)(πr ) (Jµr − J ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J − Φr ∞ + . ˜ ˜ 5 Computation: TD(0) Though computation is not a focus of this paper, we offer a brief discussion here. First, we describe a simple algorithm from [16], which draws on ideas from temporal-difference learning [11, 12] and Q-learning [23, 24] to solve Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. It requires an abilr r ity to sample a sequence of states x(0) , x(1) , x(2) , . . ., each independent and identically distributed according to π. Also required is a way to efﬁciently compute (T Φr)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)(Φr)(y)), for any given x and r. This is typically possible when the action set Ux and the support of px· (u) (i.e., the set of states that can follow x if action u is selected) are not too large. The algorithm generates a sequence of vectors r( ) according to r( +1) = r( ) + γ φ(x( ) ) (T Φr( ) )(x( ) ) − (Φr( ) )(x( ) ) , where γ is a step size and φ(x) denotes the column vector made up of components from the xth row of Φ. In [16], using results from [15, 9], it is shown that under appropriate assumptions on the step size sequence, r( ) converges to a vector r that solves Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. ˜ r r The equation Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ may have no solution. Further, the requirement that states r r are sampled independently from the invariant distribution may be impractical. However, a natural extension of the above algorithm leads to an easily implementable version of TD(0) that aims at solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. The algorithm requires simulation of a trajectory r r ˜ x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . of the MDP, with each action ut ∈ Uxt generated by the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr(t) . The sequence of vectors r(t) is generated according to r(t+1) = r(t) + γt φ(xt ) (T Φr(t) )(xt ) − (Φr(t) )(xt ) . Under suitable conditions on the step size sequence, if this algorithm converges, the limit satisﬁes Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. Whether such an algorithm converges and whether there are r r ˜ other algorithms that can effectively solve Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ for broad classes of relevant r r ˜ problems remain open issues. 6 Extensions and Open Issues Our results demonstrate that weighting a Euclidean norm projection by the invariant distribution of a greedy (or approximately greedy) policy can lead to a dramatic performance gain. It is intriguing that temporal-difference learning implicitly carries out such a projection, and consequently, any limit of convergence obeys the stronger performance loss bound. This is not the ﬁrst time that the invariant distribution has been shown to play a critical role in approximate value iteration and temporal-difference learning. In prior work involving approximation of a cost-to-go function for a ﬁxed policy (no control) and a general linearly parameterized approximator (arbitrary matrix Φ), it was shown that weighting by the invariant distribution is key to ensuring convergence and an approximation error bound [17, 18]. Earlier empirical work anticipated this [13, 14]. The temporal-difference learning algorithm presented in Section 5 is a version of TD(0), This is a special case of TD(λ), which is parameterized by λ ∈ [0, 1]. It is not known whether the results of this paper can be extended to the general case of λ ∈ [0, 1]. Prior research has suggested that larger values of λ lead to superior results. In particular, an example of [1] and the approximation error bounds of [17, 18], both of which are restricted to the case of a ﬁxed policy, suggest that approximation error is ampliﬁed by a factor of 1/(1 − α) as λ is changed from 1 to 0. The results of Sections 3 and 4 suggest that this factor vanishes if one considers a controlled process and performance loss rather than approximation error. Whether the results of this paper can be extended to accommodate approximate value iteration with general linearly parameterized approximators remains an open issue. In this broader context, error and performance loss bounds of the kind offered by Theorem 2 are unavailable, even when the invariant distribution is used to weight the projection. Such error and performance bounds are available, on the other hand, for the solution to a certain linear program [5, 6]. Whether a factor of 1/(1 − α) can similarly be eliminated from these bounds is an open issue. Our results can be extended to accommodate an average cost objective, assuming that the MDP is communicating. With Boltzmann exploration, the equation of interest becomes Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1). r r ˜ ˜ ˜ The variables include an estimate λ ∈ of the minimal average cost λ∗ ∈ and an approximation Φ˜ of the optimal differential cost function h∗ . The discount factor α is set r to 1 in computing an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy as well as T . There is an average-cost version of temporal-difference learning for which any limit of convergence ˜ ˜ (λ, r) satisﬁes this equation [19, 20, 21]. Generalization of Theorem 2 does not lead to a useful result because the right-hand side of the bound becomes inﬁnite as α approaches 1. On the other hand, generalization of Theorem 6 yields the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average-cost objective: Theorem 7 For any communicating MDP with an average-cost objective, partition, and r ˜ > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1) then r ˜ λµr − λ∗ ≤ 2 min h∗ − Φr ˜ r∈ K ∞ + . Here, λµr ∈ denotes the average cost under policy µr , which is well-deﬁned because the ˜ ˜ process is irreducible under an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy. This theorem can be proved by taking limits on the left and right-hand sides of the bound of Theorem 6. It is easy to see that the limit of the left-hand side is λµr − λ∗ . The limit of minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ ˜ on the right-hand side is minr∈ K h∗ − Φr ∞ . (This follows from the analysis of [3].)

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>3 0.2421201 <a title="186-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2005-Off-policy_Learning_with_Options_and_Recognizers.html">144 nips-2005-Off-policy Learning with Options and Recognizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Doina Precup, Cosmin Paduraru, Anna Koop, Richard S. Sutton, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for off-policy temporal-difference learning with function approximation that has lower variance and requires less knowledge of the behavior policy than prior methods. We develop the notion of a recognizer, a ﬁlter on actions that distorts the behavior policy to produce a related target policy with low-variance importance-sampling corrections. We also consider target policies that are deviations from the state distribution of the behavior policy, such as potential temporally abstract options, which further reduces variance. This paper introduces recognizers and their potential advantages, then develops a full algorithm for linear function approximation and proves that its updates are in the same direction as on-policy TD updates, which implies asymptotic convergence. Even though our algorithm is based on importance sampling, we prove that it requires absolutely no knowledge of the behavior policy for the case of state-aggregation function approximators. Off-policy learning is learning about one way of behaving while actually behaving in another way. For example, Q-learning is an off- policy learning method because it learns about the optimal policy while taking actions in a more exploratory fashion, e.g., according to an ε-greedy policy. Off-policy learning is of interest because only one way of selecting actions can be used at any time, but we would like to learn about many different ways of behaving from the single resultant stream of experience. For example, the options framework for temporal abstraction involves considering a variety of different ways of selecting actions. For each such option one would like to learn a model of its possible outcomes suitable for planning and other uses. Such option models have been proposed as fundamental building blocks of grounded world knowledge (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2005). Using off-policy learning, one would be able to learn predictive models for many options at the same time from a single stream of experience. Unfortunately, off-policy learning using temporal-difference methods has proven problematic when used in conjunction with function approximation. Function approximation is essential in order to handle the large state spaces that are inherent in many problem do- mains. Q-learning, for example, has been proven to converge to an optimal policy in the tabular case, but is unsound and may diverge in the case of linear function approximation (Baird, 1996). Precup, Sutton, and Dasgupta (2001) introduced and proved convergence for the ﬁrst off-policy learning algorithm with linear function approximation. They addressed the problem of learning the expected value of a target policy based on experience generated using a different behavior policy. They used importance sampling techniques to reduce the off-policy case to the on-policy case, where existing convergence theorems apply (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Tadic, 2001). There are two important difﬁculties with that approach. First, the behavior policy needs to be stationary and known, because it is needed to compute the importance sampling corrections. Second, the importance sampling weights are often ill-conditioned. In the worst case, the variance could be inﬁnite and convergence would not occur. The conditions required to prevent this were somewhat awkward and, even when they applied and asymptotic convergence was assured, the variance could still be high and convergence could be slow. In this paper we address both of these problems in the context of off-policy learning for options. We introduce the notion of a recognizer. Rather than specifying an explicit target policy (for instance, the policy of an option), about which we want to make predictions, a recognizer speciﬁes a condition on the actions that are selected. For example, a recognizer for the temporally extended action of picking up a cup would not specify which hand is to be used, or what the motion should be at all different positions of the cup. The recognizer would recognize a whole variety of directions of motion and poses as part of picking the cup. The advantage of this strategy is not that one might prefer a multitude of different behaviors, but that the behavior may be based on a variety of different strategies, all of which are relevant, and we would like to learn from any of them. In general, a recognizer is a function that recognizes or accepts a space of different ways of behaving and thus, can learn from a wider range of data. Recognizers have two advantages over direct speciﬁcation of a target policy: 1) they are a natural and easy way to specify a target policy for which importance sampling will be well conditioned, and 2) they do not require the behavior policy to be known. The latter is important because in many cases we may have little knowledge of the behavior policy, or a stationary behavior policy may not even exist. We show that for the case of state aggregation, even if the behavior policy is unknown, convergence to a good model is achieved. 1 Non-sequential example The beneﬁts of using recognizers in off-policy learning can be most easily seen in a nonsequential context with a single continuous action. Suppose you are given a sequence of sample actions ai ∈ [0, 1], selected i.i.d. according to probability density b : [0, 1] → ℜ+ (the behavior density). For example, suppose the behavior density is of the oscillatory form shown as a red line in Figure 1. For each each action, ai , we observe a corresponding outcome, zi ∈ ℜ, a random variable whose distribution depends only on ai . Thus the behavior density induces an outcome density. The on-policy problem is to estimate the mean mb of the outcome density. This problem can be solved simply by averaging the sample outcomes: mb = (1/n) ∑n zi . The off-policy problem is to use this same data to learn what ˆ i=1 the mean would be if actions were selected in some way other than b, for example, if the actions were restricted to a designated range, such as between 0.7 and 0.9. There are two natural ways to pose this off-policy problem. The most straightforward way is to be equally interested in all actions within the designated region. One professes to be interested in actions selected according to a target density π : [0, 1] → ℜ+ , which in the example would be 5.0 between 0.7 and 0.9, and zero elsewhere, as in the dashed line in 12 Probability density functions 1.5 Target policy with recognizer 1 Target policy w/o recognizer without recognizer .5 Behavior policy 0 0 Action 0.7 Empirical variances (average of 200 sample variances) 0.9 1 0 10 with recognizer 100 200 300 400 500 Number of sample actions Figure 1: The left panel shows the behavior policy and the target policies for the formulations of the problem with and without recognizers. The right panel shows empirical estimates of the variances for the two formulations as a function of the number sample actions. The lowest line is for the formulation using empirically-estimated recognition probabilities. Figure 1 (left). The importance- sampling estimate of the mean outcome is 1 n π(ai ) mπ = ∑ ˆ zi . n i=1 b(ai ) (1) This approach is problematic if there are parts of the region of interest where the behavior density is zero or very nearly so, such as near 0.72 and 0.85 in the example. Here the importance sampling ratios are exceedingly large and the estimate is poorly conditioned (large variance). The upper curve in Figure 1 (right) shows the empirical variance of this estimate as a function of the number of samples. The spikes and uncertain decline of the empirical variance indicate that the distribution is very skewed and that the estimates are very poorly conditioned. The second way to pose the problem uses recognizers. One professes to be interested in actions to the extent that they are both selected by b and within the designated region. This leads to the target policy shown in blue in the left panel of Figure 1 (it is taller because it still must sum to 1). For this problem, the variance of (1) is much smaller, as shown in the lower two lines of Figure 1 (right). To make this way of posing the problem clear, we introduce the notion of a recognizer function c : A → ℜ+ . The action space in the example is A = [0, 1] and the recognizer is c(a) = 1 for a between 0.7 and 0.9 and is zero elsewhere. The target policy is deﬁned in general by c(a)b(a) c(a)b(a) = . (2) π(a) = µ ∑x c(x)b(x) where µ = ∑x c(x)b(x) is a constant, equal to the probability of recognizing an action from the behavior policy. Given π, mπ from (1) can be rewritten in terms of the recognizer as ˆ n π(ai ) 1 n c(ai )b(ai ) 1 1 n c(ai ) 1 mπ = ∑ zi ˆ = ∑ zi = ∑ zi (3) n i=1 b(ai ) n i=1 µ b(ai ) n i=1 µ Note that the target density does not appear at all in the last expression and that the behavior distribution appears only in µ, which is independent of the sample action. If this constant is known, then this estimator can be computed with no knowledge of π or b. The constant µ can easily be estimated as the fraction of recognized actions in the sample. The lowest line in Figure 1 (right) shows the variance of the estimator using this fraction in place of the recognition probability. Its variance is low, no worse than that of the exact algorithm, and apparently slightly lower. Because this algorithm does not use the behavior density, it can be applied when the behavior density is unknown or does not even exist. For example, suppose actions were selected in some deterministic, systematic way that in the long run produced an empirical distribution like b. This would be problematic for the other algorithms but would require no modiﬁcation of the recognition-fraction algorithm. 2 Recognizers improve conditioning of off-policy learning The main use of recognizers is in formulating a target density π about which we can successfully learn predictions, based on the current behavior being followed. Here we formalize this intuition. Theorem 1 Let A = {a1 , . . . ak } ⊆ A be a subset of all the possible actions. Consider a ﬁxed behavior policy b and let πA be the class of policies that only choose actions from A, i.e., if π(a) > 0 then a ∈ A. Then the policy induced by b and the binary recognizer cA is the policy with minimum-variance one-step importance sampling corrections, among those in πA : π(ai ) 2 π as given by (2) = arg min Eb (4) π∈πA b(ai ) Proof: Denote π(ai ) = πi , b(ai ) = bi . Then the expected variance of the one-step importance sampling corrections is: Eb πi bi πi bi 2 2 − Eb = ∑ bi i πi bi 2 −1 = ∑ i π2 i − 1, bi where the summation (here and everywhere below) is such that the action ai ∈ A. We want to ﬁnd πi that minimizes this expression, subject to the constraint that ∑i πi = 1. This is a constrained optimization problem. To solve it, we write down the corresponding Lagrangian: π2 L(πi , β) = ∑ i − 1 + β(∑ πi − 1) i i bi We take the partial derivatives wrt πi and β and set them to 0: βbi ∂L 2 = πi + β = 0 ⇒ πi = − ∂πi bi 2 (5) ∂L = πi − 1 = 0 ∂β ∑ i (6) By taking (5) and plugging into (6), we get the following expression for β: − β 2 bi = 1 ⇒ β = − 2∑ ∑i bi i By substituting β into (5) we obtain: πi = bi ∑i b i This is exactly the policy induced by the recognizer deﬁned by c(ai ) = 1 iff ai ∈ A. We also note that it is advantageous, from the point of view of minimizing the variance of the updates, to have recognizers that accept a broad range of actions: Theorem 2 Consider two binary recognizers c1 and c2 , such that µ1 > µ2 . Then the importance sampling corrections for c1 have lower variance than the importance sampling corrections for c2 . Proof: From the previous theorem, we have the variance of a recognizer cA : Var = ∑ i π2 bi i −1 = ∑ bi ∑ j∈A b j i 2 1 1 1 −1 = −1 = −1 bi µ ∑ j∈A b j 3 Formal framework for sequential problems We turn now to the full case of learning about sequential decision processes with function approximation. We use the standard framework in which an agent interacts with a stochastic environment. At each time step t, the agent receives a state st and chooses an action at . We assume for the moment that actions are selected according to a ﬁxed behavior policy, b : S × A → [0, 1] where b(s, a) is the probability of selecting action a in state s. The behavior policy is used to generate a sequence of experience (observations, actions and rewards). The goal is to learn, from this data, predictions about different ways of behaving. In this paper we focus on learning predictions about expected returns, but other predictions can be tackled as well (for instance, predictions of transition models for options (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), or predictions speciﬁed by a TD-network (Sutton & Tanner, 2005; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2006)). We assume that the state space is large or continuous, and function approximation must be used to compute any values of interest. In particular, we assume a space of feature vectors Φ and a mapping φ : S → Φ. We denote by φs the feature vector associated with s. An option is deﬁned as a triple o = I, π, β where I ⊆ S is the set of states in which the option can be initiated, π is the internal policy of the option and β : S → [0, 1] is a stochastic termination condition. In the option work (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), each of these elements has to be explicitly speciﬁed and ﬁxed in order for an option to be well deﬁned. Here, we will instead deﬁne options implicitly, using the notion of a recognizer. A recognizer is deﬁned as a function c : S × A → [0, 1], where c(s, a) indicates to what extent the recognizer allows action a in state s. An important special case, which we treat in this paper, is that of binary recognizers. In this case, c is an indicator function, specifying a subset of actions that are allowed, or recognized, given a particular state. Note that recognizers do not specify policies; instead, they merely give restrictions on the policies that are allowed or recognized. A recognizer c together with a behavior policy b generates a target policy π, where: b(s, a)c(s, a) b(s, a)c(s, a) π(s, a) = (7) = µ(s) ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x) The denominator of this fraction, µ(s) = ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x), is the recognition probability at s, i.e., the probability that an action will be accepted at s when behavior is generated according to b. The policy π is only deﬁned at states for which µ(s) > 0. The numerator gives the probability that action a is produced by the behavior and recognized in s. Note that if the recognizer accepts all state-action pairs, i.e. c(s, a) = 1, ∀s, a, then π is the same as b. Since a recognizer and a behavior policy can specify together a target policy, we can use recognizers as a way to specify policies for options, using (7). An option can only be initiated at a state for which at least one action is recognized, so µ(s) > 0, ∀s ∈ I. Similarly, the termination condition of such an option, β, is deﬁned as β(s) = 1 if µ(s) = 0. In other words, the option must terminate if no actions are recognized at a given state. At all other states, β can be deﬁned between 0 and 1 as desired. We will focus on computing the reward model of an option o, which represents the expected total return. The expected values of different features at the end of the option can be estimated similarly. The quantity that we want to compute is Eo {R(s)} = E{r1 + r2 + . . . + rT |s0 = s, π, β} where s ∈ I, experience is generated according to the policy of the option, π, and T denotes the random variable representing the time step at which the option terminates according to β. We assume that linear function approximation is used to represent these values, i.e. Eo {R(s)} ≈ θT φs where θ is a vector of parameters. 4 Off-policy learning algorithm In this section we present an adaptation of the off-policy learning algorithm of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) to the case of learning about options. Suppose that an option’s policy π was used to generate behavior. In this case, learning the reward model of the option is a special case of temporal-difference learning of value functions. The forward ¯ (n) view of this algorithm is as follows. Let Rt denote the truncated n-step return starting at ¯ (0) time step t and let yt denote the 0-step truncated return, Rt . By the deﬁnition of the n-step truncated return, we have: ¯ (n) ¯ (n−1) Rt = rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 . This is similar to the case of value functions, but it accounts for the possibility of terminating the option at time step t + 1. The λ-return is deﬁned in the usual way: ∞ ¯ (n) ¯ Rtλ = (1 − λ) ∑ λn−1 Rt . n=1 The parameters of the linear function approximator are updated on every time step proportionally to: ¯ ¯ ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 ) · · · (1 − βt ). In our case, however, trajectories are generated according to the behavior policy b. The main idea of the algorithm is to use importance sampling corrections in order to account for the difference in the state distribution of the two policies. Let ρt = (n) Rt , π(st ,at ) b(st ,at ) be the importance sampling ratio at time step t. The truncated n-step return, satisﬁes: (n) (n−1) Rt = ρt [rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 ]. The update to the parameter vector is proportional to: ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt ρ0 (1 − β1 ) · · · ρt−1 (1 − βt ). The following result shows that the expected updates of the on-policy and off-policy algorithms are the same. Theorem 3 For every time step t ≥ 0 and any initial state s, ¯ Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s]. (n) (n) ¯ Proof: First we will show by induction that Eb {Rt |s} = Eπ {Rt |s}, ∀n (which implies ¯ that Eb {Rtλ |s} = Eπ (Rtλ |s}). For n = 0, the statement is trivial. Assuming that it is true for n − 1, we have (n) Eb Rt |s = a ∑b(s, a)∑Pss ρ(s, a) a = s ∑∑ a Pss b(s, a) a s = a ∑π(s, a)∑Pss a (n−1) a rss + (1 − β(s ))Eb Rt+1 |s π(s, a) a ¯ (n−1) r + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s b(s, a) ss a ¯ (n−1) rss + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s ¯ (n) = Eπ Rt |s . s Now we are ready to prove the theorem’s main statement. Deﬁning Ωt to be the set of all trajectory components up to state st , we have: Eb {∆θt |s} = ∑ ω∈Ωt Pb (ω|s)Eb (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω t−1 ∏ ρi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 πi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 bi t−1 = t−1 ∑ ∏ bi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt Eb Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt ∏ i=0 t−1 = ∑ ∏ πi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt = ∑ ω∈Ωt ¯ Eπ Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) i=0 ¯ ¯ Pπ (ω|s)Eπ (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) = Eπ ∆θt |s . Note that we are able to use st and ω interchangeably because of the Markov property. ¯ Since we have shown that Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s] for any state s, it follows that the expected updates will also be equal for any distribution of the initial state s. When learning the model of options with data generated from the behavior policy b, the starting state distribution with respect to which the learning is performed, I0 is determined by the stationary distribution of the behavior policy, as well as the initiation set of the option I. We note also that the importance sampling corrections only have to be performed for the trajectory since the initiation of the updates for the option. No corrections are required for the experience prior to this point. This should generate updates that have signiﬁcantly lower variance than in the case of learning values of policies (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). Because of the termination condition of the option, β, ∆θ can quickly decay to zero. To avoid this problem, we can use a restart function g : S → [0, 1], such that g(st ) speciﬁes the extent to which the updating episode is considered to start at time t. Adding restarts generates a new forward update: t ∆θt = (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt ∑ gi ρi ...ρt−1 (1 − βi+1 )...(1 − βt ), (8) i=0 where Rtλ is the same as above. With an adaptation of the proof in Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001), we can show that we get the same expected value of updates by applying this algorithm from the original starting distribution as we would by applying the algorithm without restarts from a starting distribution deﬁned by I0 and g. We can turn this forward algorithm into an incremental, backward view algorithm in the following way: • Initialize k0 = g0 , e0 = k0 ∇θ y0 • At every time step t: δt = θt+1 = kt+1 = et+1 = ρt (rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )yt+1 ) − yt θt + αδt et ρt kt (1 − βt+1 ) + gt+1 λρt (1 − βt+1 )et + kt+1 ∇θ yt+1 Using a similar technique to that of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) and Sutton & Barto (1998), we can prove that the forward and backward algorithm are equivalent (omitted due to lack of space). This algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the variance of the updates is ﬁnite (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). In the case of options, the termination condition β can be used to ensure that this is the case. 5 Learning when the behavior policy is unknown In this section, we consider the case in which the behavior policy is unknown. This case is generally problematic for importance sampling algorithms, but the use of recognizers will allow us to deﬁne importance sampling corrections, as well as a convergent algorithm. Recall that when using a recognizer, the target policy of the option is deﬁned as: c(s, a)b(s, a) π(s, a) = µ(s) and the recognition probability becomes: π(s, a) c(s, a) = b(s, a) µ(s) Of course, µ(s) depends on b. If b is unknown, instead of µ(s), we will use a maximum likelihood estimate µ : S → [0, 1]. The structure used to compute µ will have to be compatible ˆ ˆ with the feature space used to represent the reward model. We will make this more precise below. Likewise, the recognizer c(s, a) will have to be deﬁned in terms of the features used to represent the model. We will then deﬁne the importance sampling corrections as: c(s, a) ˆ ρ(s, a) = µ(s) ˆ ρ(s, a) = We consider the case in which the function approximator used to model the option is actually a state aggregator. In this case, we will deﬁne recognizers which behave consistently in each partition, i.e., c(s, a) = c(p, a), ∀s ∈ p. This means that an action is either recognized or not recognized in all states of the partition. The recognition probability µ will have one ˆ entry for every partition p of the state space. Its value will be: N(p, c = 1) µ(p) = ˆ N(p) where N(p) is the number of times partition p was visited, and N(p, c = 1) is the number of times the action taken in p was recognized. In the limit, w.p.1, µ converges to ˆ ∑s d b (s|p) ∑a c(p, a)b(s, a) where d b (s|p) is the probability of visiting state s from partiˆ ˆ tion p under the stationary distribution of b. At this limit, π(s, a) = ρ(s, a)b(s, a) will be a ˆ well-deﬁned policy (i.e., ∑a π(s, a) = 1). Using Theorem 3, off-policy updates using imˆ portance sampling corrections ρ will have the same expected value as on-policy updates ˆ ˆ using π. Note though that the learning algorithm never uses π; the only quantities needed ˆ are ρ, which are learned incrementally from data. For the case of general linear function approximation, we conjecture that a similar idea can be used, where the recognition probability is learned using logistic regression. The development of this part is left for future work.

We prove a worstcase lower bound showing that algorithms that rely solely on a global reward signal to learn policies confront a fundamental limit: They require a number of real-world examples that scales roughly linearly in the number of agents. For settings of interest with a very large number of agents, this is impractical. We demonstrate, however, that there is a class of algorithms that, by taking advantage of local reward signals in large distributed Markov Decision Processes, are able to ensure good performance with a number of samples that scales as O(log n). This makes them applicable even in settings with a very large number of agents n. 1</p><p>5 0.19408049 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Policy-Gradient_Methods_for_Planning.html">153 nips-2005-Policy-Gradient Methods for Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Douglas Aberdeen</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic temporal planning attempts to ﬁnd good policies for acting in domains with concurrent durative tasks, multiple uncertain outcomes, and limited resources. These domains are typically modelled as Markov decision problems and solved using dynamic programming methods. This paper demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning — in the form of a policy-gradient method — to these domains. Our emphasis is large domains that are infeasible for dynamic programming. Our approach is to construct simple policies, or agents, for each planning task. The result is a general probabilistic temporal planner, named the Factored Policy-Gradient Planner (FPG-Planner), which can handle hundreds of tasks, optimising for probability of success, duration, and resource use. 1</p><p>6 0.15344167 <a title="186-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2005-Goal-Based_Imitation_as_Probabilistic_Inference_over_Graphical_Models.html">87 nips-2005-Goal-Based Imitation as Probabilistic Inference over Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider approximate value iteration with a parameterized approximator in which the state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go function over each partition is approximated by a constant. We establish performance loss bounds for policies derived from approximations associated with ﬁxed points. These bounds identify beneﬁts to having projection weights equal to the invariant distribution of the resulting policy. Such projection weighting leads to the same ﬁxed points as TD(0). Our analysis also leads to the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average cost objective. 1 Preliminaries Consider a discrete-time communicating Markov decision process (MDP) with a ﬁnite state space S = {1, . . . , |S|}. At each state x ∈ S, there is a ﬁnite set Ux of admissible actions. If the current state is x and an action u ∈ Ux is selected, a cost of gu (x) is incurred, and the system transitions to a state y ∈ S with probability pxy (u). For any x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , y∈S pxy (u) = 1. Costs are discounted at a rate of α ∈ (0, 1) per period. Each instance of such an MDP is deﬁned by a quintuple (S, U, g, p, α). A (stationary deterministic) policy is a mapping µ that assigns an action u ∈ Ux to each state x ∈ S. If actions are selected based on a policy µ, the state follows a Markov process with transition matrix Pµ , where each (x, y)th entry is equal to pxy (µ(x)). The restriction to communicating MDPs ensures that it is possible to reach any state from any other state. Each policy µ is associated with a cost-to-go function Jµ ∈ |S| , deﬁned by Jµ = ∞ t t −1 gµ , where, with some abuse of notation, gµ (x) = gµ(x) (x) t=0 α Pµ gµ = (I − αPµ ) for each x ∈ S. A policy µ is said to be greedy with respect to a function J if µ(x) ∈ argmin(gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)) for all x ∈ S. u∈Ux The optimal cost-to-go function J ∗ ∈ |S| is deﬁned by J ∗ (x) = minµ Jµ (x), for all x ∈ S. A policy µ∗ is said to be optimal if Jµ∗ = J ∗ . It is well-known that an optimal policy exists. Further, a policy µ∗ is optimal if and only if it is greedy with respect to J ∗ . Hence, given the optimal cost-to-go function, optimal actions can computed be minimizing the right-hand side of the above inclusion. Value iteration generates a sequence J converging to J ∗ according to J +1 = T J , where T is the dynamic programming operator, deﬁned by (T J)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)), for all x ∈ S and J ∈ |S| . This sequence converges to J ∗ for any initialization of J0 . 2 Approximate Value Iteration The state spaces of relevant MDPs are typically so large that computation and storage of a cost-to-go function is infeasible. One approach to dealing with this obstacle involves partitioning the state space S into a manageable number K of disjoint subsets S1 , . . . , SK and approximating the optimal cost-to-go function with a function that is constant over each partition. This can be thought of as a form of state aggregation – all states within a given partition are assumed to share a common optimal cost-to-go. To represent an approximation, we deﬁne a matrix Φ ∈ |S|×K such that each kth column is an indicator function for the kth partition Sk . Hence, for any r ∈ K , k, and x ∈ Sk , (Φr)(x) = rk . In this paper, we study variations of value iteration, each of which computes a vector r so that Φr approximates J ∗ . The use of such a policy µr which is greedy with respect to Φr is justiﬁed by the following result (see [10] for a proof): ˜ Theorem 1 If µ is a greedy policy with respect to a function J ∈ Jµ − J ∗ ≤ ∞ 2α ˜ J∗ − J 1−α |S| then ∞. One common way of approximating a function J ∈ |S| with a function of the form Φr involves projection with respect to a weighted Euclidean norm · π . The weighted Euclidean 1/2 |S| 2 norm: J 2,π = . Here, π ∈ + is a vector of weights that assign x∈S π(x)J (x) relative emphasis among states. The projection Ππ J is the function Φr that attains the minimum of J −Φr 2,π ; if there are multiple functions Φr that attain the minimum, they must form an afﬁne space, and the projection is taken to be the one with minimal norm Φr 2,π . Note that in our context, where each kth column of Φ represents an indicator function for the kth partition, for any π, J, and x ∈ Sk , (Ππ J)(x) = y∈Sk π(y)J(y)/ y∈Sk π(y). Approximate value iteration begins with a function Φr(0) and generates a sequence according to Φr( +1) = Ππ T Φr( ) . It is well-known that the dynamic programming operator T is a contraction mapping with respect to the maximum norm. Further, Ππ is maximum-norm nonexpansive [16, 7, 8]. (This is not true for general Φ, but is true in our context in which columns of Φ are indicator functions for partitions.) It follows that the composition Ππ T is a contraction mapping. By the contraction mapping theorem, Ππ T has a unique ﬁxed point Φ˜, which is the limit of the sequence Φr( ) . Further, the following result holds: r Theorem 2 For any MDP, partition, and weights π with support intersecting every partition, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ then r r Φ˜ − J ∗ r ∞ ≤ 2 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K and (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ ≤ ∞, 4α min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞. The ﬁrst inequality of the theorem is an approximation error bound, established in [16, 7, 8] for broader classes of approximators that include state aggregation as a special case. The second is a performance loss bound, derived by simply combining the approximation error bound and Theorem 1. Note that Jµr (x) ≥ J ∗ (x) for all x, so the left-hand side of the performance loss bound ˜ is the maximal increase in cost-to-go, normalized by 1 − α. This normalization is natural, since a cost-to-go function is a linear combination of expected future costs, with coefﬁcients 1, α, α2 , . . ., which sum to 1/(1 − α). Our motivation of the normalizing constant begs the question of whether, for ﬁxed MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and ﬁxed Φ, minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ also grows with 1/(1 − α). It turns out that minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ = O(1). To see why, note that for any µ, Jµ = (I − αPµ )−1 gµ = 1 λ µ + hµ , 1−α where λµ (x) is the expected average cost if the process starts in state x and is controlled by policy µ, τ −1 1 t λµ = lim Pµ gµ , τ →∞ τ t=0 and hµ is the discounted differential cost function hµ = (I − αPµ )−1 (gµ − λµ ). Both λµ and hµ converge to ﬁnite vectors as α approaches 1 [3]. For an optimal policy µ∗ , limα↑1 λµ∗ (x) does not depend on x (in our context of a communicating MDP). Since constant functions lie in the range of Φ, lim min J ∗ − Φr α↑1 r∈ K ∞ ≤ lim hµ∗ α↑1 ∞ < ∞. The performance loss bound still exhibits an undesirable dependence on α through the coefﬁcient 4α/(1 − α). In most relevant contexts, α is close to 1; a representative value might be 0.99. Consequently, 4α/(1 − α) can be very large. Unfortunately, the bound is sharp, as expressed by the following theorem. We will denote by 1 the vector with every component equal to 1. Theorem 3 For any δ > 0, α ∈ (0, 1), and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ r r with π = 1, 4α min J ∗ − Φr ∞ − δ. (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ∞ ≥ ˜ 1 − α r∈ K This theorem is established through an example in [22]. The choice of uniform weights (π = 1) is meant to point out that even for such a simple, perhaps natural, choice of weights, the performance loss bound is sharp. Based on Theorems 2 and 3, one might expect that there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that, with π = 1, (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ =Θ 1 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞ . In other words, that the performance loss is both lower and upper bounded by 1/(1 − α) times the smallest possible approximation error. It turns out that this is not true, at least if we restrict to a ﬁnite state space. However, as the following theorem establishes, the coefﬁcient multiplying minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ can grow arbitrarily large as α increases, keeping all else ﬁxed. Theorem 4 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r lim inf (1 − α) (Jµr (x) − J ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. This Theorem is also established through an example [22]. For any µ and x, lim ((1 − α)Jµ (x) − λµ (x)) = lim(1 − α)hµ (x) = 0. α↑1 α↑1 Combined with Theorem 4, this yields the following corollary. Corollary 1 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r ∗ lim inf (λµr (x) − λµ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. 3 Using the Invariant Distribution In the previous section, we considered an approximation Φ˜ that solves Ππ T Φ˜ = Φ˜ for r r r some arbitrary pre-selected weights π. We now turn to consider use of an invariant state distribution πr of Pµr as the weight vector.1 This leads to a circular deﬁnition: the weights ˜ ˜ are used in deﬁning r and now we are deﬁning the weights in terms of r. What we are ˜ ˜ really after here is a vector r that satisﬁes Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜. The following theorem captures ˜ r r ˜ the associated beneﬁts. (Due to space limitations, we omit the proof, which is provided in the full length version of this paper [22].) Theorem 5 For any MDP and partition, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and πr has support intersecting r r ˜ ˜ T every partition, (1 − α)πr (Jµr − J ∗ ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ ˜ When α is close to 1, which is typical, the right-hand side of our new performance loss bound is far less than that of Theorem 2. The primary improvement is in the omission of a factor of 1 − α from the denominator. But for the bounds to be compared in a meaningful way, we must also relate the left-hand-side expressions. A relation can be based on the fact that for all µ, limα↑1 (1 − α)Jµ − λµ ∞ = 0, as explained in Section 2. In particular, based on this, we have lim(1 − α) Jµ − J ∗ ∞ = |λµ − λ∗ | = λµ − λ∗ = lim π T (Jµ − J ∗ ), α↑1 α↑1 for all policies µ and probability distributions π. Hence, the left-hand-side expressions from the two performance bounds become directly comparable as α approaches 1. Another interesting comparison can be made by contrasting Corollary 1 against the following immediate consequence of Theorem 5. Corollary 2 For all MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and partitions, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and r r ˜ lim inf α↑1 x∈Sk πr (x) > 0 for all k, ˜ lim sup λµr − λµ∗ ∞ ≤ 2 lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K The comparison suggests that solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ is strongly preferable to solving r r ˜ Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1. r r 1 By an invariant state distribution of a transition matrix P , we mean any probability distribution π such that π T P = π T . In the event that Pµr has multiple invariant distributions, πr denotes an ˜ ˜ arbitrary choice. 4 Exploration If a vector r solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and the support of πr intersects every partition, Theorem ˜ r r ˜ ˜ 5 promises a desirable bound. However, there are two signiﬁcant shortcomings to this solution concept, which we will address in this section. First, in some cases, the equation Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜ does not have a solution. It is easy to produce examples of this; though r r ˜ no example has been documented for the particular class of approximators we are using here, [2] offers an example involving a different linearly parameterized approximator that captures the spirit of what can happen. Second, it would be nice to relax the requirement that the support of πr intersect every partition. ˜ To address these shortcomings, we introduce stochastic policies. A stochastic policy µ maps state-action pairs to probabilities. For each x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , µ(x, u) is the probability of taking action u when in state x. Hence, µ(x, u) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , and u∈Ux µ(x, u) = 1 for all x ∈ S. Given a scalar > 0 and a function J, the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to J is deﬁned by µ(x, u) = e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e For any > 0 and r, let µr denote the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr. Further, we deﬁne a modiﬁed dynamic programming operator that incorporates Boltzmann exploration: (T J)(x) = u∈Ux e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e (Tu J)(x) . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e As approaches 0, -greedy Boltzmann exploration policies become greedy and the modiﬁed dynamic programming operators become the dynamic programming operator. More precisely, for all r, x, and J, lim ↓0 µr (x, µr (x)) = 1 and lim ↓1 T J = T J. These are immediate consequences of the following result (see [4] for a proof). Lemma 1 For any n, v ∈ mini vi . n , mini vi + ≥ i e−vi (n−1)/ e vi / i e−vi (n−1)/ e ≥ Because we are only concerned with communicating MDPs, there is a unique invariant state distribution associated with each -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy µr and the support of this distribution is S. Let πr denote this distribution. We consider a vector r that ˜ solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. For any > 0, there exists a solution to this equation (this is an r r ˜ immediate extension of Theorem 5.1 from [4]). We have the following performance loss bound, which parallels Theorem 5 but with an equation for which a solution is guaranteed to exist and without any requirement on the resulting invariant distribution. (Again, we omit the proof, which is available in [22].) Theorem 6 For any MDP, partition, and > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ then (1 − r r ˜ T ∗ ∗ α)(πr ) (Jµr − J ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J − Φr ∞ + . ˜ ˜ 5 Computation: TD(0) Though computation is not a focus of this paper, we offer a brief discussion here. First, we describe a simple algorithm from [16], which draws on ideas from temporal-difference learning [11, 12] and Q-learning [23, 24] to solve Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. It requires an abilr r ity to sample a sequence of states x(0) , x(1) , x(2) , . . ., each independent and identically distributed according to π. Also required is a way to efﬁciently compute (T Φr)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)(Φr)(y)), for any given x and r. This is typically possible when the action set Ux and the support of px· (u) (i.e., the set of states that can follow x if action u is selected) are not too large. The algorithm generates a sequence of vectors r( ) according to r( +1) = r( ) + γ φ(x( ) ) (T Φr( ) )(x( ) ) − (Φr( ) )(x( ) ) , where γ is a step size and φ(x) denotes the column vector made up of components from the xth row of Φ. In [16], using results from [15, 9], it is shown that under appropriate assumptions on the step size sequence, r( ) converges to a vector r that solves Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. ˜ r r The equation Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ may have no solution. Further, the requirement that states r r are sampled independently from the invariant distribution may be impractical. However, a natural extension of the above algorithm leads to an easily implementable version of TD(0) that aims at solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. The algorithm requires simulation of a trajectory r r ˜ x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . of the MDP, with each action ut ∈ Uxt generated by the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr(t) . The sequence of vectors r(t) is generated according to r(t+1) = r(t) + γt φ(xt ) (T Φr(t) )(xt ) − (Φr(t) )(xt ) . Under suitable conditions on the step size sequence, if this algorithm converges, the limit satisﬁes Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. Whether such an algorithm converges and whether there are r r ˜ other algorithms that can effectively solve Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ for broad classes of relevant r r ˜ problems remain open issues. 6 Extensions and Open Issues Our results demonstrate that weighting a Euclidean norm projection by the invariant distribution of a greedy (or approximately greedy) policy can lead to a dramatic performance gain. It is intriguing that temporal-difference learning implicitly carries out such a projection, and consequently, any limit of convergence obeys the stronger performance loss bound. This is not the ﬁrst time that the invariant distribution has been shown to play a critical role in approximate value iteration and temporal-difference learning. In prior work involving approximation of a cost-to-go function for a ﬁxed policy (no control) and a general linearly parameterized approximator (arbitrary matrix Φ), it was shown that weighting by the invariant distribution is key to ensuring convergence and an approximation error bound [17, 18]. Earlier empirical work anticipated this [13, 14]. The temporal-difference learning algorithm presented in Section 5 is a version of TD(0), This is a special case of TD(λ), which is parameterized by λ ∈ [0, 1]. It is not known whether the results of this paper can be extended to the general case of λ ∈ [0, 1]. Prior research has suggested that larger values of λ lead to superior results. In particular, an example of [1] and the approximation error bounds of [17, 18], both of which are restricted to the case of a ﬁxed policy, suggest that approximation error is ampliﬁed by a factor of 1/(1 − α) as λ is changed from 1 to 0. The results of Sections 3 and 4 suggest that this factor vanishes if one considers a controlled process and performance loss rather than approximation error. Whether the results of this paper can be extended to accommodate approximate value iteration with general linearly parameterized approximators remains an open issue. In this broader context, error and performance loss bounds of the kind offered by Theorem 2 are unavailable, even when the invariant distribution is used to weight the projection. Such error and performance bounds are available, on the other hand, for the solution to a certain linear program [5, 6]. Whether a factor of 1/(1 − α) can similarly be eliminated from these bounds is an open issue. Our results can be extended to accommodate an average cost objective, assuming that the MDP is communicating. With Boltzmann exploration, the equation of interest becomes Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1). r r ˜ ˜ ˜ The variables include an estimate λ ∈ of the minimal average cost λ∗ ∈ and an approximation Φ˜ of the optimal differential cost function h∗ . The discount factor α is set r to 1 in computing an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy as well as T . There is an average-cost version of temporal-difference learning for which any limit of convergence ˜ ˜ (λ, r) satisﬁes this equation [19, 20, 21]. Generalization of Theorem 2 does not lead to a useful result because the right-hand side of the bound becomes inﬁnite as α approaches 1. On the other hand, generalization of Theorem 6 yields the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average-cost objective: Theorem 7 For any communicating MDP with an average-cost objective, partition, and r ˜ > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1) then r ˜ λµr − λ∗ ≤ 2 min h∗ − Φr ˜ r∈ K ∞ + . Here, λµr ∈ denotes the average cost under policy µr , which is well-deﬁned because the ˜ ˜ process is irreducible under an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy. This theorem can be proved by taking limits on the left and right-hand sides of the bound of Theorem 6. It is easy to see that the limit of the left-hand side is λµr − λ∗ . The limit of minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ ˜ on the right-hand side is minr∈ K h∗ − Φr ∞ . (This follows from the analysis of [3].)

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>3 0.78884351 <a title="186-lsi-3" href="./nips-2005-Off-policy_Learning_with_Options_and_Recognizers.html">144 nips-2005-Off-policy Learning with Options and Recognizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Doina Precup, Cosmin Paduraru, Anna Koop, Richard S. Sutton, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for off-policy temporal-difference learning with function approximation that has lower variance and requires less knowledge of the behavior policy than prior methods. We develop the notion of a recognizer, a ﬁlter on actions that distorts the behavior policy to produce a related target policy with low-variance importance-sampling corrections. We also consider target policies that are deviations from the state distribution of the behavior policy, such as potential temporally abstract options, which further reduces variance. This paper introduces recognizers and their potential advantages, then develops a full algorithm for linear function approximation and proves that its updates are in the same direction as on-policy TD updates, which implies asymptotic convergence. Even though our algorithm is based on importance sampling, we prove that it requires absolutely no knowledge of the behavior policy for the case of state-aggregation function approximators. Off-policy learning is learning about one way of behaving while actually behaving in another way. For example, Q-learning is an off- policy learning method because it learns about the optimal policy while taking actions in a more exploratory fashion, e.g., according to an ε-greedy policy. Off-policy learning is of interest because only one way of selecting actions can be used at any time, but we would like to learn about many different ways of behaving from the single resultant stream of experience. For example, the options framework for temporal abstraction involves considering a variety of different ways of selecting actions. For each such option one would like to learn a model of its possible outcomes suitable for planning and other uses. Such option models have been proposed as fundamental building blocks of grounded world knowledge (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2005). Using off-policy learning, one would be able to learn predictive models for many options at the same time from a single stream of experience. Unfortunately, off-policy learning using temporal-difference methods has proven problematic when used in conjunction with function approximation. Function approximation is essential in order to handle the large state spaces that are inherent in many problem do- mains. Q-learning, for example, has been proven to converge to an optimal policy in the tabular case, but is unsound and may diverge in the case of linear function approximation (Baird, 1996). Precup, Sutton, and Dasgupta (2001) introduced and proved convergence for the ﬁrst off-policy learning algorithm with linear function approximation. They addressed the problem of learning the expected value of a target policy based on experience generated using a different behavior policy. They used importance sampling techniques to reduce the off-policy case to the on-policy case, where existing convergence theorems apply (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Tadic, 2001). There are two important difﬁculties with that approach. First, the behavior policy needs to be stationary and known, because it is needed to compute the importance sampling corrections. Second, the importance sampling weights are often ill-conditioned. In the worst case, the variance could be inﬁnite and convergence would not occur. The conditions required to prevent this were somewhat awkward and, even when they applied and asymptotic convergence was assured, the variance could still be high and convergence could be slow. In this paper we address both of these problems in the context of off-policy learning for options. We introduce the notion of a recognizer. Rather than specifying an explicit target policy (for instance, the policy of an option), about which we want to make predictions, a recognizer speciﬁes a condition on the actions that are selected. For example, a recognizer for the temporally extended action of picking up a cup would not specify which hand is to be used, or what the motion should be at all different positions of the cup. The recognizer would recognize a whole variety of directions of motion and poses as part of picking the cup. The advantage of this strategy is not that one might prefer a multitude of different behaviors, but that the behavior may be based on a variety of different strategies, all of which are relevant, and we would like to learn from any of them. In general, a recognizer is a function that recognizes or accepts a space of different ways of behaving and thus, can learn from a wider range of data. Recognizers have two advantages over direct speciﬁcation of a target policy: 1) they are a natural and easy way to specify a target policy for which importance sampling will be well conditioned, and 2) they do not require the behavior policy to be known. The latter is important because in many cases we may have little knowledge of the behavior policy, or a stationary behavior policy may not even exist. We show that for the case of state aggregation, even if the behavior policy is unknown, convergence to a good model is achieved. 1 Non-sequential example The beneﬁts of using recognizers in off-policy learning can be most easily seen in a nonsequential context with a single continuous action. Suppose you are given a sequence of sample actions ai ∈ [0, 1], selected i.i.d. according to probability density b : [0, 1] → ℜ+ (the behavior density). For example, suppose the behavior density is of the oscillatory form shown as a red line in Figure 1. For each each action, ai , we observe a corresponding outcome, zi ∈ ℜ, a random variable whose distribution depends only on ai . Thus the behavior density induces an outcome density. The on-policy problem is to estimate the mean mb of the outcome density. This problem can be solved simply by averaging the sample outcomes: mb = (1/n) ∑n zi . The off-policy problem is to use this same data to learn what ˆ i=1 the mean would be if actions were selected in some way other than b, for example, if the actions were restricted to a designated range, such as between 0.7 and 0.9. There are two natural ways to pose this off-policy problem. The most straightforward way is to be equally interested in all actions within the designated region. One professes to be interested in actions selected according to a target density π : [0, 1] → ℜ+ , which in the example would be 5.0 between 0.7 and 0.9, and zero elsewhere, as in the dashed line in 12 Probability density functions 1.5 Target policy with recognizer 1 Target policy w/o recognizer without recognizer .5 Behavior policy 0 0 Action 0.7 Empirical variances (average of 200 sample variances) 0.9 1 0 10 with recognizer 100 200 300 400 500 Number of sample actions Figure 1: The left panel shows the behavior policy and the target policies for the formulations of the problem with and without recognizers. The right panel shows empirical estimates of the variances for the two formulations as a function of the number sample actions. The lowest line is for the formulation using empirically-estimated recognition probabilities. Figure 1 (left). The importance- sampling estimate of the mean outcome is 1 n π(ai ) mπ = ∑ ˆ zi . n i=1 b(ai ) (1) This approach is problematic if there are parts of the region of interest where the behavior density is zero or very nearly so, such as near 0.72 and 0.85 in the example. Here the importance sampling ratios are exceedingly large and the estimate is poorly conditioned (large variance). The upper curve in Figure 1 (right) shows the empirical variance of this estimate as a function of the number of samples. The spikes and uncertain decline of the empirical variance indicate that the distribution is very skewed and that the estimates are very poorly conditioned. The second way to pose the problem uses recognizers. One professes to be interested in actions to the extent that they are both selected by b and within the designated region. This leads to the target policy shown in blue in the left panel of Figure 1 (it is taller because it still must sum to 1). For this problem, the variance of (1) is much smaller, as shown in the lower two lines of Figure 1 (right). To make this way of posing the problem clear, we introduce the notion of a recognizer function c : A → ℜ+ . The action space in the example is A = [0, 1] and the recognizer is c(a) = 1 for a between 0.7 and 0.9 and is zero elsewhere. The target policy is deﬁned in general by c(a)b(a) c(a)b(a) = . (2) π(a) = µ ∑x c(x)b(x) where µ = ∑x c(x)b(x) is a constant, equal to the probability of recognizing an action from the behavior policy. Given π, mπ from (1) can be rewritten in terms of the recognizer as ˆ n π(ai ) 1 n c(ai )b(ai ) 1 1 n c(ai ) 1 mπ = ∑ zi ˆ = ∑ zi = ∑ zi (3) n i=1 b(ai ) n i=1 µ b(ai ) n i=1 µ Note that the target density does not appear at all in the last expression and that the behavior distribution appears only in µ, which is independent of the sample action. If this constant is known, then this estimator can be computed with no knowledge of π or b. The constant µ can easily be estimated as the fraction of recognized actions in the sample. The lowest line in Figure 1 (right) shows the variance of the estimator using this fraction in place of the recognition probability. Its variance is low, no worse than that of the exact algorithm, and apparently slightly lower. Because this algorithm does not use the behavior density, it can be applied when the behavior density is unknown or does not even exist. For example, suppose actions were selected in some deterministic, systematic way that in the long run produced an empirical distribution like b. This would be problematic for the other algorithms but would require no modiﬁcation of the recognition-fraction algorithm. 2 Recognizers improve conditioning of off-policy learning The main use of recognizers is in formulating a target density π about which we can successfully learn predictions, based on the current behavior being followed. Here we formalize this intuition. Theorem 1 Let A = {a1 , . . . ak } ⊆ A be a subset of all the possible actions. Consider a ﬁxed behavior policy b and let πA be the class of policies that only choose actions from A, i.e., if π(a) > 0 then a ∈ A. Then the policy induced by b and the binary recognizer cA is the policy with minimum-variance one-step importance sampling corrections, among those in πA : π(ai ) 2 π as given by (2) = arg min Eb (4) π∈πA b(ai ) Proof: Denote π(ai ) = πi , b(ai ) = bi . Then the expected variance of the one-step importance sampling corrections is: Eb πi bi πi bi 2 2 − Eb = ∑ bi i πi bi 2 −1 = ∑ i π2 i − 1, bi where the summation (here and everywhere below) is such that the action ai ∈ A. We want to ﬁnd πi that minimizes this expression, subject to the constraint that ∑i πi = 1. This is a constrained optimization problem. To solve it, we write down the corresponding Lagrangian: π2 L(πi , β) = ∑ i − 1 + β(∑ πi − 1) i i bi We take the partial derivatives wrt πi and β and set them to 0: βbi ∂L 2 = πi + β = 0 ⇒ πi = − ∂πi bi 2 (5) ∂L = πi − 1 = 0 ∂β ∑ i (6) By taking (5) and plugging into (6), we get the following expression for β: − β 2 bi = 1 ⇒ β = − 2∑ ∑i bi i By substituting β into (5) we obtain: πi = bi ∑i b i This is exactly the policy induced by the recognizer deﬁned by c(ai ) = 1 iff ai ∈ A. We also note that it is advantageous, from the point of view of minimizing the variance of the updates, to have recognizers that accept a broad range of actions: Theorem 2 Consider two binary recognizers c1 and c2 , such that µ1 > µ2 . Then the importance sampling corrections for c1 have lower variance than the importance sampling corrections for c2 . Proof: From the previous theorem, we have the variance of a recognizer cA : Var = ∑ i π2 bi i −1 = ∑ bi ∑ j∈A b j i 2 1 1 1 −1 = −1 = −1 bi µ ∑ j∈A b j 3 Formal framework for sequential problems We turn now to the full case of learning about sequential decision processes with function approximation. We use the standard framework in which an agent interacts with a stochastic environment. At each time step t, the agent receives a state st and chooses an action at . We assume for the moment that actions are selected according to a ﬁxed behavior policy, b : S × A → [0, 1] where b(s, a) is the probability of selecting action a in state s. The behavior policy is used to generate a sequence of experience (observations, actions and rewards). The goal is to learn, from this data, predictions about different ways of behaving. In this paper we focus on learning predictions about expected returns, but other predictions can be tackled as well (for instance, predictions of transition models for options (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), or predictions speciﬁed by a TD-network (Sutton & Tanner, 2005; Sutton, Rafols & Koop, 2006)). We assume that the state space is large or continuous, and function approximation must be used to compute any values of interest. In particular, we assume a space of feature vectors Φ and a mapping φ : S → Φ. We denote by φs the feature vector associated with s. An option is deﬁned as a triple o = I, π, β where I ⊆ S is the set of states in which the option can be initiated, π is the internal policy of the option and β : S → [0, 1] is a stochastic termination condition. In the option work (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), each of these elements has to be explicitly speciﬁed and ﬁxed in order for an option to be well deﬁned. Here, we will instead deﬁne options implicitly, using the notion of a recognizer. A recognizer is deﬁned as a function c : S × A → [0, 1], where c(s, a) indicates to what extent the recognizer allows action a in state s. An important special case, which we treat in this paper, is that of binary recognizers. In this case, c is an indicator function, specifying a subset of actions that are allowed, or recognized, given a particular state. Note that recognizers do not specify policies; instead, they merely give restrictions on the policies that are allowed or recognized. A recognizer c together with a behavior policy b generates a target policy π, where: b(s, a)c(s, a) b(s, a)c(s, a) π(s, a) = (7) = µ(s) ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x) The denominator of this fraction, µ(s) = ∑x b(s, x)c(s, x), is the recognition probability at s, i.e., the probability that an action will be accepted at s when behavior is generated according to b. The policy π is only deﬁned at states for which µ(s) > 0. The numerator gives the probability that action a is produced by the behavior and recognized in s. Note that if the recognizer accepts all state-action pairs, i.e. c(s, a) = 1, ∀s, a, then π is the same as b. Since a recognizer and a behavior policy can specify together a target policy, we can use recognizers as a way to specify policies for options, using (7). An option can only be initiated at a state for which at least one action is recognized, so µ(s) > 0, ∀s ∈ I. Similarly, the termination condition of such an option, β, is deﬁned as β(s) = 1 if µ(s) = 0. In other words, the option must terminate if no actions are recognized at a given state. At all other states, β can be deﬁned between 0 and 1 as desired. We will focus on computing the reward model of an option o, which represents the expected total return. The expected values of different features at the end of the option can be estimated similarly. The quantity that we want to compute is Eo {R(s)} = E{r1 + r2 + . . . + rT |s0 = s, π, β} where s ∈ I, experience is generated according to the policy of the option, π, and T denotes the random variable representing the time step at which the option terminates according to β. We assume that linear function approximation is used to represent these values, i.e. Eo {R(s)} ≈ θT φs where θ is a vector of parameters. 4 Off-policy learning algorithm In this section we present an adaptation of the off-policy learning algorithm of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) to the case of learning about options. Suppose that an option’s policy π was used to generate behavior. In this case, learning the reward model of the option is a special case of temporal-difference learning of value functions. The forward ¯ (n) view of this algorithm is as follows. Let Rt denote the truncated n-step return starting at ¯ (0) time step t and let yt denote the 0-step truncated return, Rt . By the deﬁnition of the n-step truncated return, we have: ¯ (n) ¯ (n−1) Rt = rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 . This is similar to the case of value functions, but it accounts for the possibility of terminating the option at time step t + 1. The λ-return is deﬁned in the usual way: ∞ ¯ (n) ¯ Rtλ = (1 − λ) ∑ λn−1 Rt . n=1 The parameters of the linear function approximator are updated on every time step proportionally to: ¯ ¯ ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 ) · · · (1 − βt ). In our case, however, trajectories are generated according to the behavior policy b. The main idea of the algorithm is to use importance sampling corrections in order to account for the difference in the state distribution of the two policies. Let ρt = (n) Rt , π(st ,at ) b(st ,at ) be the importance sampling ratio at time step t. The truncated n-step return, satisﬁes: (n) (n−1) Rt = ρt [rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )Rt+1 ]. The update to the parameter vector is proportional to: ∆θt = Rtλ − yt ∇θ yt ρ0 (1 − β1 ) · · · ρt−1 (1 − βt ). The following result shows that the expected updates of the on-policy and off-policy algorithms are the same. Theorem 3 For every time step t ≥ 0 and any initial state s, ¯ Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s]. (n) (n) ¯ Proof: First we will show by induction that Eb {Rt |s} = Eπ {Rt |s}, ∀n (which implies ¯ that Eb {Rtλ |s} = Eπ (Rtλ |s}). For n = 0, the statement is trivial. Assuming that it is true for n − 1, we have (n) Eb Rt |s = a ∑b(s, a)∑Pss ρ(s, a) a = s ∑∑ a Pss b(s, a) a s = a ∑π(s, a)∑Pss a (n−1) a rss + (1 − β(s ))Eb Rt+1 |s π(s, a) a ¯ (n−1) r + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s b(s, a) ss a ¯ (n−1) rss + (1 − β(s ))Eπ Rt+1 |s ¯ (n) = Eπ Rt |s . s Now we are ready to prove the theorem’s main statement. Deﬁning Ωt to be the set of all trajectory components up to state st , we have: Eb {∆θt |s} = ∑ ω∈Ωt Pb (ω|s)Eb (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω t−1 ∏ ρi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 πi (1 − βi+1 ) i=0 bi t−1 = t−1 ∑ ∏ bi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt Eb Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt ∏ i=0 t−1 = ∑ ∏ πi Psaiisi+1 ω∈Ωt = ∑ ω∈Ωt ¯ Eπ Rtλ |st − yt ∇θ yt (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) i=0 ¯ ¯ Pπ (ω|s)Eπ (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt |ω (1 − β1 )...(1 − βt ) = Eπ ∆θt |s . Note that we are able to use st and ω interchangeably because of the Markov property. ¯ Since we have shown that Eb [∆θt |s] = Eπ [∆θt |s] for any state s, it follows that the expected updates will also be equal for any distribution of the initial state s. When learning the model of options with data generated from the behavior policy b, the starting state distribution with respect to which the learning is performed, I0 is determined by the stationary distribution of the behavior policy, as well as the initiation set of the option I. We note also that the importance sampling corrections only have to be performed for the trajectory since the initiation of the updates for the option. No corrections are required for the experience prior to this point. This should generate updates that have signiﬁcantly lower variance than in the case of learning values of policies (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). Because of the termination condition of the option, β, ∆θ can quickly decay to zero. To avoid this problem, we can use a restart function g : S → [0, 1], such that g(st ) speciﬁes the extent to which the updating episode is considered to start at time t. Adding restarts generates a new forward update: t ∆θt = (Rtλ − yt )∇θ yt ∑ gi ρi ...ρt−1 (1 − βi+1 )...(1 − βt ), (8) i=0 where Rtλ is the same as above. With an adaptation of the proof in Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001), we can show that we get the same expected value of updates by applying this algorithm from the original starting distribution as we would by applying the algorithm without restarts from a starting distribution deﬁned by I0 and g. We can turn this forward algorithm into an incremental, backward view algorithm in the following way: • Initialize k0 = g0 , e0 = k0 ∇θ y0 • At every time step t: δt = θt+1 = kt+1 = et+1 = ρt (rt+1 + (1 − βt+1 )yt+1 ) − yt θt + αδt et ρt kt (1 − βt+1 ) + gt+1 λρt (1 − βt+1 )et + kt+1 ∇θ yt+1 Using a similar technique to that of Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta (2001) and Sutton & Barto (1998), we can prove that the forward and backward algorithm are equivalent (omitted due to lack of space). This algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the variance of the updates is ﬁnite (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta, 2001). In the case of options, the termination condition β can be used to ensure that this is the case. 5 Learning when the behavior policy is unknown In this section, we consider the case in which the behavior policy is unknown. This case is generally problematic for importance sampling algorithms, but the use of recognizers will allow us to deﬁne importance sampling corrections, as well as a convergent algorithm. Recall that when using a recognizer, the target policy of the option is deﬁned as: c(s, a)b(s, a) π(s, a) = µ(s) and the recognition probability becomes: π(s, a) c(s, a) = b(s, a) µ(s) Of course, µ(s) depends on b. If b is unknown, instead of µ(s), we will use a maximum likelihood estimate µ : S → [0, 1]. The structure used to compute µ will have to be compatible ˆ ˆ with the feature space used to represent the reward model. We will make this more precise below. Likewise, the recognizer c(s, a) will have to be deﬁned in terms of the features used to represent the model. We will then deﬁne the importance sampling corrections as: c(s, a) ˆ ρ(s, a) = µ(s) ˆ ρ(s, a) = We consider the case in which the function approximator used to model the option is actually a state aggregator. In this case, we will deﬁne recognizers which behave consistently in each partition, i.e., c(s, a) = c(p, a), ∀s ∈ p. This means that an action is either recognized or not recognized in all states of the partition. The recognition probability µ will have one ˆ entry for every partition p of the state space. Its value will be: N(p, c = 1) µ(p) = ˆ N(p) where N(p) is the number of times partition p was visited, and N(p, c = 1) is the number of times the action taken in p was recognized. In the limit, w.p.1, µ converges to ˆ ∑s d b (s|p) ∑a c(p, a)b(s, a) where d b (s|p) is the probability of visiting state s from partiˆ ˆ tion p under the stationary distribution of b. At this limit, π(s, a) = ρ(s, a)b(s, a) will be a ˆ well-deﬁned policy (i.e., ∑a π(s, a) = 1). Using Theorem 3, off-policy updates using imˆ portance sampling corrections ρ will have the same expected value as on-policy updates ˆ ˆ using π. Note though that the learning algorithm never uses π; the only quantities needed ˆ are ρ, which are learned incrementally from data. For the case of general linear function approximation, we conjecture that a similar idea can be used, where the recognition probability is learned using logistic regression. The development of this part is left for future work.

<p>Author: Douglas Aberdeen</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic temporal planning attempts to ﬁnd good policies for acting in domains with concurrent durative tasks, multiple uncertain outcomes, and limited resources. These domains are typically modelled as Markov decision problems and solved using dynamic programming methods. This paper demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning — in the form of a policy-gradient method — to these domains. Our emphasis is large domains that are infeasible for dynamic programming. Our approach is to construct simple policies, or agents, for each planning task. The result is a general probabilistic temporal planner, named the Factored Policy-Gradient Planner (FPG-Planner), which can handle hundreds of tasks, optimising for probability of success, duration, and resource use. 1</p><p>5 0.57045102 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Online_Policy_Gradient_Learning_with_SMD_Gain_Vector_Adaptation.html">72 nips-2005-Fast Online Policy Gradient Learning with SMD Gain Vector Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider approximate value iteration with a parameterized approximator in which the state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go function over each partition is approximated by a constant. We establish performance loss bounds for policies derived from approximations associated with ﬁxed points. These bounds identify beneﬁts to having projection weights equal to the invariant distribution of the resulting policy. Such projection weighting leads to the same ﬁxed points as TD(0). Our analysis also leads to the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average cost objective. 1 Preliminaries Consider a discrete-time communicating Markov decision process (MDP) with a ﬁnite state space S = {1, . . . , |S|}. At each state x ∈ S, there is a ﬁnite set Ux of admissible actions. If the current state is x and an action u ∈ Ux is selected, a cost of gu (x) is incurred, and the system transitions to a state y ∈ S with probability pxy (u). For any x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , y∈S pxy (u) = 1. Costs are discounted at a rate of α ∈ (0, 1) per period. Each instance of such an MDP is deﬁned by a quintuple (S, U, g, p, α). A (stationary deterministic) policy is a mapping µ that assigns an action u ∈ Ux to each state x ∈ S. If actions are selected based on a policy µ, the state follows a Markov process with transition matrix Pµ , where each (x, y)th entry is equal to pxy (µ(x)). The restriction to communicating MDPs ensures that it is possible to reach any state from any other state. Each policy µ is associated with a cost-to-go function Jµ ∈ |S| , deﬁned by Jµ = ∞ t t −1 gµ , where, with some abuse of notation, gµ (x) = gµ(x) (x) t=0 α Pµ gµ = (I − αPµ ) for each x ∈ S. A policy µ is said to be greedy with respect to a function J if µ(x) ∈ argmin(gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)) for all x ∈ S. u∈Ux The optimal cost-to-go function J ∗ ∈ |S| is deﬁned by J ∗ (x) = minµ Jµ (x), for all x ∈ S. A policy µ∗ is said to be optimal if Jµ∗ = J ∗ . It is well-known that an optimal policy exists. Further, a policy µ∗ is optimal if and only if it is greedy with respect to J ∗ . Hence, given the optimal cost-to-go function, optimal actions can computed be minimizing the right-hand side of the above inclusion. Value iteration generates a sequence J converging to J ∗ according to J +1 = T J , where T is the dynamic programming operator, deﬁned by (T J)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)J(y)), for all x ∈ S and J ∈ |S| . This sequence converges to J ∗ for any initialization of J0 . 2 Approximate Value Iteration The state spaces of relevant MDPs are typically so large that computation and storage of a cost-to-go function is infeasible. One approach to dealing with this obstacle involves partitioning the state space S into a manageable number K of disjoint subsets S1 , . . . , SK and approximating the optimal cost-to-go function with a function that is constant over each partition. This can be thought of as a form of state aggregation – all states within a given partition are assumed to share a common optimal cost-to-go. To represent an approximation, we deﬁne a matrix Φ ∈ |S|×K such that each kth column is an indicator function for the kth partition Sk . Hence, for any r ∈ K , k, and x ∈ Sk , (Φr)(x) = rk . In this paper, we study variations of value iteration, each of which computes a vector r so that Φr approximates J ∗ . The use of such a policy µr which is greedy with respect to Φr is justiﬁed by the following result (see [10] for a proof): ˜ Theorem 1 If µ is a greedy policy with respect to a function J ∈ Jµ − J ∗ ≤ ∞ 2α ˜ J∗ − J 1−α |S| then ∞. One common way of approximating a function J ∈ |S| with a function of the form Φr involves projection with respect to a weighted Euclidean norm · π . The weighted Euclidean 1/2 |S| 2 norm: J 2,π = . Here, π ∈ + is a vector of weights that assign x∈S π(x)J (x) relative emphasis among states. The projection Ππ J is the function Φr that attains the minimum of J −Φr 2,π ; if there are multiple functions Φr that attain the minimum, they must form an afﬁne space, and the projection is taken to be the one with minimal norm Φr 2,π . Note that in our context, where each kth column of Φ represents an indicator function for the kth partition, for any π, J, and x ∈ Sk , (Ππ J)(x) = y∈Sk π(y)J(y)/ y∈Sk π(y). Approximate value iteration begins with a function Φr(0) and generates a sequence according to Φr( +1) = Ππ T Φr( ) . It is well-known that the dynamic programming operator T is a contraction mapping with respect to the maximum norm. Further, Ππ is maximum-norm nonexpansive [16, 7, 8]. (This is not true for general Φ, but is true in our context in which columns of Φ are indicator functions for partitions.) It follows that the composition Ππ T is a contraction mapping. By the contraction mapping theorem, Ππ T has a unique ﬁxed point Φ˜, which is the limit of the sequence Φr( ) . Further, the following result holds: r Theorem 2 For any MDP, partition, and weights π with support intersecting every partition, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ then r r Φ˜ − J ∗ r ∞ ≤ 2 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K and (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ ≤ ∞, 4α min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞. The ﬁrst inequality of the theorem is an approximation error bound, established in [16, 7, 8] for broader classes of approximators that include state aggregation as a special case. The second is a performance loss bound, derived by simply combining the approximation error bound and Theorem 1. Note that Jµr (x) ≥ J ∗ (x) for all x, so the left-hand side of the performance loss bound ˜ is the maximal increase in cost-to-go, normalized by 1 − α. This normalization is natural, since a cost-to-go function is a linear combination of expected future costs, with coefﬁcients 1, α, α2 , . . ., which sum to 1/(1 − α). Our motivation of the normalizing constant begs the question of whether, for ﬁxed MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and ﬁxed Φ, minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ also grows with 1/(1 − α). It turns out that minr J ∗ − Φr ∞ = O(1). To see why, note that for any µ, Jµ = (I − αPµ )−1 gµ = 1 λ µ + hµ , 1−α where λµ (x) is the expected average cost if the process starts in state x and is controlled by policy µ, τ −1 1 t λµ = lim Pµ gµ , τ →∞ τ t=0 and hµ is the discounted differential cost function hµ = (I − αPµ )−1 (gµ − λµ ). Both λµ and hµ converge to ﬁnite vectors as α approaches 1 [3]. For an optimal policy µ∗ , limα↑1 λµ∗ (x) does not depend on x (in our context of a communicating MDP). Since constant functions lie in the range of Φ, lim min J ∗ − Φr α↑1 r∈ K ∞ ≤ lim hµ∗ α↑1 ∞ < ∞. The performance loss bound still exhibits an undesirable dependence on α through the coefﬁcient 4α/(1 − α). In most relevant contexts, α is close to 1; a representative value might be 0.99. Consequently, 4α/(1 − α) can be very large. Unfortunately, the bound is sharp, as expressed by the following theorem. We will denote by 1 the vector with every component equal to 1. Theorem 3 For any δ > 0, α ∈ (0, 1), and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ r r with π = 1, 4α min J ∗ − Φr ∞ − δ. (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ∞ ≥ ˜ 1 − α r∈ K This theorem is established through an example in [22]. The choice of uniform weights (π = 1) is meant to point out that even for such a simple, perhaps natural, choice of weights, the performance loss bound is sharp. Based on Theorems 2 and 3, one might expect that there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that, with π = 1, (1 − α) Jµr − J ∗ ˜ ∞ =Θ 1 min J ∗ − Φr 1 − α r∈ K ∞ . In other words, that the performance loss is both lower and upper bounded by 1/(1 − α) times the smallest possible approximation error. It turns out that this is not true, at least if we restrict to a ﬁnite state space. However, as the following theorem establishes, the coefﬁcient multiplying minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ can grow arbitrarily large as α increases, keeping all else ﬁxed. Theorem 4 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r lim inf (1 − α) (Jµr (x) − J ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. This Theorem is also established through an example [22]. For any µ and x, lim ((1 − α)Jµ (x) − λµ (x)) = lim(1 − α)hµ (x) = 0. α↑1 α↑1 Combined with Theorem 4, this yields the following corollary. Corollary 1 For any L and ∆ ≥ 0, there exists MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and a partition such that limα↑1 minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ = ∆ and, if Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1, r r ∗ lim inf (λµr (x) − λµ∗ (x)) ≥ L lim min J − Φr ∞ , ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K for all x ∈ S. 3 Using the Invariant Distribution In the previous section, we considered an approximation Φ˜ that solves Ππ T Φ˜ = Φ˜ for r r r some arbitrary pre-selected weights π. We now turn to consider use of an invariant state distribution πr of Pµr as the weight vector.1 This leads to a circular deﬁnition: the weights ˜ ˜ are used in deﬁning r and now we are deﬁning the weights in terms of r. What we are ˜ ˜ really after here is a vector r that satisﬁes Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜. The following theorem captures ˜ r r ˜ the associated beneﬁts. (Due to space limitations, we omit the proof, which is provided in the full length version of this paper [22].) Theorem 5 For any MDP and partition, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and πr has support intersecting r r ˜ ˜ T every partition, (1 − α)πr (Jµr − J ∗ ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ ˜ When α is close to 1, which is typical, the right-hand side of our new performance loss bound is far less than that of Theorem 2. The primary improvement is in the omission of a factor of 1 − α from the denominator. But for the bounds to be compared in a meaningful way, we must also relate the left-hand-side expressions. A relation can be based on the fact that for all µ, limα↑1 (1 − α)Jµ − λµ ∞ = 0, as explained in Section 2. In particular, based on this, we have lim(1 − α) Jµ − J ∗ ∞ = |λµ − λ∗ | = λµ − λ∗ = lim π T (Jµ − J ∗ ), α↑1 α↑1 for all policies µ and probability distributions π. Hence, the left-hand-side expressions from the two performance bounds become directly comparable as α approaches 1. Another interesting comparison can be made by contrasting Corollary 1 against the following immediate consequence of Theorem 5. Corollary 2 For all MDP parameters (S, U, g, p) and partitions, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and r r ˜ lim inf α↑1 x∈Sk πr (x) > 0 for all k, ˜ lim sup λµr − λµ∗ ∞ ≤ 2 lim min J ∗ − Φr ∞ . ˜ α↑1 α↑1 r∈ K The comparison suggests that solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ is strongly preferable to solving r r ˜ Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ with π = 1. r r 1 By an invariant state distribution of a transition matrix P , we mean any probability distribution π such that π T P = π T . In the event that Pµr has multiple invariant distributions, πr denotes an ˜ ˜ arbitrary choice. 4 Exploration If a vector r solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ and the support of πr intersects every partition, Theorem ˜ r r ˜ ˜ 5 promises a desirable bound. However, there are two signiﬁcant shortcomings to this solution concept, which we will address in this section. First, in some cases, the equation Ππr T Φ˜ = Φ˜ does not have a solution. It is easy to produce examples of this; though r r ˜ no example has been documented for the particular class of approximators we are using here, [2] offers an example involving a different linearly parameterized approximator that captures the spirit of what can happen. Second, it would be nice to relax the requirement that the support of πr intersect every partition. ˜ To address these shortcomings, we introduce stochastic policies. A stochastic policy µ maps state-action pairs to probabilities. For each x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , µ(x, u) is the probability of taking action u when in state x. Hence, µ(x, u) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ S and u ∈ Ux , and u∈Ux µ(x, u) = 1 for all x ∈ S. Given a scalar > 0 and a function J, the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to J is deﬁned by µ(x, u) = e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e For any > 0 and r, let µr denote the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr. Further, we deﬁne a modiﬁed dynamic programming operator that incorporates Boltzmann exploration: (T J)(x) = u∈Ux e−(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e (Tu J)(x) . −(Tu J)(x)(|Ux |−1)/ e u∈Ux e As approaches 0, -greedy Boltzmann exploration policies become greedy and the modiﬁed dynamic programming operators become the dynamic programming operator. More precisely, for all r, x, and J, lim ↓0 µr (x, µr (x)) = 1 and lim ↓1 T J = T J. These are immediate consequences of the following result (see [4] for a proof). Lemma 1 For any n, v ∈ mini vi . n , mini vi + ≥ i e−vi (n−1)/ e vi / i e−vi (n−1)/ e ≥ Because we are only concerned with communicating MDPs, there is a unique invariant state distribution associated with each -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy µr and the support of this distribution is S. Let πr denote this distribution. We consider a vector r that ˜ solves Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. For any > 0, there exists a solution to this equation (this is an r r ˜ immediate extension of Theorem 5.1 from [4]). We have the following performance loss bound, which parallels Theorem 5 but with an equation for which a solution is guaranteed to exist and without any requirement on the resulting invariant distribution. (Again, we omit the proof, which is available in [22].) Theorem 6 For any MDP, partition, and > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ then (1 − r r ˜ T ∗ ∗ α)(πr ) (Jµr − J ) ≤ 2α minr∈ K J − Φr ∞ + . ˜ ˜ 5 Computation: TD(0) Though computation is not a focus of this paper, we offer a brief discussion here. First, we describe a simple algorithm from [16], which draws on ideas from temporal-difference learning [11, 12] and Q-learning [23, 24] to solve Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. It requires an abilr r ity to sample a sequence of states x(0) , x(1) , x(2) , . . ., each independent and identically distributed according to π. Also required is a way to efﬁciently compute (T Φr)(x) = minu∈Ux (gu (x) + α y∈S pxy (u)(Φr)(y)), for any given x and r. This is typically possible when the action set Ux and the support of px· (u) (i.e., the set of states that can follow x if action u is selected) are not too large. The algorithm generates a sequence of vectors r( ) according to r( +1) = r( ) + γ φ(x( ) ) (T Φr( ) )(x( ) ) − (Φr( ) )(x( ) ) , where γ is a step size and φ(x) denotes the column vector made up of components from the xth row of Φ. In [16], using results from [15, 9], it is shown that under appropriate assumptions on the step size sequence, r( ) converges to a vector r that solves Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜. ˜ r r The equation Φ˜ = Ππ T Φ˜ may have no solution. Further, the requirement that states r r are sampled independently from the invariant distribution may be impractical. However, a natural extension of the above algorithm leads to an easily implementable version of TD(0) that aims at solving Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. The algorithm requires simulation of a trajectory r r ˜ x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . of the MDP, with each action ut ∈ Uxt generated by the -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy with respect to Φr(t) . The sequence of vectors r(t) is generated according to r(t+1) = r(t) + γt φ(xt ) (T Φr(t) )(xt ) − (Φr(t) )(xt ) . Under suitable conditions on the step size sequence, if this algorithm converges, the limit satisﬁes Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜. Whether such an algorithm converges and whether there are r r ˜ other algorithms that can effectively solve Φ˜ = Ππr T Φ˜ for broad classes of relevant r r ˜ problems remain open issues. 6 Extensions and Open Issues Our results demonstrate that weighting a Euclidean norm projection by the invariant distribution of a greedy (or approximately greedy) policy can lead to a dramatic performance gain. It is intriguing that temporal-difference learning implicitly carries out such a projection, and consequently, any limit of convergence obeys the stronger performance loss bound. This is not the ﬁrst time that the invariant distribution has been shown to play a critical role in approximate value iteration and temporal-difference learning. In prior work involving approximation of a cost-to-go function for a ﬁxed policy (no control) and a general linearly parameterized approximator (arbitrary matrix Φ), it was shown that weighting by the invariant distribution is key to ensuring convergence and an approximation error bound [17, 18]. Earlier empirical work anticipated this [13, 14]. The temporal-difference learning algorithm presented in Section 5 is a version of TD(0), This is a special case of TD(λ), which is parameterized by λ ∈ [0, 1]. It is not known whether the results of this paper can be extended to the general case of λ ∈ [0, 1]. Prior research has suggested that larger values of λ lead to superior results. In particular, an example of [1] and the approximation error bounds of [17, 18], both of which are restricted to the case of a ﬁxed policy, suggest that approximation error is ampliﬁed by a factor of 1/(1 − α) as λ is changed from 1 to 0. The results of Sections 3 and 4 suggest that this factor vanishes if one considers a controlled process and performance loss rather than approximation error. Whether the results of this paper can be extended to accommodate approximate value iteration with general linearly parameterized approximators remains an open issue. In this broader context, error and performance loss bounds of the kind offered by Theorem 2 are unavailable, even when the invariant distribution is used to weight the projection. Such error and performance bounds are available, on the other hand, for the solution to a certain linear program [5, 6]. Whether a factor of 1/(1 − α) can similarly be eliminated from these bounds is an open issue. Our results can be extended to accommodate an average cost objective, assuming that the MDP is communicating. With Boltzmann exploration, the equation of interest becomes Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1). r r ˜ ˜ ˜ The variables include an estimate λ ∈ of the minimal average cost λ∗ ∈ and an approximation Φ˜ of the optimal differential cost function h∗ . The discount factor α is set r to 1 in computing an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy as well as T . There is an average-cost version of temporal-difference learning for which any limit of convergence ˜ ˜ (λ, r) satisﬁes this equation [19, 20, 21]. Generalization of Theorem 2 does not lead to a useful result because the right-hand side of the bound becomes inﬁnite as α approaches 1. On the other hand, generalization of Theorem 6 yields the ﬁrst performance loss bound for approximate value iteration with an average-cost objective: Theorem 7 For any communicating MDP with an average-cost objective, partition, and r ˜ > 0, if Φ˜ = Ππr (T Φ˜ − λ1) then r ˜ λµr − λ∗ ≤ 2 min h∗ − Φr ˜ r∈ K ∞ + . Here, λµr ∈ denotes the average cost under policy µr , which is well-deﬁned because the ˜ ˜ process is irreducible under an -greedy Boltzmann exploration policy. This theorem can be proved by taking limits on the left and right-hand sides of the bound of Theorem 6. It is easy to see that the limit of the left-hand side is λµr − λ∗ . The limit of minr∈ K J ∗ − Φr ∞ ˜ on the right-hand side is minr∈ K h∗ − Φr ∞ . (This follows from the analysis of [3].)

Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We present a family of approximation techniques for probabilistic graphical models, based on the use of graphical preconditioners developed in the scientiﬁc computing literature. Our framework yields rigorous upper and lower bounds on event probabilities and the log partition function of undirected graphical models, using non-iterative procedures that have low time complexity. As in mean ﬁeld approaches, the approximations are built upon tractable subgraphs; however, we recast the problem of optimizing the tractable distribution parameters and approximate inference in terms of the well-studied linear systems problem of obtaining a good matrix preconditioner.

<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Doru C. Balcan, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Biological sensory systems are faced with the problem of encoding a high-ﬁdelity sensory signal with a population of noisy, low-ﬁdelity neurons. This problem can be expressed in information theoretic terms as coding and transmitting a multi-dimensional, analog signal over a set of noisy channels. Previously, we have shown that robust, overcomplete codes can be learned by minimizing the reconstruction error with a constraint on the channel capacity. Here, we present a theoretical analysis that characterizes the optimal linear coder and decoder for one- and twodimensional data. The analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides a number of important insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions to achieve robustness. We also report numerical solutions for robust coding of highdimensional image data and show that these codes are substantially more robust compared against other image codes such as ICA and wavelets. 1</p><p>4 0.59608811 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Generalization_to_Unseen_Cases.html">85 nips-2005-Generalization to Unseen Cases</a></p>
<p>Author: Teemu Roos, Peter Grünwald, Petri Myllymäki, Henry Tirri</p><p>Abstract: We analyze classiﬁcation error on unseen cases, i.e. cases that are different from those in the training set. Unlike standard generalization error, this off-training-set error may differ signiﬁcantly from the empirical error with high probability even with large sample sizes. We derive a datadependent bound on the difference between off-training-set and standard generalization error. Our result is based on a new bound on the missing mass, which for small samples is stronger than existing bounds based on Good-Turing estimators. As we demonstrate on UCI data-sets, our bound gives nontrivial generalization guarantees in many practical cases. In light of these results, we show that certain claims made in the No Free Lunch literature are overly pessimistic. 1</p><p>5 0.59258074 <a title="186-lda-5" href="./nips-2005-Estimating_the_wrong_Markov_random_field%3A_Benefits_in_the_computation-limited_setting.html">65 nips-2005-Estimating the wrong Markov random field: Benefits in the computation-limited setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Consider the problem of joint parameter estimation and prediction in a Markov random ﬁeld: i.e., the model parameters are estimated on the basis of an initial set of data, and then the ﬁtted model is used to perform prediction (e.g., smoothing, denoising, interpolation) on a new noisy observation. Working in the computation-limited setting, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for ﬁtting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the “wrong” model even in the inﬁnite data limit) is provably beneﬁcial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of variational methods. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product. 1 Keywords: Markov random ﬁelds; variational method; message-passing algorithms; sum-product; belief propagation; parameter estimation; learning. 1</p><p>6 0.58042794 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Layered_Dynamic_Textures.html">108 nips-2005-Layered Dynamic Textures</a></p>

</p><p>4 35- m 2-poly 3-metal CMOS technology and the edge ﬁltering at a rate of 200 frames/sec. [sent-18, score-0.123]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction Directional edge detection in an input image is the most essential operation in early visual processing [1, 2]. [sent-20, score-0.337]
</p><p>6 Such spatial ﬁltering operations are carried out by taking the convolution between a block of pixels and a weight matrix, requiring a number of multiply-andaccumulate operations. [sent-21, score-0.328]
</p><p>7 Since the convolution operation must be repeated pixel-by-pixel to scan the entire image, the computation is very expensive and software solutions are not compatible to real-time applications. [sent-22, score-0.37]
</p><p>8 Therefore, the hardware implementation of focalplane parallel processing is highly demanded. [sent-23, score-0.185]
</p><p>9 However, there exists a hard problem which we call the interconnects explosion as illustrated in Fig. [sent-24, score-0.454]
</p><p>10 interconnects for pixels in the two rows, an illustrative example of interconnecs explosion. [sent-35, score-0.488]
</p><p>11 In carrying out a ﬁltering operation for one pixel, the luminance data must be gathered from the nearest-neighbor and second nearest-neighbor pixels. [sent-36, score-0.209]
</p><p>12 The interconnects necessary for this is illustrated in Fig. [sent-37, score-0.454]
</p><p>13 If such wiring is formed for two rows of pixels, excessively high density overlapping interconnects are required. [sent-39, score-0.558]
</p><p>14 If we extend this to an entire chip, it is impossible to form the wiring even with the most advanced VLSI interconnects technology. [sent-40, score-0.496]
</p><p>15 We must overcome the difﬁculty by introducing new architectures. [sent-43, score-0.027]
</p><p>16 In order to achieve real-time performance in image ﬁltering, a number of VLSI chips have been developed in both digital [3, 4] and analog [5, 6, 7] technologies. [sent-44, score-0.278]
</p><p>17 A ﬂash-convolution processor [4] allows a single 5¢5-pixel convolution operation in a single clock cycle by introducing a subtle memory access scheme. [sent-45, score-0.625]
</p><p>18 However, for an N¢M-pixel image, it takes N¢M clock cycles to complete the processing. [sent-46, score-0.073]
</p><p>19 In the line-parallel processing scheme employed in [7], both row-parallel and column-parallel processing scan the target image several times and the entire ﬁltering ﬁnishes in O (N+M) steps. [sent-47, score-0.274]
</p><p>20 (A single step includes several clock cycles to control the analog processing. [sent-48, score-0.259]
</p><p>21 ) The purpose of this work is to present an analog focal-plane CMOS image sensor chip which carries out the directional edge ﬁltering convolution for an N¢M-pixel image only in M (or N) steps. [sent-49, score-0.877]
</p><p>22 In order to achieve an efﬁcient processing, two key technologies have been introduced: “only-nearest-neighbor interconnects” architecture and “cyclic line access and row-parallel processing”. [sent-50, score-0.284]
</p><p>23 The former was ﬁrst developed in [8], and has enabled the convolution including second-nearest-neighbor luminance data only using nearest neighbor interconnects, thus greatly reducing the interconnect complexity. [sent-51, score-0.344]
</p><p>24 However, the ﬁll factor was sacriﬁced due to the pixel parallel organization. [sent-52, score-0.135]
</p><p>25 The problem has been resolved in the present work by “cyclic line access and row-parallel processing. [sent-53, score-0.13]
</p><p>26 ” Namely, the processing elements are separated from the array of photo diodes and the “only-nearest-neighbor interconnects” architecture was realized as a separate module of row-parallel processing elements. [sent-54, score-0.565]
</p><p>27 The cyclic line access scheme ﬁrst introduced in the present work has eliminated the redundant data readout operations from the photodiode array and has established a very efﬁcient processing. [sent-55, score-0.555]
</p><p>28 As a result, it has become possible to complete the edge ﬁltering for a 128¢128 pixel image only in 128¢2 steps. [sent-56, score-0.216]

[sent-60, score-0.735]
</p><p>31 2 System Organization The two key technologies employed in the present work are explained in the following. [sent-62, score-0.081]
</p><p>32 1 “Only-Nearest-Neighbor Interconnects” Architecture This architecture was ﬁrst proposed in [8], and experimentally veriﬁed with small-scale test circuits (7¢7 processing elements without photodiodes). [sent-64, score-0.351]
</p><p>33 The key feature of the architecture is that photodiodes (PD’s) are placed at four corners of each processing element (PE), and that the luminance data of each PD are shared by four PE’s as shown in Fig. [sent-65, score-0.453]
</p><p>34 The edge ﬁltering is carried out as explained below. [sent-67, score-0.165]
</p><p>35 2 (a), preprocessing is carried out in each PE using the luminance data taken from four PD’s located at its corners. [sent-69, score-0.176]
</p><p>36 This accomplishes the ﬁltering processing for one half of the entire pixels. [sent-72, score-0.114]
</p><p>37 Then the roles of pre-processing PE’s and center PE’s are interchanged and the same procedure follows to complete the processing for the rest of the pixels. [sent-73, score-0.079]
</p><p>38 The interconnects necessary for the entire parallel processing is shown in Fig. [sent-74, score-0.607]
</p><p>39 In this manner, every PE can gather all data necessary for the processing from its nearest-neighbor and second nearest-neighbor pixels without complicated crossover interconnects. [sent-76, score-0.141]
</p><p>40 2 (d) are utilized to detect the edge information at the center location. [sent-80, score-0.12]
</p><p>41 2 Cyclic Line Access and Row-Parallel Processing A block diagram of the analog edge-ﬁltering processor is given in Fig. [sent-85, score-0.365]
</p><p>42 It consists of an array of 131¢131 photodiodes (PD’s) and a module for row-parallel processing placed at the bottom of the PD array. [sent-87, score-0.371]
</p><p>43 Figure 4(b) illustrates the organization of the row processing module, which is composed of four rows of 130 PE’s and ﬁve rows of 131 analog memory cells that temporarily store the luminance data read out from the PD array. [sent-88, score-0.85]
</p><p>44 It should be noted that only three rows of PE’s and four rows of PD’s are sufﬁcient to carry out a singlerow processing as explained in reference to Fig. [sent-89, score-0.391]
</p><p>45 However, one extra row of PE’s and one extra row of analog memories for PD data storage were included in the row-parallel processing module. [sent-91, score-0.539]
</p><p>46 This is essential to carry out a seamless data read out from the PD array and computation without analog data shift within the processing module. [sent-92, score-0.496]
</p><p>47 The chip yields  analog PD memory  PE  5  3 4 5  5  4  1  4  3  4  7  2  3  6  5  2  5  6  1  5  (b)  (a)  (c)  (d)  Figure 5: “Cyclic-line access and row-parallel processing” scheme. [sent-93, score-0.596]
</p><p>48 the kernel convolution results for one of the rows in the PD array as 128 parallel outputs. [sent-94, score-0.477]
</p><p>49 Now, the operation of the row-parallel processing module is explained with reference to Fig. [sent-95, score-0.312]
</p><p>50 In order to carry out the convolution for the data in Row 1 4, the PD data are temporarily stored in the analog memory array as shown in Fig. [sent-98, score-0.616]
</p><p>51 The convolution operation proceeds using the upper four rows of data as explained in Fig. [sent-101, score-0.467]
</p><p>52 In the next step, the data from Row 5 are overwritten to the sites of Row 1 data as shown in Fig. [sent-103, score-0.076]
</p><p>53 The operation proceeds using the lower four rows of data and the second set of outputs is produced. [sent-105, score-0.252]
</p><p>54 In the third step, the data from Row 6 is overwritten to the sites of Row 2 data (Fig. [sent-106, score-0.076]
</p><p>55 5 (c)), and the convolution is taken using the data in the enclosure. [sent-107, score-0.174]
</p><p>56 Although a part of the data (top two rows) are separated from the rest, the topology of the hardware computation is identical to that explained in Fig. [sent-108, score-0.08]
</p><p>57 This is because the same set of data is stored in both top and bottom PD memories and the top and bottom PE’s are connected by “cyclic connection” as illustrated in Fig. [sent-110, score-0.094]
</p><p>58 By introducing such one extra row of PD memories and one extra row of PE’s with cyclic interconnections, row-parallel processing can be seamlessly performed with only a single-row PD data set download at each step. [sent-112, score-0.537]
</p><p>59 Figure 6(a) shows the adder circuit using the multiple-input ﬂoating-gate source follower [9]. [sent-116, score-0.207]
</p><p>60 The substrate of Å ½ is connected to the source to avoid the body effect. [sent-117, score-0.031]
</p><p>61 The transistor Å ¾ operates as a current source for fast output voltage stabilization as well as to achieve good linearity. [sent-118, score-0.162]
</p><p>62 Due to the charge redistribution in the ﬂoating gate, the average of the four input voltages appears at the output as  ÎÓÙØ  Î½ · Î¾ · Î¿ · Î  ·  ÎØ  where ÎØ represents the threshold voltage of Å ½. [sent-119, score-0.148]
</p><p>63 Here, the four coupling capacitors connected to the ﬂoating gate of Å ½ are identical and the capacitance coupling between the ﬂoating gate and the ground was assumed to be 0 for simplicity. [sent-120, score-0.313]
</p><p>64 The electrical charge in the ﬂoating gate is initialized periodically using the reset switch (Å ¿). [sent-121, score-0.113]
</p><p>65 The coupling capacitors themselves are also utilized as temporary memories for the PD data read out from the PD array. [sent-122, score-0.225]
</p><p>66 Figure 6(b) shows the subtraction circuit, where the same source follower was used. [sent-123, score-0.101]
</p><p>67 developed across the capacitor  :  ´Î Ò Ô½ · Î Ò Ô¾ µ   ´Î Ò Ñ½ · Î Ò Ñ¾ µ Then, SW1 and SW2 are turned off, and SW3 is turned on. [sent-125, score-0.134]
</p><p>68 As a result, the output voltage ÎÓÙØ becomes  ´Î Ò Ô½ · Î Ò Ô¾ µ   ´Î Ò Ñ½ · Î Ò Ñ¾ µ · Î · Ö represents the threshold voltage of Å ½. [sent-126, score-0.144]

</p><p>70 Figure 7 shows the photomicrograph of the chip, and the chip speciﬁcations are given in Table 1. [sent-129, score-0.268]
</p><p>71 Since the pitch of a single PE unit is larger than the pitch of the PD array, 130 PE units are laid out as two separate L-shaped blocks at the periphery of the PD array as seen in the chip photomicrograph. [sent-130, score-0.477]
</p><p>72 8, where the experimental results for   -degree edge ﬁltering are demonstrated. [sent-133, score-0.092]
</p><p>73 Since the thresholding circuitry was not implemented in the present chip, only the convolution results are shown. [sent-134, score-0.174]
</p><p>74 128 parallel outputs from the test chip were multiplexed for observation using the external multiplexers mounted on a milled printed circuit board. [sent-135, score-0.511]
</p><p>75 The vertical stripes observed in the result are due to the resistance variation in the external interconnects poorly produced on the milled printed circuit board. [sent-136, score-0.602]
</p><p>76 It was experimentally conﬁrmed the chip operates at 1000 frames/sec. [sent-137, score-0.357]
</p><p>77 However, the operation is limited by the integration time of PD’s and typical motion images are processed at about 200 frames/sec. [sent-138, score-0.11]
</p><p>78 The power dissipation in the PE’s was 25 mW and that in the PD array was 40mW. [sent-139, score-0.18]
</p><p>79 5 Conclusions An analog edge-ﬁltering processor has been developed based on the two key technologies: “only-nearest-neighbor interconnects” architecture and “cyclic line access and row-parallel  PEs  131 x 131 PD Array  PEs  Figure 7: Chip photomicrograph. [sent-140, score-0.591]

<p>Author: Tatsuto Murayama, Peter Davis</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a system-level analysis of a scalable distributed sensing model for networked sensors. In our system model, a data center acquires data from a bunch of L sensors which each independently encode their noisy observations of an original binary sequence, and transmit their encoded data sequences to the data center at a combined rate R, which is limited. Supposing that the sensors use independent LDGM rate distortion codes, we show that the system performance can be evaluated for any given ﬁnite R when the number of sensors L goes to inﬁnity. The analysis shows how the optimal strategy for the distributed sensing problem changes at critical values of the data rate R or the noise level. 1</p><p>4 0.12234488 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2005-Gradient_Flow_Independent_Component_Analysis_in_Micropower_VLSI.html">88 nips-2005-Gradient Flow Independent Component Analysis in Micropower VLSI</a></p>

Gradient ﬂow representation of the traveling wave signals acquired over a miniature (1cm diameter) array of four microphones yields linearly mixed instantaneous observations of the time-differentiated sources, separated and localized by independent component analysis (ICA). The gradient ﬂow and ICA processors each measure 3mm × 3mm in 0.5 µm CMOS, and consume 54 µW and 180 µW power, respectively, from a 3 V supply at 16 ks/s sampling rate. Experiments demonstrate perceptually clear (12dB) separation and precise localization of two speech sources presented through speakers positioned at 1.5m from the array on a conference room table. Analysis of the multipath residuals shows that they are spectrally diffuse, and void of the direct path.</p><p>5 0.1167304 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2005-Learning_in_Silicon%3A_Timing_is_Everything.html">118 nips-2005-Learning in Silicon: Timing is Everything</a></p>
<p>Author: John V. Arthur, Kwabena Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neuromorphic chip that uses binary synapses with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to learn stimulated patterns of activity and to compensate for variability in excitability. Speciﬁcally, STDP preferentially potentiates (turns on) synapses that project from excitable neurons, which spike early, to lethargic neurons, which spike late. The additional excitatory synaptic current makes lethargic neurons spike earlier, thereby causing neurons that belong to the same pattern to spike in synchrony. Once learned, an entire pattern can be recalled by stimulating a subset. 1 Variability in Neural Systems Evidence suggests precise spike timing is important in neural coding, speciﬁcally, in the hippocampus. The hippocampus uses timing in the spike activity of place cells (in addition to rate) to encode location in space [1]. Place cells employ a phase code: the timing at which a neuron spikes relative to the phase of the inhibitory theta rhythm (5-12Hz) conveys information. As an animal approaches a place cell’s preferred location, the place cell not only increases its spike rate, but also spikes at earlier phases in the theta cycle. To implement a phase code, the theta rhythm is thought to prevent spiking until the input synaptic current exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and the decreasing inhibition on the downward phase of the cycle [2]. However, even with identical inputs and common theta inhibition, neurons do not spike in synchrony. Variability in excitability spreads the activity in phase. Lethargic neurons (such as those with high thresholds) spike late in the theta cycle, since their input exceeds the sum of the neuron threshold and theta inhibition only after the theta inhibition has had time to decrease. Conversely, excitable neurons (such as those with low thresholds) spike early in the theta cycle. Consequently, variability in excitability translates into variability in timing. We hypothesize that the hippocampus achieves its precise spike timing (about 10ms) through plasticity enhanced phase-coding (PEP). The source of hippocampal timing precision in the presence of variability (and noise) remains unexplained. Synaptic plasticity can compensate for variability in excitability if it increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons in inverse proportion to their excitabilities. Recasting this in a phase-coding framework, we desire a learning rule that increases excitatory synaptic input to neurons directly related to their phases. Neurons that lag require additional synaptic input, whereas neurons that lead 120µm 190µm A B Figure 1: STDP Chip.

The spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) observed in the hippocampus satisﬁes this requirement [3]. It requires repeated pre-before-post spike pairings (within a time window) to potentiate and repeated post-before-pre pairings to depress a synapse. Here we validate our hypothesis with a model implemented in silicon, where variability is as ubiquitous as it is in biology [4]. Section 2 presents our silicon system, including the STDP Chip. Section 3 describes and characterizes the STDP circuit. Section 4 demonstrates that PEP compensates for variability and provides evidence that STDP is the compensation mechanism. Section 5 explores a desirable consequence of PEP: unconventional associative pattern recall. Section 6 discusses the implications of the PEP model, including its beneﬁts and applications in the engineering of neuromorphic systems and in the study of neurobiology. 2 Silicon System We have designed, submitted, and tested a silicon implementation of PEP. The STDP Chip was fabricated through MOSIS in a 1P5M 0.25µm CMOS process, with just under 750,000 transistors in just over 10mm2 of area. It has a 32 by 32 array of excitatory principal neurons commingled with a 16 by 16 array of inhibitory interneurons that are not used here (Figure 1A). Each principal neuron has 21 STDP synapses. The address-event representation (AER) [5] is used to transmit spikes off chip and to receive afferent and recurrent spike input. To conﬁgure the STDP Chip as a recurrent network, we embedded it in a circuit board (Figure 1B). The board has ﬁve primary components: a CPLD (complex programmable logic device), the STDP Chip, a RAM chip, a USB interface chip, and DACs (digital-to-analog converters). The central component in the system is the CPLD. The CPLD handles AER trafﬁc, mediates communication between devices, and implements recurrent connections by accessing a lookup table, stored in the RAM chip. The USB interface chip provides a bidirectional link with a PC. The DACs control the analog biases in the system, including the leak current, which the PC varies in real-time to create the global inhibitory theta rhythm. The principal neuron consists of a refractory period and calcium-dependent potassium circuit (RCK), a synapse circuit, and a soma circuit (Figure 2A).

The histogram includes spikes from ﬁve theta cycles. composed of two reusable blocks: the low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) and the pulse extender (PE). The soma is a modiﬁed version of the LPF, which receives additional input from an axonhillock circuit (AH). RCK is inhibitory to the neuron. It consists of a PE, which models calcium inﬂux during a spike, and a LPF, which models calcium buffering. When AH ﬁres a spike, a packet of charge is dumped onto a capacitor in the PE. The PE’s output activates until the charge decays away, which takes a few milliseconds. Also, while the PE is active, charge accumulates on the LPF’s capacitor, lowering the LPF’s output voltage. Once the PE deactivates, this charge leaks away as well, but this takes tens of milliseconds because the leak is smaller. The PE’s and the LPF’s inhibitory effects on the soma are both described below in terms of the sum (ISHUNT ) of the currents their output voltages produce in pMOS transistors whose sources are at Vdd (see Figure 2A). Note that, in the absence of spikes, these currents decay exponentially, with a time-constant determined by their respective leaks. The synapse circuit is excitatory to the neuron. It is composed of a PE, which represents the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft, and a LPF, which represents the bound neurotransmitter. The synapse circuit is similar to RCK in structure but differs in function: It is activated not by the principal neuron itself but by the STDP circuits (or directly by afferent spikes that bypass these circuits, i.e., ﬁxed synapses). The synapse’s effect on the soma is also described below in terms of the current (ISYN ) its output voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd. The soma circuit is a leaky integrator. It receives excitation from the synapse circuit and shunting inhibition from RCK and has a leak current as well. Its temporal behavior is described by: τ dISOMA ISYN I0 + ISOMA = dt ISHUNT where ISOMA is the current the capacitor’s voltage produces in a pMOS transistor whose source is at Vdd (see Figure 2A). ISHUNT is the sum of the leak, refractory, and calciumdependent potassium currents. These currents also determine the time constant: τ = C Ut κISHUNT , where I0 and κ are transistor parameters and Ut is the thermal voltage.

A The circuit is composed of three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM. B The circuit potentiates when the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike and depresses when the postsynaptic spike precedes the presynaptic spike. The soma circuit is connected to an AH, the locus of spike generation. The AH consists of model voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channel populations (modiﬁed from [6] by Kai Hynna). It initiates the AER signaling process required to send a spike off chip. To characterize principal neuron variability, we excited 81 neurons with poisson-like 58Hz spike trains (Figure 2B). We made these spike trains poisson-like by starting with a regular 200Hz spike train and dropping spikes randomly, with probability of 0.71. Thus spikes were delivered to neurons that won the coin toss in synchrony every 5ms. However, neurons did not lock onto the input synchrony due to ﬁltering by the synaptic time constant (see Figure 2B). They also received a common inhibitory input at the theta frequency (8.3Hz), via their leak current. Each neuron was prevented from ﬁring more than one spike in a theta cycle by its model calcium-dependent potassium channel population. The principal neurons’ spike times were variable. To quantify the spike variability, we used timing precision, which we deﬁne as twice the standard deviation of spike times accumulated from ﬁve theta cycles. With an input rate of 58Hz the timing precision was 34ms. 3 STDP Circuit The STDP circuit (related to [7]-[8]), for which the STDP Chip is named, is the most abundant, with 21,504 copies on the chip. This circuit is built from three subcircuits: decay, integrator, and SRAM (Figure 3A). The decay and integrator are used to implement potentiation, and depression, in a symmetric fashion. The SRAM holds the current binary state of the synapse, either potentiated or depressed. For potentiation, the decay remembers the last presynaptic spike. Its capacitor is charged when that spike occurs and discharges linearly thereafter. A postsynaptic spike samples the charge remaining on the capacitor, passes it through an exponential function, and dumps the resultant charge into the integrator. This charge decays linearly thereafter. At the time of the postsynaptic spike, the SRAM, a cross-coupled inverter pair, reads the voltage on the integrator’s capacitor. If it exceeds a threshold, the SRAM switches state from depressed to potentiated (∼LTD goes high and ∼LTP goes low). The depression side of the STDP circuit is exactly symmetric, except that it responds to postsynaptic activation followed by presynaptic activation and switches the SRAM’s state from potentiated to depressed (∼LTP goes high and ∼LTD goes low). When the SRAM is in the potentiated state, the presynaptic 50 After STDP 83 92 100 Timing precision(ms) Before STDP 75 B Before STDP After STDP 40 30 20 10 0 50 60 70 80 90 Input rate(Hz) 100 50 58 67 text A 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 0.2 0.4 Time(s) 0.6 C Figure 4: Plasticity enhanced phase-coding.

C Each neuron (center box) sends synapses to (dark gray) and receives synapses from (light gray) twenty-one randomly chosen neighbors up to ﬁve nodes away (black indicates both connections). spike activates the principal neuron’s synapse; otherwise the spike has no effect. We characterized the STDP circuit by activating a plastic synapse and a ﬁxed synapse– which elicits a spike at different relative times. We repeated this pairing at 16Hz. We counted the number of pairings required to potentiate (or depress) the synapse. Based on this count, we calculated the efﬁcacy of each pairing as the inverse number of pairings required (Figure 3B). For example, if twenty pairings were required to potentiate the synapse, the efﬁcacy of that pre-before-post time-interval was one twentieth. The efﬁcacy of both potentiation and depression are ﬁt by exponentials with time constants of 11.4ms and 94.9ms, respectively. This behavior is similar to that observed in the hippocampus: potentiation has a shorter time constant and higher maximum efﬁcacy than depression [3]. 4 Recurrent Network We carried out an experiment designed to test the STDP circuit’s ability to compensate for variability in spike timing through PEP. Each neuron received recurrent connections from 21 randomly selected neurons within an 11 by 11 neighborhood centered on itself (see Figure 4C). Conversely, it made recurrent connections to randomly chosen neurons within the same neighborhood. These connections were mediated by STDP circuits, initialized to the depressed state. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons and delivered spikes at a mean rate of 50 to 100Hz to each one (dropping spikes with a probability of 0.75 to 0.5 from a regular 200Hz train) and provided common theta inhibition as before. We compared the variability in spike timing after ﬁve seconds of learning with the initial distribution. Phase coding was enhanced after STDP (Figure 4A). Before STDP, spike timing among neurons was highly variable (except for the very highest input rate). After STDP, variability was virtually eliminated (except for the very lowest input rate). Initially, the variability, characterized by timing precision, was inversely related to the input rate, decreasing from 34 to 13ms. After ﬁve seconds of STDP, variability decreased and was largely independent of input rate, remaining below 11ms. Potentiated synapses 25 A Synaptic state after STDP 20 15 10 5 0 B 50 100 150 200 Spiking order 250 Figure 5: Compensating for variability. A Some synapses (dots) become potentiated (light) while others remain depressed (dark) after STDP. B The number of potentiated synapses neurons make (pluses) and receive (circles) is negatively (r = -0.71) and positively (r = 0.76) correlated to their rank in the spiking order, respectively. Comparing the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received with its excitability conﬁrmed the PEP hypothesis (i.e., leading neurons provide additional synaptic current to lagging neurons via potentiated recurrent synapses). In this experiment, to eliminate variability due to noise (as opposed to excitability), we provided a 17 by 17 cluster of neurons with a regular 200Hz excitatory input. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. After 10 seconds of STDP, a large fraction of the synapses were potentiated (Figure 5A). When the number of potentiated synapses each neuron made or received was plotted versus its rank in spiking order (Figure 5B), a clear correlation emerged (r = -0.71 or 0.76, respectively). As expected, neurons that spiked early made more and received fewer potentiated synapses. In contrast, neurons that spiked late made fewer and received more potentiated synapses. 5 Pattern Completion After STDP, we found that the network could recall an entire pattern given a subset, thus the same mechanisms that compensated for variability and noise could also compensate for lack of information. We chose a 9 by 9 cluster of neurons as our pattern and delivered a poisson-like spike train with mean rate of 67Hz to each one as in the ﬁrst experiment. Theta inhibition was present as before and all synapses were initialized to the depressed state. Before STDP, we stimulated a subset of the pattern and only neurons in that subset spiked (Figure 6A). After ﬁve seconds of STDP, we stimulated the same subset again. This time they recruited spikes from other neurons in the pattern, completing it (Figure 6B). Upon varying the fraction of the pattern presented, we found that the fraction recalled increased faster than the fraction presented. We selected subsets of the original pattern randomly, varying the fraction of neurons chosen from 0.1 to 1.0 (ten trials for each). We classiﬁed neurons as active if they spiked in the two second period over which we recorded. Thus, we characterized PEP’s pattern-recall performance as a function of the probability that the pattern in question’s neurons are activated (Figure 6C). At a fraction of 0.50 presented, nearly all of the neurons in the pattern are consistently activated (0.91±0.06), showing robust pattern completion. We ﬁtted the recall performance with a sigmoid that reached 0.50 recall fraction with an input fraction of 0.30. No spurious neurons were activated during any trials.

C The fraction of the pattern activated grows faster than the fraction stimulated. 6 Discussion Our results demonstrate that PEP successfully compensates for graded variations in our silicon recurrent network using binary (on–off) synapses (in contrast with [8], where weights are graded). While our chip results are encouraging, variability was not eliminated in every case. In the case of the lowest input (50Hz), we see virtually no change (Figure 4A). We suspect the timing remains imprecise because, with such low input, neurons do not spike every theta cycle and, consequently, provide fewer opportunities for the STDP synapses to potentiate. This shortfall illustrates the system’s limits; it can only compensate for variability within certain bounds, and only for activity appropriate to the PEP model. As expected, STDP is the mechanism responsible for PEP. STDP potentiated recurrent synapses from leading neurons to lagging neurons, reducing the disparity among the diverse population of neurons. Even though the STDP circuits are themselves variable, with different efﬁcacies and time constants, when using timing the sign of the weight-change is always correct (data not shown). For this reason, we chose STDP over other more physiological implementations of plasticity, such as membrane-voltage-dependent plasticity (MVDP), which has the capability to learn with graded voltage signals [9], such as those found in active dendrites, providing more computational power [10]. Previously, we investigated a MVDP circuit, which modeled a voltage-dependent NMDAreceptor-gated synapse [11]. It potentiated when the calcium current analog exceeded a threshold, which was designed to occur only during a dendritic action potential. This circuit produced behavior similar to STDP, implying it could be used in PEP. However, it was sensitive to variability in the NMDA and potentiation thresholds, causing a fraction of the population to potentiate anytime the synapse received an input and another fraction to never potentiate, rendering both subpopulations useless. Therefore, the simpler, less biophysical STDP circuit won out over the MVDP circuit: In our system timing is everything. Associative storage and recall naturally emerge in the PEP network when synapses between neurons coactivated by a pattern are potentiated. These synapses allow neurons to recruit their peers when a subset of the pattern is presented, thereby completing the pattern. However, this form of pattern storage and completion differs from Hopﬁeld’s attractor model [12] . Rather than forming symmetric, recurrent neuronal circuits, our recurrent network forms asymmetric circuits in which neurons make connections exclusively to less excitable neurons in the pattern. In both the poisson-like and regular cases (Figures 4 & 5), only about six percent of potentiated connections were reciprocated, as expected by chance. We plan to investigate the storage capacity of this asymmetric form of associative memory. Our system lends itself to modeling brain regions that use precise spike timing, such as the hippocampus. We plan to extend the work presented to store and recall sequences of patterns, as the hippocampus is hypothesized to do. Place cells that represent different locations spike at different phases of the theta cycle, in relation to the distance to their preferred locations. This sequential spiking will allow us to link patterns representing different locations in the order those locations are visited, thereby realizing episodic memory. We propose PEP as a candidate neural mechanism for information coding and storage in the hippocampal system. Observations from the CA1 region of the hippocampus suggest that basal dendrites (which primarily receive excitation from recurrent connections) support submillisecond timing precision, consistent with PEP [13]. We have shown, in a silicon model, PEP’s ability to exploit such fast recurrent connections to sharpen timing precision as well as to associatively store and recall patterns.

<p>Author: Andre V. Schaik, Richard Reeve, Craig Jin, Tara Hamilton</p><p>Abstract: Female crickets can locate males by phonotaxis to the mating song they produce. The behaviour and underlying physiology has been studied in some depth showing that the cricket auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. We present an analogue very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of this process and show that results from testing the circuit agree with simulation and what is known from the behaviour and physiology of the cricket auditory system. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway. 1 In trod u ction Understanding how insects carry out complex sensorimotor tasks can help in the design of simple sensory and robotic systems. Often insect sensors have evolved into intricate filters matched to extract highly specific data from the environment which solves a particular problem directly with little or no need for further processing [1]. Examples include head stabilisation in the fly, which uses vision amongst other senses to estimate self-rotation and thus to stabilise its head in flight, and phonotaxis in the cricket. Because of the narrowness of the cricket body (only a few millimetres), the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) for sounds arriving at the two sides of the head is very small (10–20µs). Even with the tympanal membranes (eardrums) located, as they are, on the forelegs of the cricket, the ITD only reaches about 40µs, which is too low to detect directly from timings of neural spikes. Because the wavelength of the cricket calling song is significantly greater than the width of the cricket body the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) is also very low. In the absence of ITD or IID information, the cricket uses phase to determine direction. This is possible because the male cricket produces an almost pure tone for its calling song. * School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. + Figure 1: The cricket auditory system. Four acoustic inputs channel sounds directly or through tracheal tubes onto two tympanal membranes. Sound from contralateral inputs has to pass a (double) central membrane (the medial septum), inducing a phase delay and reduction in gain. The sound transmission from the contralateral tympanum is very weak, making each eardrum effectively a 3 input system. The physics of the cricket auditory system is well understood [2]; the system (see Figure 1) uses a pair of sound receivers with four acoustic inputs, two on the forelegs, which are the external surfaces of the tympana, and two on the body, the prothoracic or acoustic spiracles [3]. The connecting tracheal tubes are such that interference occurs as sounds travel inside the cricket, producing a directional response at the tympana to frequencies near to that of the calling song. The amplitude of vibration of the tympana, and hence the firing rate of the auditory afferent neurons attached to them, vary as a sound source is moved around the cricket and the sounds from the different inputs move in and out of phase. The outputs of the two tympana match when the sound is straight ahead, and the inputs are bilaterally symmetric with respect to the sound source. However, when sound at the calling song frequency is off-centre the phase of signals on the closer side comes better into alignment, and the signal increases on that side, and conversely decreases on the other. It is that crossover of tympanal vibration amplitudes which allows the cricket to track a sound source (see Figure 6 for example). A simplified version of the auditory system using only two acoustic inputs was implemented in hardware [4], and a simple 8-neuron network was all that was required to then direct a robot to carry out phonotaxis towards a species-specific calling song [5]. A simple simulator was also created to model the behaviour of the auditory system of Figure 1 at different frequencies [6]. Data from Michelsen et al. [2] (Figures 5 and 6) were digitised, and used together with average and “typical” values from the paper to choose gains and delays for the simulation. Figure 2 shows the model of the internal auditory system of the cricket from sound arriving at the acoustic inputs through to transmission down auditory receptor fibres. The simulator implements this model up to the summing of the delayed inputs, as well as modelling the external sound transmission. Results from the simulator were used to check the directionality of the system at different frequencies, and to gain a better understanding of its response. It was impractical to check the effect of leg movements or of complex sounds in the simulator due to the necessity of simulating the sound production and transmission. An aVLSI chip was designed to implement the same model, both allowing more complex experiments, such as leg movements to be run, and experiments to be run in the real world. Figure 2: A model of the auditory system of the cricket, used to build the simulator and the aVLSI implementation (shown in boxes). These experiments with the simulator and the circuits are being published in [6] and the reader is referred to those papers for more details. In the present paper we present the details of the circuits used for the aVLSI implementation. 2 Circuits The chip, implementing the aVLSI box in Figure 2, comprises two all-pass delay filters, three gain circuits, a second-order narrow-band band-pass filter, a first-order wide-band band-pass filter, a first-order high-pass filter, as well as supporting circuitry (including reference voltages, currents, etc.). A single aVLSI chip (MOSIS tiny-chip) thus includes half the necessary circuitry to model the complete auditory system of a cricket. The complete model of the auditory system can be obtained by using two appropriately connected chips. Only two all-pass delay filters need to be implemented instead of three as suggested by Figure 2, because it is only the relative delay between the three pathways arriving at the one summing node that counts. The delay circuits were implemented with fully-differential gm-C filters. In order to extend the frequency range of the delay, a first-order all-pass delay circuit was cascaded with a second-order all-pass delay circuit. The resulting addition of the first-order delay and the second-order delay allowed for an approximately flat delay response for a wider bandwidth as the decreased delay around the corner frequency of the first-order filter cancelled with the increased delay of the second-order filter around its resonant frequency. Figure 3 shows the first- and second-order sections of the all-pass delay circuit. Two of these circuits were used and, based on data presented in [2], were designed with delays of 28µs and 62µs, by way of bias current manipulation. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in figure 3 is a standard OTA which includes the common-mode feedback necessary for fully differential designs. The buffers (Figure 3) are simple, cascoded differential pairs. V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ V+ V- II+ Figure 3: The first-order all-pass delay circuit (left) and the second-order all-pass delay (right). The differential output of the delay circuits is converted into a current which is multiplied by a variable gain implemented as shown in Figure 4. The gain cell includes a differential pair with source degeneration via transistors N4 and N5. The source degeneration improves the linearity of the current. The three gain cells implemented on the aVLSI have default gains of 2, 3 and 0.91 which are set by holding the default input high and appropriately ratioing the bias currents through the value of vbiasp. To correct any on-chip mismatches and/or explore other gain configurations a current splitter cell [7] (p-splitter, figure 4) allows the gain to be programmed by digital means post fabrication. The current splitter takes an input current (Ibias, figure 4) and divides it into branches which recursively halve the current, i.e., the first branch gives ½ Ibias, the second branch ¼ Ibias, the third branch 1/8 Ibias and so on. These currents can be used together with digitally controlled switches as a Digital-to-Analogue converter. By holding default low and setting C5:C0 appropriately, any gain – from 4 to 0.125 – can be set. To save on output pins the program bits (C5:C0) for each of the three gain cells are set via a single 18-bit shift register in bit-serial fashion. Summing the output of the three gain circuits in the current domain simply involves connecting three wires together. Therefore, a natural option for the filters that follow is to use current domain filters. In our case we have chosen to implement log-domain filters using MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Figure 5 shows the basic building blocks for the filters – the Tau Cell [8] and the multiplier cell – and block diagrams showing how these blocks were connected to create the necessary filtering blocks. The Tau Cell is a log-domain filter which has the firstorder response: I out 1 , = I in sτ + 1 where τ = nC aVT Ia and n = the slope factor, VT = thermal voltage, Ca = capacitance, and Ia = bias current. In figure 5, the input currents to the Tau Cell, Imult and A*Ia, are only used when building a second-order filter. The multiplier cell is simply a translinear loop where: I out1 ∗ I mult = I out 2 ∗ AI a or Imult = AIaIout2/Iout1. The configurations of the Tau Cell to get particular responses are covered in [8] along with the corresponding equations. The high frequency filter of Figure 2 is implemented by the high-pass filter in Figure 5 with a corner frequency of 17kHz. The low frequency filter, however, is divided into two parts since the biological filter’s response (see for example Figure 3A in [9]) separates well into a narrow second-order band-pass filter with a 10kHz resonant frequency and a wide band-pass filter made from a first-order high-pass filter with a 3kHz corner frequency followed by a first-order low-pass filter with a 12kHz corner frequency. These filters are then added together to reproduce the biological filter. The filters’ responses can be adjusted post fabrication via their bias currents. This allows for compensation due to processing and matching errors. Figure 4: The Gain Cell above is used to convert the differential voltage input from the delay cells into a single-ended current output. The gain of each cell is controllable via a programmable current cell (p_splitter). An on-chip bias generator [7] was used to create all the necessary current biases on the chip. All the main blocks (delays, gain cells and filters), however, can have their on-chip bias currents overridden through external pins on the chip. The chip was fabricated using the MOSIS AMI 1.6µm technology and designed using the Cadence Custom IC Design Tools (5.0.33). 3 Methods The chip was tested using sound generated on a computer and played through a soundcard to the chip. Responses from the chip were recorded by an oscilloscope, and uploaded back to the computer on completion. Given that the output from the chip and the gain circuits is a current, an external current-sense circuit built with discrete components was used to enable the output to be probed by the oscilloscope. Figure 5: The circuit diagrams for the log-domain filter building blocks – The Tau Cell and The Multiplier – along with the block diagrams for the three filters used in the aVLSI model. Initial experiments were performed to tune the delays and gains. After that, recordings were taken of the directional frequency responses. Sounds were generated by computer for each chip input to simulate moving the forelegs by delaying the sound by the appropriate amount of time; this was a much simpler solution than using microphones and moving them using motors. 4 Results The aVLSI chip was tested to measure its gains and delays, which were successfully tuned to the appropriate values. The chip was then compared with the simulation to check that it was faithfully modelling the system. A result of this test at 4kHz (approximately the cricket calling-song frequency) is shown in Figure 6. Apart from a drop in amplitude of the signal, the response of the circuit was very similar to that of the simulator. The differences were expected because the aVLSI circuit has to deal with real-world noise, whereas the simulated version has perfect signals. Examples of the gain versus frequency response of the two log-domain band-pass filters are shown in Figure 7. Note that the narrow-band filter peaks at 6kHz, which is significantly above the mating song frequency of the cricket which is around 4.5kHz. This is not a mistake, but is observed in real crickets as well. As stated in the introduction, a range of further testing results with both the circuit and the simulator are being published in [6]. 5 D i s c u s s i on The aVLSI auditory sensor in this research models the hearing of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. It is a more faithful model of the cricket auditory system than was previously built in [4], reproducing all the acoustic inputs, as well as the responses to frequencies of both the co specific calling song and bat echolocation chirps. It also generates outputs corresponding to the two sets of behaviourally relevant auditory receptor fibres. Results showed that it matched the biological data well, though there were some inconsistencies due to an error in the specification that will be addressed in a future iteration of the design. A more complete implementation across all frequencies was impractical because of complexity and size issues as well as serving no clear behavioural purpose. Figure 6: Vibration amplitude of the left (dotted) and right (solid) virtual tympana measured in decibels in response to a 4kHz tone in simulation (left) and on the aVLSI chip (right). The plot shows the amplitude of the tympanal responses as the sound source is rotated around the cricket. Figure 7: Frequency-Gain curves for the narrow-band and wide-band bandpass filters. The long-term aim of this work is to better understand simple sensorimotor control loops in crickets and other insects. The next step is to mount this circuitry on a robot to carry out behavioural experiments, which we will compare with existing and new behavioural data (such as that in [10]). This will allow us to refine our models of the neural circuitry involved. Modelling the sensory afferent neurons in hardware is necessary in order to reduce processor load on our robot, so the next revision will include these either onboard, or on a companion chip as we have done before [11]. We will also move both sides of the auditory system onto a single chip to conserve space on the robot. It is our belief and experience that, as a result of this intelligent pre-processing carried out at the sensor level, the neural circuits necessary to accurately model the behaviour will remain simple.

<p>Author: Tatsuto Murayama, Peter Davis</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides a system-level analysis of a scalable distributed sensing model for networked sensors. In our system model, a data center acquires data from a bunch of L sensors which each independently encode their noisy observations of an original binary sequence, and transmit their encoded data sequences to the data center at a combined rate R, which is limited. Supposing that the sensors use independent LDGM rate distortion codes, we show that the system performance can be evaluated for any given ﬁnite R when the number of sensors L goes to inﬁnity. The analysis shows how the optimal strategy for the distributed sensing problem changes at critical values of the data rate R or the noise level. 1</p><p>6 0.42831996 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="./nips-2005-CMOL_CrossNets%3A_Possible_Neuromorphic_Nanoelectronic_Circuits.html">40 nips-2005-CMOL CrossNets: Possible Neuromorphic Nanoelectronic Circuits</a></p>

<p>Author: O. P. Kreidl, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Given a directed graphical model with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach leads to a novel message-passing algorithm to be executed ofﬂine, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative examples, (ii) assumptions that guarantee convergence and efﬁciency and (iii) connections to active research areas. 1</p><p>4 0.30947688 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./nips-2005-Fast_Online_Policy_Gradient_Learning_with_SMD_Gain_Vector_Adaptation.html">72 nips-2005-Fast Online Policy Gradient Learning with SMD Gain Vector Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Doron Blatt, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to convert a T -stage stochastic decision problem with a continuous state space to a sequence of supervised learning problems. The optimization problem associated with the trajectory tree and random trajectory methods of Kearns, Mansour, and Ng, 2000, is solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The algorithm breaks a multistage reinforcement learning problem into a sequence of single-stage reinforcement learning subproblems, each of which is solved via an exact reduction to a weighted-classiﬁcation problem that can be solved using off-the-self methods. Thus the algorithm converts a reinforcement learning problem into simpler supervised learning subproblems. It is shown that the method converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a solution that cannot be further improved by componentwise optimization. The implication of the proposed algorithm is that a plethora of classiﬁcation methods can be applied to ﬁnd policies in the reinforcement learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.3026965 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2005-Augmented_Rescorla-Wagner_and_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation.html">32 nips-2005-Augmented Rescorla-Wagner and Maximum Likelihood Estimation</a></p>

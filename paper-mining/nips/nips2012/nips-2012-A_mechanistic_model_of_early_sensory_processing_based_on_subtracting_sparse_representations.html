<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We present a dynamic nonlinear generative model for visual motion based on a latent representation of binary-gated Gaussian variables. Trained on sequences of images, the model learns to represent different movement directions in different variables. We use an online approximate inference scheme that can be mapped to the dynamics of networks of neurons. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars of light, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. Most model neurons also show speed tuning and respond equally well to a range of motion directions and speeds aligned to the constraint line of their respective preferred speed. We show how these computations are enabled by a speciﬁc pattern of recurrent connections learned by the model. 1</p><p>3 0.21034166 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Delay_Compensation_with_Dynamical_Synapses.html">94 nips-2012-Delay Compensation with Dynamical Synapses</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi Fung, K. Wong, Si Wu</p><p>Abstract: Time delay is pervasive in neural information processing. To achieve real-time tracking, it is critical to compensate the transmission and processing delays in a neural system. In the present study we show that dynamical synapses with shortterm depression can enhance the mobility of a continuous attractor network to the extent that the system tracks time-varying stimuli in a timely manner. The state of the network can either track the instantaneous position of a moving stimulus perfectly (with zero-lag) or lead it with an effectively constant time, in agreement with experiments on the head-direction systems in rodents. The parameter regions for delayed, perfect and anticipative tracking correspond to network states that are static, ready-to-move and spontaneously moving, respectively, demonstrating the strong correlation between tracking performance and the intrinsic dynamics of the network. We also ﬁnd that when the speed of the stimulus coincides with the natural speed of the network state, the delay becomes effectively independent of the stimulus amplitude.</p><p>4 0.19259167 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_lattice_filter_model_of_the_visual_pathway.html">23 nips-2012-A lattice filter model of the visual pathway</a></p>
<p>Author: Karol Gregor, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: Early stages of visual processing are thought to decorrelate, or whiten, the incoming temporally varying signals. Motivated by the cascade structure of the visual pathway (retina → lateral geniculate nucelus (LGN) → primary visual cortex, V1) we propose to model its function using lattice ﬁlters - signal processing devices for stage-wise decorrelation of temporal signals. Lattice ﬁlter models predict neuronal responses consistent with physiological recordings in cats and primates. In particular, they predict temporal receptive ﬁelds of two different types resembling so-called lagged and non-lagged cells in the LGN. Moreover, connection weights in the lattice ﬁlter can be learned using Hebbian rules in a stage-wise sequential manner reminiscent of the neuro-developmental sequence in mammals. In addition, lattice ﬁlters can model visual processing in insects. Therefore, lattice ﬁlter is a useful abstraction that captures temporal aspects of visual processing. Our sensory organs face an ongoing barrage of stimuli from the world and must transmit as much information about them as possible to the rest of the brain [1]. This is a formidable task because, in sensory modalities such as vision, the dynamic range of natural stimuli (more than three orders of magnitude) greatly exceeds the dynamic range of relay neurons (less than two orders of magnitude) [2]. The reason why high ﬁdelity transmission is possible at all is that the continuity of objects in the physical world leads to correlations in natural stimuli, which imply redundancy. In turn, such redundancy can be eliminated by compression performed by the front end of the visual system leading to the reduction of the dynamic range [3, 4]. A compression strategy appropriate for redundant natural stimuli is called predictive coding [5, 6, 7]. In predictive coding, a prediction of the incoming signal value is computed from past values delayed in the circuit. This prediction is subtracted from the actual signal value and only the prediction error is transmitted. In the absence of transmission noise such compression is lossless as the original signal could be decoded on the receiving end by inverting the encoder. If predictions are accurate, the dynamic range of the error is much smaller than that of the natural stimuli. Therefore, minimizing dynamic range using predictive coding reduces to optimizing prediction. Experimental support for viewing the front end of the visual system as a predictive encoder comes from the measurements of receptive ﬁelds [6, 7]. In particular, predictive coding suggests that, for natural stimuli, the temporal receptive ﬁelds should be biphasic and the spatial receptive ﬁelds center-surround. These predictions are born out by experimental measurements in retinal ganglion cells, [8], lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons [9] and ﬂy second order visual neurons called large monopolar cells (LMCs) [2]. In addition, the experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds vary with signal-to-noise ratio as would be expected from optimal prediction theory [6]. Furthermore, experimentally observed whitening of the transmitted signal [10] is consistent with removing correlated components from the incoming signals [11]. As natural stimuli contain correlations on time scales greater than hundred milliseconds, experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds of LGN neurons are equally long [12]. Decorrelation over such long time scales requires equally long delays. How can such extended receptive ﬁeld be produced by 1 biological neurons and synapses whose time constants are typically less than hundred milliseconds [13]? The ﬁeld of signal processing offers a solution to this problem in the form of a device called a lattice ﬁlter, which decorrelates signals in stages, sequentially adding longer and longer delays [14, 15, 16, 17]. Motivated by the cascade structure of visual systems [18], we propose to model decorrelation in them by lattice ﬁlters. Naturally, visual systems are more complex than lattice ﬁlters and perform many other operations. However, we show that the lattice ﬁlter model explains several existing observations in vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems and makes testable predictions. Therefore, we believe that lattice ﬁlters provide a convenient abstraction for modeling temporal aspects of visual processing. This paper is organized as follows. First, we brieﬂy summarize relevant results from linear prediction theory. Second, we explain the operation of the lattice ﬁlter in discrete and continuous time. Third, we compare lattice ﬁlter predictions with physiological measurements. 1 Linear prediction theory Despite the non-linear nature of neurons and synapses, the operation of some neural circuits in vertebrates [19] and invertebrates [20] can be described by a linear systems theory. The advantage of linear systems is that optimal circuit parameters may be obtained analytically and the results are often intuitively clear. Perhaps not surprisingly, the ﬁeld of signal processing relies heavily on the linear prediction theory, offering a convenient framework [15, 16, 17]. Below, we summarize the results from linear prediction that will be used to explain the operation of the lattice ﬁlter. Consider a scalar sequence y = {yt } where time t = 1, . . . , n. Suppose that yt at each time point depends on side information provided by vector zt . Our goal is to generate a series of linear predictions, yt from the vector zt , yt = w · zt . We deﬁne a prediction error as: ˆ ˆ et = yt − yt = yt − w · zt ˆ (1) and look for values of w that minimize mean squared error: e2 = 1 nt e2 = t t 1 nt (yt − w · zt )2 . (2) t The weight vector, w is optimal for prediction of sequence y from sequence z if and only if the prediction error sequence e = y − w · z is orthogonal to each component of vector z: ez = 0. (3) When the whole series y is given in advance, i.e. in the ofﬂine setting, these so-called normal equations can be solved for w, for example, by Gaussian elimination [21]. However, in signal processing and neuroscience applications, another setting called online is more relevant: At every time step t, prediction yt must be made using only current values of zt and w. Furthermore, after a ˆ prediction is made, w is updated based on the prediction yt and observed yt , zt . ˆ In the online setting, an algorithm called stochastic gradient descent is often used, where, at each time step, w is updated in the direction of negative gradient of e2 : t w →w−η w (yt − w · zt ) 2 . (4) This leads to the following weight update, known as least mean square (LMS) [15], for predicting sequence y from sequence z: w → w + ηet zt , (5) where η is the learning rate. The value of η represents the relative inﬂuence of more recent observations compared to more distant ones. The larger the learning rate the faster the system adapts to recent observations and less past it remembers. In this paper, we are interested in predicting a current value xt of sequence x from its past values xt−1 , . . . , xt−k restricted by the prediction order k > 0: xt = wk · (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . ˆ 2 (6) This problem is a special case of the online linear prediction framework above, where yt = xt , zt = (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . Then the gradient update is given by: w → wk + ηet (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . (7) While the LMS algorithm can ﬁnd the weights that optimize linear prediction (6), the ﬁlter wk has a long temporal extent making it difﬁcult to implement with neurons and synapses. 2 Lattice ﬁlters One way to generate long receptive ﬁelds in circuits of biological neurons is to use a cascade architecture, known as the lattice ﬁlter, which calculates optimal linear predictions for temporal sequences and transmits prediction errors [14, 15, 16, 17]. In this section, we explain the operation of a discrete-time lattice ﬁlter, then adapt it to continuous-time operation. 2.1 Discrete-time implementation The ﬁrst stage of the lattice ﬁlter, Figure 1, calculates the error of the ﬁrst order optimal prediction (i.e. only using the preceding element of the sequence), the second stage uses the output of the ﬁrst stage and calculates the error of the second order optimal prediction (i.e. using only two previous values) etc. To make such stage-wise error computations possible the lattice ﬁlter calculates at every stage not only the error of optimal prediction of xt from past values xt−1 , . . . , xt−k , called forward error, ftk = xt − wk · (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T , (8) but, perhaps non-intuitively, also the error of optimal prediction of a past value xt−k from the more recent values xt−k+1 , . . . , xt , called backward error: bk = xt−k − w k · (xt−k+1 , . . . , xt )T , t k where w and w k (9) are the weights of the optimal prediction. For example, the ﬁrst stage of the ﬁlter calculates the forward error ft1 of optimal prediction of xt from xt−1 : ft1 = xt − u1 xt−1 as well as the backward error b1 of optimal prediction of xt−1 from t xt : b1 = xt−1 − v 1 xt , Figure 1. Here, we assume that coefﬁcients u1 and v 1 that give optimal linear t prediction are known and return to learning them below. Each following stage of the lattice ﬁlter performs a stereotypic operation on its inputs, Figure 1. The k-th stage (k > 1) receives forward, ftk−1 , and backward, bk−1 , errors from the previous stage, t delays backward error by one time step and computes a forward error: ftk = ftk−1 − uk bk−1 t−1 (10) of the optimal linear prediction of ftk−1 from bk−1 . In addition, each stage computes a backward t−1 error k−1 k bt = bt−1 − v k ftk−1 (11) of the optimal linear prediction of bk−1 from ftk−1 . t−1 As can be seen in Figure 1, the lattice ﬁlter contains forward prediction error (top) and backward prediction error (bottom) branches, which interact at every stage via cross-links. Operation of the lattice ﬁlter can be characterized by the linear ﬁlters acting on the input, x, to compute forward or backward errors of consecutive order, so called prediction-error ﬁlters (blue bars in Figure 1). Because of delays in the backward error branch the temporal extent of the ﬁlters grows from stage to stage. In the next section, we will argue that prediction-error ﬁlters correspond to the measurements of temporal receptive ﬁelds in neurons. For detailed comparison with physiological measurements we will use the result that, for bi-phasic prediction-error ﬁlters, such as the ones in Figure 1, the ﬁrst bar of the forward prediction-error ﬁlter has larger weight, by absolute value, than the combined weights of the remaining coefﬁcients of the corresponding ﬁlter. Similarly, in backward predictionerror ﬁlters, the last bar has greater weight than the rest of them combined. This fact arises from the observation that forward prediction-error ﬁlters are minimum phase, while backward predictionerror ﬁlters are maximum phase [16, 17]. 3 Figure 1: Discrete-time lattice ﬁlter performs stage-wise computation of forward and backward prediction errors. In the ﬁrst stage, the optimal prediction of xt from xt−1 is computed by delaying the input by one time step and multiplying it by u1 . The upper summation unit subtracts the predicted xt from the actual value and outputs prediction error ft1 . Similarly, the optimal prediction of xt−1 from xt is computed by multiplying the input by v 1 . The lower summation unit subtracts the optimal prediction from the actual value and outputs backward error b1 . In each following stage t k, the optimal prediction of ftk−1 from bk−1 is computed by delaying bk−1 by one time step and t t multiplying it by uk . The upper summation unit subtracts the prediction from the actual ftk−1 and outputs prediction error ftk . Similarly, the optimal prediction of bk−1 from ftk−1 is computed by t−1 multiplying it by uk . The lower summation unit subtracts the optimal prediction from the actual value and outputs backward error bk . Black connections have unitary weights and red connections t have learnable negative weights. One can view forward and backward error calculations as applications of so-called prediction-error ﬁlters (blue) to the input sequence. Note that the temporal extent of the ﬁlters gets longer from stage to stage. Next, we derive a learning rule for ﬁnding optimal coefﬁcients u and v in the online setting. The uk is used for predicting ftk−1 from bk−1 to obtain error ftk . By substituting yt = ftk−1 , zt = bk−1 and t−1 t−1 et = ftk into (5) the update of uk becomes uk → uk + ηftk bk−1 . t−1 (12) Similarly, v k is updated by v k → v k + ηbk ftk−1 . (13) t Interestingly, the updates of the weights are given by the product of the activities of outgoing and incoming nodes of the corresponding cross-links. Such updates are known as Hebbian learning rules thought to be used by biological neurons [22, 23]. Finally, we give a simple proof that, in the ofﬂine setting when the entire sequence x is known, f k and bk , given by equations (10, 11), are indeed errors of optimal k-th order linear prediction. Let D be one step time delay operator (Dx)t = xt−1 . The induction statement at k is that f k and bk are k-th order forward and backward errors of optimal linear prediction which is equivalent to f k and bk k k being of the form f k = x−w1 Dx−. . .−wk Dk x and bk = Dk x−w1k Dk−1 x−. . .−wkk x and, from k i normal equations (3), satisfying f D x = 0 and Dbk Di x = bk Di−1 x = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k. That this is true for k = 1 directly follows from the deﬁnition of f 1 and b1 . Now we assume that this is true for k − 1 ≥ 1 and show it is true for k. It is easy to see from the forms of f k−1 and bk−1 k k and from f k = f k−1 − uk Dbk−1 that f k has the correct form f k = x − w1 Dx − . . . − wk Dk x. k i k−1 k k−1 Regarding orthogonality for i = 1, . . . , k − 1 we have f D x = (f − u Db )Di x = f k−1 Di x − uk (Dbk−1 )Di x = 0 using the induction assumptions of orhogonality at k − 1. For the remaining i = k we note that f k is the error of the optimal linear prediction of f k−1 from Dbk−1 k−1 and therefore 0 = f k Dbk−1 = f k (Dk x − w1k−1 Dk−1 x − . . . + wk−1 Dx) = f k Dk x as desired. The bk case can be proven similarly. 2.2 Continuous-time implementation The last hurdle remaining for modeling neuronal circuits which operate in continuous time with a lattice ﬁlter is its discrete-time operation. To obtain a continuous-time implementation of the lattice 4 ﬁlter we cannot simply take the time step size to zero as prediction-error ﬁlters would become inﬁnitesimally short. Here, we adapt the discrete-time lattice ﬁlter to continous-time operation in two steps. First, we introduce a discrete-time Laguerre lattice ﬁlter [24, 17] which uses Laguerre polynomials rather than the shift operator to generate its basis functions, Figure 2. The input signal passes through a leaky integrator whose leakage constant α deﬁnes a time-scale distinct from the time step (14). A delay, D, at every stage is replaced by an all-pass ﬁlter, L, (15) with the same constant α, which preserves the magnitude of every Fourier component of the input but shifts its phase in a frequency dependent manner. Such all-pass ﬁlter reduces to a single time-step delay when α = 0. The optimality of a general discrete-time Laguerre lattice ﬁlter can be proven similarly to that for the discrete-time ﬁlter, simply by replacing operator D with L in the proof of section 2.1. Figure 2: Continuous-time lattice ﬁlter using Laguerre polynomials. Compared to the discretetime version, it contains a leaky integrator, L0 ,(16) and replaces delays with all-pass ﬁlters, L, (17). Second, we obtain a continuous-time formulation of the lattice ﬁlter by replacing t − 1 → t − δt, deﬁning the inverse time scale γ = (1 − α)/δt and taking the limit δt → 0 while keeping γ ﬁxed. As a result L0 and L are given by: Discrete time L0 (x)t L(x)t Continuous time = αL0 (x)t−1 + xt (14) = α(L(x)t−1 − xt ) + xt−1 (15) dL0 (x)/dt = −γL0 (x) + x L(x) = x − 2γL0 (x) (16) (17) Representative impulse responses of the continuous Laguerre ﬁlter are shown in Figure 2. Note that, similarly to the discrete-time case, the area under the ﬁrst (peak) phase is greater than the area under the second (rebound) phase in the forward branch and the opposite is true in the backward branch. Moreover, the temporal extent of the rebound is greater than that of the peak not just in the forward branch like in the basic discrete-time implementation but also in the backward branch. As will be seen in the next section, these predictions are conﬁrmed by physiological recordings. 3 Experimental evidence for the lattice ﬁlter in visual pathways In this section we demonstrate that physiological measurements from visual pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates are consistent with the predictions of the lattice ﬁlter model. For the purpose of modeling visual pathways, we identify summation units of the lattice ﬁlter with neurons and propose that neural activity represents forward and backward errors. In the ﬂy visual pathway neuronal activity is represented by continuously varying graded potentials. In the vertebrate visual system, all neurons starting with ganglion cells are spiking and we identify their ﬁring rate with the activity in the lattice ﬁlter. 3.1 Mammalian visual pathway In mammals, visual processing is performed in stages. In the retina, photoreceptors synapse onto bipolar cells, which in turn synapse onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs send axons to the LGN, where they synapse onto LGN relay neurons projecting to the primary visual cortex, V1. In addition to this feedforward pathway, at each stage there are local circuits involving (usually inhibitory) inter-neurons such as horizontal and amacrine cells in the retina. Neurons of each class 5 come in many types, which differ in their connectivity, morphology and physiological response. The bewildering complexity of these circuits has posed a major challenge to visual neuroscience. Alonso et al. • Connections between LGN and Cortex J. Neurosci., June 1, 2001, 21(11):4002–4015 4009 Temporal Filter 1 0.5 0 -0.5 -1 RGC LGN 0 100 Time (ms) 200 Figure 7. Distribution of geniculate cells and simple cells with respect to the timing of their responses. The distribution of three parameters derived from impulse responses of geniculate and cortical neurons is shown. A, Peak time. B, Zero-crossing time. C, Rebound index. Peak time is the time with the strongest response in the ﬁrst phase of the impulse response. Zero-crossing time is the time between the ﬁrst and second phases. Rebound index is the area of the impulse response after the zero crossing divided by the area before the zero crossing. Only impulse responses with good signal to noise were included (Ͼ5 SD above baseline; n ϭ 169). Figure 3: Electrophysiologically measured temporal receptive ﬁelds get progressively longer along the cat visual pathway. Left: A cat LGN cell (red) has a longer receptive ﬁeld than a corresponding RGC cell (blue) (adapted from [12] which also reports population data). Right (A,B): Extent of the temporal receptive ﬁelds of simple cells in cat V1 is greater than that of corresponding LGN cells as quantiﬁed by the peak (A) and zero-crossing (B) times. Right (C): In the temporal receptive ﬁelds of cat LGN and V1 cells the peak can be stronger or weaker than the rebound (adapted from [25]). simple cells and geniculate cells differed for all temporal parameters measured, there was considerable overlap between the distributions (Fig. 7). This overlap raises the following question: does connectivity depend on how well geniculate and cortical responses are matched with respect to time? For instance, do simple cells with fast subregions (early times to peak and early zero crossings) receive input mostly from geniculate cells with fast centers? Figure 8 illustrates the visual responses from a geniculate cell and a simple cell that were monosynaptically connected. A strong positive peak was observed in the correlogram (shown with a 10 msec time window to emphasize its short latency and fast rise time). In this case, an ON central subregion was well overlapped with an ON geniculate center (precisely at the peak of the subregion). Moreover, the timings of the visual responses from the overlapped subregion and the geniculate center were very similar (same onset, ϳ0 –25 msec; same peak, ϳ25–50 msec). It is worth noting that the two central subregions of the simple cell were faster and stronger than the two lateral subregions. The responses of the central subregions matched the timing of the geniculate center. In contrast, the timing of the lateral subregions resembled more closely the timing of the geniculate surround (both peaked at 25–50 msec). Unlike the example shown in Figure 8, a considerable number of geniculocortical pairs produced responses with different timing. For example, Figure 9 illustrates a case in which a geniculate center fully overlapped a strong simple-cell subregion of the same sign, but with slower timing (LGN onset, ϳ0 –25 msec; peak, ϳ25–50 msec; simple-cell onset, ϳ25–50 msec; peak, ϳ50 –75 msec). The cross-correlogram between this pair of neurons was ﬂat, which indicates the absence of a monosynaptic connection (Fig. 9, top right). To examine the role of timing in geniculocortical connectivity, we measured the response time course from all cell pairs that met two criteria. First, the geniculate center overlapped a simple-cell subregion of the same sign (n ϭ 104). Second, the geniculate center overlapped the cortical subregion in a near-optimal position (relative overlap Ͼ 50%, n ϭ 47; see Materials and Methods; Fig. 5A). All these cell pairs had a high probability of being monosynaptically connected because of the precise match in receptive-ﬁeld position and sign (31 of 47 were connected). The distributions of peak time, zero-crossing time, and rebound index from these cell pairs were very similar to the distributions from the entire sample (Fig. 7; see also Fig. 10 legend). The selected cell pairs included both presumed directional (predicted DI Ͼ 0.3, see Materials and Methods; 12/20 connected) and nondirectional (19/27 connected) simple cells. Most geniculate cells had small receptive ﬁelds (less than two simple-cell subregion widths; see Receptive-ﬁeld sign), although ﬁve cells with larger receptive ﬁelds were also included (three connected). From the 47 cell pairs used in this analysis, those with similar response time courses had a higher probability of being connected (Fig. 10). In particular, cell pairs that had both similar peak time and zero-crossing time were all connected (n ϭ 12; Fig. 10 A). Directionally selective simple cells were included in all timing groups. For example, in Figure 10 A there were four, ﬁve, two, and one directionally selective cells in the time groups Ͻ20, 40, 60, and Ͼ60 msec, respectively. Similar results were obtained if we restricted our sample to geniculate centers overlapped with the dominant subregion of the simple cell (n ϭ 31). Interestingly, the efﬁcacy and contributions of the connections seemed to depend little on the relative timing of the visual responses (Fig. 10, right). Although our sample of them was quite small, lagged cells are of considerable interest and therefore deserve comment. We recorded from 13 potentially lagged LGN cells whose centers were superimposed with a simple-cell subregion (eight with rebound indices between 1.2 and 1.5; ﬁve with rebound indices Ͼ1.9). Only seven of these pairs could be used for timing comparisons (in one pair the baseline of the correlogram had insufﬁcient spikes; in three pairs the geniculate receptive ﬁelds were Here, we point out several experimental observations related to temporal processing in the visual system consistent with the lattice ﬁlter model. First, measurements of temporal receptive ﬁelds demonstrate that they get progressively longer at each consecutive stage: i) LGN neurons have longer receptive ﬁelds than corresponding pre-synaptic ganglion cells [12], Figure 3left; ii) simple cells in V1 have longer receptive ﬁelds than corresponding pre-synaptic LGN neurons [25], Figure 3rightA,B. These observation are consistent with the progressively greater temporal extent of the prediction-error ﬁlters (blue plots in Figure 2). Second, the weight of the peak (integrated area under the curve) may be either greater or less than that of the rebound both in LGN relay cells [26] and simple cells of V1 [25], Figure 3right(C). Neurons with peak weight exceeding that of rebound are often referred to as non-lagged while the others are known as lagged found both in cat [27, 28, 29] and monkey [30]. The reason for this becomes clear from the response to a step stimulus, Figure 4(top). By comparing experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds with those of the continuous lattice ﬁlter, Figure 4, we identify non-lagged neurons with the forward branch and lagged neurons with the backward branch. Another way to characterize step-stimulus response is whether the sign of the transient is the same (non-lagged) or different (lagged) relative to sustained response. Third, measurements of cross-correlation between RGCs and LGN cell spikes in lagged and nonlagged neurons reveals a difference of the transfer function indicative of the difference in underlying circuitry [30]. This is consistent with backward pathway circuit of the Laguerre lattice ﬁlter, Figure 2, being more complex then that of the forward path (which results in different transfer function). ” (or replacing ”more complex” with ”different”) Third, measurements of cross-correlation between RGCs and LGN cell spikes in lagged and nonlagged neurons reveals a difference of the transfer function indicative of the difference in underlying circuitry [31]. This is consistent with the backward branch circuit of the Laguerre lattice ﬁlter, Figure 2, being different then that of the forward branch (which results in different transfer function). In particular, a combination of different glutamate receptors such as AMPA and NMDA, as well as GABA receptors are thought to be responsible for observed responses in lagged cells [32]. However, further investigation of the corresponding circuitry, perhaps using connectomics technology, is desirable. Fourth, the cross-link weights of the lattice ﬁlter can be learned using Hebbian rules, (12,13) which are biologically plausible [22, 23]. Interestingly, if these weights are learned sequentially, starting from the ﬁrst stage, they do not need to be re-learned when additional stages are added or learned. This property maps naturally on the fact that in the course of mammalian development the visual pathway matures in a stage-wise fashion - starting with the retina, then LGN, then V1 - and implying that the more peripheral structures do not need to adapt to the maturation of the downstream ones. 6 Figure 4: Comparison of electrophysiologically measured responses of cat LGN cells with the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model. Top: Experimentally measured temporal receptive ﬁelds and step-stimulus responses of LGN cells (adapted from [26]). Bottom: Typical examples of responses in the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model. Lattice ﬁlter coefﬁcients were u1 = v 1 = 0.4, u2 = v 2 = 0.2 and 1/γ = 50ms to model the non-lagged cell and u1 = v 1 = u2 = v 2 = 0.2 and 1/γ = 60ms to model the lagged cell. To model photoreceptor contribution to the responses, an additional leaky integrator L0 was added to the circuit of Figure 2. While Hebbian rules are biologically plausible, one may get an impression from Figure 2 that they must apply to inhibitory cross-links. We point out that this circuit is meant to represent only the computation performed rather than the speciﬁc implementation in terms of neurons. As the same linear computation can be performed by circuits with a different arrangement of the same components, there are multiple implementations of the lattice ﬁlter. For example, activity of non-lagged OFF cells may be seen as representing minus forward error. Then the cross-links between the non-lagged OFF pathway and the lagged ON pathway would be excitatory. In general, classiﬁcation of cells into lagged and non-lagged seems independent of their ON/OFF and X/Y classiﬁcation [31, 28, 29], but see[33]. 3.2 Insect visual pathway In insects, two cell types, L1 and L2, both post-synaptic to photoreceptors play an important role in visual processing. Physiological responses of L1 and L2 indicate that they decorrelate visual signals by subtracting their predictable parts. In fact, receptive ﬁelds of these neurons were used as the ﬁrst examples of predictive coding in neuroscience [6]. Yet, as the numbers of synapses from photoreceptors to L1 and L2 are the same [34] and their physiological properties are similar, it has been a mystery why insects, have not just one but a pair of such seemingly redundant neurons per facet. Previously, it was suggested that L1 and L2 provide inputs to the two pathways that map onto ON and OFF pathways in the vertebrate retina [35, 36]. Here, we put forward a hypothesis that the role of L1 and L2 in visual processing is similar to that of the two branches of the lattice ﬁlter. We do not incorporate the ON/OFF distinction in the effectively linear lattice ﬁlter model but anticipate that such combined description will materialize in the future. As was argued in Section 2, in forward prediction-error ﬁlters, the peak has greater weight than the rebound, while in backward prediction-error ﬁlters the opposite is true. Such difference implies that in response to a step-stimulus the signs of sustained responses compared to initial transients are different between the branches. Indeed, Ca2+ imaging shows that responses of L1 and L2 to step-stimulus are different as predicted by the lattice ﬁlter model [35], Figure 5b. Interestingly, the activity of L1 seems to represent minus forward error and L2 - plus backward error, suggesting that the lattice ﬁlter cross-links are excitatory. To summarize, the predictions of the lattice ﬁlter model seem to be consistent with the physiological measurements in the ﬂy visual system and may help understand its operation. 7 Stimulus 1 0.5 0 0 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 5 10 time 15 20 − Forward Error 1 0 −1 0 Backward Error 1 0 −1 0 Figure 5: Response of the lattice ﬁlter and fruit ﬂy LMCs to a step-stimulus. Left: Responses of the ﬁrst order discrete-time lattice ﬁlter to a step stimulus. Right: Responses of ﬂy L1 and L2 cells to a moving step stimulus (adapted from [35]). Predicted and the experimentally measured responses have qualitatively the same shape: a transient followed by sustained response, which has the same sign for the forward error and L1 and the opposite sign for the backward error and L2. 4 Discussion Motivated by the cascade structure of the visual pathway, we propose to model its operation with the lattice ﬁlter. We demonstrate that the predictions of the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model are consistent with the course of neural development and the physiological measurement in the LGN, V1 of cat and monkey, as well as ﬂy LMC neurons. Therefore, lattice ﬁlters may offer a useful abstraction for understanding aspects of temporal processing in visual systems of vertebrates and invertebrates. Previously, [11] proposed that lagged and non-lagged cells could be a result of rectiﬁcation by spiking neurons. Although we agree with [11] that LGN performs temporal decorrelation, our explanation does not rely on non-linear processing but rather on the cascade architecture and, hence, is fundamentally different. Our model generates the following predictions that are not obvious in [11]: i) Not only are LGN receptive ﬁelds longer than RGC but also V1 receptive ﬁelds are longer than LGN; ii) Even a linear model can generate a difference in the peak/rebound ratio; iii) The circuit from RGC to LGN should be different for lagged and non-lagged cells consistent with [31]; iv) The lattice ﬁlter circuit can self-organize using Hebbian rules, which gives a mechanistic explanation of receptive ﬁelds beyond the normative framework of [11]. In light of the redundancy reduction arguments given in the introduction, we note that, if the only goal of the system were to compress incoming signals using a given number of lattice ﬁlter stages, then after the compression is peformed only one kind of prediction errors, forward or backward needs to be transmitted. Therefore, having two channels, in the absence of noise, may seem redundant. However, transmitting both forward and backward errors gives one the ﬂexibility to continue decorrelation further by adding stages performing relatively simple operations. We are grateful to D.A.

<p>Author: Xue-xin Wei, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: A common challenge for Bayesian models of perception is the fact that the two fundamental Bayesian components, the prior distribution and the likelihood function, are formally unconstrained. Here we argue that a neural system that emulates Bayesian inference is naturally constrained by the way it represents sensory information in populations of neurons. More speciﬁcally, we show that an efﬁcient coding principle creates a direct link between prior and likelihood based on the underlying stimulus distribution. The resulting Bayesian estimates can show biases away from the peaks of the prior distribution, a behavior seemingly at odds with the traditional view of Bayesian estimation, yet one that has been reported in human perception. We demonstrate that our framework correctly accounts for the repulsive biases previously reported for the perception of visual orientation, and show that the predicted tuning characteristics of the model neurons match the reported orientation tuning properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Our results suggest that efﬁcient coding is a promising hypothesis in constraining Bayesian models of perceptual inference. 1 Motivation Human perception is not perfect. Biases have been observed in a large number of perceptual tasks and modalities, of which the most salient ones constitute many well-known perceptual illusions. It has been suggested, however, that these biases do not reﬂect a failure of perception but rather an observer’s attempt to optimally combine the inherently noisy and ambiguous sensory information with appropriate prior knowledge about the world [13, 4, 14]. This hypothesis, which we will refer to as the Bayesian hypothesis, has indeed proven quite successful in providing a normative explanation of perception at a qualitative and, more recently, quantitative level (see e.g. [15]). A major challenge in forming models based on the Bayesian hypothesis is the correct selection of two main components: the prior distribution (belief) and the likelihood function. This has encouraged some to criticize the Bayesian hypothesis altogether, claiming that arbitrary choices for these components always allow for unjustiﬁed post-hoc explanations of the data [1]. We do not share this criticism, referring to a number of successful attempts to constrain prior beliefs and likelihood functions based on principled grounds. For example, prior beliefs have been deﬁned as the relative distribution of the sensory variable in the environment in cases where these statistics are relatively easy to measure (e.g. local visual orientations [16]), or where it can be assumed that subjects have learned them over the course of the experiment (e.g. time perception [17]). Other studies have constrained the likelihood function according to known noise characteristics of neurons that are crucially involved in the speciﬁc perceptual process (e.g motion tuned neurons in visual cor∗ http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ astocker/lab 1 world neural representation efficient encoding percept Bayesian decoding Figure 1: Encoding-decoding framework. A stimulus representing a sensory variable θ elicits a ﬁring rate response R = {r1 , r2 , ..., rN } in a population of N neurons. The perceptual task is to generate a ˆ good estimate θ(R) of the presented value of the sensory variable based on this population response. Our framework assumes that encoding is efﬁcient, and decoding is Bayesian based on the likelihood p(R|θ), the prior p(θ), and a squared-error loss function. tex [18]). However, we agree that ﬁnding appropriate constraints is generally difﬁcult and that prior beliefs and likelihood functions have been often selected on the basis of mathematical convenience. Here, we propose that the efﬁcient coding hypothesis [19] offers a joint constraint on the prior and likelihood function in neural implementations of Bayesian inference. Efﬁcient coding provides a normative description of how neurons encode sensory information, and suggests a direct link between measured perceptual discriminability, neural tuning characteristics, and environmental statistics [11]. We show how this link can be extended to a full Bayesian account of perception that includes perceptual biases. We validate our model framework against behavioral as well as neural data characterizing the perception of visual orientation. We demonstrate that we can account not only for the reported perceptual biases away from the cardinal orientations, but also for the speciﬁc response characteristics of orientation-tuned neurons in primary visual cortex. Our work is a novel proposal of how two important normative hypotheses in perception science, namely efﬁcient (en)coding and Bayesian decoding, might be linked. 2 Encoding-decoding framework We consider perception as an inference process that takes place along the simpliﬁed neural encodingdecoding cascade illustrated in Fig. 11 . 2.1 Efﬁcient encoding Efﬁcient encoding proposes that the tuning characteristics of a neural population are adapted to the prior distribution p(θ) of the sensory variable such that the population optimally represents the sensory variable [19]. Different deﬁnitions of “optimally” are possible, and may lead to different results. Here, we assume an efﬁcient representation that maximizes the mutual information between the sensory variable and the population response. With this deﬁnition and an upper limit on the total ﬁring activity, the square-root of the Fisher Information must be proportional to the prior distribution [12, 21]. In order to constrain the tuning curves of individual neurons in the population we also impose a homogeneity constraint, requiring that there exists a one-to-one mapping F (θ) that transforms the ˜ physical space with units θ to a homogeneous space with units θ = F (θ) in which the stimulus distribution becomes uniform. This deﬁnes the mapping as θ F (θ) = p(χ)dχ , (1) −∞ which is the cumulative of the prior distribution p(θ). We then assume a neural population with identical tuning curves that evenly tiles the stimulus range in this homogeneous space. The population provides an efﬁcient representation of the sensory variable θ according to the above constraints [11]. ˜ The tuning curves in the physical space are obtained by applying the inverse mapping F −1 (θ).

(1)). c) As a result, the likelihood shape is constrained by the prior distribution showing heavier tails on the side of lower prior density. d) Fisher information, discrimination threshold, and average ﬁring rates are all uniform in the homogeneous space. illustrates the applied efﬁcient encoding scheme, the mapping, and the concept of the homogeneous space for the example of a symmetric, exponentially decaying prior distribution p(θ). The key idea here is that by assuming efﬁcient encoding, the prior (i.e. the stimulus distribution in the world) directly constrains the likelihood function. In particular, the shape of the likelihood is determined by the cumulative distribution of the prior. As a result, the likelihood is generally asymmetric, as shown in Fig. 2, exhibiting heavier tails on the side of the prior with lower density. 2.2 Bayesian decoding Let us consider a population of N sensory neurons that efﬁciently represents a stimulus variable θ as described above. A stimulus θ0 elicits a speciﬁc population response that is characterized by the vector R = [r1 , r2 , ..., rN ] where ri is the spike-count of the ith neuron over a given time-window τ . Under the assumption that the variability in the individual ﬁring rates is governed by a Poisson process, we can write the likelihood function over θ as N p(R|θ) = (τ fi (θ))ri −τ fi (θ) e , ri ! i=1 (2) ˆ with fi (θ) describing the tuning curve of neuron i. We then deﬁne a Bayesian decoder θLSE as the estimator that minimizes the expected squared-error between the estimate and the true stimulus value, thus θp(R|θ)p(θ)dθ ˆ θLSE (R) = , (3) p(R|θ)p(θ)dθ where we use Bayes’ rule to appropriately combine the sensory evidence with the stimulus prior p(θ). 3 Bayesian estimates can be biased away from prior peaks Bayesian models of perception typically predict perceptual biases toward the peaks of the prior density, a characteristic often considered a hallmark of Bayesian inference. This originates from the 3 a b prior attraction prior prior attraction likelihood repulsion! likelihood c prior prior repulsive bias likelihood likelihood mean posterior mean posterior mean Figure 3: Bayesian estimates biased away from the prior. a) If the likelihood function is symmetric, then the estimate (posterior mean) is, on average, shifted away from the actual value of the sensory variable θ0 towards the prior peak. b) Efﬁcient encoding typically leads to an asymmetric likelihood function whose normalized mean is away from the peak of the prior (relative to θ0 ). The estimate is determined by a combination of prior attraction and shifted likelihood mean, and can exhibit an overall repulsive bias. c) If p(θ0 ) < 0 and the likelihood is relatively narrow, then (1/p(θ)2 ) > 0 (blue line) and the estimate is biased away from the prior peak (see Eq. (6)). common approach of choosing a parametric description of the likelihood function that is computationally convenient (e.g. Gaussian). As a consequence, likelihood functions are typically assumed to be symmetric (but see [23, 24]), leaving the bias of the Bayesian estimator to be mainly determined by the shape of the prior density, i.e. leading to biases toward the peak of the prior (Fig. 3a). In our model framework, the shape of the likelihood function is constrained by the stimulus prior via efﬁcient neural encoding, and is generally not symmetric for non-ﬂat priors. It has a heavier tail on the side with lower prior density (Fig. 3b). The intuition is that due to the efﬁcient allocation of neural resources, the side with smaller prior density will be encoded less accurately, leading to a broader likelihood function on that side. The likelihood asymmetry pulls the Bayes’ least-squares estimate away from the peak of the prior while at the same time the prior pulls it toward its peak. Thus, the resulting estimation bias is the combination of these two counter-acting forces - and both are determined by the prior! 3.1 General derivation of the estimation bias In the following, we will formally derive the mean estimation bias b(θ) of the proposed encodingdecoding framework. Speciﬁcally, we will study the conditions for which the bias is repulsive i.e. away from the peak of the prior density. ˆ We ﬁrst re-write the estimator θLSE (3) by replacing θ with the inverse of its mapping to the homo−1 ˜ geneous space, i.e., θ = F (θ). The motivation for this is that the likelihood in the homogeneous space is symmetric (Fig. 2). Given a value θ0 and the elicited population response R, we can write the estimator as ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ θp(R|θ)p(θ)dθ F −1 (θ)p(R|F −1 (θ))p(F −1 (θ))dF −1 (θ) ˆ θLSE (R) = = . ˜ ˜ ˜ p(R|θ)p(θ)dθ p(R|F −1 (θ))p(F −1 (θ))dF −1 (θ) Calculating the derivative of the inverse function and noting that F is the cumulative of the prior density, we get 1 1 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ dθ = dθ. dF −1 (θ) = (F −1 (θ)) dθ = dθ = −1 (θ)) ˜ F (θ) p(θ) p(F ˆ Hence, we can simplify θLSE (R) as ˆ θLSE (R) = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ . ˜ ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ With ˜ K(R, θ) = ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ)) ˜ ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ 4 we can further simplify the notation and get ˆ θLSE (R) = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)K(R, θ)dθ . (4) ˆ ˜ In order to get the expected value of the estimate, θLSE (θ), we marginalize (4) over the population response space S, ˆ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ θLSE (θ) = p(R)F −1 (θ)K(R, θ)dθdR S = F −1 ˜ (θ)( ˜ ˜ p(R)K(R, θ)dR)dθ = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)L(θ)dθ, S where we deﬁne ˜ L(θ) = ˜ p(R)K(R, θ)dR. S ˜ ˜ ˜ It follows that L(θ)dθ = 1. Due to the symmetry in this space, it can be shown that L(θ) is ˜0 . Intuitively, L(θ) can be thought as the normalized ˜ symmetric around the true stimulus value θ average likelihood in the homogeneous space. We can then compute the expected bias at θ0 as b(θ0 ) = ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)L(θ)dθ − F −1 (θ0 ) (5) ˜ This is expression is general where F −1 (θ) is deﬁned as the inverse of the cumulative of an arbitrary ˜ prior density p(θ) (see Eq. (1)) and the dispersion of L(θ) is determined by the internal noise level. ˜ ˜ Assuming the prior density to be smooth, we expand F −1 in a neighborhood (θ0 − h, θ0 + h) that is larger than the support of the likelihood function. Using Taylor’s theorem with mean-value forms of the remainder, we get 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ) = F −1 (θ0 ) + F −1 (θ0 ) (θ − θ0 ) + F −1 (θx ) (θ − θ0 )2 , 2 ˜ ˜ ˜ with θx lying between θ0 and θ. By applying this expression to (5), we ﬁnd ˜ θ0 +h b(θ0 ) = = 1 2 ˜ θ0 −h 1 −1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ 1 F (θx )θ (θ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ = ˜ 2 2 ˜ θ0 +h −( ˜ θ0 −h p(θx )θ ˜ ˜ 2 ˜ ˜ 1 )(θ − θ0 ) L(θ)dθ = p(θx )3 4 ˜ θ0 +h 1 ˜ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ ˜ ˜ ˜ ( ) ˜(θ ˜ p(F −1 (θx )) θ ( 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ) (θ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ. p(θx )2 θ ˜ θ0 −h ˜ θ0 +h ˜ θ0 −h In general, there is no simple rule to judge the sign of b(θ0 ). However, if the prior is monotonic ˜ ˜ on the interval F −1 ((θ0 − h, θ0 + h)), then the sign of ( p(θ1 )2 ) is always the same as the sign of x 1 1 ( p(θ0 )2 ) . Also, if the likelihood is sufﬁciently narrow we can approximate ( p(θ1 )2 ) by ( p(θ0 )2 ) , x and therefore approximate the bias as b(θ0 ) ≈ C( 1 ) , p(θ0 )2 (6) where C is a positive constant. The result is quite surprising because it states that as long as the prior is monotonic over the support of the likelihood function, the expected estimation bias is always away from the peaks of the prior! 3.2 Internal (neural) versus external (stimulus) noise The above derivation of estimation bias is based on the assumption that all uncertainty about the sensory variable is caused by neural response variability. This level of internal noise depends on the response magnitude, and thus can be modulated e.g. by changing stimulus contrast. This contrastcontrolled noise modulation is commonly exploited in perceptual studies (e.g. [18]). Internal noise will always lead to repulsive biases in our framework if the prior is monotonic. If internal noise is low, the likelihood is narrow and thus the bias is small. Increasing internal noise leads to increasingly 5 larger biases up to the point where the likelihood becomes wide enough such that monotonicity of the prior over the support of the likelihood is potentially violated. Stimulus noise is another way to modulate the noise level in perception (e.g. random-dot motion stimuli). Such external noise, however, has a different effect on the shape of the likelihood function as compared to internal noise. It modiﬁes the likelihood function (2) by convolving it with the noise kernel. External noise is frequently chosen as additive and symmetric (e.g. zero-mean Gaussian). It is straightforward to prove that such symmetric external noise does not lead to a change in the mean of the likelihood, and thus does not alter the repulsive effect induced by its asymmetry. However, by increasing the overall width of the likelihood, the attractive inﬂuence of the prior increases, resulting in an estimate that is closer to the prior peak than without external noise2 . 4 Perception of visual orientation We tested our framework by modelling the perception of visual orientation. Our choice was based on the fact that i) we have pretty good estimates of the prior distribution of local orientations in natural images, ii) tuning characteristics of orientation selective neurons in visual cortex are wellstudied (monkey/cat), and iii) biases in perceived stimulus orientation have been well characterized. We start by creating an efﬁcient neural population based on measured prior distributions of local visual orientation, and then compare the resulting tuning characteristics of the population and the predicted perceptual biases with reported data in the literature. 4.1 Efﬁcient neural model population for visual orientation Previous studies measured the statistics of the local orientation in large sets of natural images and consistently found that the orientation distribution is multimodal, peaking at the two cardinal orientations as shown in Fig. 4a [16, 20]. We assumed that the visual system’s prior belief over orientation p(θ) follows this distribution and approximate it formally as p(θ) ∝ 2 − | sin(θ)| (black line in Fig. 4b) . (7) Based on this prior distribution we deﬁned an efﬁcient neural representation for orientation. We assumed a population of model neurons (N = 30) with tuning curves that follow a von-Mises distribution in the homogeneous space on top of a constant spontaneous ﬁring rate (5 Hz). We then ˜ applied the inverse transformation F −1 (θ) to all these tuning curves to get the corresponding tuning curves in the physical space (Fig. 4b - red curves), where F (θ) is the cumulative of the prior (7). The concentration parameter for the von-Mises tuning curves was set to κ ≈ 1.6 in the homogeneous space in order to match the measured average tuning width (∼ 32 deg) of neurons in area V1 of the macaque [9]. 4.2 Predicted tuning characteristics of neurons in primary visual cortex The orientation tuning characteristics of our model population well match neurophysiological data of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Efﬁcient encoding predicts that the distribution of neurons’ preferred orientation follows the prior, with more neurons tuned to cardinal than oblique orientations by a factor of approximately 1.5. A similar ratio has been found for neurons in area V1 of monkey/cat [9, 10]. Also, the tuning widths of the model neurons vary between 25-42 deg depending on their preferred tuning (see Fig. 4c), matching the measured tuning width ratio of 0.6 between neurons tuned to the cardinal versus oblique orientations [9]. An important prediction of our model is that most of the tuning curves should be asymmetric. Such asymmetries have indeed been reported for the orientation tuning of neurons in area V1 [6, 7, 8]. We computed the asymmetry index for our model population as deﬁned in previous studies [6, 7], and plotted it as a function of the preferred tuning of each neuron (Fig. 4d). The overall asymmetry index in our model population is 1.24 ± 0.11, which approximately matches the measured values for neurons in area V1 of the cat (1.26 ± 0.06) [6]. It also predicts that neurons tuned to the cardinal and oblique orientations should show less symmetry than those tuned to orientations in between. Finally, 2 Note, that these predictions are likely to change if the external noise is not symmetric. 6 a b 25 firing rate(Hz) 0 orientation(deg) asymmetry vs. tuning width 1.0 2.0 90 2.0 e asymmetry 1.0 0 asymmetry index 50 30 width (deg) 10 90 preferred tuning(deg) -90 0 d 0 0 90 asymmetry index 0 orientation(deg) tuning width -90 0 0 probability 0 -90 c efficient representation 0.01 0.01 image statistics -90 0 90 preferred tuning(deg) 25 30 35 40 tuning width (deg) Figure 4: Tuning characteristics of model neurons. a) Distribution of local orientations in natural images, replotted from [16]. b) Prior used in the model (black) and predicted tuning curves according to efﬁcient coding (red). c) Tuning width as a function of preferred orientation. d) Tuning curves of cardinal and oblique neurons are more symmetric than those tuned to orientations in between. e) Both narrowly and broadly tuned neurons neurons show less asymmetry than neurons with tuning widths in between. neurons with tuning widths at the lower and upper end of the range are predicted to exhibit less asymmetry than those neurons whose widths lie in between these extremes (illustrated in Fig. 4e). These last two predictions have not been tested yet. 4.3 Predicted perceptual biases Our model framework also provides speciﬁc predictions for the expected perceptual biases. Humans show systematic biases in perceived orientation of visual stimuli such as e.g. arrays of Gabor patches (Fig. 5a,d). Two types of biases can be distinguished: First, perceived orientations show an absolute bias away from the cardinal orientations, thus away from the peaks of the orientation prior [2, 3]. We refer to these biases as absolute because they are typically measured by adjusting a noise-free reference until it matched the orientation of the test stimulus. Interestingly, these repulsive absolute biases are the larger the smaller the external stimulus noise is (see Fig. 5b). Second, the relative bias between the perceived overall orientations of a high-noise and a low-noise stimulus is toward the cardinal orientations as shown in Fig. 5c, and thus toward the peak of the prior distribution [3, 16]. The predicted perceptual biases of our model are shown Fig. 5e,f. We computed the likelihood function according to (2) and used the prior in (7). External noise was modeled by convolving the stimulus likelihood function with a Gaussian (different widths for different noise levels). The predictions well match both, the reported absolute bias away as well as the relative biases toward the cardinal orientations. Note, that our model framework correctly accounts for the fact that less external noise leads to larger absolute biases (see also discussion in section 3.2). 5 Discussion We have presented a modeling framework for perception that combines efﬁcient (en)coding and Bayesian decoding. Efﬁcient coding imposes constraints on the tuning characteristics of a population of neurons according to the stimulus distribution (prior). It thus establishes a direct link between prior and likelihood, and provides clear constraints on the latter for a Bayesian observer model of perception. We have shown that the resulting likelihoods are in general asymmetric, with 7 absolute bias (data) b c relative bias (data) -4 0 bias(deg) 4 a low-noise stimulus -90 e 90 absolute bias (model) low external noise high external noise 3 high-noise stimulus -90 f 0 90 relative bias (model) 0 bias(deg) d 0 attraction -3 repulsion -90 0 orientation (deg) 90 -90 0 orientation (deg) 90 Figure 5: Biases in perceived orientation: Human data vs. Model prediction. a,d) Low- and highnoise orientation stimuli of the type used in [3, 16]. b) Humans show absolute biases in perceived orientation that are away from the cardinal orientations.

We demonstrated that such asymmetric likelihoods can lead to the counter-intuitive prediction that a Bayesian estimator is biased away from the peaks of the prior distribution. Interestingly, such repulsive biases have been reported for human perception of visual orientation, yet a principled and consistent explanation of their existence has been missing so far. Here, we suggest that these counter-intuitive biases directly follow from the asymmetries in the likelihood function induced by efﬁcient neural encoding of the stimulus. The good match between our model predictions and the measured perceptual biases and orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in primary visual cortex provides further support of our framework. Previous work has suggested that there might be a link between stimulus statistics, neuronal tuning characteristics, and perceptual behavior based on efﬁcient coding principles, yet none of these studies has recognized the importance of the resulting likelihood asymmetries [16, 11]. We have demonstrated here that such asymmetries can be crucial in explaining perceptual data, even though the resulting estimates appear “anti-Bayesian” at ﬁrst sight (see also models of sensory adaptation [23]). Note, that we do not provide a neural implementation of the Bayesian inference step. However, we and others have proposed various neural decoding schemes that can approximate Bayes’ leastsquares estimation using efﬁcient coding [26, 25, 22]. It is also worth pointing out that our estimator is set to minimize total squared-error, and that other choices of the loss function (e.g. MAP estimator) could lead to different predictions. Our framework is general and should be directly applicable to other modalities. In particular, it might provide a new explanation for perceptual biases that are hard to reconcile with traditional Bayesian approaches [5]. Acknowledgments We thank M. Jogan and A.

<p>Author: Shaul Druckmann, Tao Hu, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: Early stages of sensory systems face the challenge of compressing information from numerous receptors onto a much smaller number of projection neurons, a so called communication bottleneck. To make more efficient use of limited bandwidth, compression may be achieved using predictive coding, whereby predictable, or redundant, components of the stimulus are removed. In the case of the retina, Srinivasan et al. (1982) suggested that feedforward inhibitory connections subtracting a linear prediction generated from nearby receptors implement such compression, resulting in biphasic center-surround receptive fields. However, feedback inhibitory circuits are common in early sensory circuits and furthermore their dynamics may be nonlinear. Can such circuits implement predictive coding as well? Here, solving the transient dynamics of nonlinear reciprocal feedback circuits through analogy to a signal-processing algorithm called linearized Bregman iteration we show that nonlinear predictive coding can be implemented in an inhibitory feedback circuit. In response to a step stimulus, interneuron activity in time constructs progressively less sparse but more accurate representations of the stimulus, a temporally evolving prediction. This analysis provides a powerful theoretical framework to interpret and understand the dynamics of early sensory processing in a variety of physiological experiments and yields novel predictions regarding the relation between activity and stimulus statistics.</p><p>2 0.88113827 <a title="24-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Delay_Compensation_with_Dynamical_Synapses.html">94 nips-2012-Delay Compensation with Dynamical Synapses</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi Fung, K. Wong, Si Wu</p><p>Abstract: Time delay is pervasive in neural information processing. To achieve real-time tracking, it is critical to compensate the transmission and processing delays in a neural system. In the present study we show that dynamical synapses with shortterm depression can enhance the mobility of a continuous attractor network to the extent that the system tracks time-varying stimuli in a timely manner. The state of the network can either track the instantaneous position of a moving stimulus perfectly (with zero-lag) or lead it with an effectively constant time, in agreement with experiments on the head-direction systems in rodents. The parameter regions for delayed, perfect and anticipative tracking correspond to network states that are static, ready-to-move and spontaneously moving, respectively, demonstrating the strong correlation between tracking performance and the intrinsic dynamics of the network. We also ﬁnd that when the speed of the stimulus coincides with the natural speed of the network state, the delay becomes effectively independent of the stimulus amplitude.</p><p>3 0.80440199 <a title="24-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_coding_provides_a_direct_link_between_prior_and_likelihood_in_perceptual_Bayesian_inference.html">114 nips-2012-Efficient coding provides a direct link between prior and likelihood in perceptual Bayesian inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Xue-xin Wei, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: A common challenge for Bayesian models of perception is the fact that the two fundamental Bayesian components, the prior distribution and the likelihood function, are formally unconstrained. Here we argue that a neural system that emulates Bayesian inference is naturally constrained by the way it represents sensory information in populations of neurons. More speciﬁcally, we show that an efﬁcient coding principle creates a direct link between prior and likelihood based on the underlying stimulus distribution. The resulting Bayesian estimates can show biases away from the peaks of the prior distribution, a behavior seemingly at odds with the traditional view of Bayesian estimation, yet one that has been reported in human perception. We demonstrate that our framework correctly accounts for the repulsive biases previously reported for the perception of visual orientation, and show that the predicted tuning characteristics of the model neurons match the reported orientation tuning properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Our results suggest that efﬁcient coding is a promising hypothesis in constraining Bayesian models of perceptual inference. 1 Motivation Human perception is not perfect. Biases have been observed in a large number of perceptual tasks and modalities, of which the most salient ones constitute many well-known perceptual illusions. It has been suggested, however, that these biases do not reﬂect a failure of perception but rather an observer’s attempt to optimally combine the inherently noisy and ambiguous sensory information with appropriate prior knowledge about the world [13, 4, 14]. This hypothesis, which we will refer to as the Bayesian hypothesis, has indeed proven quite successful in providing a normative explanation of perception at a qualitative and, more recently, quantitative level (see e.g. [15]). A major challenge in forming models based on the Bayesian hypothesis is the correct selection of two main components: the prior distribution (belief) and the likelihood function. This has encouraged some to criticize the Bayesian hypothesis altogether, claiming that arbitrary choices for these components always allow for unjustiﬁed post-hoc explanations of the data [1]. We do not share this criticism, referring to a number of successful attempts to constrain prior beliefs and likelihood functions based on principled grounds. For example, prior beliefs have been deﬁned as the relative distribution of the sensory variable in the environment in cases where these statistics are relatively easy to measure (e.g. local visual orientations [16]), or where it can be assumed that subjects have learned them over the course of the experiment (e.g. time perception [17]). Other studies have constrained the likelihood function according to known noise characteristics of neurons that are crucially involved in the speciﬁc perceptual process (e.g motion tuned neurons in visual cor∗ http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ astocker/lab 1 world neural representation efficient encoding percept Bayesian decoding Figure 1: Encoding-decoding framework. A stimulus representing a sensory variable θ elicits a ﬁring rate response R = {r1 , r2 , ..., rN } in a population of N neurons. The perceptual task is to generate a ˆ good estimate θ(R) of the presented value of the sensory variable based on this population response. Our framework assumes that encoding is efﬁcient, and decoding is Bayesian based on the likelihood p(R|θ), the prior p(θ), and a squared-error loss function. tex [18]). However, we agree that ﬁnding appropriate constraints is generally difﬁcult and that prior beliefs and likelihood functions have been often selected on the basis of mathematical convenience. Here, we propose that the efﬁcient coding hypothesis [19] offers a joint constraint on the prior and likelihood function in neural implementations of Bayesian inference. Efﬁcient coding provides a normative description of how neurons encode sensory information, and suggests a direct link between measured perceptual discriminability, neural tuning characteristics, and environmental statistics [11]. We show how this link can be extended to a full Bayesian account of perception that includes perceptual biases. We validate our model framework against behavioral as well as neural data characterizing the perception of visual orientation. We demonstrate that we can account not only for the reported perceptual biases away from the cardinal orientations, but also for the speciﬁc response characteristics of orientation-tuned neurons in primary visual cortex. Our work is a novel proposal of how two important normative hypotheses in perception science, namely efﬁcient (en)coding and Bayesian decoding, might be linked. 2 Encoding-decoding framework We consider perception as an inference process that takes place along the simpliﬁed neural encodingdecoding cascade illustrated in Fig. 11 . 2.1 Efﬁcient encoding Efﬁcient encoding proposes that the tuning characteristics of a neural population are adapted to the prior distribution p(θ) of the sensory variable such that the population optimally represents the sensory variable [19]. Different deﬁnitions of “optimally” are possible, and may lead to different results. Here, we assume an efﬁcient representation that maximizes the mutual information between the sensory variable and the population response. With this deﬁnition and an upper limit on the total ﬁring activity, the square-root of the Fisher Information must be proportional to the prior distribution [12, 21]. In order to constrain the tuning curves of individual neurons in the population we also impose a homogeneity constraint, requiring that there exists a one-to-one mapping F (θ) that transforms the ˜ physical space with units θ to a homogeneous space with units θ = F (θ) in which the stimulus distribution becomes uniform. This deﬁnes the mapping as θ F (θ) = p(χ)dχ , (1) −∞ which is the cumulative of the prior distribution p(θ). We then assume a neural population with identical tuning curves that evenly tiles the stimulus range in this homogeneous space. The population provides an efﬁcient representation of the sensory variable θ according to the above constraints [11]. ˜ The tuning curves in the physical space are obtained by applying the inverse mapping F −1 (θ).

The key idea here is that by assuming efﬁcient encoding, the prior (i.e. the stimulus distribution in the world) directly constrains the likelihood function. In particular, the shape of the likelihood is determined by the cumulative distribution of the prior. As a result, the likelihood is generally asymmetric, as shown in Fig. 2, exhibiting heavier tails on the side of the prior with lower density. 2.2 Bayesian decoding Let us consider a population of N sensory neurons that efﬁciently represents a stimulus variable θ as described above. A stimulus θ0 elicits a speciﬁc population response that is characterized by the vector R = [r1 , r2 , ..., rN ] where ri is the spike-count of the ith neuron over a given time-window τ . Under the assumption that the variability in the individual ﬁring rates is governed by a Poisson process, we can write the likelihood function over θ as N p(R|θ) = (τ fi (θ))ri −τ fi (θ) e , ri ! i=1 (2) ˆ with fi (θ) describing the tuning curve of neuron i. We then deﬁne a Bayesian decoder θLSE as the estimator that minimizes the expected squared-error between the estimate and the true stimulus value, thus θp(R|θ)p(θ)dθ ˆ θLSE (R) = , (3) p(R|θ)p(θ)dθ where we use Bayes’ rule to appropriately combine the sensory evidence with the stimulus prior p(θ). 3 Bayesian estimates can be biased away from prior peaks Bayesian models of perception typically predict perceptual biases toward the peaks of the prior density, a characteristic often considered a hallmark of Bayesian inference. This originates from the 3 a b prior attraction prior prior attraction likelihood repulsion! likelihood c prior prior repulsive bias likelihood likelihood mean posterior mean posterior mean Figure 3: Bayesian estimates biased away from the prior. a) If the likelihood function is symmetric, then the estimate (posterior mean) is, on average, shifted away from the actual value of the sensory variable θ0 towards the prior peak. b) Efﬁcient encoding typically leads to an asymmetric likelihood function whose normalized mean is away from the peak of the prior (relative to θ0 ). The estimate is determined by a combination of prior attraction and shifted likelihood mean, and can exhibit an overall repulsive bias. c) If p(θ0 ) < 0 and the likelihood is relatively narrow, then (1/p(θ)2 ) > 0 (blue line) and the estimate is biased away from the prior peak (see Eq. (6)). common approach of choosing a parametric description of the likelihood function that is computationally convenient (e.g. Gaussian). As a consequence, likelihood functions are typically assumed to be symmetric (but see [23, 24]), leaving the bias of the Bayesian estimator to be mainly determined by the shape of the prior density, i.e. leading to biases toward the peak of the prior (Fig. 3a). In our model framework, the shape of the likelihood function is constrained by the stimulus prior via efﬁcient neural encoding, and is generally not symmetric for non-ﬂat priors. It has a heavier tail on the side with lower prior density (Fig. 3b). The intuition is that due to the efﬁcient allocation of neural resources, the side with smaller prior density will be encoded less accurately, leading to a broader likelihood function on that side. The likelihood asymmetry pulls the Bayes’ least-squares estimate away from the peak of the prior while at the same time the prior pulls it toward its peak. Thus, the resulting estimation bias is the combination of these two counter-acting forces - and both are determined by the prior! 3.1 General derivation of the estimation bias In the following, we will formally derive the mean estimation bias b(θ) of the proposed encodingdecoding framework. Speciﬁcally, we will study the conditions for which the bias is repulsive i.e. away from the peak of the prior density. ˆ We ﬁrst re-write the estimator θLSE (3) by replacing θ with the inverse of its mapping to the homo−1 ˜ geneous space, i.e., θ = F (θ). The motivation for this is that the likelihood in the homogeneous space is symmetric (Fig. 2). Given a value θ0 and the elicited population response R, we can write the estimator as ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ θp(R|θ)p(θ)dθ F −1 (θ)p(R|F −1 (θ))p(F −1 (θ))dF −1 (θ) ˆ θLSE (R) = = . ˜ ˜ ˜ p(R|θ)p(θ)dθ p(R|F −1 (θ))p(F −1 (θ))dF −1 (θ) Calculating the derivative of the inverse function and noting that F is the cumulative of the prior density, we get 1 1 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ dθ = dθ. dF −1 (θ) = (F −1 (θ)) dθ = dθ = −1 (θ)) ˜ F (θ) p(θ) p(F ˆ Hence, we can simplify θLSE (R) as ˆ θLSE (R) = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ . ˜ ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ With ˜ K(R, θ) = ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ)) ˜ ˜ p(R|F −1 (θ))dθ 4 we can further simplify the notation and get ˆ θLSE (R) = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)K(R, θ)dθ . (4) ˆ ˜ In order to get the expected value of the estimate, θLSE (θ), we marginalize (4) over the population response space S, ˆ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ θLSE (θ) = p(R)F −1 (θ)K(R, θ)dθdR S = F −1 ˜ (θ)( ˜ ˜ p(R)K(R, θ)dR)dθ = ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)L(θ)dθ, S where we deﬁne ˜ L(θ) = ˜ p(R)K(R, θ)dR. S ˜ ˜ ˜ It follows that L(θ)dθ = 1. Due to the symmetry in this space, it can be shown that L(θ) is ˜0 . Intuitively, L(θ) can be thought as the normalized ˜ symmetric around the true stimulus value θ average likelihood in the homogeneous space. We can then compute the expected bias at θ0 as b(θ0 ) = ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ)L(θ)dθ − F −1 (θ0 ) (5) ˜ This is expression is general where F −1 (θ) is deﬁned as the inverse of the cumulative of an arbitrary ˜ prior density p(θ) (see Eq. (1)) and the dispersion of L(θ) is determined by the internal noise level. ˜ ˜ Assuming the prior density to be smooth, we expand F −1 in a neighborhood (θ0 − h, θ0 + h) that is larger than the support of the likelihood function. Using Taylor’s theorem with mean-value forms of the remainder, we get 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ F −1 (θ) = F −1 (θ0 ) + F −1 (θ0 ) (θ − θ0 ) + F −1 (θx ) (θ − θ0 )2 , 2 ˜ ˜ ˜ with θx lying between θ0 and θ. By applying this expression to (5), we ﬁnd ˜ θ0 +h b(θ0 ) = = 1 2 ˜ θ0 −h 1 −1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ 1 F (θx )θ (θ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ = ˜ 2 2 ˜ θ0 +h −( ˜ θ0 −h p(θx )θ ˜ ˜ 2 ˜ ˜ 1 )(θ − θ0 ) L(θ)dθ = p(θx )3 4 ˜ θ0 +h 1 ˜ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ ˜ ˜ ˜ ( ) ˜(θ ˜ p(F −1 (θx )) θ ( 1 ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ) (θ − θ0 )2 L(θ)dθ. p(θx )2 θ ˜ θ0 −h ˜ θ0 +h ˜ θ0 −h In general, there is no simple rule to judge the sign of b(θ0 ). However, if the prior is monotonic ˜ ˜ on the interval F −1 ((θ0 − h, θ0 + h)), then the sign of ( p(θ1 )2 ) is always the same as the sign of x 1 1 ( p(θ0 )2 ) . Also, if the likelihood is sufﬁciently narrow we can approximate ( p(θ1 )2 ) by ( p(θ0 )2 ) , x and therefore approximate the bias as b(θ0 ) ≈ C( 1 ) , p(θ0 )2 (6) where C is a positive constant. The result is quite surprising because it states that as long as the prior is monotonic over the support of the likelihood function, the expected estimation bias is always away from the peaks of the prior! 3.2 Internal (neural) versus external (stimulus) noise The above derivation of estimation bias is based on the assumption that all uncertainty about the sensory variable is caused by neural response variability. This level of internal noise depends on the response magnitude, and thus can be modulated e.g. by changing stimulus contrast. This contrastcontrolled noise modulation is commonly exploited in perceptual studies (e.g. [18]). Internal noise will always lead to repulsive biases in our framework if the prior is monotonic. If internal noise is low, the likelihood is narrow and thus the bias is small. Increasing internal noise leads to increasingly 5 larger biases up to the point where the likelihood becomes wide enough such that monotonicity of the prior over the support of the likelihood is potentially violated. Stimulus noise is another way to modulate the noise level in perception (e.g. random-dot motion stimuli). Such external noise, however, has a different effect on the shape of the likelihood function as compared to internal noise. It modiﬁes the likelihood function (2) by convolving it with the noise kernel. External noise is frequently chosen as additive and symmetric (e.g. zero-mean Gaussian). It is straightforward to prove that such symmetric external noise does not lead to a change in the mean of the likelihood, and thus does not alter the repulsive effect induced by its asymmetry. However, by increasing the overall width of the likelihood, the attractive inﬂuence of the prior increases, resulting in an estimate that is closer to the prior peak than without external noise2 . 4 Perception of visual orientation We tested our framework by modelling the perception of visual orientation. Our choice was based on the fact that i) we have pretty good estimates of the prior distribution of local orientations in natural images, ii) tuning characteristics of orientation selective neurons in visual cortex are wellstudied (monkey/cat), and iii) biases in perceived stimulus orientation have been well characterized. We start by creating an efﬁcient neural population based on measured prior distributions of local visual orientation, and then compare the resulting tuning characteristics of the population and the predicted perceptual biases with reported data in the literature. 4.1 Efﬁcient neural model population for visual orientation Previous studies measured the statistics of the local orientation in large sets of natural images and consistently found that the orientation distribution is multimodal, peaking at the two cardinal orientations as shown in Fig. 4a [16, 20]. We assumed that the visual system’s prior belief over orientation p(θ) follows this distribution and approximate it formally as p(θ) ∝ 2 − | sin(θ)| (black line in Fig. 4b) . (7) Based on this prior distribution we deﬁned an efﬁcient neural representation for orientation. We assumed a population of model neurons (N = 30) with tuning curves that follow a von-Mises distribution in the homogeneous space on top of a constant spontaneous ﬁring rate (5 Hz). We then ˜ applied the inverse transformation F −1 (θ) to all these tuning curves to get the corresponding tuning curves in the physical space (Fig. 4b - red curves), where F (θ) is the cumulative of the prior (7). The concentration parameter for the von-Mises tuning curves was set to κ ≈ 1.6 in the homogeneous space in order to match the measured average tuning width (∼ 32 deg) of neurons in area V1 of the macaque [9]. 4.2 Predicted tuning characteristics of neurons in primary visual cortex The orientation tuning characteristics of our model population well match neurophysiological data of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Efﬁcient encoding predicts that the distribution of neurons’ preferred orientation follows the prior, with more neurons tuned to cardinal than oblique orientations by a factor of approximately 1.5. A similar ratio has been found for neurons in area V1 of monkey/cat [9, 10]. Also, the tuning widths of the model neurons vary between 25-42 deg depending on their preferred tuning (see Fig. 4c), matching the measured tuning width ratio of 0.6 between neurons tuned to the cardinal versus oblique orientations [9]. An important prediction of our model is that most of the tuning curves should be asymmetric. Such asymmetries have indeed been reported for the orientation tuning of neurons in area V1 [6, 7, 8]. We computed the asymmetry index for our model population as deﬁned in previous studies [6, 7], and plotted it as a function of the preferred tuning of each neuron (Fig. 4d). The overall asymmetry index in our model population is 1.24 ± 0.11, which approximately matches the measured values for neurons in area V1 of the cat (1.26 ± 0.06) [6]. It also predicts that neurons tuned to the cardinal and oblique orientations should show less symmetry than those tuned to orientations in between. Finally, 2 Note, that these predictions are likely to change if the external noise is not symmetric. 6 a b 25 firing rate(Hz) 0 orientation(deg) asymmetry vs. tuning width 1.0 2.0 90 2.0 e asymmetry 1.0 0 asymmetry index 50 30 width (deg) 10 90 preferred tuning(deg) -90 0 d 0 0 90 asymmetry index 0 orientation(deg) tuning width -90 0 0 probability 0 -90 c efficient representation 0.01 0.01 image statistics -90 0 90 preferred tuning(deg) 25 30 35 40 tuning width (deg) Figure 4: Tuning characteristics of model neurons. a) Distribution of local orientations in natural images, replotted from [16]. b) Prior used in the model (black) and predicted tuning curves according to efﬁcient coding (red). c) Tuning width as a function of preferred orientation. d) Tuning curves of cardinal and oblique neurons are more symmetric than those tuned to orientations in between. e) Both narrowly and broadly tuned neurons neurons show less asymmetry than neurons with tuning widths in between. neurons with tuning widths at the lower and upper end of the range are predicted to exhibit less asymmetry than those neurons whose widths lie in between these extremes (illustrated in Fig. 4e). These last two predictions have not been tested yet. 4.3 Predicted perceptual biases Our model framework also provides speciﬁc predictions for the expected perceptual biases. Humans show systematic biases in perceived orientation of visual stimuli such as e.g. arrays of Gabor patches (Fig. 5a,d). Two types of biases can be distinguished: First, perceived orientations show an absolute bias away from the cardinal orientations, thus away from the peaks of the orientation prior [2, 3]. We refer to these biases as absolute because they are typically measured by adjusting a noise-free reference until it matched the orientation of the test stimulus. Interestingly, these repulsive absolute biases are the larger the smaller the external stimulus noise is (see Fig. 5b). Second, the relative bias between the perceived overall orientations of a high-noise and a low-noise stimulus is toward the cardinal orientations as shown in Fig. 5c, and thus toward the peak of the prior distribution [3, 16]. The predicted perceptual biases of our model are shown Fig. 5e,f. We computed the likelihood function according to (2) and used the prior in (7). External noise was modeled by convolving the stimulus likelihood function with a Gaussian (different widths for different noise levels). The predictions well match both, the reported absolute bias away as well as the relative biases toward the cardinal orientations. Note, that our model framework correctly accounts for the fact that less external noise leads to larger absolute biases (see also discussion in section 3.2). 5 Discussion We have presented a modeling framework for perception that combines efﬁcient (en)coding and Bayesian decoding. Efﬁcient coding imposes constraints on the tuning characteristics of a population of neurons according to the stimulus distribution (prior). It thus establishes a direct link between prior and likelihood, and provides clear constraints on the latter for a Bayesian observer model of perception. We have shown that the resulting likelihoods are in general asymmetric, with 7 absolute bias (data) b c relative bias (data) -4 0 bias(deg) 4 a low-noise stimulus -90 e 90 absolute bias (model) low external noise high external noise 3 high-noise stimulus -90 f 0 90 relative bias (model) 0 bias(deg) d 0 attraction -3 repulsion -90 0 orientation (deg) 90 -90 0 orientation (deg) 90 Figure 5: Biases in perceived orientation: Human data vs. Model prediction. a,d) Low- and highnoise orientation stimuli of the type used in [3, 16]. b) Humans show absolute biases in perceived orientation that are away from the cardinal orientations.

We demonstrated that such asymmetric likelihoods can lead to the counter-intuitive prediction that a Bayesian estimator is biased away from the peaks of the prior distribution. Interestingly, such repulsive biases have been reported for human perception of visual orientation, yet a principled and consistent explanation of their existence has been missing so far. Here, we suggest that these counter-intuitive biases directly follow from the asymmetries in the likelihood function induced by efﬁcient neural encoding of the stimulus. The good match between our model predictions and the measured perceptual biases and orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in primary visual cortex provides further support of our framework. Previous work has suggested that there might be a link between stimulus statistics, neuronal tuning characteristics, and perceptual behavior based on efﬁcient coding principles, yet none of these studies has recognized the importance of the resulting likelihood asymmetries [16, 11]. We have demonstrated here that such asymmetries can be crucial in explaining perceptual data, even though the resulting estimates appear “anti-Bayesian” at ﬁrst sight (see also models of sensory adaptation [23]). Note, that we do not provide a neural implementation of the Bayesian inference step. However, we and others have proposed various neural decoding schemes that can approximate Bayes’ leastsquares estimation using efﬁcient coding [26, 25, 22]. It is also worth pointing out that our estimator is set to minimize total squared-error, and that other choices of the loss function (e.g. MAP estimator) could lead to different predictions. Our framework is general and should be directly applicable to other modalities. In particular, it might provide a new explanation for perceptual biases that are hard to reconcile with traditional Bayesian approaches [5]. Acknowledgments We thank M. Jogan and A.

<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We present a dynamic nonlinear generative model for visual motion based on a latent representation of binary-gated Gaussian variables. Trained on sequences of images, the model learns to represent different movement directions in different variables. We use an online approximate inference scheme that can be mapped to the dynamics of networks of neurons. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars of light, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. Most model neurons also show speed tuning and respond equally well to a range of motion directions and speeds aligned to the constraint line of their respective preferred speed. We show how these computations are enabled by a speciﬁc pattern of recurrent connections learned by the model. 1</p><p>5 0.71578139 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Multi-scale_Hyper-time_Hardware_Emulation_of_Human_Motor_Nervous_System_Based_on_Spiking_Neurons_using_FPGA.html">224 nips-2012-Multi-scale Hyper-time Hardware Emulation of Human Motor Nervous System Based on Spiking Neurons using FPGA</a></p>
<p>Author: C. M. Niu, Sirish Nandyala, Won J. Sohn, Terence Sanger</p><p>Abstract: Our central goal is to quantify the long-term progression of pediatric neurological diseases, such as a typical 10-15 years progression of child dystonia. To this purpose, quantitative models are convincing only if they can provide multi-scale details ranging from neuron spikes to limb biomechanics. The models also need to be evaluated in hyper-time, i.e. signiﬁcantly faster than real-time, for producing useful predictions. We designed a platform with digital VLSI hardware for multiscale hyper-time emulations of human motor nervous systems. The platform is constructed on a scalable, distributed array of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. All devices operate asynchronously with 1 millisecond time granularity, and the overall system is accelerated to 365x real-time. Each physiological component is implemented using models from well documented studies and can be ﬂexibly modiﬁed. Thus the validity of emulation can be easily advised by neurophysiologists and clinicians. For maximizing the speed of emulation, all calculations are implemented in combinational logic instead of clocked iterative circuits. This paper presents the methodology of building FPGA modules emulating a monosynaptic spinal loop. Emulated activities are qualitatively similar to real human data. Also discussed is the rationale of approximating neural circuitry by organizing neurons with sparse interconnections. In conclusion, our platform allows emulating pathological abnormalities such that motor symptoms will emerge and can be analyzed. It compels us to test the origins of childhood motor disorders and predict their long-term progressions. 1 Challenges of studying developmental motor disorders There is currently no quantitative model of how a neuropathological condition, which mainly affects the function of neurons, ends up causing the functional abnormalities identiﬁed in clinical examinations. The gap in knowledge is particularly evident for disorders in developing human nervous systems, i.e. childhood neurological diseases. In these cases, the ultimate clinical effect of cellu1 lar injury is compounded by a complex interplay among the child’s injury, development, behavior, experience, plasticity, etc. Qualitative insight has been provided by clinical experiences into the association between particular types of injury and particular types of outcome. Their quantitative linkages, nevertheless, have yet to be created – neither in clinic nor in cellular physiological tests. This discrepancy is signiﬁcantly more prominent for individual child patients, which makes it very difﬁcult to estimate the efﬁcacy of treatment plans. In order to understand the consequence of injury and discover new treatments, it is necessary to create a modeling toolset with certain design guidelines, such that child neurological diseases can be quantitatively analyzed. Perhaps more than any other organ, the brain necessarily operates on multiple spatial and temporal scales. On the one hand, it is the neurons that perform fundamental computations, but neurons have to interact with large-scale organs (ears, eyes, skeletal muscles, etc.) to achieve global functions. This multi-scale nature worths more attention in injuries, where the overall deﬁcits depend on both the cellular effects of injuries and the propagated consequences. On the other hand, neural processes in developmental diseases usually operate on drastically different time scales, e.g. spinal reﬂex in milliseconds versus learning in years. Thus when studying motor nervous systems, mathematical modeling is convincing only if it can provide multi-scale details, ranging from neuron spikes to limb biomechanics; also the models should be evaluated with time granularity as small as 1 millisecond, meanwhile the evaluation needs to continue trillions of cycles in order to cover years of life. It is particularly challenging to describe the multi-scale nature of human nervous system when modeling childhood movement disorders. Note that for a child who suffered brain injury at birth, the full development of all motor symptoms may easily take more than 10 years. Therefore the millisecondbased model needs to be evaluated signiﬁcantly faster than real-time, otherwise the model will fail to produce any useful predictions in time. We have implemented realistic models for spiking motoneurons, sensory neurons, neural circuitry, muscle ﬁbers and proprioceptors using VLSI and programmable logic technologies. All models are computed in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware in 365 times real-time. Therefore one year of disease progression can be assessed after one day of emulation. This paper presents the methodology of building the emulation platform. The results demonstrate that our platform is capable of producing physiologically realistic multi-scale signals, which are usually scarce in experiments. Successful emulations enabled by this platform will be used to verify theories of neuropathology. New treatment mechanisms and drug effects can also be emulated before animal experiments or clinical trials. 2 Methodology of multi-scale neural emulation A. Human arm B. Monosynaptic spinal loop C. Inner structure of muscle spindle Gamma Secondary dynamic Gamma output input static Primary input output Bag 1 αMN Bag 2 Chain Figure 1: Illustration of the multi-scale nature of motor nervous system. The motor part of human nervous system is responsible for maintaining body postures and generating voluntary movements. The multi-scale nature of motor nervous system is demonstrated in Fig.1. When the elbow (Fig.1A) is maintaining a posture or performing a movement, a force is established by the involved muscle based on how much spiking excitation the muscle receives from its αmotoneurons (Fig.1B). The α-motoneurons are regulated by a variety of sensory input, part of which comes directly from the proprioceptors in the muscle. As the primary proprioceptor found in skeletal muscles, a muscle spindle is another complex system that has its own microscopic Multiple-InputMultiple-Output structure (Fig.1C). Spindles continuously provide information about the length and lengthening speed of the muscle ﬁber. A muscle with its regulating motoneurons, sensory neurons and proprioceptors constitutes a monosynaptic spinal loop. This minimalist neurophysiological 2 structure is used as an example for explaining the multi-scale hyper-time emulation in hardware. Additional structures can be added to the backbone set-up using similar methodologies. 2.1 Modularized architecture for multi-scale models Decades of studies on neurophysiology provided an abundance of models characterizing different components of the human motor nervous system. The informational characteristics of physiological components allowed us to model them as functional structures, i.e. each of which converting input signals to certain outputs. In particular, within a monosynaptic spinal loop illustrated in Fig.1B, stretching the muscle will elicit a chain of physiological activities in: muscle stretch ⇒ spindle ⇒ sensory neuron ⇒ synapse ⇒ motoneuron ⇒ muscle contraction. The adjacent components must have compatible interfaces, and the interfacing variables must also be physiologically realistic. In our design, each component is mathematically described in Table 1: Table 1: Functional deﬁnition of neural models COMPONENT Neuron Synapse Muscle Spindle MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION S(t) = fneuron (I, t) I(t) = fsynapse (S, t) ˙ T (t) = fmuscle (S, L, L, t) ˙ Γdynamic , Γstatic , t) A(t) = fspindle (L, L, all components are modeled as black-box functions that map the inputs to the outputs. The meanings of these mathematical deﬁnitions are explained below. This design allows existing physiological models to be easily inserted and switched. In all models the input signals are time-varying, e.g. I = I(t), L = L(t) , etc. The argument of t in input signals are omitted throughout this paper. 2.2 Selection of models for emulation Models were selected in consideration of their computational cost, physiological verisimilitude, and whether it can be adapted to the mathematical form deﬁned in Table 1. Model of Neuron The informational process for a neuron is to take post-synaptic current I as the input, and produce a binary spike train S in the output. The neuron model adopted in the emulation was developed by Izhikevich [1]: = 0.04v 2 + 5v + 140 − u + I = a(bv − u) v u (1) (2) if v = 30 mV, then v ← c, u ← u + d where a, b, c, d are free parameters tuned to achieve certain ﬁring patterns. Membrane potential v directly determines a binary spike train S(t) that S(t) = 1 if v ≥ 30, otherwise S(t) = 0. Note that v in Izhikevich model is in millivolts and time t is in milliseconds. Therefore the coefﬁcients in eq.1 need to be adjusted in correspondence to SI units. Model of Synapse When a pre-synaptic neuron spikes, i.e. S(0) = 1, an excitatory synapse subsequently issues an Excitatory Post-Synaptic Current (EPSC) that drives the post-synaptic neuron. Neural recording of hair cells in rats [2] provided evidence that the time proﬁle of EPSC can be well characterized using the equations below: I(t) = Vm × e t d Vm −τ 0 t − e− τr Vm if t ≥ 0 (3) otherwise The key parameters in a synapse model is the time constants for rising (τr ) and decaying (τd ). In our emulation τr = 0.001 s and τr = 0.003 s. 3 Model of Muscle force and electromyograph (EMG) The primary effect of skeletal muscle is to convert α-motoneuron spikes S into force T , depending ˙ on the muscle’s instantaneous length L and lengthening speed L. We used Hill’s muscle model in the emulation with parameter tuning described in [3]. Another measurable output of muscle is electromyograph (EMG). EMG is the small skin current polarized by motor unit action potential (MUAP) when it travels along muscle ﬁbers. Models exist to describe the typical waveform picked by surface EMG electrodes. In this project we chose to implement the one described in [4]. Model of Proprioceptor Spindle is a sensory organ that provides the main source of proprioceptive information. As can be seen in Fig.1C, a spindle typically produces two afferent outputs (primary Ia and secondary II) ˙ according to its gamma fusimotor drives (Γdynamic and Γstatic ) and muscle states (L and L). There is currently no closed-form models describing spindle functions due to spindle’s signiﬁcant nonlinearity. On representative model that numerically approximates the spindle dynamics was developed by Mileusnic et al. [5]. The model used differential equations to characterize a typical cat soleus spindle. Eqs.4-10 present a subset of this model for one type of spindle ﬁber (bag1): Γdynamic − x0 /τ Γdynamic + Ω2 bag1 x0 ˙ = x1 ˙ = x2 1 = [TSR − TB − TP R − Γ1 x0 ] M x2 ˙ (4) (5) (6) where TSR TB TP R CSS = KSR (L − x1 − LSR0 ) (7) 0.3 = (B0 + B1 x0 ) · (x1 − R) · CSS · |x2 | = KP R (x1 − LP R0 ) 2 = −1 −1000x2 1+e (8) (9) (10) Eq.8 and 10 suggest that evaluating the spindle model requires multiplication, division as well as more complex arithmetics like polynomials and exponentials. The implementation details are described in Section 3. 2.3 Neuron connectivity with sparse interconnections Although the number of spinal neurons (~1 billion) is signiﬁcantly less compared to that of cortical neurons (~100 billion), a fully connected spinal network still means approximately 2 trillion synaptic endings [6]. Implementing such a huge number of synapses imposes a major challenge, if not impossible, given limited hardware resource. In this platform we approximated the neural connectivity by sparsely connecting sensory neurons to motoneurons as parallel pathways. We do not attempt to introduce the full connectivity. The rationale is that in a neural control system, the effect of a single neuron can be considered as mapping current state x to change in state x through a band-limited channel. Therefore when a collection of ˙ neurons are ﬁring stochastically, the probability of x depends on both x and the ﬁring behavior s ˙ (s = 1 when spiking, otherwise s = 0) of each neuron, as such: p(x|x, s) = p(x|s = 1)p(s = 1|x) + p(x|s = 0)p(s = 0|x) ˙ ˙ ˙ (11) Eq.11 is a master equation that determines a probability ﬂow on the state. From the Kramers-Moyal expansion we can associate this probability ﬂow with a partial differential equation: ∂ p(x, t) ∂t ∞ − = i=1 ∂ ∂x i D(i) (x)p(x, t) (12) where D(i) (x) is a time-invariant term that modiﬁes the change of probability density based on its i-th gradient. 4 Under certain conditions [7, 8], D(i) (x) for i > 2 all vanish and therefore the probability ﬂow can be described deterministically using a linear operator L: ∂ ∂ ∂ 2 (2) D (x) p(x, t) = Lp(x, t) (13) p(x, t) = − D(1) (x) + ∂t ∂x ∂x2 This means that various Ls can be superimposed to achieve complex system dynamics (illustrated in Fig.2A). B. Equivalent network with sparse interconnections A. Neuron function as superimposed linear operators SN Sensory Input + SN SN SN αMN αMN αMN Motor Output αMN Figure 2: Functions of neuron population can be described as the combination of linear operators (A). Therefore the original neural function can be equivalently produced by sparsely connected neurons formalizing parallel pathways (B). As a consequence, the statistical effect of two fully connected neuron populations is equivalent to ones that are only sparsely connected, as long as the probability ﬂow can be described by the same L. For a movement task, in particular, it is the statistical effect from the neuron ensemble onto skeletal muscles that determines the global behavior. Therefore we argue that it is feasible to approximate the spinal cord connectivity by sparsely interconnecting sensory and motor neurons (Fig.2B). Here a pool of homogenous sensory neurons projects to another pool of homogeneous α-motoneurons. Pseudorandom noise is added to the input of all homogeneous neurons within a population. It is worth noting that this approximation signiﬁcantly reduces the number of synapses that need to be implemented in hardware. 3 Hardware implementation on FPGA We select FPGA as the implementation device due to its inherent parallelism that resembles the nervous system. FPGA is favored over GPU or clustered CPUs because it is relatively easy to network hundreds of nodes under ﬂexible protocols. The platform is distributed on multiple nodes of Xilinx Spartan-6 devices. The interfacing among FPGAs and computers is created using OpalKelly development board XEM6010. The dynamic range of variables is tight in models of Izhikevich neuron, synapse and EMG. This helps maintaining the accuracy of models even when they are evaluated in 32-bit ﬁxed-point arithmetics. The spindle model, in contrast, requires ﬂoating-point arithmetics due to its wide dynamic range and complex calculations (see eq.4-10). Hyper-time computations with ﬂoating-point numbers are resource consuming and therefore need to be implemented with special attentions. 3.1 Floating-point arithmetics in combinational logic Our arithmetic implementations are compatible with IEEE-754 standard. Typical ﬂoating-point arithmetic IP cores are either pipe-lined or based on iterative algorithms such as CORDIC, all of which require clocks to schedule the calculation. In our platform, no clock is provided for model evaluations thus all arithmetics need to be executed in pure combinational logic. Taking advantage of combinational logic allows all model evaluations to be 1) fast, the evaluation time depends entirely on the propagating and settling time of signals, which is on the order of microseconds, and 2) parallel, each model is evaluated on its own circuit without waiting for any other results. Our implementations of adder and multiplier are inspired by the open source project “Free FloatingPoint Madness”, available at http://www.hmc.edu/chips/. Please contact the authors of this paper if the modiﬁed code is needed. 5 Fast combinational ﬂoating-point division Floating-point division is even more resource demanding than multiplications. We avoided directly implementing the dividing algorithm by approximating it with additions and multiplications. Our approach is inspired by an algorithm described in [9], which provides a good approximation of the inverse square root for any positive number x within one Newton-Raphson iteration: 1 x Q(x) = √ ≈ x(1.5 − · x2 ) 2 x (x > 0) (14) Q(x) can be implemented only using ﬂoating-point adders and multipliers. Thereby any division with a positive divisor can be achieved if two blocks of Q(x) are concatenated: a a (15) = √ √ = a · Q(b) · Q(b) (b > 0) b b· b This algorithm has been adjusted to also work with negative divisors (b < 0). Numerical integrators for differential equations Evaluating the instantaneous states of differential equation models require a ﬁxed-step numerical integrator. Backward Euler’s Method was chosen to balance the numerical error and FPGA usage: x ˙ xn+1 = f (x, t) = xn + T f (xn+1 , tn+1 ) (16) (17) where T is the sampling interval. f (x, t) is the derivative function for state variable x. 3.2 Asynchronous spike-based communication between FPGA chips Clock Spike clean count Counter 1 1 2 1 2 3 Figure 3: Timing diagram of asynchronous spike-based communication FPGA nodes are networked by transferring 1-bit binary spikes to each other. Our design allowed the sender and the receiver to operate on independent clocks without having to synchronize. The timing diagram of the spike-based communication is shown in Fig.3. The sender issues Spike with a pulse width of 1/(365 × Femu ) second. Each Spike then triggers a counting event on the receiver, meanwhile each Clock ﬁrst reads the accumulated spike count and subsequently cleans the counter. Note that the phase difference between Spike and Clock is not predictable due to asynchronicity. 3.3 Serialize neuron evaluations within a homogeneous population Different neuron populations are instantiated as standalone circuits. Within in each population, however, homogeneous neurons mentioned in Section 2.3 are evaluated in series in order to optimize FPGA usage. Within each FPGA node all modules operate with a central clock, which is the only source allowed to trigger any updating event. Therefore the maximal number of neurons that can be serialized (Nserial ) is restrained by the following relationship: Ffpga = C × Nserial × 365 × Femu (18) Here Ffpga is the fastest clock rate that a FPGA can operate on; C = 4 is the minimal clock cycles needed for updating each state variable in the on-chip memory; Femu = 1 kHz is the time granularity of emulation (1 millisecond), and 365 × Femu represents 365x real-time. Consider that Xilinx 6 Spartan-6 FPGA devices peaks at 200MHz central clock frequency, the theoretical maximum of neurons that can be serialized is Nserial 200 MHz/(4 × 365 × 1 kHz) ≈ 137 (19) In the current design we choose Nserial = 128. 4 Results: emulated activities of motor nervous system Figure 4 shows the implemented monosynaptic spinal loop in schematics and in operation. Each FPGA node is able to emulate monosynaptic spinal loops consisting of 1,024 sensory and 1,024 motor neurons, i.e. 2,048 neurons in total. The spike-based asynchronous communication is successful between two FPGA nodes. Note that the emulation has to be signiﬁcantly slowed down for on-line plotting. When the emulation is at full speed (365x real-time) the software front-end is not able to visualize the signals due to limited data throughput. 128 SNs 128 αMNs SN αMN 128 SNs 128 αMNs SN αMN ... 8 parallel pathways 2,048 neurons Figure 4: The neural emulation platform in operation. Left: Neural circuits implemented for each FPGA node including 2,048 neurons. SN = Sensory Neuron; αMN = α-motoneuron. Center: One working FPGA node. Right: Two FPGA nodes networked using asynchronous spiking protocol. The emulation platform successfully created multi-scale information when the muscle is externally stretched (Fig.5A). We also tested if our emulated motor system is able to produce the recruitment order and size principles observed in real physiological data. It has been well known that when a voluntary motor command is sent to the α-motoneuron pool, the motor units are recruited in an order that small ones get recruited ﬁrst, followed by the big ones [10]. The comparison between our results and real data are shown in Fig.5B, where the top panel shows 20 motor unit activities emulated using our platform, and the bottom panel shows decoded motor unit activities from real human EMG [11]. No qualitative difference was found. 5 Discussion and future work We designed a hardware platform for emulating the multi-scale motor nervous activities in hypertime. We managed to use one node of single Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA to emulate monosynaptic spinal loops consisting of 2,048 neurons, associated muscles and proprioceptors. The neurons are organized as parallel pathways with sparse interconnections. The emulation is successfully accelerated to 365x real-time. The platform can be scaled by networking multiple FPGA nodes, which is enabled by an asynchronous spike-based communication protocol. The emulated monosynaptic spinal loops are capable of producing reﬂex-like activities in response to muscle stretch. Our results of motor unit recruitment order are compatible with the physiological data collected in real human subjects. There is a question of whether this stochastic system turns out chaotic, especially with accumulated errors from Backward Euler’s integrator. Note that the ﬁring property of a neuron population is usually stable even with explicit noise [8], and spindle inputs are measured from real robots so the integrator errors are corrected at every iteration. To our knowledge, the system is not critically sensitive to the initial conditions or integrator errors. This question, however, is both interesting and important for in-depth investigations in the future. 7 It has been shown [12] that replicating classic types of spinal interneurons (propriospinal, Iaexcitatory, Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw, etc.) is sufﬁcient to produce stabilizing responses and rapid reaching movement in a wrist. Our platform will introduce those interneurons to describe the known spinal circuitry in further details. Physiological models will also be reﬁned as needed. For the purpose of modeling movement behavior or diseases, Izhikevich model is a good balance between verisimilitude and computational cost. Nevertheless when testing drug effects along disease progression, neuron models are expected to cover sufﬁcient molecular details including how neurotransmitters affect various ion channels. With the advancing of programmable semiconductor technology, it is expected to upgrade our neuron model to Hodgkin-Huxley’s. For the muscle models, Hill’s type of model does not ﬁt the muscle properties accurately enough when the muscle is being shortened. Alternative models will be tested. Other studies showed that the functional dexterity of human limbs – especially in the hands – is critically enabled by the tendon conﬁgurations and joint geometry [13]. As a result, if our platform is used to understand whether known neurophysiology and biomechanics are sufﬁcient to produce able and pathological movements, it will be necessary to use this platform to control human-like limbs. Since the emulation speed can be ﬂexibly adjusted from arbitrarily slow to 365x real-time, when speeded to exactly 1x real-time the platform will function as a digital controller with 1kHz refresh rate. The main purpose of the emulation is to learn how certain motor disorders progress during childhood development. This ﬁrst requires the platform to reproduce motor symptoms that are compatible with clinical observations. For example it has been suggested that muscle spasticity in rats is associated with decreased soma size of α-motoneurons [14], which presumably reduced the ﬁring threshold of neurons. Thus when lower ﬁring threshold is introduced to the emulated motoneuron pool, similar EMG patterns as in [15] should be observed. It is also necessary for the symptoms to evolve with neural plasticity. In the current version we presume that the structure of each component remains time invariant. In the future work Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) will be introduced such that all components are subject to temporal modiﬁcations. B. Verify motor unit recruitment pattern A.

<p>Author: Shaul Druckmann, Tao Hu, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: Early stages of sensory systems face the challenge of compressing information from numerous receptors onto a much smaller number of projection neurons, a so called communication bottleneck. To make more efficient use of limited bandwidth, compression may be achieved using predictive coding, whereby predictable, or redundant, components of the stimulus are removed. In the case of the retina, Srinivasan et al. (1982) suggested that feedforward inhibitory connections subtracting a linear prediction generated from nearby receptors implement such compression, resulting in biphasic center-surround receptive fields. However, feedback inhibitory circuits are common in early sensory circuits and furthermore their dynamics may be nonlinear. Can such circuits implement predictive coding as well? Here, solving the transient dynamics of nonlinear reciprocal feedback circuits through analogy to a signal-processing algorithm called linearized Bregman iteration we show that nonlinear predictive coding can be implemented in an inhibitory feedback circuit. In response to a step stimulus, interneuron activity in time constructs progressively less sparse but more accurate representations of the stimulus, a temporally evolving prediction. This analysis provides a powerful theoretical framework to interpret and understand the dynamics of early sensory processing in a variety of physiological experiments and yields novel predictions regarding the relation between activity and stimulus statistics.</p><p>2 0.77278274 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Spike-Coding_with_Multiplicative_Adaptation_in_a_Spike_Response_Model.html">112 nips-2012-Efficient Spike-Coding with Multiplicative Adaptation in a Spike Response Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Neural adaptation underlies the ability of neurons to maximize encoded information over a wide dynamic range of input stimuli. Recent spiking neuron models like the adaptive Spike Response Model implement adaptation as additive ﬁxed-size fast spike-triggered threshold dynamics and slow spike-triggered currents. Such adaptation accurately models neural spiking behavior over a limited dynamic input range. To extend efﬁcient coding over large changes in dynamic input range, we propose a multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model where the spike-triggered adaptation dynamics are scaled multiplicatively by the adaptation state at the time of spiking. We show that, unlike the additive adaptation model, the ﬁring rate in our multiplicative adaptation model saturates to a realistic maximum spike-rate regardless of input magnitude. Additionally, when simulating variance switching experiments, the model quantitatively ﬁts experimental data over a wide dynamic range. Dynamic threshold models of adaptation furthermore suggest a straightforward interpretation of neural activity in terms of dynamic differential signal encoding with shifted and weighted exponential kernels. We show that when thus encoding rectiﬁed ﬁltered stimulus signals, the multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model achieves a high coding efﬁciency and maintains this efﬁciency over changes in the dynamic signal range of several orders of magnitude, without changing model parameters. 1</p><p>3 0.70014381 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_estimation_of_discrete_entropy_with_mixtures_of_stick-breaking_priors.html">57 nips-2012-Bayesian estimation of discrete entropy with mixtures of stick-breaking priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Shannon’s entropy H in the under-sampled regime, where the number of possible symbols may be unknown or countably inﬁnite. Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes provide tractable prior distributions over the space of countably inﬁnite discrete distributions, and have found major applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that they provide natural priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the analytic tractability of the moments of the induced posterior distribution over entropy H. We derive formulas for the posterior mean and variance of H given data. However, we show that a ﬁxed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior on H, meaning the prior strongly determines the estimate in the under-sampled regime. We therefore deﬁne a family of continuous mixing measures such that the resulting mixture of Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor processes produces an approximately ﬂat prior over H. We explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators and show that they perform well on data sampled from both exponential and power-law tailed distributions. 1</p><p>4 0.69893777 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Assessing_Blinding_in_Clinical_Trials.html">46 nips-2012-Assessing Blinding in Clinical Trials</a></p>

Thus in clinical trials an effort is made to conceal the nature of the administered intervention from the participants in the trial i.e. to blind it.

The current standard is follow up the trial with an auxiliary questionnaire, which allows trial participants to express their belief concerning the assigned intervention and which is used to compute a measure of the extent of blinding in the trial. If the estimated extent of blinding exceeds a threshold the trial is deemed sufﬁciently blinded; otherwise, the trial is deemed to have failed. In this paper we make several important contributions. Firstly, we identify a series of fundamental problems of the aforesaid practice and discuss them in context of the most commonly used blinding measures. Secondly, motivated by the highlighted problems, we formulate a novel method for handling imperfectly blinded trials. We too adopt a post-trial feedback questionnaire but interpret the collected data using an original approach, fundamentally different from those previously proposed. Unlike previous approaches, ours is void of any ad hoc free parameters, is robust to small changes in auxiliary data and is not predicated on any strong assumptions used to interpret participants’ feedback. 1</p><p>5 0.69887829 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-High-Order_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning_to_Identify_Longitudinal_Phenotypic_Markers_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_Progression_Prediction.html">151 nips-2012-High-Order Multi-Task Feature Learning to Identify Longitudinal Phenotypic Markers for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang, Jingwen Yan, Sungeun Kim, Shannon Risacher, Andrew Saykin, Li Shen</p><p>Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in imaging and cognitive data by structured sparsity-inducing norms. The sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of imaging measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The empirical studies, using the longitudinal imaging and cognitive data of the ADNI cohort, have yielded promising results.</p><p>6 0.69515592 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Human_memory_search_as_a_random_walk_in_a_semantic_network.html">155 nips-2012-Human memory search as a random walk in a semantic network</a></p>

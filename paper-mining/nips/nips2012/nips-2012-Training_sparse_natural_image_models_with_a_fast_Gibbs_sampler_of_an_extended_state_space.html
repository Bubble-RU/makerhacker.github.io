<p>Author: Yichuan Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Amos J. Storkey, Charles A. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization, but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difﬁcult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation inference algorithms on a number of illustrative problems. 1</p><p>3 0.13411966 <a title="349-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Natural_Images%2C_Gaussian_Mixtures_and_Dead_Leaves.html">235 nips-2012-Natural Images, Gaussian Mixtures and Dead Leaves</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Simple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) learned from pixels of natural image patches have been recently shown to be surprisingly strong performers in modeling the statistics of natural images. Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models. 1 GMMs and natural image statistics models Many models for the statistics of natural image patches have been suggested in recent years. Finding good models for natural images is important to many different research areas - computer vision, biological vision and neuroscience among others. Recently, there has been a growing interest in comparing different aspects of models for natural images such as log-likelihood and multi-information reduction performance, and much progress has been achieved [1,2, 3,4,5, 6]. Out of these results there is one which is particularly interesting: simple, unconstrained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with a relatively small number of mixture components learned from image patches are extraordinarily good in modeling image statistics [6, 4]. This is a surprising result due to the simplicity of GMMs and their ubiquity. Another surprising aspect of this result is that many of the current models may be thought of as GMMs with an exponential or infinite number of components, having different constraints on the covariance structure of the mixture components. In this work we study the nature of GMMs learned from natural image patches. We start with a thorough comparison to some popular and cutting edge image models. We show that indeed, GMMs are excellent performers in modeling natural image patches. We then analyze what properties of natural images these GMMs capture, their dependence on the number of components in the mixture and their relation to the structure of the world around us. Finally, we show that the learned GMM suggests a strong connection between natural image statistics and a simple variant of the dead leaves model [7, 8] , explicitly modeling occlusions and explaining some of the success of GMMs in modeling natural images. 1 3.5 .,...- ••.......-.-.. -..---'-. 1 ~~6\8161·· -.. .-.. --...--.-- ---..-.- -. --------------MII+··+ilIl ..... .. . . ~ '[25 . . . ---- ] B'II 1_ -- ~2 ;t:: fI 1 - --- ,---- ._.. : 61.5 .....

Nonlinear sparse coding with spike-and-slab prior for neurally plausible image encoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Sterne, Joerg Bornschein, Abdul-saboor Sheikh, Joerg Luecke, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Modelling natural images with sparse coding (SC) has faced two main challenges: ﬂexibly representing varying pixel intensities and realistically representing lowlevel image components. This paper proposes a novel multiple-cause generative model of low-level image statistics that generalizes the standard SC model in two crucial points: (1) it uses a spike-and-slab prior distribution for a more realistic representation of component absence/intensity, and (2) the model uses the highly nonlinear combination rule of maximal causes analysis (MCA) instead of a linear combination. The major challenge is parameter optimization because a model with either (1) or (2) results in strongly multimodal posteriors. We show for the ﬁrst time that a model combining both improvements can be trained efﬁciently while retaining the rich structure of the posteriors. We design an exact piecewise Gibbs sampling method and combine this with a variational method based on preselection of latent dimensions. This combined training scheme tackles both analytical and computational intractability and enables application of the model to a large number of observed and hidden dimensions. Applying the model to image patches we study the optimal encoding of images by simple cells in V1 and compare the model’s predictions with in vivo neural recordings. In contrast to standard SC, we ﬁnd that the optimal prior favors asymmetric and bimodal activity of simple cells. Testing our model for consistency we ﬁnd that the average posterior is approximately equal to the prior. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the model predicts a high percentage of globular receptive ﬁelds alongside Gabor-like ﬁelds. Similarly high percentages are observed in vivo. Our results thus argue in favor of improvements of the standard sparse coding model for simple cells by using ﬂexible priors and nonlinear combinations. 1</p><p>5 0.10650607 <a title="349-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Dynamic_Pruning_of_Factor_Graphs_for_Maximum_Marginal_Prediction.html">105 nips-2012-Dynamic Pruning of Factor Graphs for Maximum Marginal Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of maximum marginal prediction (MMP) in probabilistic graphical models, a task that occurs, for example, as the Bayes optimal decision rule under a Hamming loss. MMP is typically performed as a two-stage procedure: one estimates each variable’s marginal probability and then forms a prediction from the states of maximal probability. In this work we propose a simple yet effective technique for accelerating MMP when inference is sampling-based: instead of the above two-stage procedure we directly estimate the posterior probability of each decision variable. This allows us to identify the point of time when we are sufﬁciently certain about any individual decision. Whenever this is the case, we dynamically prune the variables we are conﬁdent about from the underlying factor graph. Consequently, at any time only samples of variables whose decision is still uncertain need to be created. Experiments in two prototypical scenarios, multi-label classiﬁcation and image inpainting, show that adaptive sampling can drastically accelerate MMP without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.10063677 <a title="349-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Dual-Space_Analysis_of_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">104 nips-2012-Dual-Space Analysis of the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Kei Wakabayashi, Takao Miura</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs) are sophisticated stochastic models that enable us to capture a hierarchical context characterization of sequence data. However, existing HHMM parameter estimation methods require large computations of time complexity O(T N 2D ) at least for model inference, where D is the depth of the hierarchy, N is the number of states in each level, and T is the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a new inference method of HHMMs for which the time complexity is O(T N D+1 ). A key idea of our algorithm is application of the forward-backward algorithm to state activation probabilities. The notion of a state activation, which offers a simple formalization of the hierarchical transition behavior of HHMMs, enables us to conduct model inference efﬁciently. We present some experiments to demonstrate that our proposed method works more efﬁciently to estimate HHMM parameters than do some existing methods such as the ﬂattening method and Gibbs sampling method. 1</p><p>6 0.62244159 <a title="349-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_Nonparametric_Modeling_of_Suicide_Attempts.html">52 nips-2012-Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling of Suicide Attempts</a></p>

<p>Author: Chad Scherrer, Ambuj Tewari, Mahantesh Halappanavar, David Haglin</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale `1 -regularized loss minimization problems arise in high-dimensional applications such as compressed sensing and high-dimensional supervised learning, including classiﬁcation and regression problems. High-performance algorithms and implementations are critical to efﬁciently solving these problems. Building upon previous work on coordinate descent algorithms for `1 -regularized problems, we introduce a novel family of algorithms called block-greedy coordinate descent that includes, as special cases, several existing algorithms such as SCD, Greedy CD, Shotgun, and Thread-Greedy. We give a uniﬁed convergence analysis for the family of block-greedy algorithms. The analysis suggests that block-greedy coordinate descent can better exploit parallelism if features are clustered so that the maximum inner product between features in different blocks is small. Our theoretical convergence analysis is supported with experimental results using data from diverse real-world applications. We hope that algorithmic approaches and convergence analysis we provide will not only advance the ﬁeld, but will also encourage researchers to systematically explore the design space of algorithms for solving large-scale `1 -regularization problems. 1</p><p>2 0.8123697 <a title="349-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Dip-means%3A_an_incremental_clustering_method_for_estimating_the_number_of_clusters.html">99 nips-2012-Dip-means: an incremental clustering method for estimating the number of clusters</a></p>
<p>Author: Argyris Kalogeratos, Aristidis Likas</p><p>Abstract: Learning the number of clusters is a key problem in data clustering. We present dip-means, a novel robust incremental method to learn the number of data clusters that can be used as a wrapper around any iterative clustering algorithm of k-means family. In contrast to many popular methods which make assumptions about the underlying cluster distributions, dip-means only assumes a fundamental cluster property: each cluster to admit a unimodal distribution. The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as an individual ‘viewer’ and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations. Experimental results on artiﬁcial and real datasets indicate the eﬀectiveness of our method and its superiority over analogous approaches.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.80697238 <a title="349-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Training_sparse_natural_image_models_with_a_fast_Gibbs_sampler_of_an_extended_state_space.html">349 nips-2012-Training sparse natural image models with a fast Gibbs sampler of an extended state space</a></p>
<p>Author: Lucas Theis, Jascha Sohl-dickstein, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: We present a new learning strategy based on an efﬁcient blocked Gibbs sampler for sparse overcomplete linear models. Particular emphasis is placed on statistical image modeling, where overcomplete models have played an important role in discovering sparse representations. Our Gibbs sampler is faster than general purpose sampling schemes while also requiring no tuning as it is free of parameters. Using the Gibbs sampler and a persistent variant of expectation maximization, we are able to extract highly sparse distributions over latent sources from data. When applied to natural images, our algorithm learns source distributions which resemble spike-and-slab distributions. We evaluate the likelihood and quantitatively compare the performance of the overcomplete linear model to its complete counterpart as well as a product of experts model, which represents another overcomplete generalization of the complete linear model. In contrast to previous claims, we ﬁnd that overcomplete representations lead to signiﬁcant improvements, but that the overcomplete linear model still underperforms other models. 1</p><p>4 0.76705933 <a title="349-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Ensemble_weighted_kernel_estimators_for_multivariate_entropy_estimation.html">117 nips-2012-Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kumar Sricharan, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: The problem of estimation of entropy functionals of probability densities has received much attention in the information theory, machine learning and statistics communities. Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, for large feature dimension d, kernel plug-in estimators suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality: the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order O(T −γ/d ), where T is the number of samples, and γ > 0 is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for suﬃciently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order O(T −1 ). Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed oﬄine. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates. 1</p><p>5 0.76550758 <a title="349-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Spectral_learning_of_linear_dynamics_from_generalised-linear_observations_with_application_to_neural_population_data.html">321 nips-2012-Spectral learning of linear dynamics from generalised-linear observations with application to neural population data</a></p>
<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Maneesh Sahani, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for instance when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons. Here, we show how spectral learning methods (usually called subspace identiﬁcation in this context) for linear systems with linear-Gaussian observations can be extended to estimate the parameters of a generalised-linear dynamical system model despite a non-linear and non-Gaussian observation process. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.</p><p>6 0.76367921 <a title="349-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

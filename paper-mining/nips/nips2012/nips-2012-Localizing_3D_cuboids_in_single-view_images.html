<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level 3D object detection. Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects in 3D by enclosing them with tight oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model [1] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efﬁciency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are continuous in our model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the stateof-the-art in both 2D [1] and 3D object detection [2]. 1</p><p>3 0.16649039 <a title="201-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohsen Hejrati, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to detecting and analyzing the 3D conﬁguration of objects in real-world images with heavy occlusion and clutter. We focus on the application of ﬁnding and analyzing cars. We do so with a two-stage model; the ﬁrst stage reasons about 2D shape and appearance variation due to within-class variation (station wagons look different than sedans) and changes in viewpoint. Rather than using a view-based model, we describe a compositional representation that models a large number of effective views and shapes using a small number of local view-based templates. We use this model to propose candidate detections and 2D estimates of shape. These estimates are then reﬁned by our second stage, using an explicit 3D model of shape and viewpoint. We use a morphable model to capture 3D within-class variation, and use a weak-perspective camera model to capture viewpoint. We learn all model parameters from 2D annotations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for detection, viewpoint estimation, and 3D shape reconstruction on challenging images from the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset. 1</p><p>5 0.11762806 <a title="201-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Dynamical_And-Or_Graph_Learning_for_Object_Shape_Modeling_and_Detection.html">106 nips-2012-Dynamical And-Or Graph Learning for Object Shape Modeling and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies a novel discriminative part-based model to represent and recognize object shapes with an “And-Or graph”. We deﬁne this model consisting of three layers: the leaf-nodes with collaborative edges for localizing local parts, the or-nodes specifying the switch of leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the global veriﬁcation. A discriminative learning algorithm, extended from the CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e.g., the conﬁguration of the leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration. The advantages of our method are two-fold. (i) The And-Or graph model enables us to handle well large intra-class variance and background clutters for object shape detection from images. (ii) The proposed learning algorithm is able to obtain the And-Or graph representation without requiring elaborate supervision and initialization. We validate the proposed method on several challenging databases (e.g., INRIA-Horse, ETHZ-Shape, and UIUC-People), and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.1147051 <a title="201-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Max-Margin_Structured_Output_Regression_for_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization.html">209 nips-2012-Max-Margin Structured Output Regression for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization</a></p>

<p>Author: Shulin Yang, Liefeng Bo, Jue Wang, Linda G. Shapiro</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition refers to a subordinate level of recognition, such as recognizing different species of animals and plants. It differs from recognition of basic categories, such as humans, tables, and computers, in that there are global similarities in shape and structure shared cross different categories, and the differences are in the details of object parts. We suggest that the key to identifying the ﬁne-grained differences lies in ﬁnding the right alignment of image regions that contain the same object parts. We propose a template model for the purpose, which captures common shape patterns of object parts, as well as the cooccurrence relation of the shape patterns. Once the image regions are aligned, extracted features are used for classiﬁcation. Learning of the template model is efﬁcient, and the recognition results we achieve signiﬁcantly outperform the stateof-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.53628939 <a title="201-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Dynamical_And-Or_Graph_Learning_for_Object_Shape_Modeling_and_Detection.html">106 nips-2012-Dynamical And-Or Graph Learning for Object Shape Modeling and Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Kosuke Fukumasu, Koji Eguchi, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling is a widely used approach to analyzing large text collections. A small number of multilingual topic models have recently been explored to discover latent topics among parallel or comparable documents, such as in Wikipedia. Other topic models that were originally proposed for structured data are also applicable to multilingual documents. Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation (CorrLDA) is one such model; however, it requires a pivot language to be speciﬁed in advance. We propose a new topic model, Symmetric Correspondence LDA (SymCorrLDA), that incorporates a hidden variable to control a pivot language, in an extension of CorrLDA. We experimented with two multilingual comparable datasets extracted from Wikipedia and demonstrate that SymCorrLDA is more eﬀective than some other existing multilingual topic models. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78290516 <a title="201-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Localizing_3D_cuboids_in_single-view_images.html">201 nips-2012-Localizing 3D cuboids in single-view images</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we seek to detect rectangular cuboids and localize their corners in uncalibrated single-view images depicting everyday scenes. In contrast to recent approaches that rely on detecting vanishing points of the scene and grouping line segments to form cuboids, we build a discriminative parts-based detector that models the appearance of the cuboid corners and internal edges while enforcing consistency to a 3D cuboid model. Our model copes with different 3D viewpoints and aspect ratios and is able to detect cuboids across many different object categories. We introduce a database of images with cuboid annotations that spans a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and show qualitative and quantitative results on our collected database. Our model out-performs baseline detectors that use 2D constraints alone on the task of localizing cuboid corners. 1</p><p>3 0.67213428 <a title="201-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Searching_for_objects_driven_by_context.html">303 nips-2012-Searching for objects driven by context</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Nicolas Heess, Yee W. Teh, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: The dominant visual search paradigm for object class detection is sliding windows. Although simple and effective, it is also wasteful, unnatural and rigidly hardwired. We propose strategies to search for objects which intelligently explore the space of windows by making sequential observations at locations decided based on previous observations. Our strategies adapt to the class being searched and to the content of a particular test image, exploiting context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. In addition to being more elegant than sliding windows, we demonstrate experimentally on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset that our strategies evaluate two orders of magnitude fewer windows while achieving higher object detection performance. 1</p><p>4 0.66540653 <a title="201-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Shifting_Weights%3A_Adapting_Object_Detectors_from_Image_to_Video.html">311 nips-2012-Shifting Weights: Adapting Object Detectors from Image to Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Vignesh Ramanathan, Li Fei-fei, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Typical object detectors trained on images perform poorly on video, as there is a clear distinction in domain between the two types of data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of adapting object detectors learned from images to work well on videos. We treat the problem as one of unsupervised domain adaptation, in which we are given labeled data from the source domain (image), but only unlabeled data from the target domain (video). Our approach, self-paced domain adaptation, seeks to iteratively adapt the detector by re-training the detector with automatically discovered target domain examples, starting with the easiest ﬁrst. At each iteration, the algorithm adapts by considering an increased number of target domain examples, and a decreased number of source domain examples. To discover target domain examples from the vast amount of video data, we introduce a simple, robust approach that scores trajectory tracks instead of bounding boxes. We also show how rich and expressive features speciﬁc to the target domain can be incorporated under the same framework. We show promising results on the 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection [1] and LabelMe Video [2] datasets that illustrate the beneﬁt of our approach to adapt object detectors to video. 1</p><p>5 0.66489965 <a title="201-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>6 0.66129911 <a title="201-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-A_systematic_approach_to_extracting_semantic_information_from_functional_MRI_data.html">28 nips-2012-A systematic approach to extracting semantic information from functional MRI data</a></p>

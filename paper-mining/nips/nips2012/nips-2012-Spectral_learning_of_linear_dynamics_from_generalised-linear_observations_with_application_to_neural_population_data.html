<p>Author: Borja Balle, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in text and speech processing and computational biology require estimating functions mapping strings to real numbers. A broad class of such functions can be deﬁned by weighted automata. Spectral methods based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix have been recently proposed for learning a probability distribution represented by a weighted automaton from a training sample drawn according to this same target distribution. In this paper, we show how spectral methods can be extended to the problem of learning a general weighted automaton from a sample generated by an arbitrary distribution. The main obstruction to this approach is that, in general, some entries of the Hankel matrix may be missing. We present a solution to this problem based on solving a constrained matrix completion problem. Combining these two ingredients, matrix completion and spectral method, a whole new family of algorithms for learning general weighted automata is obtained. We present generalization bounds for a particular algorithm in this family. The proofs rely on a joint stability analysis of matrix completion and spectral learning. 1</p><p>3 0.16344364 <a title="321-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Fully_Bayesian_inference_for_neural_models_with_negative-binomial_spiking.html">138 nips-2012-Fully Bayesian inference for neural models with negative-binomial spiking</a></p>
<p>Author: James Scott, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Characterizing the information carried by neural populations in the brain requires accurate statistical models of neural spike responses. The negative-binomial distribution provides a convenient model for over-dispersed spike counts, that is, responses with greater-than-Poisson variability. Here we describe a powerful data-augmentation framework for fully Bayesian inference in neural models with negative-binomial spiking. Our approach relies on a recently described latentvariable representation of the negative-binomial distribution, which equates it to a Polya-gamma mixture of normals. This framework provides a tractable, conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior that can be used to design efﬁcient EM and Gibbs sampling based algorithms for inference in regression and dynamic factor models. We apply the model to neural data from primate retina and show that it substantially outperforms Poisson regression on held-out data, and reveals latent structure underlying spike count correlations in simultaneously recorded spike trains. 1</p><p>4 0.10940274 <a title="321-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Mixing_Properties_of_Conditional_Markov_Chains_with_Unbounded_Feature_Functions.html">218 nips-2012-Mixing Properties of Conditional Markov Chains with Unbounded Feature Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Sinn, Bei Chen</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Markov Chains (also known as Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields in the literature) are a versatile class of discriminative models for the distribution of a sequence of hidden states conditional on a sequence of observable variables. Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been ﬁrst studied in [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: ﬁrst, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identiﬁability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given. 1</p><p>5 0.089963168 <a title="321-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-conﬁdence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T 1/2 log T ) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-conﬁdence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance. 1</p><p>6 0.084834181 <a title="321-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Neuronal_Spike_Generation_Mechanism_as_an_Oversampling%2C_Noise-shaping_A-to-D_converter.html">239 nips-2012-Neuronal Spike Generation Mechanism as an Oversampling, Noise-shaping A-to-D converter</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhitang Chen, Kun Zhang, Laiwan Chan</p><p>Abstract: In conventional causal discovery, structural equation models (SEM) are directly applied to the observed variables, meaning that the causal effect can be represented as a function of the direct causes themselves. However, in many real world problems, there are signiﬁcant dependencies in the variances or energies, which indicates that causality may possibly take place at the level of variances or energies. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic causal scale-mixture model with spatiotemporal variance dependencies to represent a speciﬁc type of generating mechanism of the observations. In particular, the causal mechanism including contemporaneous and temporal causal relations in variances or energies is represented by a Structural Vector AutoRegressive model (SVAR). We prove the identiﬁability of this model under the non-Gaussian assumption on the innovation processes. We also propose algorithms to estimate the involved parameters and discover the contemporaneous causal structure. Experiments on synthetic and real world data are conducted to show the applicability of the proposed model and algorithms.</p><p>4 0.56311297 <a title="321-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Slice_Normalized_Dynamic_Markov_Logic_Networks.html">314 nips-2012-Slice Normalized Dynamic Markov Logic Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Tivadar Papai, Henry Kautz, Daniel Stefankovic</p><p>Abstract: Markov logic is a widely used tool in statistical relational learning, which uses a weighted ﬁrst-order logic knowledge base to specify a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). In many applications, a Markov logic network (MLN) is trained in one domain, but used in a different one. This paper focuses on dynamic Markov logic networks, where the size of the discretized time-domain typically varies between training and testing. It has been previously pointed out that the marginal probabilities of truth assignments to ground atoms can change if one extends or reduces the domains of predicates in an MLN. We show that in addition to this problem, the standard way of unrolling a Markov logic theory into a MRF may result in time-inhomogeneity of the underlying Markov chain. Furthermore, even if these representational problems are not signiﬁcant for a given domain, we show that the more practical problem of generating samples in a sequential conditional random ﬁeld for the next slice relying on the samples from the previous slice has high computational cost in the general case, due to the need to estimate a normalization factor for each sample. We propose a new discriminative model, slice normalized dynamic Markov logic networks (SN-DMLN), that suffers from none of these issues. It supports efﬁcient online inference, and can directly model inﬂuences between variables within a time slice that do not have a causal direction, in contrast with fully directed models (e.g., DBNs). Experimental results show an improvement in accuracy over previous approaches to online inference in dynamic Markov logic networks. 1</p><p>5 0.55608118 <a title="321-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Multi-scale_Hyper-time_Hardware_Emulation_of_Human_Motor_Nervous_System_Based_on_Spiking_Neurons_using_FPGA.html">224 nips-2012-Multi-scale Hyper-time Hardware Emulation of Human Motor Nervous System Based on Spiking Neurons using FPGA</a></p>
<p>Author: C. M. Niu, Sirish Nandyala, Won J. Sohn, Terence Sanger</p><p>Abstract: Our central goal is to quantify the long-term progression of pediatric neurological diseases, such as a typical 10-15 years progression of child dystonia. To this purpose, quantitative models are convincing only if they can provide multi-scale details ranging from neuron spikes to limb biomechanics. The models also need to be evaluated in hyper-time, i.e. signiﬁcantly faster than real-time, for producing useful predictions. We designed a platform with digital VLSI hardware for multiscale hyper-time emulations of human motor nervous systems. The platform is constructed on a scalable, distributed array of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. All devices operate asynchronously with 1 millisecond time granularity, and the overall system is accelerated to 365x real-time. Each physiological component is implemented using models from well documented studies and can be ﬂexibly modiﬁed. Thus the validity of emulation can be easily advised by neurophysiologists and clinicians. For maximizing the speed of emulation, all calculations are implemented in combinational logic instead of clocked iterative circuits. This paper presents the methodology of building FPGA modules emulating a monosynaptic spinal loop. Emulated activities are qualitatively similar to real human data. Also discussed is the rationale of approximating neural circuitry by organizing neurons with sparse interconnections. In conclusion, our platform allows emulating pathological abnormalities such that motor symptoms will emerge and can be analyzed. It compels us to test the origins of childhood motor disorders and predict their long-term progressions. 1 Challenges of studying developmental motor disorders There is currently no quantitative model of how a neuropathological condition, which mainly affects the function of neurons, ends up causing the functional abnormalities identiﬁed in clinical examinations. The gap in knowledge is particularly evident for disorders in developing human nervous systems, i.e. childhood neurological diseases. In these cases, the ultimate clinical effect of cellu1 lar injury is compounded by a complex interplay among the child’s injury, development, behavior, experience, plasticity, etc. Qualitative insight has been provided by clinical experiences into the association between particular types of injury and particular types of outcome. Their quantitative linkages, nevertheless, have yet to be created – neither in clinic nor in cellular physiological tests. This discrepancy is signiﬁcantly more prominent for individual child patients, which makes it very difﬁcult to estimate the efﬁcacy of treatment plans. In order to understand the consequence of injury and discover new treatments, it is necessary to create a modeling toolset with certain design guidelines, such that child neurological diseases can be quantitatively analyzed. Perhaps more than any other organ, the brain necessarily operates on multiple spatial and temporal scales. On the one hand, it is the neurons that perform fundamental computations, but neurons have to interact with large-scale organs (ears, eyes, skeletal muscles, etc.) to achieve global functions. This multi-scale nature worths more attention in injuries, where the overall deﬁcits depend on both the cellular effects of injuries and the propagated consequences. On the other hand, neural processes in developmental diseases usually operate on drastically different time scales, e.g. spinal reﬂex in milliseconds versus learning in years. Thus when studying motor nervous systems, mathematical modeling is convincing only if it can provide multi-scale details, ranging from neuron spikes to limb biomechanics; also the models should be evaluated with time granularity as small as 1 millisecond, meanwhile the evaluation needs to continue trillions of cycles in order to cover years of life. It is particularly challenging to describe the multi-scale nature of human nervous system when modeling childhood movement disorders. Note that for a child who suffered brain injury at birth, the full development of all motor symptoms may easily take more than 10 years. Therefore the millisecondbased model needs to be evaluated signiﬁcantly faster than real-time, otherwise the model will fail to produce any useful predictions in time. We have implemented realistic models for spiking motoneurons, sensory neurons, neural circuitry, muscle ﬁbers and proprioceptors using VLSI and programmable logic technologies. All models are computed in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware in 365 times real-time. Therefore one year of disease progression can be assessed after one day of emulation. This paper presents the methodology of building the emulation platform. The results demonstrate that our platform is capable of producing physiologically realistic multi-scale signals, which are usually scarce in experiments. Successful emulations enabled by this platform will be used to verify theories of neuropathology. New treatment mechanisms and drug effects can also be emulated before animal experiments or clinical trials. 2 Methodology of multi-scale neural emulation A. Human arm B. Monosynaptic spinal loop C. Inner structure of muscle spindle Gamma Secondary dynamic Gamma output input static Primary input output Bag 1 αMN Bag 2 Chain Figure 1: Illustration of the multi-scale nature of motor nervous system. The motor part of human nervous system is responsible for maintaining body postures and generating voluntary movements. The multi-scale nature of motor nervous system is demonstrated in Fig.1. When the elbow (Fig.1A) is maintaining a posture or performing a movement, a force is established by the involved muscle based on how much spiking excitation the muscle receives from its αmotoneurons (Fig.1B). The α-motoneurons are regulated by a variety of sensory input, part of which comes directly from the proprioceptors in the muscle. As the primary proprioceptor found in skeletal muscles, a muscle spindle is another complex system that has its own microscopic Multiple-InputMultiple-Output structure (Fig.1C). Spindles continuously provide information about the length and lengthening speed of the muscle ﬁber. A muscle with its regulating motoneurons, sensory neurons and proprioceptors constitutes a monosynaptic spinal loop. This minimalist neurophysiological 2 structure is used as an example for explaining the multi-scale hyper-time emulation in hardware. Additional structures can be added to the backbone set-up using similar methodologies. 2.1 Modularized architecture for multi-scale models Decades of studies on neurophysiology provided an abundance of models characterizing different components of the human motor nervous system. The informational characteristics of physiological components allowed us to model them as functional structures, i.e. each of which converting input signals to certain outputs. In particular, within a monosynaptic spinal loop illustrated in Fig.1B, stretching the muscle will elicit a chain of physiological activities in: muscle stretch ⇒ spindle ⇒ sensory neuron ⇒ synapse ⇒ motoneuron ⇒ muscle contraction. The adjacent components must have compatible interfaces, and the interfacing variables must also be physiologically realistic. In our design, each component is mathematically described in Table 1: Table 1: Functional deﬁnition of neural models COMPONENT Neuron Synapse Muscle Spindle MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION S(t) = fneuron (I, t) I(t) = fsynapse (S, t) ˙ T (t) = fmuscle (S, L, L, t) ˙ Γdynamic , Γstatic , t) A(t) = fspindle (L, L, all components are modeled as black-box functions that map the inputs to the outputs. The meanings of these mathematical deﬁnitions are explained below. This design allows existing physiological models to be easily inserted and switched. In all models the input signals are time-varying, e.g. I = I(t), L = L(t) , etc. The argument of t in input signals are omitted throughout this paper. 2.2 Selection of models for emulation Models were selected in consideration of their computational cost, physiological verisimilitude, and whether it can be adapted to the mathematical form deﬁned in Table 1. Model of Neuron The informational process for a neuron is to take post-synaptic current I as the input, and produce a binary spike train S in the output. The neuron model adopted in the emulation was developed by Izhikevich [1]: = 0.04v 2 + 5v + 140 − u + I = a(bv − u) v u (1) (2) if v = 30 mV, then v ← c, u ← u + d where a, b, c, d are free parameters tuned to achieve certain ﬁring patterns. Membrane potential v directly determines a binary spike train S(t) that S(t) = 1 if v ≥ 30, otherwise S(t) = 0. Note that v in Izhikevich model is in millivolts and time t is in milliseconds. Therefore the coefﬁcients in eq.1 need to be adjusted in correspondence to SI units. Model of Synapse When a pre-synaptic neuron spikes, i.e. S(0) = 1, an excitatory synapse subsequently issues an Excitatory Post-Synaptic Current (EPSC) that drives the post-synaptic neuron. Neural recording of hair cells in rats [2] provided evidence that the time proﬁle of EPSC can be well characterized using the equations below: I(t) = Vm × e t d Vm −τ 0 t − e− τr Vm if t ≥ 0 (3) otherwise The key parameters in a synapse model is the time constants for rising (τr ) and decaying (τd ). In our emulation τr = 0.001 s and τr = 0.003 s. 3 Model of Muscle force and electromyograph (EMG) The primary effect of skeletal muscle is to convert α-motoneuron spikes S into force T , depending ˙ on the muscle’s instantaneous length L and lengthening speed L. We used Hill’s muscle model in the emulation with parameter tuning described in [3]. Another measurable output of muscle is electromyograph (EMG). EMG is the small skin current polarized by motor unit action potential (MUAP) when it travels along muscle ﬁbers. Models exist to describe the typical waveform picked by surface EMG electrodes. In this project we chose to implement the one described in [4]. Model of Proprioceptor Spindle is a sensory organ that provides the main source of proprioceptive information. As can be seen in Fig.1C, a spindle typically produces two afferent outputs (primary Ia and secondary II) ˙ according to its gamma fusimotor drives (Γdynamic and Γstatic ) and muscle states (L and L). There is currently no closed-form models describing spindle functions due to spindle’s signiﬁcant nonlinearity. On representative model that numerically approximates the spindle dynamics was developed by Mileusnic et al. [5]. The model used differential equations to characterize a typical cat soleus spindle. Eqs.4-10 present a subset of this model for one type of spindle ﬁber (bag1): Γdynamic − x0 /τ Γdynamic + Ω2 bag1 x0 ˙ = x1 ˙ = x2 1 = [TSR − TB − TP R − Γ1 x0 ] M x2 ˙ (4) (5) (6) where TSR TB TP R CSS = KSR (L − x1 − LSR0 ) (7) 0.3 = (B0 + B1 x0 ) · (x1 − R) · CSS · |x2 | = KP R (x1 − LP R0 ) 2 = −1 −1000x2 1+e (8) (9) (10) Eq.8 and 10 suggest that evaluating the spindle model requires multiplication, division as well as more complex arithmetics like polynomials and exponentials. The implementation details are described in Section 3. 2.3 Neuron connectivity with sparse interconnections Although the number of spinal neurons (~1 billion) is signiﬁcantly less compared to that of cortical neurons (~100 billion), a fully connected spinal network still means approximately 2 trillion synaptic endings [6]. Implementing such a huge number of synapses imposes a major challenge, if not impossible, given limited hardware resource. In this platform we approximated the neural connectivity by sparsely connecting sensory neurons to motoneurons as parallel pathways. We do not attempt to introduce the full connectivity. The rationale is that in a neural control system, the effect of a single neuron can be considered as mapping current state x to change in state x through a band-limited channel. Therefore when a collection of ˙ neurons are ﬁring stochastically, the probability of x depends on both x and the ﬁring behavior s ˙ (s = 1 when spiking, otherwise s = 0) of each neuron, as such: p(x|x, s) = p(x|s = 1)p(s = 1|x) + p(x|s = 0)p(s = 0|x) ˙ ˙ ˙ (11) Eq.11 is a master equation that determines a probability ﬂow on the state. From the Kramers-Moyal expansion we can associate this probability ﬂow with a partial differential equation: ∂ p(x, t) ∂t ∞ − = i=1 ∂ ∂x i D(i) (x)p(x, t) (12) where D(i) (x) is a time-invariant term that modiﬁes the change of probability density based on its i-th gradient. 4 Under certain conditions [7, 8], D(i) (x) for i > 2 all vanish and therefore the probability ﬂow can be described deterministically using a linear operator L: ∂ ∂ ∂ 2 (2) D (x) p(x, t) = Lp(x, t) (13) p(x, t) = − D(1) (x) + ∂t ∂x ∂x2 This means that various Ls can be superimposed to achieve complex system dynamics (illustrated in Fig.2A). B. Equivalent network with sparse interconnections A. Neuron function as superimposed linear operators SN Sensory Input + SN SN SN αMN αMN αMN Motor Output αMN Figure 2: Functions of neuron population can be described as the combination of linear operators (A). Therefore the original neural function can be equivalently produced by sparsely connected neurons formalizing parallel pathways (B). As a consequence, the statistical effect of two fully connected neuron populations is equivalent to ones that are only sparsely connected, as long as the probability ﬂow can be described by the same L. For a movement task, in particular, it is the statistical effect from the neuron ensemble onto skeletal muscles that determines the global behavior. Therefore we argue that it is feasible to approximate the spinal cord connectivity by sparsely interconnecting sensory and motor neurons (Fig.2B). Here a pool of homogenous sensory neurons projects to another pool of homogeneous α-motoneurons. Pseudorandom noise is added to the input of all homogeneous neurons within a population. It is worth noting that this approximation signiﬁcantly reduces the number of synapses that need to be implemented in hardware. 3 Hardware implementation on FPGA We select FPGA as the implementation device due to its inherent parallelism that resembles the nervous system. FPGA is favored over GPU or clustered CPUs because it is relatively easy to network hundreds of nodes under ﬂexible protocols. The platform is distributed on multiple nodes of Xilinx Spartan-6 devices. The interfacing among FPGAs and computers is created using OpalKelly development board XEM6010. The dynamic range of variables is tight in models of Izhikevich neuron, synapse and EMG. This helps maintaining the accuracy of models even when they are evaluated in 32-bit ﬁxed-point arithmetics. The spindle model, in contrast, requires ﬂoating-point arithmetics due to its wide dynamic range and complex calculations (see eq.4-10). Hyper-time computations with ﬂoating-point numbers are resource consuming and therefore need to be implemented with special attentions. 3.1 Floating-point arithmetics in combinational logic Our arithmetic implementations are compatible with IEEE-754 standard. Typical ﬂoating-point arithmetic IP cores are either pipe-lined or based on iterative algorithms such as CORDIC, all of which require clocks to schedule the calculation. In our platform, no clock is provided for model evaluations thus all arithmetics need to be executed in pure combinational logic. Taking advantage of combinational logic allows all model evaluations to be 1) fast, the evaluation time depends entirely on the propagating and settling time of signals, which is on the order of microseconds, and 2) parallel, each model is evaluated on its own circuit without waiting for any other results. Our implementations of adder and multiplier are inspired by the open source project “Free FloatingPoint Madness”, available at http://www.hmc.edu/chips/. Please contact the authors of this paper if the modiﬁed code is needed. 5 Fast combinational ﬂoating-point division Floating-point division is even more resource demanding than multiplications. We avoided directly implementing the dividing algorithm by approximating it with additions and multiplications. Our approach is inspired by an algorithm described in [9], which provides a good approximation of the inverse square root for any positive number x within one Newton-Raphson iteration: 1 x Q(x) = √ ≈ x(1.5 − · x2 ) 2 x (x > 0) (14) Q(x) can be implemented only using ﬂoating-point adders and multipliers. Thereby any division with a positive divisor can be achieved if two blocks of Q(x) are concatenated: a a (15) = √ √ = a · Q(b) · Q(b) (b > 0) b b· b This algorithm has been adjusted to also work with negative divisors (b < 0). Numerical integrators for differential equations Evaluating the instantaneous states of differential equation models require a ﬁxed-step numerical integrator. Backward Euler’s Method was chosen to balance the numerical error and FPGA usage: x ˙ xn+1 = f (x, t) = xn + T f (xn+1 , tn+1 ) (16) (17) where T is the sampling interval. f (x, t) is the derivative function for state variable x. 3.2 Asynchronous spike-based communication between FPGA chips Clock Spike clean count Counter 1 1 2 1 2 3 Figure 3: Timing diagram of asynchronous spike-based communication FPGA nodes are networked by transferring 1-bit binary spikes to each other. Our design allowed the sender and the receiver to operate on independent clocks without having to synchronize. The timing diagram of the spike-based communication is shown in Fig.3. The sender issues Spike with a pulse width of 1/(365 × Femu ) second. Each Spike then triggers a counting event on the receiver, meanwhile each Clock ﬁrst reads the accumulated spike count and subsequently cleans the counter. Note that the phase difference between Spike and Clock is not predictable due to asynchronicity. 3.3 Serialize neuron evaluations within a homogeneous population Different neuron populations are instantiated as standalone circuits. Within in each population, however, homogeneous neurons mentioned in Section 2.3 are evaluated in series in order to optimize FPGA usage. Within each FPGA node all modules operate with a central clock, which is the only source allowed to trigger any updating event. Therefore the maximal number of neurons that can be serialized (Nserial ) is restrained by the following relationship: Ffpga = C × Nserial × 365 × Femu (18) Here Ffpga is the fastest clock rate that a FPGA can operate on; C = 4 is the minimal clock cycles needed for updating each state variable in the on-chip memory; Femu = 1 kHz is the time granularity of emulation (1 millisecond), and 365 × Femu represents 365x real-time. Consider that Xilinx 6 Spartan-6 FPGA devices peaks at 200MHz central clock frequency, the theoretical maximum of neurons that can be serialized is Nserial 200 MHz/(4 × 365 × 1 kHz) ≈ 137 (19) In the current design we choose Nserial = 128. 4 Results: emulated activities of motor nervous system Figure 4 shows the implemented monosynaptic spinal loop in schematics and in operation. Each FPGA node is able to emulate monosynaptic spinal loops consisting of 1,024 sensory and 1,024 motor neurons, i.e. 2,048 neurons in total. The spike-based asynchronous communication is successful between two FPGA nodes. Note that the emulation has to be signiﬁcantly slowed down for on-line plotting. When the emulation is at full speed (365x real-time) the software front-end is not able to visualize the signals due to limited data throughput. 128 SNs 128 αMNs SN αMN 128 SNs 128 αMNs SN αMN ... 8 parallel pathways 2,048 neurons Figure 4: The neural emulation platform in operation. Left: Neural circuits implemented for each FPGA node including 2,048 neurons. SN = Sensory Neuron; αMN = α-motoneuron. Center: One working FPGA node. Right: Two FPGA nodes networked using asynchronous spiking protocol. The emulation platform successfully created multi-scale information when the muscle is externally stretched (Fig.5A). We also tested if our emulated motor system is able to produce the recruitment order and size principles observed in real physiological data. It has been well known that when a voluntary motor command is sent to the α-motoneuron pool, the motor units are recruited in an order that small ones get recruited ﬁrst, followed by the big ones [10]. The comparison between our results and real data are shown in Fig.5B, where the top panel shows 20 motor unit activities emulated using our platform, and the bottom panel shows decoded motor unit activities from real human EMG [11]. No qualitative difference was found. 5 Discussion and future work We designed a hardware platform for emulating the multi-scale motor nervous activities in hypertime. We managed to use one node of single Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA to emulate monosynaptic spinal loops consisting of 2,048 neurons, associated muscles and proprioceptors. The neurons are organized as parallel pathways with sparse interconnections. The emulation is successfully accelerated to 365x real-time. The platform can be scaled by networking multiple FPGA nodes, which is enabled by an asynchronous spike-based communication protocol. The emulated monosynaptic spinal loops are capable of producing reﬂex-like activities in response to muscle stretch. Our results of motor unit recruitment order are compatible with the physiological data collected in real human subjects. There is a question of whether this stochastic system turns out chaotic, especially with accumulated errors from Backward Euler’s integrator. Note that the ﬁring property of a neuron population is usually stable even with explicit noise [8], and spindle inputs are measured from real robots so the integrator errors are corrected at every iteration. To our knowledge, the system is not critically sensitive to the initial conditions or integrator errors. This question, however, is both interesting and important for in-depth investigations in the future. 7 It has been shown [12] that replicating classic types of spinal interneurons (propriospinal, Iaexcitatory, Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw, etc.) is sufﬁcient to produce stabilizing responses and rapid reaching movement in a wrist. Our platform will introduce those interneurons to describe the known spinal circuitry in further details. Physiological models will also be reﬁned as needed. For the purpose of modeling movement behavior or diseases, Izhikevich model is a good balance between verisimilitude and computational cost. Nevertheless when testing drug effects along disease progression, neuron models are expected to cover sufﬁcient molecular details including how neurotransmitters affect various ion channels. With the advancing of programmable semiconductor technology, it is expected to upgrade our neuron model to Hodgkin-Huxley’s. For the muscle models, Hill’s type of model does not ﬁt the muscle properties accurately enough when the muscle is being shortened. Alternative models will be tested. Other studies showed that the functional dexterity of human limbs – especially in the hands – is critically enabled by the tendon conﬁgurations and joint geometry [13]. As a result, if our platform is used to understand whether known neurophysiology and biomechanics are sufﬁcient to produce able and pathological movements, it will be necessary to use this platform to control human-like limbs. Since the emulation speed can be ﬂexibly adjusted from arbitrarily slow to 365x real-time, when speeded to exactly 1x real-time the platform will function as a digital controller with 1kHz refresh rate. The main purpose of the emulation is to learn how certain motor disorders progress during childhood development. This ﬁrst requires the platform to reproduce motor symptoms that are compatible with clinical observations. For example it has been suggested that muscle spasticity in rats is associated with decreased soma size of α-motoneurons [14], which presumably reduced the ﬁring threshold of neurons. Thus when lower ﬁring threshold is introduced to the emulated motoneuron pool, similar EMG patterns as in [15] should be observed. It is also necessary for the symptoms to evolve with neural plasticity. In the current version we presume that the structure of each component remains time invariant. In the future work Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) will be introduced such that all components are subject to temporal modiﬁcations. B. Verify motor unit recruitment pattern A.

<p>Author: Hiroki Terashima, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: The computational modelling of the primary auditory cortex (A1) has been less fruitful than that of the primary visual cortex (V1) due to the less organized properties of A1. Greater disorder has recently been demonstrated for the tonotopy of A1 that has traditionally been considered to be as ordered as the retinotopy of V1. This disorder appears to be incongruous, given the uniformity of the neocortex; however, we hypothesized that both A1 and V1 would adopt an efﬁcient coding strategy and that the disorder in A1 reﬂects natural sound statistics. To provide a computational model of the tonotopic disorder in A1, we used a model that was originally proposed for the smooth V1 map. In contrast to natural images, natural sounds exhibit distant correlations, which were learned and reﬂected in the disordered map. The auditory model predicted harmonic relationships among neighbouring A1 cells; furthermore, the same mechanism used to model V1 complex cells reproduced nonlinear responses similar to the pitch selectivity. These results contribute to the understanding of the sensory cortices of different modalities in a novel and integrated manner.</p><p>2 0.78913522 <a title="321-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_estimation_of_discrete_entropy_with_mixtures_of_stick-breaking_priors.html">57 nips-2012-Bayesian estimation of discrete entropy with mixtures of stick-breaking priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Shannon’s entropy H in the under-sampled regime, where the number of possible symbols may be unknown or countably inﬁnite. Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes provide tractable prior distributions over the space of countably inﬁnite discrete distributions, and have found major applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that they provide natural priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the analytic tractability of the moments of the induced posterior distribution over entropy H. We derive formulas for the posterior mean and variance of H given data. However, we show that a ﬁxed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior on H, meaning the prior strongly determines the estimate in the under-sampled regime. We therefore deﬁne a family of continuous mixing measures such that the resulting mixture of Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor processes produces an approximately ﬂat prior over H. We explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators and show that they perform well on data sampled from both exponential and power-law tailed distributions. 1</p><p>3 0.78732586 <a title="321-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-High-Order_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning_to_Identify_Longitudinal_Phenotypic_Markers_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_Progression_Prediction.html">151 nips-2012-High-Order Multi-Task Feature Learning to Identify Longitudinal Phenotypic Markers for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang, Jingwen Yan, Sungeun Kim, Shannon Risacher, Andrew Saykin, Li Shen</p><p>Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in imaging and cognitive data by structured sparsity-inducing norms. The sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of imaging measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The empirical studies, using the longitudinal imaging and cognitive data of the ADNI cohort, have yielded promising results.</p><p>4 0.78708482 <a title="321-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_from_the_Wisdom_of_Crowds_by_Minimax_Entropy.html">189 nips-2012-Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Sumit Basu, Yi Mao, John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: An important way to make large training sets is to gather noisy labels from crowds of nonexperts. We propose a minimax entropy principle to improve the quality of these labels. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over workers, items, and labels. By maximizing the entropy of this distribution, the method naturally infers item confusability and worker expertise. We infer the ground truth by minimizing the entropy of this distribution, which we show minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distribution and the unknown truth. We show that a simple coordinate descent scheme can optimize minimax entropy. Empirically, our results are substantially better than previously published methods for the same problem. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.78626883 <a title="321-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Spectral_learning_of_linear_dynamics_from_generalised-linear_observations_with_application_to_neural_population_data.html">321 nips-2012-Spectral learning of linear dynamics from generalised-linear observations with application to neural population data</a></p>
<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Maneesh Sahani, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for instance when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons. Here, we show how spectral learning methods (usually called subspace identiﬁcation in this context) for linear systems with linear-Gaussian observations can be extended to estimate the parameters of a generalised-linear dynamical system model despite a non-linear and non-Gaussian observation process. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.</p><p>6 0.78604835 <a title="321-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Fully_Bayesian_inference_for_neural_models_with_negative-binomial_spiking.html">138 nips-2012-Fully Bayesian inference for neural models with negative-binomial spiking</a></p>

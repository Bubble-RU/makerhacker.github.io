<p>Author: S. D. Babacan, Shinichi Nakajima, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering data points into lowdimensional subspaces in the presence of outliers. We pose the problem using a density estimation formulation with an associated generative model. Based on this probability model, we ﬁrst develop an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and then derive its global solution. In addition, we develop two Bayesian methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) approximation, which are capable of automatic dimensionality selection. While the ﬁrst method is based on an alternating optimization scheme for all unknowns, the second method makes use of recent results in VB matrix factorization leading to fast and effective estimation. Both methods are extended to handle sparse outliers for robustness and can handle missing values. Experimental results suggest that proposed methods are very effective in subspace clustering and identifying outliers. 1</p><p>3 0.07134714 <a title="268-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Compressive_Sensing_MRI_with_Wavelet_Tree_Sparsity.html">78 nips-2012-Compressive Sensing MRI with Wavelet Tree Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Chen, Junzhou Huang</p><p>Abstract: In Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI), one can reconstruct a MR image with good quality from only a small number of measurements. This can signiﬁcantly reduce MR scanning time. According to structured sparsity theory, the measurements can be further reduced to O(K + log n) for tree-sparse data instead of O(K + K log n) for standard K-sparse data with length n. However, few of existing algorithms have utilized this for CS-MRI, while most of them model the problem with total variation and wavelet sparse regularization. On the other side, some algorithms have been proposed for tree sparse regularization, but few of them have validated the beneﬁt of wavelet tree structure in CS-MRI. In this paper, we propose a fast convex optimization algorithm to improve CS-MRI. Wavelet sparsity, gradient sparsity and tree sparsity are all considered in our model for real MR images. The original complex problem is decomposed into three simpler subproblems then each of the subproblems can be efﬁciently solved with an iterative scheme. Numerous experiments have been conducted and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI algorithms, and gain better reconstructions results on real MR images than general tree based solvers or algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.055371732 <a title="268-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Complex_Inference_in_Neural_Circuits_with_Probabilistic_Population_Codes_and_Topic_Models.html">77 nips-2012-Complex Inference in Neural Circuits with Probabilistic Population Codes and Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeff Beck, Alexandre Pouget, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that humans and animals typically reason probabilistically about their environment. This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efﬁcient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be naturally implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identiﬁcation of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classiﬁcation, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb’s rule and describe an extension of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes. 1 Introduction to Probabilistic Inference in Cortex Probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning provides a coherent and, in many ways, optimal framework for dealing with complex problems in an uncertain world. It is, therefore, somewhat reassuring that behavioural experiments reliably demonstrate that humans and animals behave in a manner consistent with optimal probabilistic reasoning when performing a wide variety of perceptual [1, 2, 3], motor [4, 5, 6], and cognitive tasks[7]. This remarkable ability requires a neural code that represents probability distribution functions of task relevant stimuli rather than just single values. While there 1 are many ways to represent functions, Bayes rule tells us that when it comes to probability distribution functions, there is only one statistically optimal way to do it. More precisely, Bayes Rule states that any pattern of activity, r, that efﬁciently represents a probability distribution over some task relevant quantity s, must satisfy the relationship p(s|r) ∝ p(r|s)p(s), where p(r|s) is the stimulus conditioned likelihood function that speciﬁes the form of neural variability, p(s) gives the prior belief regarding the stimulus, and p(s|r) gives the posterior distribution over values of the stimulus, s given the representation r . Of course, it is unlikely that the nervous system consistently achieves this level of optimality. None-the-less, Bayes rule suggests the existence of a link between neural variability as characterized by the likelihood function p(r|s) and the state of belief of a mature statistical learning machine such as the brain. The so called Probabilistic Population Coding (or PPC) framework[8, 9, 10] takes this link seriously by proposing that the function encoded by a pattern of neural activity r is, in fact, the likelihood function p(r|s). When this is the case, the precise form of the neural variability informs the nature of the neural code. For example, the exponential family of statistical models with linear sufﬁcient statistics has been shown to be ﬂexible enough to model the ﬁrst and second order statistics of in vivo recordings in awake behaving monkeys[9, 11, 12] and anesthetized cats[13]. When the likelihood function is modeled in this way, the log posterior probability over the stimulus is linearly encoded by neural activity, i.e. log p(s|r) = h(s) · r − log Z(r) (1) Here, the stimulus dependent kernel, h(s), is a vector of functions of s, the dot represents a standard dot product, and Z(r) is the partition function which serves to normalize the posterior. This log linear form for a posterior distribution is highly computationally convenient and allows for evidence integration to be implemented via linear operations on neural activity[14, 8]. Proponents of this kind of linear PPC have demonstrated how to build biologically plausible neural networks capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference that are needed to optimally perform the behavioural tasks listed above. This includes, linear PPC implementations of cue combination[8], evidence integration over time, maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior estimation[9], coordinate transformation/auditory localization[10], object tracking/Kalman ﬁltering[10], explaining away[10], and visual search[15]. Moreover, each of these neural computations has required only a single recurrently connected layer of neurons that is capable of just two non-linear operations: coincidence detection and divisive normalization, both of which are widely observed in cortex[16, 17]. Unfortunately, this research program has been a piecemeal effort that has largely proceeded by building neural networks designed deal with particular problems. As a result, there have been no proposals for a general principle by which neural network implementations of linear PPCs might be generated and no suggestions regarding how to deal with complex (intractable) problems of probabilistic inference. In this work, we will partially address this short coming by showing that Variation Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm provides a general scheme for approximate inference and learning with linear PPCs. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the VBEM algorithm and show how it naturally leads to a linear PPC representation of the posterior as well as constraints on the neural network dynamics which build that PPC representation. Because this section describes the VB-PPC approach rather abstractly, the remainder of the paper is dedicated to concrete applications. As a motivating example, we consider the problem of inferring the concentrations of odors in an olfactory scene from a complex pattern of spikes in a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In section 3, we argue that this requires solving a spike pattern demixing problem which is indicative of the generic problem faced by many layers of cortex. We then show that this demixing problem is equivalent to the problem addressed by a class of models for text documents know as probabilistic topic models, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA[18]. In section 4, we apply the VB-PPC approach to build a neural network implementation of probabilistic inference and learning for LDA. This derivation shows that causal inference with linear PPC’s also critically relies on divisive normalization. This result suggests that this particular non-linearity may be involved in very general and fundamental probabilistic computation, rather than simply playing a role in gain modulation. In this section, we also show how this formulation allows for a probabilistic treatment of learning and show that a simple variation of Hebb’s rule can implement Bayesian learning in neural circuits. 2 We conclude this work by generalizing this approach to time varying inputs by introducing the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) which can infer short term ﬂuctuations in the concentrations of individual topics/odors and can be used to model foraging and other tracking tasks. 2 Variational Bayesian Inference with linear Probabilistic Population Codes Variational Bayesian (VB) inference refers to a class of deterministic methods for approximating the intractable integrals which arise in the context of probabilistic reasoning. Properly implemented it can result a fast alternative to sampling based methods of inference such as MCMC[19] sampling. Generically, the goal of any Bayesian inference algorithm is to infer a posterior distribution over behaviourally relevant latent variables Z given observations X and a generative model which speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Θ, Z). This task is confounded by the fact that the generative model includes latent parameters Θ which must be marginalized out, i.e. we wish to compute, p(Z|X) ∝ p(X, Θ, Z)dΘ (2) When the number of latent parameters is large this integral can be quite unwieldy. The VB algorithms simplify this marginalization by approximating the complex joint distribution over behaviourally relevant latents and parameters, p(Θ, Z|X), with a distribution q(Θ, Z) for which integrals of this form are easier to deal with in some sense. There is some art to choosing the particular form for the approximating distribution to make the above integral tractable, however, a factorized approximation is common, i.e. q(Θ, Z) = qΘ (Θ)qZ (Z). Regardless, for any given observation X, the approximate posterior is found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Θ, Z) and p(Θ, Z|X). When a factorized posterior is assumed, the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm ﬁnds a local minimum of the KL divergence by iteratively updating, qΘ (Θ) and qZ (Z) according to the scheme n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qZ (Z) and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qΘ (Θ) (3) Here the brackets indicate an expected value taken with respect to the subscripted probability distribution function and the tilde indicates equality up to a constant which is independent of Θ and Z. The key property to note here is that the approximate posterior which results from this procedure is in an exponential family form and is therefore representable by a linear PPC (Eq. 1). This feature allows for the straightforward construction of networks which implement the VBEM algorithm with linear PPC’s in the following way. If rn and rn are patterns of activity that use a linear PPC representation Θ Z of the relevant posteriors, then n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ hΘ (Θ) · rn Θ and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ hZ (Z) · rn+1 . Z (4) Here the stimulus dependent kernels hZ (Z) and hΘ (Θ) are chosen so that their outer product results in a basis that spans the function space on Z × Θ given by log p(X, Θ, Z) for every X. This choice guarantees that there exist functions fΘ (X, rn ) and fZ (X, rn ) such that Z Θ rn = fΘ (X, rn ) Θ Z and rn+1 = fZ (X, rn ) Θ Z (5) satisfy Eq. 3. When this is the case, simply iterating the discrete dynamical system described by Eq. 5 until convergence will ﬁnd the VBEM approximation to the posterior. This is one way to build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm. However, its not the only way. In general, any dynamical system which has stable ﬁxed points in common with Eq. 5 can also be said to implement the VBEM algorithm. In the example below we will take advantage of this ﬂexibility in order to build biologically plausible neural network implementations. 3 Response! to Mixture ! of Odors! Single	  Odor	  Response	  Cause Intensity	  Figure 1: (Left) Each cause (e.g. coffee) in isolation results in a pattern of neural activity (top). When multiple causes contribute to a scene this results in an overall pattern of neural activity which is a mixture of these patterns weighted by the intensities (bottom). (Right) The resulting pattern can be represented by a raster, where each spike is colored by its corresponding latent cause. 3 Probabilistic Topic Models for Spike Train Demixing Consider the problem of odor identiﬁcation depicted in Fig. 1. A typical mammalian olfactory system consists of a few hundred different types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), each of which responds to a wide range of volatile chemicals. This results in a highly distributed code for each odor. Since, a typical olfactory scene consists of many different odors at different concentrations, the pattern of ORN spike trains represents a complex mixture. Described in this way, it is easy to see that the problem faced by early olfactory cortex can be described as the task of demixing spike trains to infer latent causes (odor intensities). In many ways this olfactory problem is a generic problem faced by each cortical layer as it tries to make sense of the activity of the neurons in the layer below. The input patterns of activity consist of spikes (or spike counts) labeled by the axons which deliver them and summarized by a histogram which indicates how many spikes come from each input neuron. Of course, just because a spike came from a particular neuron does not mean that it had a particular cause, just as any particular ORN spike could have been caused by any one of a large number of volatile chemicals. Like olfactory codes, cortical codes are often distributed and multiple latent causes can be present at the same time. Regardless, this spike or histogram demixing problem is formally equivalent to a class of demixing problems which arise in the context of probabilistic topic models used for document modeling. A simple but successful example of this kind of topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [18]. LDA assumes that word order in documents is irrelevant and, therefore, models documents as histograms of word counts. It also assumes that there are K topics and that each of these topics appears in different proportions in each document, e.g. 80% of the words in a document might be concerned with coffee and 20% with strawberries. Words from a given topic are themselves drawn from a distribution over words associated with that topic, e.g. when talking about coffee you have a 5% chance of using the word ’bitter’. The goal of LDA is to infer both the distribution over topics discussed in each document and the distribution of words associated with each topic. We can map the generative model for LDA onto the task of spike demixing in cortex by letting topics become latent causes or odors, words become neurons, word occurrences become spikes, word distributions associated with each topic become patterns of neural activity associated with each cause, and different documents become the observed patterns of neural activity on different trials. This equivalence is made explicit in Fig. 2 which describes the standard generative model for LDA applied to documents on the left and mixtures of spikes on the right. 4 LDA Inference and Network Implementation In this section we will apply the VB-PPC formulation to build a biologically plausible network capable of approximating probabilistic inference for spike pattern demixing. For simplicity, we will use the equivalent Gamma-Poisson formulation of LDA which directly models word and topic counts 4 1. For each topic k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Distribution over words βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For document d = 1, . . . , D, (a) Distribution over topics θd ∼ Dirichlet(α0 ) (b) For word m = 1, . . . , Ωd i.

Neuron assignment ωd,m ∼ Multinomial(βzm ) Figure 2: (Left) The LDA generative model in the context of document modeling.

Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne, Rd,j to be the number of times neuron j ﬁres during trial d. Similarly, we let Nd,j,k to be the number of times a spike in neuron j comes from cause k in trial d. These new variables play the roles of the cause and neuron assignment variables, zd,m and ωd,m by simply counting them up. If we let cd,k be an un-normalized intensity of cause j such that θd,k = cd,k / k cd,k then the generative model, Rd,j = k Nd,j,k Nd,j,k ∼ Poisson(βj,k cd,k ) 0 cd,k ∼ Gamma(αk , C −1 ). (6) is equivalent to the topic models described above. Here the parameter C is a scale parameter which sets the expected total number of spikes from the population on each trial. Note that, the problem of inferring the wj,k and cd,k is a non-negative matrix factorization problem similar to that considered by Lee and Seung[20]. The primary difference is that, here, we are attempting to infer a probability distribution over these quantities rather than maximum likelihood estimates. See supplement for details. Following the prescription laid out in section 2, we approximate the posterior over latent variables given a set of input patterns, Rd , d = 1, . . . , D, with a factorized distribution of the form, qN (N)qc (c)qβ (β). This results in marginal posterior distributions q (β:,k |η:,k ), q cd,k |αd,k , C −1 + 1 ), and q (Nd,j,: | log pd,j,: , Rd,i ) which are Dirichlet, Gamma, and Multinomial respectively. Here, the parameters η:,k , αd,k , and log pd,j,: are the natural parameters of these distributions. The VBEM update algorithm yields update rules for these parameters which are summarized in Fig. 3 Algorithm1. Algorithm 1: Batch VB updates 1: while ηj,k not converged do 2: for d = 1, · · · , D do 3: while pd,j,k , αd,k not converged do 4: αd,k → α0 + j Rd,j pd,j,k 5: pd,j,k → Algorithm 2: Online VB updates 1: for d = 1, · · · , D do 2: reinitialize pj,k , αk ∀j, k 3: while pj,k , αk not converged do 4: αk → α0 + j Rd,j pj,k 5: pj,k → exp (ψ(ηj,k )−ψ(¯k )) exp ψ(αk ) η η i exp (ψ(ηj,i )−ψ(¯i )) exp ψ(αi ) exp (ψ(ηj,k )−ψ(¯k )) exp ψ(αd,k ) η η i exp (ψ(ηj,i )−ψ(¯i )) exp ψ(αd,i ) 6: end while 7: end for 8: ηj,k = η 0 + 9: end while end while ηj,k → (1 − dt)ηj,k + dt(η 0 + Rd,j pj,k ) 8: end for 6: 7: d Rd,j pd,j,k Figure 3: Here ηk = j ηj,k and ψ(x) is the digamma function so that exp ψ(x) is a smoothed ¯ threshold linear function. Before we move on to the neural network implementation, note that this standard formulation of variational inference for LDA utilizes a batch learning scheme that is not biologically plausible. Fortunately, an online version of this variational algorithm was recently proposed and shown to give 5 superior results when compared to the batch learning algorithm[21]. This algorithm replaces the sum over d in update equation for ηj,k with an incremental update based upon only the most recently observed pattern of spikes. See Fig. 3 Algorithm 2. 4.1 Neural Network Implementation Recall that the goal was to build a neural network that implements the VBEM algorithm for the underlying latent causes of a mixture of spikes using a neural code that represents the posterior distribution via a linear PPC. A linear PPC represents the natural parameters of a posterior distribution via a linear operation on neural activity. Since the primary quantity of interest here is the posterior distribution over odor concentrations, qc (c|α), this means that we need a pattern of activity rα which is linearly related to the αk ’s in the equations above. One way to accomplish this is to simply assume that the ﬁring rates of output neurons are equal to the positive valued αk parameters. Fig. 4 depicts the overall network architecture. Input patterns of activity, R, are transmitted to the synapses of a population of output neurons which represent the αk ’s. The output activity is pooled to ¯ form an un-normalized prediction of the activity of each input neuron, Rj , given the output layer’s current state of belief about the latent causes of the Rj . The activity at each synapse targeted by input neuron j is then inhibited divisively by this prediction. This results in a dendrite that reports to the ¯ soma a quantity, Nj,k , which represents the fraction of unexplained spikes from input neuron j that could be explained by latent cause k. A continuous time dynamical system with this feature and the property that it shares its ﬁxed points with the LDA algorithm is given by d ¯ Nj,k dt d αk dt ¯ ¯ = wj,k Rj − Rj Nj,k = (7) ¯ Nj,k exp (ψ (¯k )) (α0 − αk ) + exp (ψ (αk )) η (8) i ¯ where Rj = k wj,k exp (ψ (αk )), and wj,k = exp (ψ (ηj,k )). Note that, despite its form, it is Eq. 7 which implements the required divisive normalization operation since, in the steady state, ¯ ¯ Nj,k = wj,k Rj /Rj . Regardless, this network has a variety of interesting properties that align well with biology. It predicts that a balance of excitation and inhibition is maintained in the dendrites via divisive normalization and that the role of inhibitory neurons is to predict the input spikes which target individual dendrites. It also predicts superlinear facilitation. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal term on the right of Eq. 8 indicates that more active cells will be more sensitive to their dendritic inputs. Alternatively, this could be implemented via recurrent excitation at the population level. In either case, this is the mechanism by which the network implements a sparse prior on topic concentrations and stands in stark contrast to the winner take all mechanisms which rely on competitive mutual inhibition mechanisms. Additionally, the ηj in Eq. 8 represents a cell wide ’leak’ parameter that indicates that the total leak should be ¯ roughly proportional to the sum total weight of the synapses which drive the neuron. This predicts that cells that are highly sensitive to input should also decay back to baseline more quickly. This implementation also predicts Hebbian learning of synaptic weights. To observe this fact, note that the online update rule for the ηj,k parameters can be implemented by simply correlating the activity at ¯ each synapse, Nj,k with activity at the soma αj via the equation: τL d ¯ wj,k = exp (ψ (¯k )) (η0 − 1/2 − wj,k ) + Nj,k exp ψ (αk ) η dt (9) where τL is a long time constant for learning and we have used the fact that exp (ψ (ηjk )) ≈ ηjk −1/2 for x > 1. For a detailed derivation see the supplementary material. 5 Dynamic Document Model LDA is a rather simple generative model that makes several unrealistic assumptions about mixtures of sensory and cortical spikes.

This makes LDA a rather poor computational model for a task like olfactory foraging which requires the animal to track the rise a fall of odor intensities as it navigates its environment. We can model this more complicated task by replacing the static cause or odor intensity parameters with dynamic odor intensity parameters whose behavior is governed by an exponentiated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with drift and diffusion matrices given by (Λ and ΣD ). We call this variant of LDA the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) as it could be used to model smooth changes in the distribution of topics over the course of a single document. 5.1 DDM Model Thus the generative model for the DDM is as follows: 1. For latent cause k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Cause distribution over spikes βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For scene t = 1, . . . , T , (a) Log intensity of causes c(t) ∼ Normal(Λct−1 , ΣD ) (b) Number of spikes in neuron j resulting from cause k, Nj,k (t) ∼ Poisson(βj,k exp ck (t)) (c) Number of spikes in neuron j, Rj (t) = k Nj,k (t) This model bears many similarities to the Correlated and Dynamic topic models[22], but models dynamics over a short time scale, where the dynamic relationship (Λ, ΣD ) is important. 5.2 Network Implementation Once again the quantity of interest is the current distribution of latent causes, p(c(t)|R(τ ), τ = 0..T ). If no spikes occur then no evidence is presented and posterior inference over c(t) is simply given by an undriven Kalman ﬁlter with parameters (Λ, ΣD ). A recurrent neural network which uses a linear PPC to encode a posterior that evolves according to a Kalman ﬁlter has the property that neural responses are linearly related to the inverse covariance matrix of the posterior as well as that inverse covariance matrix times the posterior mean. In the absence of evidence, it is easy to show that these quantities must evolve according to recurrent dynamics which implement divisive normalization[10]. Thus, the patterns of neural activity which linearly encode them must do so as well. When a new spike arrives, optimal inference is no longer possible and a variational approximation must be utilized. As is shown in the supplement, this variational approximation is similar to the variational approximation used for LDA. As a result, a network which can divisively inhibit its synapses is able to implement approximate Bayesian inference. Curiously, this implies that the addition of spatial and temporal correlations to the latent causes adds very little complexity to the VB-PPC network implementation of probabilistic inference. All that is required is an additional inhibitory population which targets the somata in the output population.

Black shows true concentration, blue and red (indistinguishable) show MAP estimates for the network and VBEM algorithms. 6 Experimental Results We compared the PPC neural network implementations of the variational inference with the standard VBEM algorithm. This comparison is necessary because the two algorithms are not guaranteed to converge to the same solution due to the fact that we only required that the neural network dynamics have the same ﬁxed points as the standard VBEM algorithm. As a result, it is possible for the two algorithms to converge to different local minima of the KL divergence. For the network implementation of LDA we ﬁnd good agreement between the neural network and VBEM estimates of the natural parameters of the posterior. See Fig. 6(left) which shows the two algorithms estimates of the shape parameter of the posterior distribution over topic (odor) concentrations (a quantity which is proportional to the expected concentration). This agreement, however, is not perfect, especially when posterior predicted concentrations are low. In part, this is due to the fact we are presenting the network with difﬁcult inference problems for which the true posterior distribution over topics (odors) is highly correlated and multimodal. As a result, the objective function (KL divergence) is littered with local minima. Additionally, the discrete iterations of the VBEM algorithm can take very large steps in the space of natural parameters while the neural network implementation cannot. In contrast, the network implementation of the DDM is in much better agreement with the VBEM estimation. See Fig. 6(right). This is because the smooth temporal dynamics of the topics eliminate the need for the VBEM algorithm to take large steps. As a result, the smooth network dynamics are better able to accurately track the VBEM algorithms output. For simulation details please see the supplement. 7 Discussion and Conclusion In this work we presented a general framework for inference and learning with linear Probabilistic Population codes. This framework takes advantage of the fact that the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm generates approximate posterior distributions which are in an exponential family form. This is precisely the form needed in order to make probability distributions representable by a linear PPC. We then outlined a general means by which one can build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm using this kind of neural code. We applied this VB-PPC framework to generate a biologically plausible neural network for spike train demixing. We chose this problem because it has many of the features of the canonical problem faced by nearly every layer of cortex, i.e. that of inferring the latent causes of complex mixtures of spike trains in the layer below. Curiously, this very complicated problem of probabilistic inference and learning ended up having a remarkably simple network solution, requiring only that neurons be capable of implementing divisive normalization via dendritically targeted inhibition and superlinear facilitation. Moreover, we showed that extending this approach to the more complex dynamic case in which latent causes change in intensity over time does not substantially increase the complexity of the neural circuit. Finally, we would like to note that, while we utilized a rate coding scheme for our linear PPC, the basic equations would still apply to any spike based log probability codes such as that considered Beorlin and Deneve[23]. 8 References [1] Daniel Kersten, Pascal Mamassian, and Alan Yuille.

<p>Author: Peter Sollich, Simon Ashton</p><p>Abstract: We study the average case performance of multi-task Gaussian process (GP) regression as captured in the learning curve, i.e. the average Bayes error for a chosen task versus the total number of examples n for all tasks. For GP covariances that are the product of an input-dependent covariance function and a free-form intertask covariance matrix, we show that accurate approximations for the learning curve can be obtained for an arbitrary number of tasks T . We use these to study the asymptotic learning behaviour for large n. Surprisingly, multi-task learning can be asymptotically essentially useless, in the sense that examples from other tasks help only when the degree of inter-task correlation, ρ, is near its maximal value ρ = 1. This effect is most extreme for learning of smooth target functions as described by e.g. squared exponential kernels. We also demonstrate that when learning many tasks, the learning curves separate into an initial phase, where the Bayes error on each task is reduced down to a plateau value by “collective learning” even though most tasks have not seen examples, and a ﬁnal decay that occurs once the number of examples is proportional to the number of tasks. 1 Introduction and motivation Gaussian processes (GPs) [1] have been popular in the NIPS community for a number of years now, as one of the key non-parametric Bayesian inference approaches. In the simplest case one can use a GP prior when learning a function from data. In line with growing interest in multi-task or transfer learning, where relatedness between tasks is used to aid learning of the individual tasks (see e.g. [2, 3]), GPs have increasingly also been used in a multi-task setting. A number of different choices of covariance functions have been proposed [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These differ e.g. in assumptions on whether the functions to be learned are related to a smaller number of latent functions or have free-form inter-task correlations; for a recent review see [9]. Given this interest in multi-task GPs, one would like to quantify the beneﬁts that they bring compared to single-task learning. PAC-style bounds for classiﬁcation [2, 3, 10] in more general multi-task scenarios exist, but there has been little work on average case analysis. The basic question in this setting is: how does the Bayes error on a given task depend on the number of training examples for all tasks, when averaged over all data sets of the given size. For a single regression task, this learning curve has become relatively well understood since the late 1990s, with a number of bounds and approximations available [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] as well as some exact predictions [20]. Already two-task GP regression is much more difﬁcult to analyse, and progress was made only very recently at NIPS 2009 [21], where upper and lower bounds for learning curves were derived. The tightest of these bounds, however, either required evaluation by Monte Carlo sampling, or assumed knowledge of the corresponding single-task learning curves. Here our aim is to obtain accurate learning curve approximations that apply to an arbitrary number T of tasks, and that can be evaluated explicitly without recourse to sampling. 1 We begin (Sec. 2) by expressing the Bayes error for any single task in a multi-task GP regression problem in a convenient feature space form, where individual training examples enter additively. This requires the introduction of a non-trivial tensor structure combining feature space components and tasks. Considering the change in error when adding an example for some task leads to partial differential equations linking the Bayes errors for all tasks. Solving these using the method of characteristics then gives, as our primary result, the desired learning curve approximation (Sec. 3). In Sec. 4 we discuss some of its predictions. The approximation correctly delineates the limits of pure transfer learning, when all examples are from tasks other than the one of interest. Next we compare with numerical simulations for some two-task scenarios, ﬁnding good qualitative agreement. These results also highlight a surprising feature, namely that asymptotically the relatedness between tasks can become much less useful. We analyse this effect in some detail, showing that it is most extreme for learning of smooth functions. Finally we discuss the case of many tasks, where there is an unexpected separation of the learning curves into a fast initial error decay arising from “collective learning”, and a much slower ﬁnal part where tasks are learned almost independently. 2 GP regression and Bayes error We consider GP regression for T functions fτ (x), τ = 1, 2, . . . , T . These functions have to be learned from n training examples (x , τ , y ), = 1, . . . , n. Here x is the training input, τ ∈ {1, . . . , T } denotes which task the example relates to, and y is the corresponding training output. We assume that the latter is given by the target function value fτ (x ) corrupted by i.i.d. additive 2 2 Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance στ . This setup allows the noise level στ to depend on the task. In GP regression the prior over the functions fτ (x) is a Gaussian process. This means that for any set of inputs x and task labels τ , the function values {fτ (x )} have a joint Gaussian distribution. As is common we assume this to have zero mean, so the multi-task GP is fully speciﬁed by the covariances fτ (x)fτ (x ) = C(τ, x, τ , x ). For this covariance we take the ﬂexible form from [5], fτ (x)fτ (x ) = Dτ τ C(x, x ). Here C(x, x ) determines the covariance between function values at different input points, encoding “spatial” behaviour such as smoothness and the lengthscale(s) over which the functions vary, while the matrix D is a free-form inter-task covariance matrix. One of the attractions of GPs for regression is that, even though they are non-parametric models with (in general) an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, predictions can be made in closed form, see e.g. [1]. For a test point x for task τ , one would predict as output the mean of fτ (x) over the (Gaussian) posterior, which is y T K −1 kτ (x). Here K is the n × n Gram matrix with entries 2 K m = Dτ τm C(x , xm ) + στ δ m , while kτ (x) is a vector with the n entries kτ, = Dτ τ C(x , x). The error bar would be taken as the square root of the posterior variance of fτ (x), which is T Vτ (x) = Dτ τ C(x, x) − kτ (x)K −1 kτ (x) (1) The learning curve for task τ is deﬁned as the mean-squared prediction error, averaged over the location of test input x and over all data sets with a speciﬁed number of examples for each task, say n1 for task 1 and so on. As is standard in learning curve analysis we consider a matched scenario where the training outputs y are generated from the same prior and noise model that we use for inference. In this case the mean-squared prediction error ˆτ is the Bayes error, and is given by the average posterior variance [1], i.e. ˆτ = Vτ (x) x . To obtain the learning curve this is averaged over the location of the training inputs x : τ = ˆτ . This average presents the main challenge for learning curve prediction because the training inputs feature in a highly nonlinear way in Vτ (x). Note that the training outputs, on the other hand, do not appear in the posterior variance Vτ (x) and so do not need to be averaged over. We now want to write the Bayes error ˆτ in a form convenient for performing, at least approximately, the averages required for the learning curve. Assume that all training inputs x , and also the test input x, are drawn from the same distribution P (x). One can decompose the input-dependent part of the covariance function into eigenfunctions relative to P (x), according to C(x, x ) = i λi φi (x)φi (x ). The eigenfunctions are deﬁned by the condition C(x, x )φi (x ) x = λi φi (x) and can be chosen to be orthonormal with respect to P (x), φi (x)φj (x) x = δij . The sum over i here is in general inﬁnite (unless the covariance function is degenerate, as e.g. for the dot product kernel C(x, x ) = x · x ). To make the algebra below as simple as possible, we let the eigenvalues λi be arranged in decreasing order and truncate the sum to the ﬁnite range i = 1, . . . , M ; M is then some large effective feature space dimension and can be taken to inﬁnity at the end. 2 In terms of the above eigenfunction decomposition, the Gram matrix has elements K m = Dτ 2 λi φi (x )φi (xm )+στ δ τm m δτ = i ,τ φi (x )λi δij Dτ τ φj (xm )δτ 2 ,τm +στ δ m i,τ,j,τ or in matrix form K = ΨLΨT + Σ where Σ is the diagonal matrix from the noise variances and Ψ = δτ ,iτ ,τ φi (x ), Liτ,jτ = λi δij Dτ τ (2) Here Ψ has its second index ranging over M (number of kernel eigenvalues) times T (number of tasks) values; L is a square matrix of this size. In Kronecker (tensor) product notation, L = D ⊗ Λ if we deﬁne Λ as the diagonal matrix with entries λi δij . The Kronecker product is convenient for the simpliﬁcations below; we will use that for generic square matrices, (A ⊗ B)(A ⊗ B ) = (AA ) ⊗ (BB ), (A ⊗ B)−1 = A−1 ⊗ B −1 , and tr (A ⊗ B) = (tr A)(tr B). In thinking about the mathematical expressions, it is often easier to picture Kronecker products over feature spaces and tasks as block matrices. For example, L can then be viewed as consisting of T × T blocks, each of which is proportional to Λ. To calculate the Bayes error, we need to average the posterior variance Vτ (x) over the test input x. The ﬁrst term in (1) then becomes Dτ τ C(x, x) = Dτ τ tr Λ. In the second one, we need to average kτ, (x)kτ,m = Dτ τ C(x , x)C(x, xm ) x Dτm τ = x Dτ τ λi λj φi (x ) φi (x)φj (x) x φj (xm )Dτm τ ij = Dτ τ Ψl,iτ λi λj δij Ψm,jτ Dτ τ i,τ ,j,τ T In matrix form this is kτ (x)kτ (x) x = Ψ[(Deτ eT D) ⊗ Λ2 ]ΨT = ΨMτ ΨT Here the last τ equality deﬁnes Mτ , and we have denoted by eτ the T -dimensional vector with τ -th component equal to one and all others zero. Multiplying by the inverse Gram matrix K −1 and taking the trace gives the average of the second term in (1); combining with the ﬁrst gives the Bayes error on task τ ˆτ = Vτ (x) x = Dτ τ tr Λ − tr ΨMτ ΨT (ΨLΨT + Σ)−1 Applying the Woodbury identity and re-arranging yields = Dτ τ tr Λ − tr Mτ ΨT Σ−1 Ψ(I + LΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 = ˆτ Dτ τ tr Λ − tr Mτ L−1 [I − (I + LΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 ] But tr Mτ L−1 = tr {[(Deτ eT D) ⊗ Λ2 ][D ⊗ Λ]−1 } τ = tr {[Deτ eT ] ⊗ Λ} = eT Deτ tr Λ = Dτ τ tr Λ τ τ so the ﬁrst and second terms in the expression for ˆτ cancel and one has = tr Mτ L−1 (I + LΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 = tr L−1 Mτ L−1 (L−1 + ΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 = tr [D ⊗ Λ]−1 [(Deτ eT D) ⊗ Λ2 ][D ⊗ Λ]−1 (L−1 + ΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 τ = ˆτ tr [eτ eT ⊗ I](L−1 + ΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 τ The matrix in square brackets in the last line is just a projector Pτ onto task τ ; thought of as a matrix of T × T blocks (each of size M × M ), this has an identity matrix in the (τ, τ ) block while all other blocks are zero. We can therefore write, ﬁnally, for the Bayes error on task τ , ˆτ = tr Pτ (L−1 + ΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 (3) Because Σ is diagonal and given the deﬁnition (2) of Ψ, the matrix ΨT Σ−1 Ψ is a sum of contributions from the individual training examples = 1, . . . , n. This will be important for deriving the learning curve approximation below. We note in passing that, because τ Pτ = I, the sum of the Bayes errors on all tasks is τ ˆτ = tr (L−1 +ΨT Σ−1 Ψ)−1 , in close analogy to the corresponding expression for the single-task case [13]. 3 3 Learning curve prediction To obtain the learning curve τ = ˆτ , we now need to carry out the average . . . over the training inputs. To help with this, we can extend an approach for the single-task scenario [13] and deﬁne a response or resolvent matrix G = (L−1 + ΨT Σ−1 Ψ + τ vτ Pτ )−1 with auxiliary parameters vτ that will be set back to zero at the end. One can then ask how G = G and hence τ = tr Pτ G changes with the number nτ of training points for task τ . Adding an example at position x for task −2 τ increases ΨT Σ−1 Ψ by στ φτ φT , where φτ has elements (φτ )iτ = φi (x)δτ τ . Evaluating the τ −1 −2 difference (G + στ φτ φT )−1 − G with the help of the Woodbury identity and approximating it τ with a derivative gives Gφτ φT G ∂G τ =− 2 ∂nτ στ + φT Gφτ τ This needs to be averaged over the new example and all previous ones. If we approximate by averaging numerator and denominator separately we get 1 ∂G ∂G = 2 ∂nτ στ + tr Pτ G ∂vτ (4) Here we have exploited for the average over x that the matrix φτ φT x has (i, τ ), (j, τ )-entry τ φi (x)φj (x) x δτ τ δτ τ = δij δτ τ δτ τ , hence simply φτ φT x = Pτ . We have also used the τ auxiliary parameters to rewrite − GPτ G = ∂ G /∂vτ = ∂G/∂vτ . Finally, multiplying (4) by Pτ and taking the trace gives the set of quasi-linear partial differential equations ∂ τ 1 = 2 ∂nτ στ + τ ∂ τ ∂vτ (5) The remaining task is now to ﬁnd the functions τ (n1 , . . . , nT , v1 , . . . , vT ) by solving these differential equations. We initially attempted to do this by tracking the τ as examples are added one task at a time, but the derivation is laborious already for T = 2 and becomes prohibitive beyond. Far more elegant is to adapt the method of characteristics to the present case. We need to ﬁnd a 2T -dimensional surface in the 3T -dimensional space (n1 , . . . , nT , v1 , . . . , vT , 1 , . . . , T ), which is speciﬁed by the T functions τ (. . .). A small change (δn1 , . . . , δnT , δv1 , . . . , δvT , δ 1 , . . . , δ T ) in all 3T coordinates is tangential to this surface if it obeys the T constraints (one for each τ ) δ τ ∂ τ ∂ τ δnτ + δvτ ∂nτ ∂vτ = τ 2 From (5), one sees that this condition is satisﬁed whenever δ τ = 0 and δnτ = −δvτ (στ + τ ) It follows that all the characteristic curves given by τ (t) = τ,0 = const., vτ (t) = vτ,0 (1 − t), 2 nτ (t) = vτ,0 (στ + τ,0 ) t for t ∈ [0, 1] are tangential to the solution surface for all t, so lie within this surface if the initial point at t = 0 does. Because at t = 0 there are no training examples (nτ (0) = 0), this initial condition is satisﬁed by setting −1 τ,0 = tr Pτ −1 L + vτ ,0 Pτ τ Because t=1 τ (t) is constant along the characteristic curve, we get by equating the values at t = 0 and −1 τ,0 = tr Pτ L −1 + vτ ,0 Pτ = τ ({nτ = vτ 2 ,0 (στ + τ ,0 )}, {vτ = 0}) τ Expressing vτ ,0 in terms of nτ gives then τ = tr Pτ L−1 + τ nτ 2 στ + −1 Pτ (6) τ This is our main result: a closed set of T self-consistency equations for the average Bayes errors 2 τ . Given L as deﬁned by the eigenvalues λi of the covariance function, the noise levels στ and the 4 number of examples nτ for each task, it is straightforward to solve these equations numerically to ﬁnd the average Bayes error τ for each task. The r.h.s. of (6) is easiest to evaluate if we view the matrix inside the brackets as consisting of M × M blocks of size T × T (which is the reverse of the picture we have used so far). The matrix is then block diagonal, with the blocks corresponding to different eigenvalues λi . Explicitly, because L−1 = D −1 ⊗ Λ−1 , one has τ λ−1 D −1 + diag({ i = i 4 2 στ nτ + −1 }) τ (7) ττ Results and discussion We now consider the consequences of the approximate prediction (7) for multi-task learning curves in GP regression. A trivial special case is the one of uncorrelated tasks, where D is diagonal. Here one recovers T separate equations for the individual tasks as expected, which have the same form as for single-task learning [13]. 4.1 Pure transfer learning Consider now the case of pure transfer learning, where one is learning a task of interest (say τ = 1) purely from examples for other tasks. What is the lowest average Bayes error that can be obtained? Somewhat more generally, suppose we have no examples for the ﬁrst T0 tasks, n1 = . . . = nT0 = 0, but a large number of examples for the remaining T1 = T − T0 tasks. Denote E = D −1 and write this in block form as E00 E01 E= T E01 E11 2 Now multiply by λ−1 and add in the lower right block a diagonal matrix N = diag({nτ /(στ + i −1 −1 τ )}τ =T0 +1,...,T ). The matrix inverse in (7) then has top left block λi [E00 + E00 E01 (λi N + −1 −1 T T E11 − E01 E00 E01 )−1 E01 E00 ]. As the number of examples for the last T1 tasks grows, so do all −1 (diagonal) elements of N . In the limit only the term λi E00 survives, and summing over i gives −1 −1 1 = tr Λ(E00 )11 = C(x, x) (E00 )11 . The Bayes error on task 1 cannot become lower than this, placing a limit on the beneﬁts of pure transfer learning. That this prediction of the approximation (7) for such a lower limit is correct can also be checked directly: once the last T1 tasks fτ (x) (τ = T0 + 1, . . . T ) have been learn perfectly, the posterior over the ﬁrst T0 functions is, by standard Gaussian conditioning, a GP with covariance C(x, x )(E00 )−1 . Averaging the posterior variance of −1 f1 (x) then gives the Bayes error on task 1 as 1 = C(x, x) (E00 )11 , as found earlier. This analysis can be extended to the case where there are some examples available also for the ﬁrst T0 tasks. One ﬁnds for the generalization errors on these tasks the prediction (7) with D −1 replaced by E00 . This is again in line with the above form of the GP posterior after perfect learning of the remaining T1 tasks. 4.2 Two tasks We next analyse how well the approxiation (7) does in predicting multi-task learning curves for T = 2 tasks. Here we have the work of Chai [21] as a baseline, and as there we choose D= 1 ρ ρ 1 The diagonal elements are ﬁxed to unity, as in a practical application where one would scale both task functions f1 (x) and f2 (x) to unit variance; the degree of correlation of the tasks is controlled by ρ. We ﬁx π2 = n2 /n and plot learning curves against n. In numerical simulations we ensure integer values of n1 and n2 by setting n2 = nπ2 , n1 = n − n2 ; for evaluation of (7) we use 2 2 directly n2 = nπ2 , n1 = n(1 − π2 ). For simplicity we consider equal noise levels σ1 = σ2 = σ 2 . As regards the covariance function and input distribution, we analyse ﬁrst the scenario studied in [21]: a squared exponential (SE) kernel C(x, x ) = exp[−(x − x )2 /(2l2 )] with lengthscale l, and one-dimensional inputs x with a Gaussian distribution N (0, 1/12). The kernel eigenvalues λi 5 1 1 1 1 ε1 ε1 0.8 1 1 ε1 ε1 0.8 0.001 1 ε1 0.8 0.001 n 10000 ε1 1 0.01 1 n 10000 0.6 0.6 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.2 n 1000 0.6 0.2 0 0 100 200 n 300 400 0 500 0 100 200 n 300 400 500 0 0 100 200 n 300 400 500 Figure 1: Average Bayes error for task 1 for two-task GP regression with kernel lengthscale l = 0.01, noise level σ 2 = 0.05 and a fraction π2 = 0.75 of examples for task 2.

Figure 1(left) compares numerically simulated learning curves with the predictions for 1 , the average Bayes error on task 1, from (7). Five pairs of curves are shown, for ρ2 = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1. Note that the two extreme values represent single-task limits, where examples from task 2 are either ignored (ρ = 0) or effectively treated as being from task 1 (ρ = 1). Our predictions lie generally below the true learning curves, but qualitatively represent the trends well, in particular the variation with ρ2 . The curves for the different ρ2 values are fairly evenly spaced vertically for small number of examples, n, corresponding to a linear dependence on ρ2 . As n increases, however, the learning curves for ρ < 1 start to bunch together and separate from the one for the fully correlated case (ρ = 1). The approximation (7) correctly captures this behaviour, which is discussed in more detail below. Figure 1(middle) has analogous results for the case of inputs x uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]; the λi here decay exponentially with i2 [17]. Quantitative agreement between simulations and predictions is better for this case. The discussion in [17] suggests that this is because the approximation method we have used implicitly neglects spatial variation of the dataset-averaged posterior variance Vτ (x) ; but for a uniform input distribution this variation will be weak except near the ends of the input range [0, 1]. Figure 1(right) displays similar results for an OU kernel C(x, x ) = exp(−|x − x |/l), showing that our predictions also work well when learning rough (nowhere differentiable) functions. 4.3 Asymptotic uselessness The two-task results above suggest that multi-task learning is less useful asymptotically: when the number of training examples n is large, the learning curves seem to bunch towards the curve for ρ = 0, where task 2 examples are ignored, except when the two tasks are fully correlated (ρ = 1). We now study this effect. When the number of examples for all tasks becomes large, the Bayes errors τ will become small 2 and eventually be negligible compared to the noise variances στ in (7). One then has an explicit prediction for each τ , without solving T self-consistency equations. If we write, for T tasks, 2 nτ = nπτ with πτ the fraction of examples for task τ , and set γτ = πτ /στ , then for large n τ = i λ−1 D −1 + nΓ i −1 ττ = −1/2 −1 [λi (Γ1/2 DΓ1/2 )−1 i (Γ + nI]−1 Γ−1/2 )τ τ 1/2 where Γ = diag(γ1 , . . . , γT ). Using an eigendecomposition of the symmetric matrix Γ T T a=1 δa va va , one then shows in a few lines that (8) can be written as τ −1 ≈ γτ 2 a (va,τ ) δa g(nδa ) 6 (8) 1/2 DΓ = (9) 1 1 1 50000 ε 5000 r 0.1 ε 0.5 n=500 10 100 1000 n 0.1 0 0 0.2 0.4 ρ 2 0.6 0.8 1 1 10 100 1000 n Figure 2: Left: Bayes error (parameters as in Fig. 1(left), with n = 500) vs ρ2 .

This is the general asymptotic form of our prediction for the average Bayes error for task τ . To get a more explicit result, consider the case where sample functions from the GP prior have (mean-square) derivatives up to order r. The kernel eigenvalues λi then decay as1 i−(2r+2) for large i, and using arguments from [17] one deduces that g(h) ∼ h−α for large h, with α = (2r +1)/(2r + 2). In (9) we can then write, for large n, g(nδa ) ≈ (δa /γτ )−α g(nγτ ) and hence τ ≈ g(nγτ ){ 2 1−α } a (va,τ ) (δa /γτ ) (10) 2 When there is only a single task, δ1 = γ1 and this expression reduces to 1 = g(nγ1 ) = g(n1 /σ1 ). 2 Thus g(nγτ ) = g(nτ /στ ) is the error we would get by ignoring all examples from tasks other than τ , and the term in {. . .} in (10) gives the “multi-task gain”, i.e. the factor by which the error is reduced because of examples from other tasks. (The absolute error reduction always vanishes trivially for n → ∞, along with the errors themselves.) One observation can be made directly. Learning of very smooth functions, as deﬁned e.g. by the SE kernel, corresponds to r → ∞ and hence α → 1, so the multi-task gain tends to unity: multi-task learning is asymptotically useless. The only exception occurs when some of the tasks are fully correlated, because one or more of the eigenvalues δa of Γ1/2 DΓ1/2 will then be zero. Fig. 2(left) shows this effect in action, plotting Bayes error against ρ2 for the two-task setting of Fig. 1(left) with n = 500. Our predictions capture the nonlinear dependence on ρ2 quite well, though the effect is somewhat weaker in the simulations. For larger n the predictions approach a curve that is constant for ρ < 1, signifying negligible improvement from multi-task learning except at ρ = 1. It is worth contrasting this with the lower bound from [21], which is linear in ρ2 . While this provides a very good approximation to the learning curves for moderate n [21], our results here show that asymptotically this bound can become very loose. When predicting rough functions, there is some asymptotic improvement to be had from multi-task learning, though again the multi-task gain is nonlinear in ρ2 : see Fig. 2(left, inset) for the OU case, which has r = 1). A simple expression for the gain can be obtained in the limit of many tasks, to which we turn next. 1 See the discussion of Sacks-Ylvisaker conditions in e.g. [1]; we consider one-dimensional inputs here though the discussion can be generalized. 7 4.4 Many tasks We assume as for the two-task case that all inter-task correlations, Dτ,τ with τ = τ , are equal to ρ, while Dτ,τ = 1. This setup was used e.g. in [23], and can be interpreted as each task having a √ component proportional to ρ of a shared latent function, with an independent task-speciﬁc signal in addition. We assume for simplicity that we have the same number nτ = n/T of examples for 2 each task, and that all noise levels are the same, στ = σ 2 . Then also all Bayes errors τ = will be the same. Carrying out the matrix inverses in (7) explicitly, one can then write this equation as = gT (n/(σ 2 + ), ρ) (11) where gT (h, ρ) is related to the single-task function g(h) from above by gT (h, ρ) = 1−ρ T −1 (1 − ρ)g(h(1 − ρ)/T ) + ρ + T T g(h[ρ + (1 − ρ)/T ]) (12) Now consider the limit T → ∞ of many tasks. If n and hence h = n/(σ 2 + ) is kept ﬁxed, gT (h, ρ) → (1 − ρ) + ρg(hρ); here we have taken g(0) = 1 which corresponds to tr Λ = C(x, x) x = 1 as in the examples above. One can then deduce from (11) that the Bayes error for any task will have the form = (1 − ρ) + ρ˜, where ˜ decays from one to zero with increasing n as for a single task, but with an effective noise level σ 2 = (1 − ρ + σ 2 )/ρ. Remarkably, then, ˜ even though here n/T → 0 so that for most tasks no examples have been seen, the Bayes error for each task decreases by “collective learning” to a plateau of height 1 − ρ. The remaining decay of to zero happens only once n becomes of order T . Here one can show, by taking T → ∞ at ﬁxed h/T in (12) and inserting into (11), that = (1 − ρ)¯ where ¯ again decays as for a single task but with an effective number of examples n = n/T and effective noise level σ 2 /(1 − ρ). This ﬁnal stage of ¯ ¯ learning therefore happens only when each task has seen a considerable number of exampes n/T . Fig. 2(right) validates these predictions against simulations, for a number of tasks (T = 200) that is in the same ballpark as in the many-tasks application example of [24]. The inset for T = 1000 shows clearly how the two learning curve stages separate as T becomes larger. Finally we can come back to the multi-task gain in the asymptotic stage of learning. For GP priors with sample functions with derivatives up to order r as before, the function ¯ from above will decay as (¯ /¯ 2 )−α ; since = (1 − ρ)¯ and σ 2 = σ 2 /(1 − ρ), the Bayes error is then proportional n σ ¯ to (1 − ρ)1−α . This multi-task gain again approaches unity for ρ < 1 for smooth functions (α = (2r + 1)/(2r + 2) → 1). Interestingly, for rough functions (α < 1), the multi-task gain decreases for small ρ2 as 1 − (1 − α) ρ2 and so always lies below a linear dependence on ρ2 initially. This shows that a linear-in-ρ2 lower error bound cannot generally apply to T > 2 tasks, and indeed one can verify that the derivation in [21] does not extend to this case. 5 Conclusion We have derived an approximate prediction (7) for learning curves in multi-task GP regression, valid for arbitrary inter-task correlation matrices D. This can be evaluated explicitly knowing only the kernel eigenvalues, without sampling or recourse to single-task learning curves. The approximation shows that pure transfer learning has a simple lower error bound, and provides a good qualitative account of numerically simulated learning curves. Because it can be used to study the asymptotic behaviour for large training sets, it allowed us to show that multi-task learning can become asymptotically useless: when learning smooth functions it reduces the asymptotic Bayes error only if tasks are fully correlated. For the limit of many tasks we found that, remarkably, some initial “collective learning” is possible even when most tasks have not seen examples. A much slower second learning stage then requires many examples per task. The asymptotic regime of this also showed explicitly that a lower error bound that is linear in ρ2 , the square of the inter-task correlation, is applicable only to the two-task setting T = 2. In future work it would be interesting to use our general result to investigate in more detail the consequences of speciﬁc choices for the inter-task correlations D, e.g. to represent a lower-dimensional latent factor structure. One could also try to deploy similar approximation methods to study the case of model mismatch, where the inter-task correlations D would have to be learned from data. More challenging, but worthwhile, would be an extension to multi-task covariance functions where task and input-space correlations to not factorize. 8 References [1] C K I Williams and C Rasmussen.

<p>Author: Shinichi Nakajima, Ryota Tomioka, Masashi Sugiyama, S. D. Babacan</p><p>Abstract: The variational Bayesian (VB) approach is one of the best tractable approximations to the Bayesian estimation, and it was demonstrated to perform well in many applications. However, its good performance was not fully understood theoretically. For example, VB sometimes produces a sparse solution, which is regarded as a practical advantage of VB, but such sparsity is hardly observed in the rigorous Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic PCA and give more theoretical insight into the empirical success of VB. More speciﬁcally, for the situation where the noise variance is unknown, we derive a sufﬁcient condition for perfect recovery of the true PCA dimensionality in the large-scale limit when the size of an observed matrix goes to inﬁnity. In our analysis, we obtain bounds for a noise variance estimator and simple closed-form solutions for other parameters, which themselves are actually very useful for better implementation of VB-PCA. 1</p><p>2 0.69275898 <a title="268-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Low-Rank_Subspace_Clustering.html">277 nips-2012-Probabilistic Low-Rank Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: S. D. Babacan, Shinichi Nakajima, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering data points into lowdimensional subspaces in the presence of outliers. We pose the problem using a density estimation formulation with an associated generative model. Based on this probability model, we ﬁrst develop an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and then derive its global solution. In addition, we develop two Bayesian methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) approximation, which are capable of automatic dimensionality selection. While the ﬁrst method is based on an alternating optimization scheme for all unknowns, the second method makes use of recent results in VB matrix factorization leading to fast and effective estimation. Both methods are extended to handle sparse outliers for robustness and can handle missing values. Experimental results suggest that proposed methods are very effective in subspace clustering and identifying outliers. 1</p><p>3 0.64799786 <a title="268-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Scalable_CUR_Matrix_Decomposition_Algorithm%3A_Lower_Time_Complexity_and_Tighter_Bound.html">17 nips-2012-A Scalable CUR Matrix Decomposition Algorithm: Lower Time Complexity and Tighter Bound</a></p>
<p>Author: Shusen Wang, Zhihua Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The CUR matrix decomposition is an important extension of Nystr¨ m approximao tion to a general matrix. It approximates any data matrix in terms of a small number of its columns and rows. In this paper we propose a novel randomized CUR algorithm with an expected relative-error bound. The proposed algorithm has the advantages over the existing relative-error CUR algorithms that it possesses tighter theoretical bound and lower time complexity, and that it can avoid maintaining the whole data matrix in main memory. Finally, experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement over the existing relative-error algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.63907564 <a title="268-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Robust_PCA.html">254 nips-2012-On the Sample Complexity of Robust PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Coudron, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate the rate of convergence and sample complexity of a recent robust estimator for a generalized version of the inverse covariance matrix. This estimator is used in a convex algorithm for robust subspace recovery (i.e., robust PCA). Our model assumes a sub-Gaussian underlying distribution and an i.i.d. sample from it. Our main result shows with high probability that the norm of the difference between the generalized inverse covariance of the underlying distribution and its estimator from an i.i.d. sample of size N is of order O(N −0.5+ ) for arbitrarily small > 0 (affecting the probabilistic estimate); this rate of convergence is close to the one of direct covariance estimation, i.e., O(N −0.5 ). Our precise probabilistic estimate implies for some natural settings that the sample complexity of the generalized inverse covariance estimation when using the Frobenius norm is O(D2+δ ) for arbitrarily small δ > 0 (whereas the sample complexity of direct covariance estimation with Frobenius norm is O(D2 )). These results provide similar rates of convergence and sample complexity for the corresponding robust subspace recovery algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work analyzing the sample complexity of any robust PCA algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.62787843 <a title="268-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Multi-Index_Function_Models.html">34 nips-2012-Active Learning of Multi-Index Function Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tyagi Hemant, Volkan Cevher</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of actively learning multi-index functions of the form k f (x) = g(Ax) = i=1 gi (aT x) from point evaluations of f . We assume that i the function f is deﬁned on an 2 -ball in Rd , g is twice continuously differentiable almost everywhere, and A ∈ Rk×d is a rank k matrix, where k d. We propose a randomized, active sampling scheme for estimating such functions with uniform approximation guarantees. Our theoretical developments leverage recent techniques from low rank matrix recovery, which enables us to derive an estimator of the function f along with sample complexity bounds. We also characterize the noise robustness of the scheme, and provide empirical evidence that the highdimensional scaling of our sample complexity bounds are quite accurate. 1</p><p>6 0.58047223 <a title="268-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Convex_Multi-view_Subspace_Learning.html">86 nips-2012-Convex Multi-view Subspace Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Melanie Rey, Volker Roth</p><p>Abstract: We present a reformulation of the information bottleneck (IB) problem in terms of copula, using the equivalence between mutual information and negative copula entropy. Focusing on the Gaussian copula we extend the analytical IB solution available for the multivariate Gaussian case to distributions with a Gaussian dependence structure but arbitrary marginal densities, also called meta-Gaussian distributions. This opens new possibles applications of IB to continuous data and provides a solution more robust to outliers. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66917884 <a title="268-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Perfect_Dimensionality_Recovery_by_Variational_Bayesian_PCA.html">268 nips-2012-Perfect Dimensionality Recovery by Variational Bayesian PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Shinichi Nakajima, Ryota Tomioka, Masashi Sugiyama, S. D. Babacan</p><p>Abstract: The variational Bayesian (VB) approach is one of the best tractable approximations to the Bayesian estimation, and it was demonstrated to perform well in many applications. However, its good performance was not fully understood theoretically. For example, VB sometimes produces a sparse solution, which is regarded as a practical advantage of VB, but such sparsity is hardly observed in the rigorous Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic PCA and give more theoretical insight into the empirical success of VB. More speciﬁcally, for the situation where the noise variance is unknown, we derive a sufﬁcient condition for perfect recovery of the true PCA dimensionality in the large-scale limit when the size of an observed matrix goes to inﬁnity. In our analysis, we obtain bounds for a noise variance estimator and simple closed-form solutions for other parameters, which themselves are actually very useful for better implementation of VB-PCA. 1</p><p>3 0.59582579 <a title="268-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Transelliptical_Graphical_Models.html">352 nips-2012-Transelliptical Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Han Liu, Fang Han, Cun-hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We advocate the use of a new distribution family—the transelliptical—for robust inference of high dimensional graphical models. The transelliptical family is an extension of the nonparanormal family proposed by Liu et al. (2009). Just as the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables using univariate functions, the transelliptical extends the elliptical family in the same way. We propose a nonparametric rank-based regularization estimator which achieves the parametric rates of convergence for both graph recovery and parameter estimation. Such a result suggests that the extra robustness and ﬂexibility obtained by the semiparametric transelliptical modeling incurs almost no efﬁciency loss. We also discuss the relationship between this work with the transelliptical component analysis proposed by Han and Liu (2012). 1</p><p>4 0.56167877 <a title="268-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.55538696 <a title="268-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Caron, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an inﬁnite number of choice items. Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior speciﬁed by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books. 1</p><p>6 0.55490714 <a title="268-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Locating_Changes_in_Highly_Dependent_Data_with_Unknown_Number_of_Change_Points.html">203 nips-2012-Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points</a></p>

<p>Author: Mathieu Sinn, Bei Chen</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Markov Chains (also known as Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields in the literature) are a versatile class of discriminative models for the distribution of a sequence of hidden states conditional on a sequence of observable variables. Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been ﬁrst studied in [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: ﬁrst, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identiﬁability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given. 1</p><p>3 0.24857529 <a title="292-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-conﬁdence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T 1/2 log T ) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-conﬁdence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance. 1</p><p>4 0.20025961 <a title="292-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Nonparametric_Conjugate_Prior_Distribution_for_the_Maximizing_Argument_of_a_Noisy_Function.html">13 nips-2012-A Nonparametric Conjugate Prior Distribution for the Maximizing Argument of a Noisy Function</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro Ortega, Jordi Grau-moya, Tim Genewein, David Balduzzi, Daniel Braun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve ﬁnding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of ﬁrst, doing inference over the function space and second, ﬁnding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior based on a kernel regressor. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function. Given t observations of the function, the posterior can be evaluated efﬁciently in time O(t2 ) up to a multiplicative constant. Finally, we show how to apply our model to optimize a noisy, non-convex, high-dimensional objective function.</p><p>5 0.19876654 <a title="292-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_with_Only_One_Projection.html">324 nips-2012-Stochastic Gradient Descent with Only One Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin, Shenghuo Zhu, Jinfeng Yi</p><p>Abstract: Although many variants of stochastic gradient descent have been proposed for large-scale convex optimization, most of them require projecting the solution at each iteration to ensure that the obtained solution stays within the feasible domain. For complex domains (e.g., positive semideﬁnite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing novel stochastic optimization algorithms that do not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, √ the proposed algorithms achieve an O(1/ T ) convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an O(ln T /T ) rate for strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function. 1</p><p>6 0.19065331 <a title="292-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>

<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Ohad Shamir, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We show a principled way of deriving online learning algorithms from a minimax analysis. Various upper bounds on the minimax value, previously thought to be non-constructive, are shown to yield algorithms. This allows us to seamlessly recover known methods and to derive new ones, also capturing such “unorthodox” methods as Follow the Perturbed Leader and the R2 forecaster. Understanding the inherent complexity of the learning problem thus leads to the development of algorithms. To illustrate our approach, we present several new algorithms, including a family of randomized methods that use the idea of a “random playout”. New versions of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithms are presented, as well as methods based on the Littlestone’s dimension, efﬁcient methods for matrix completion with trace norm, and algorithms for the problems of transductive learning and prediction with static experts. 1</p><p>4 0.66227406 <a title="292-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Talvitie</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces timeline trees, which are partial models of partially observable environments. Timeline trees are given some speciﬁc predictions to make and learn a decision tree over history. The main idea of timeline trees is to use temporally abstract features to identify and split on features of key events, spread arbitrarily far apart in the past (whereas previous decision-tree-based methods have been limited to a ﬁnite sufﬁx of history). Experiments demonstrate that timeline trees can learn to make high quality predictions in complex, partially observable environments with high-dimensional observations (e.g. an arcade game). 1</p><p>2 0.74013537 <a title="292-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-A_Stochastic_Gradient_Method_with_an_Exponential_Convergence__Rate_for_Finite_Training_Sets.html">20 nips-2012-A Stochastic Gradient Method with an Exponential Convergence  Rate for Finite Training Sets</a></p>

Bach</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new stochastic gradient method for optimizing the sum of a ﬁnite set of smooth functions, where the sum is strongly convex. While standard stochastic gradient methods converge at sublinear rates for this problem, the proposed method incorporates a memory of previous gradient values in order to achieve a linear convergence rate. In a machine learning context, numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm can dramatically outperform standard algorithms, both in terms of optimizing the training error and reducing the test error quickly. 1</p><p>3 0.70590514 <a title="292-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Augmented-SVM%3A_Automatic_space_partitioning_for_combining_multiple_non-linear_dynamics.html">48 nips-2012-Augmented-SVM: Automatic space partitioning for combining multiple non-linear dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashwini Shukla, Aude Billard</p><p>Abstract: Non-linear dynamical systems (DS) have been used extensively for building generative models of human behavior. Their applications range from modeling brain dynamics to encoding motor commands. Many schemes have been proposed for encoding robot motions using dynamical systems with a single attractor placed at a predeﬁned target in state space. Although these enable the robots to react against sudden perturbations without any re-planning, the motions are always directed towards a single target. In this work, we focus on combining several such DS with distinct attractors, resulting in a multi-stable DS. We show its applicability in reach-to-grasp tasks where the attractors represent several grasping points on the target object. While exploiting multiple attractors provides more ﬂexibility in recovering from unseen perturbations, it also increases the complexity of the underlying learning problem. Here we present the Augmented-SVM (A-SVM) model which inherits region partitioning ability of the well known SVM classiﬁer and is augmented with novel constraints derived from the individual DS. The new constraints modify the original SVM dual whose optimal solution then results in a new class of support vectors (SV). These new SV ensure that the resulting multistable DS incurs minimum deviation from the original dynamics and is stable at each of the attractors within a ﬁnite region of attraction. We show, via implementations on a simulated 10 degrees of freedom mobile robotic platform, that the model is capable of real-time motion generation and is able to adapt on-the-ﬂy to perturbations.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.7023744 <a title="292-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Regularized_Off-Policy_TD-Learning.html">292 nips-2012-Regularized Off-Policy TD-Learning</a></p>

A variety of experiments are presented to illustrate the off-policy convergence, sparse feature selection capability and low computational cost of the RO-TD algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.6620478 <a title="292-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">229 nips-2012-Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitish Srivastava, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: A Deep Boltzmann Machine is described for learning a generative model of data that consists of multiple and diverse input modalities. The model can be used to extract a uniﬁed representation that fuses modalities together. We ﬁnd that this representation is useful for classiﬁcation and information retrieval tasks. The model works by learning a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs. It uses states of latent variables as representations of the input. The model can extract this representation even when some modalities are absent by sampling from the conditional distribution over them and ﬁlling them in. Our experimental results on bi-modal data consisting of images and text show that the Multimodal DBM can learn a good generative model of the joint space of image and text inputs that is useful for information retrieval from both unimodal and multimodal queries. We further demonstrate that this model signiﬁcantly outperforms SVMs and LDA on discriminative tasks. Finally, we compare our model to other deep learning methods, including autoencoders and deep belief networks, and show that it achieves noticeable gains. 1</p><p>6 0.65669101 <a title="292-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Ensemble_weighted_kernel_estimators_for_multivariate_entropy_estimation.html">117 nips-2012-Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation</a></p>

We complement our algorithmic development with information-theoretic lower bounds on the minimax convergence rate of such problems, which show that our bounds are sharp with respect to all problemdependent quantities: they cannot be improved by more than constant factors. 1</p><p>3 0.068728253 <a title="76-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_optimization_and_sparse_statistical_recovery%3A_Optimal_algorithms_for_high_dimensions.html">325 nips-2012-Stochastic optimization and sparse statistical recovery: Optimal algorithms for high dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic optimization algorithms for problems in which the expected loss is strongly convex, and the optimum is (approximately) sparse. Previous approaches are able to exploit only one of these two structures, yielding a O(d/T ) convergence rate for strongly convex objectives in d dimensions and O( s(log d)/T ) convergence rate when the optimum is s-sparse. Our algorithm is based on successively solving a series of ℓ1 -regularized optimization problems using Nesterov’s dual averaging algorithm. We establish that the error of our solution after T iterations is at most O(s(log d)/T ), with natural extensions to approximate sparsity. Our results apply to locally Lipschitz losses including the logistic, exponential, hinge and least-squares losses. By recourse to statistical minimax results, we show that our convergence rates are optimal up to constants. The effectiveness of our approach is also conﬁrmed in numerical simulations where we compare to several baselines on a least-squares regression problem.</p><p>4 0.067445181 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Active_Comparison_of_Prediction_Models.html">32 nips-2012-Active Comparison of Prediction Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Sawade, Niels Landwehr, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of comparing the risks of two given predictive models—for instance, a baseline model and a challenger—as conﬁdently as possible on a ﬁxed labeling budget. This problem occurs whenever models cannot be compared on held-out training data, possibly because the training data are unavailable or do not reﬂect the desired test distribution. In this case, new test instances have to be drawn and labeled at a cost. We devise an active comparison method that selects instances according to an instrumental sampling distribution. We derive the sampling distribution that maximizes the power of a statistical test applied to the observed empirical risks, and thereby minimizes the likelihood of choosing the inferior model. Empirically, we investigate model selection problems on several classiﬁcation and regression tasks and study the accuracy of the resulting p-values. 1</p><p>5 0.062393628 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_Regularized_Dual_Averaging_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization.html">263 nips-2012-Optimal Regularized Dual Averaging Methods for Stochastic Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Chen, Qihang Lin, Javier Pena</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic optimization problems where both the loss function and regularizer can be non-smooth. We develop a novel algorithm based on the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates for both convex and strongly convex loss. In particular, for strongly convex loss, it achieves the opti1 1 mal rate of O( N + N 2 ) for N iterations, which improves the rate O( log N ) for preN vious regularized dual averaging algorithms. In addition, our method constructs the ﬁnal solution directly from the proximal mapping instead of averaging of all previous iterates. For widely used sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., 1 -norm), it has the advantage of encouraging sparser solutions. We further develop a multistage extension using the proposed algorithm as a subroutine, which achieves the 1 uniformly-optimal rate O( N + exp{−N }) for strongly convex loss. 1</p><p>6 0.058681816 <a title="76-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_with_Only_One_Projection.html">324 nips-2012-Stochastic Gradient Descent with Only One Projection</a></p>

<p>Author: Nishant Mehta, Dongryeol Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Since its inception, the modus operandi of multi-task learning (MTL) has been to minimize the task-wise mean of the empirical risks. We introduce a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL that includes a spectrum of formulations as a subfamily. One endpoint of this spectrum is minimax MTL: a new MTL formulation that minimizes the maximum of the tasks’ empirical risks. Via a certain relaxation of minimax MTL, we obtain a continuum of MTL formulations spanning minimax MTL and classical MTL. The full paradigm itself is loss-compositional, operating on the vector of empirical risks. It incorporates minimax MTL, its relaxations, and many new MTL formulations as special cases. We show theoretically that minimax MTL tends to avoid worst case outcomes on newly drawn test tasks in the learning to learn (LTL) test setting. The results of several MTL formulations on synthetic and real problems in the MTL and LTL test settings are encouraging. 1</p><p>5 0.65981191 <a title="76-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Query_Complexity_of_Derivative-Free_Optimization.html">285 nips-2012-Query Complexity of Derivative-Free Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Recht, Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides lower bounds on the convergence rate of Derivative Free Optimization (DFO) with noisy function evaluations, exposing a fundamental and unavoidable gap between the performance of algorithms with access to gradients and those with access to only function evaluations. However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same. 1</p><p>6 0.64318347 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Stochastic_Gradient_Method_with_an_Exponential_Convergence__Rate_for_Finite_Training_Sets.html">20 nips-2012-A Stochastic Gradient Method with an Exponential Convergence  Rate for Finite Training Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Rishabh Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of discrete divergences on sets (equivalently binary vectors) that we call the submodular-Bregman divergences. We consider two kinds, deﬁned either from tight modular upper or tight modular lower bounds of a submodular function. We show that the properties of these divergences are analogous to the (standard continuous) Bregman divergence. We demonstrate how they generalize many useful divergences, including the weighted Hamming distance, squared weighted Hamming, weighted precision, recall, conditional mutual information, and a generalized KL-divergence on sets. We also show that the generalized Bregman divergence on the Lov´ sz extension of a submodular function, which we a call the Lov´ sz-Bregman divergence, is a continuous extension of a submodular a Bregman divergence. We point out a number of applications, and in particular show that a proximal algorithm deﬁned through the submodular Bregman divergence provides a framework for many mirror-descent style algorithms related to submodular function optimization. We also show that a generalization of the k-means algorithm using the Lov´ sz Bregman divergence is natural in clustering scenarios where a ordering is important. A unique property of this algorithm is that computing the mean ordering is extremely efﬁcient unlike other order based distance measures. 1</p><p>2 0.78052223 <a title="76-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-A_latent_factor_model_for_highly_multi-relational_data.html">22 nips-2012-A latent factor model for highly multi-relational data</a></p>
<p>Author: Rodolphe Jenatton, Nicolas L. Roux, Antoine Bordes, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: Many data such as social networks, movie preferences or knowledge bases are multi-relational, in that they describe multiple relations between entities. While there is a large body of work focused on modeling these data, modeling these multiple types of relations jointly remains challenging. Further, existing approaches tend to breakdown when the number of these types grows. In this paper, we propose a method for modeling large multi-relational datasets, with possibly thousands of relations. Our model is based on a bilinear structure, which captures various orders of interaction of the data, and also shares sparse latent factors across different relations. We illustrate the performance of our approach on standard tensor-factorization datasets where we attain, or outperform, state-of-the-art results. Finally, a NLP application demonstrates our scalability and the ability of our model to learn efﬁcient and semantically meaningful verb representations. 1</p><p>3 0.76942688 <a title="76-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Nonparanormal_Belief_Propagation_%28NPNBP%29.html">248 nips-2012-Nonparanormal Belief Propagation (NPNBP)</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Cobi Cario</p><p>Abstract: The empirical success of the belief propagation approximate inference algorithm has inspired numerous theoretical and algorithmic advances. Yet, for continuous non-Gaussian domains performing belief propagation remains a challenging task: recent innovations such as nonparametric or kernel belief propagation, while useful, come with a substantial computational cost and offer little theoretical guarantees, even for tree structured models. In this work we present Nonparanormal BP for performing efﬁcient inference on distributions parameterized by a Gaussian copulas network and any univariate marginals. For tree structured networks, our approach is guaranteed to be exact for this powerful class of non-Gaussian models. Importantly, the method is as efﬁcient as standard Gaussian BP, and its convergence properties do not depend on the complexity of the univariate marginals, even when a nonparametric representation is used. 1</p><p>4 0.75778306 <a title="76-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Scaled_Gradients_on_Grassmann_Manifolds_for_Matrix_Completion.html">301 nips-2012-Scaled Gradients on Grassmann Manifolds for Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Thanh Ngo, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes gradient methods based on a scaled metric on the Grassmann manifold for low-rank matrix completion. The proposed methods signiﬁcantly improve canonical gradient methods, especially on ill-conditioned matrices, while maintaining established global convegence and exact recovery guarantees. A connection between a form of subspace iteration for matrix completion and the scaled gradient descent procedure is also established. The proposed conjugate gradient method based on the scaled gradient outperforms several existing algorithms for matrix completion and is competitive with recently proposed methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.74728173 <a title="76-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Communication-Efficient_Algorithms_for_Statistical_Optimization.html">76 nips-2012-Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Statistical Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: We study two communication-efﬁcient algorithms for distributed statistical optimization on large-scale data. The ﬁrst algorithm is an averaging method that distributes the N data samples evenly to m machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error that decays as √ O(N −1 + (N/m)−2 ). Whenever m ≤ N , this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of the bootstrap. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as O(N −1 + (N/m)−3 ), and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on largescale problems from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods efﬁciently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which consists of N ≈ 2.4 × 108 samples and d ≥ 700, 000 dimensions. 1</p><p>6 0.69200033 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Shared_Hypotheses.html">181 nips-2012-Learning Multiple Tasks using Shared Hypotheses</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Wu, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: Sparse linear (or generalized linear) models combine a standard likelihood function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefﬁcients. These priors can conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with different variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefﬁcients, while an empirical Bayesian alternative (Type II) ﬁrst marginalizes the coefﬁcients and then maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior approximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space framework from [22], which allows both the Type I or Type II objectives to be expressed in either coefﬁcient or hyperparmeter space. This perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to development in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data ﬁt. As this parameter is effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to solve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefﬁcient-space techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful recovering sparse coefﬁcients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties (RIP) lead to failure of popular ℓ1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable integrations. 1</p><p>3 0.07046815 <a title="221-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Fused_sparsity_and_robust_estimation_for_linear_models_with_unknown_variance.html">139 nips-2012-Fused sparsity and robust estimation for linear models with unknown variance</a></p>
<p>Author: Arnak Dalalyan, Yin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of learning sparse representations in the context of fused sparsity and unknown noise level. We propose an algorithm, termed Scaled Fused Dantzig Selector (SFDS), that accomplishes the aforementioned learning task by means of a second-order cone program. A special emphasize is put on the particular instance of fused sparsity corresponding to the learning in presence of outliers. We establish ﬁnite sample risk bounds and carry out an experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.067321323 <a title="221-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Gradient_Weights_help_Nonparametric_Regressors.html">145 nips-2012-Gradient Weights help Nonparametric Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe, Abdeslam Boularias</p><p>Abstract: In regression problems over Rd , the unknown function f often varies more in some coordinates than in others. We show that weighting each coordinate i with the estimated norm of the ith derivative of f is an efﬁcient way to signiﬁcantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors, e.g. kernel and k-NN regressors. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. Moreover, the proposed estimator is efﬁciently learned online. 1</p><p>5 0.062143479 <a title="221-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_with_Only_One_Projection.html">324 nips-2012-Stochastic Gradient Descent with Only One Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin, Shenghuo Zhu, Jinfeng Yi</p><p>Abstract: Although many variants of stochastic gradient descent have been proposed for large-scale convex optimization, most of them require projecting the solution at each iteration to ensure that the obtained solution stays within the feasible domain. For complex domains (e.g., positive semideﬁnite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing novel stochastic optimization algorithms that do not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, √ the proposed algorithms achieve an O(1/ T ) convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an O(ln T /T ) rate for strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function. 1</p><p>6 0.05944436 <a title="221-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Link_Prediction_in_Graphs_with_Autoregressive_Features.html">199 nips-2012-Link Prediction in Graphs with Autoregressive Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi Jin, Liwei Wang</p><p>Abstract: Margin is one of the most important concepts in machine learning. Previous margin bounds, both for SVM and for boosting, are dimensionality independent. A major advantage of this dimensionality independency is that it can explain the excellent performance of SVM whose feature spaces are often of high or inﬁnite dimension. In this paper we address the problem whether such dimensionality independency is intrinsic for the margin bounds. We prove a dimensionality dependent PAC-Bayes margin bound. The bound is monotone increasing with respect to the dimension when keeping all other factors ﬁxed. We show that our bound is strictly sharper than a previously well-known PAC-Bayes margin bound if the feature space is of ﬁnite dimension; and the two bounds tend to be equivalent as the dimension goes to inﬁnity. In addition, we show that the VC bound for linear classiﬁers can be recovered from our bound under mild conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and ﬁnd that the new bound is useful for model selection and is usually signiﬁcantly sharper than the dimensionality independent PAC-Bayes margin bound as well as the VC bound for linear classiﬁers.</p><p>4 0.631262 <a title="221-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Multi-Index_Function_Models.html">34 nips-2012-Active Learning of Multi-Index Function Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tyagi Hemant, Volkan Cevher</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of actively learning multi-index functions of the form k f (x) = g(Ax) = i=1 gi (aT x) from point evaluations of f . We assume that i the function f is deﬁned on an 2 -ball in Rd , g is twice continuously differentiable almost everywhere, and A ∈ Rk×d is a rank k matrix, where k d. We propose a randomized, active sampling scheme for estimating such functions with uniform approximation guarantees. Our theoretical developments leverage recent techniques from low rank matrix recovery, which enables us to derive an estimator of the function f along with sample complexity bounds. We also characterize the noise robustness of the scheme, and provide empirical evidence that the highdimensional scaling of our sample complexity bounds are quite accurate. 1</p><p>5 0.62933439 <a title="221-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Spectral_Learning_of_General_Weighted_Automata_via_Constrained_Matrix_Completion.html">320 nips-2012-Spectral Learning of General Weighted Automata via Constrained Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Borja Balle, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in text and speech processing and computational biology require estimating functions mapping strings to real numbers. A broad class of such functions can be deﬁned by weighted automata. Spectral methods based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix have been recently proposed for learning a probability distribution represented by a weighted automaton from a training sample drawn according to this same target distribution. In this paper, we show how spectral methods can be extended to the problem of learning a general weighted automaton from a sample generated by an arbitrary distribution. The main obstruction to this approach is that, in general, some entries of the Hankel matrix may be missing. We present a solution to this problem based on solving a constrained matrix completion problem. Combining these two ingredients, matrix completion and spectral method, a whole new family of algorithms for learning general weighted automata is obtained. We present generalization bounds for a particular algorithm in this family. The proofs rely on a joint stability analysis of matrix completion and spectral learning. 1</p><p>6 0.60573196 <a title="221-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Fused_sparsity_and_robust_estimation_for_linear_models_with_unknown_variance.html">139 nips-2012-Fused sparsity and robust estimation for linear models with unknown variance</a></p>

<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Shengxuan Ye, Ian Ross, Adam Mamelak, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real time before the action occurs has been long sought in the neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making, agency and volition. On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise their left or right hand immediately as the “go” signal appeared on a computer screen. They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68±3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously, and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict the correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less conﬁdent. Our system demonstrates— for the ﬁrst time—the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single trials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs. 1 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72893631 <a title="221-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Multi-Stage_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning.html">221 nips-2012-Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning</a></p>

Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.66922557 <a title="221-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>4 0.66216296 <a title="221-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Phoneme_Classification_using_Constrained_Variational_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_System.html">270 nips-2012-Phoneme Classification using Constrained Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical System</a></p>
<p>Author: Hyunsin Park, Sungrack Yun, Sanghyuk Park, Jongmin Kim, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For phoneme classiﬁcation, this paper describes an acoustic model based on the variational Gaussian process dynamical system (VGPDS). The nonlinear and nonparametric acoustic model is adopted to overcome the limitations of classical hidden Markov models (HMMs) in modeling speech. The Gaussian process prior on the dynamics and emission functions respectively enable the complex dynamic structure and long-range dependency of speech to be better represented than that by an HMM. In addition, a variance constraint in the VGPDS is introduced to eliminate the sparse approximation error in the kernel matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with three experimental results, including parameter estimation and classiﬁcation performance, on the synthetic and benchmark datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.66214341 <a title="221-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Simultaneously_Leveraging_Output_and_Task_Structures_for_Multiple-Output_Regression.html">312 nips-2012-Simultaneously Leveraging Output and Task Structures for Multiple-Output Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Piyush Rai, Abhishek Kumar, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Multiple-output regression models require estimating multiple parameters, one for each output. Structural regularization is usually employed to improve parameter estimation in such models. In this paper, we present a multiple-output regression model that leverages the covariance structure of the latent model parameters as well as the conditional covariance structure of the observed outputs. This is in contrast with existing methods that usually take into account only one of these structures. More importantly, unlike some of the other existing methods, none of these structures need be known a priori in our model, and are learned from the data. Several previously proposed structural regularization based multiple-output regression models turn out to be special cases of our model. Moreover, in addition to being a rich model for multiple-output regression, our model can also be used in estimating the graphical model structure of a set of variables (multivariate outputs) conditioned on another set of variables (inputs). Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 1</p><p>6 0.6592871 <a title="221-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Model_Evidence_Using_Bayesian_Quadrature.html">33 nips-2012-Active Learning of Model Evidence Using Bayesian Quadrature</a></p>

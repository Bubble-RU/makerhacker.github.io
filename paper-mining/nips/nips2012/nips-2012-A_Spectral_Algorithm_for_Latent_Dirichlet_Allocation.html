<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>3 0.19491844 <a title="19-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Identifiability_and_Unmixing_of_Latent_Parse_Trees.html">156 nips-2012-Identifiability and Unmixing of Latent Parse Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Daniel J. Hsu, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores unsupervised learning of parsing models along two directions. First, which models are identiﬁable from inﬁnite data? We use a general technique for numerically checking identiﬁability based on the rank of a Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependency parsing models. Second, for identiﬁable models, how do we estimate the parameters efﬁciently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral methods [1] cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree varies across sentences. We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals with this additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models. 1</p><p>4 0.16355659 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Neural_Autoregressive_Topic_Model.html">12 nips-2012-A Neural Autoregressive Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hugo Larochelle, Stanislas Lauly</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new model for learning meaningful representations of text documents from an unlabeled collection of documents. This model is inspired by the recently proposed Replicated Softmax, an undirected graphical model of word counts that was shown to learn a better generative model and more meaningful document representations. Speciﬁcally, we take inspiration from the conditional mean-ﬁeld recursive equations of the Replicated Softmax in order to deﬁne a neural network architecture that estimates the probability of observing a new word in a given document given the previously observed words. This paradigm also allows us to replace the expensive softmax distribution over words with a hierarchical distribution over paths in a binary tree of words. The end result is a model whose training complexity scales logarithmically with the vocabulary size instead of linearly as in the Replicated Softmax. Our experiments show that our model is competitive both as a generative model of documents and as a document representation learning algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.15577705 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Provable_ICA_with_Unknown_Gaussian_Noise%2C_with_Implications_for_Gaussian_Mixtures_and_Autoencoders.html">281 nips-2012-Provable ICA with Unknown Gaussian Noise, with Implications for Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanjeev Arora, Rong Ge, Ankur Moitra, Sushant Sachdeva</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has provable performance guarantees. In particular, suppose we are given samples of the form y = Ax + η where A is an unknown n × n matrix and x is a random variable whose components are independent and have a fourth moment strictly less than that of a standard Gaussian random variable and η is an n-dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance Σ: We give an algorithm that provable recovers A and Σ up to an additive and whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in n and 1/ . To accomplish this, we introduce a novel “quasi-whitening” step that may be useful in other contexts in which the covariance of Gaussian noise is not known in advance. We also give a general framework for ﬁnding all local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately ﬁnding just one) and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we ﬁnd the columns of A one by one via local search. 1</p><p>6 0.15017721 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kosuke Fukumasu, Koji Eguchi, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling is a widely used approach to analyzing large text collections. A small number of multilingual topic models have recently been explored to discover latent topics among parallel or comparable documents, such as in Wikipedia. Other topic models that were originally proposed for structured data are also applicable to multilingual documents. Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation (CorrLDA) is one such model; however, it requires a pivot language to be speciﬁed in advance. We propose a new topic model, Symmetric Correspondence LDA (SymCorrLDA), that incorporates a hidden variable to control a pivot language, in an extension of CorrLDA. We experimented with two multilingual comparable datasets extracted from Wikipedia and demonstrate that SymCorrLDA is more eﬀective than some other existing multilingual topic models. 1</p><p>5 0.66494256 <a title="19-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>6 0.6370551 <a title="19-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Identifiability_and_Unmixing_of_Latent_Parse_Trees.html">156 nips-2012-Identifiability and Unmixing of Latent Parse Trees</a></p>

Moreover, the algorithm is scalable, since the SVDs are carried out only on k × k matrices, where k is the number of latent factors (topics) and is typically much smaller than the dimension of the observation (word) space. 1</p><p>3 0.84506333 <a title="19-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Fused_sparsity_and_robust_estimation_for_linear_models_with_unknown_variance.html">139 nips-2012-Fused sparsity and robust estimation for linear models with unknown variance</a></p>
<p>Author: Arnak Dalalyan, Yin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of learning sparse representations in the context of fused sparsity and unknown noise level. We propose an algorithm, termed Scaled Fused Dantzig Selector (SFDS), that accomplishes the aforementioned learning task by means of a second-order cone program. A special emphasize is put on the particular instance of fused sparsity corresponding to the learning in presence of outliers. We establish ﬁnite sample risk bounds and carry out an experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.80814195 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Model_Evidence_Using_Bayesian_Quadrature.html">33 nips-2012-Active Learning of Model Evidence Using Bayesian Quadrature</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Osborne, Roman Garnett, Zoubin Ghahramani, David K. Duvenaud, Stephen J. Roberts, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Numerical integration is a key component of many problems in scientiﬁc computing, statistical modelling, and machine learning. Bayesian Quadrature is a modelbased method for numerical integration which, relative to standard Monte Carlo methods, offers increased sample efﬁciency and a more robust estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature approach for numerical integration when the integrand is non-negative, such as the case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive distribution, or normalising constant of a probabilistic model. Our approach approximately marginalises the quadrature model’s hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an active learning scheme to optimally select function evaluations, as opposed to using Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic benchmarks and a real scientiﬁc problem from astronomy. 1</p><p>5 0.80512899 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Label_Trees_for_Probabilistic_Modelling_of_Implicit_Feedback.html">178 nips-2012-Learning Label Trees for Probabilistic Modelling of Implicit Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: User preferences for items can be inferred from either explicit feedback, such as item ratings, or implicit feedback, such as rental histories. Research in collaborative ﬁltering has concentrated on explicit feedback, resulting in the development of accurate and scalable models. However, since explicit feedback is often difﬁcult to collect it is important to develop effective models that take advantage of the more widely available implicit feedback. We introduce a probabilistic approach to collaborative ﬁltering with implicit feedback based on modelling the user’s item selection process. In the interests of scalability, we restrict our attention to treestructured distributions over items and develop a principled and efﬁcient algorithm for learning item trees from data. We also identify a problem with a widely used protocol for evaluating implicit feedback models and propose a way of addressing it using a small quantity of explicit feedback data. 1</p><p>6 0.80503094 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-CPRL_--_An_Extension_of_Compressive_Sensing_to_the_Phase_Retrieval_Problem.html">63 nips-2012-CPRL -- An Extension of Compressive Sensing to the Phase Retrieval Problem</a></p>

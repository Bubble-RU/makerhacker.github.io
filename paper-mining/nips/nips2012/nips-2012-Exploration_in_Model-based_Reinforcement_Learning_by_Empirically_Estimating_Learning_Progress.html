<p>Author: Arthur Guez, David Silver, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayesoptimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a signiﬁcant margin on several well-known benchmark problems – because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an inﬁnite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration. 1</p><p>3 0.2262249 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdeslam Boularias, Jan R. Peters, Oliver B. Kroemer</p><p>Abstract: We use a graphical model for representing policies in Markov Decision Processes. This new representation can easily incorporate domain knowledge in the form of a state similarity graph that loosely indicates which states are supposed to have similar optimal actions. A bias is then introduced into the policy search process by sampling policies from a distribution that assigns high probabilities to policies that agree with the provided state similarity graph, i.e. smoother policies. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We also present forward and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms for learning such policy distributions. We illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach on two problems: cart-balancing with swing-up, and teaching a robot to grasp unknown objects. 1</p><p>4 0.22615169 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_through_Structured_Classification.html">162 nips-2012-Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Structured Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Edouard Klein, Matthieu Geist, Bilal Piot, Olivier Pietquin</p><p>Abstract: This paper adresses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward for which a demonstrated expert behavior is optimal. We introduce a new algorithm, SCIRL, whose principle is to use the so-called feature expectation of the expert as the parameterization of the score function of a multiclass classiﬁer. This approach produces a reward function for which the expert policy is provably near-optimal. Contrary to most of existing IRL algorithms, SCIRL does not require solving the direct RL problem. Moreover, with an appropriate heuristic, it can succeed with only trajectories sampled according to the expert behavior. This is illustrated on a car driving simulator. 1</p><p>5 0.20511797 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Tractable_Objectives_for_Robust_Policy_Optimization.html">348 nips-2012-Tractable Objectives for Robust Policy Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Katherine Chen, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Robust policy optimization acknowledges that risk-aversion plays a vital role in real-world decision-making. When faced with uncertainty about the effects of actions, the policy that maximizes expected utility over the unknown parameters of the system may also carry with it a risk of intolerably poor performance. One might prefer to accept lower utility in expectation in order to avoid, or reduce the likelihood of, unacceptable levels of utility under harmful parameter realizations. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty, but unlike other methods avoid making any distributional assumptions about the form of this uncertainty. Instead we focus on identifying optimization objectives for which solutions can be efﬁciently approximated. We introduce percentile measures: a very general class of objectives for robust policy optimization, which encompasses most existing approaches, including ones known to be intractable. We then introduce a broad subclass of this family for which robust policies can be approximated efﬁciently. Finally, we frame these objectives in the context of a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game and employ a no-regret algorithm to approximate an optimal policy, with computation only polynomial in the number of states and actions of the MDP. 1</p><p>6 0.20442826 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Use_of_Non-Stationary_Policies_for_Stationary_Infinite-Horizon_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">255 nips-2012-On the Use of Non-Stationary Policies for Stationary Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongho Kim, Kee-eung Kim, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected longterm total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.89660579 <a title="122-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Exploration_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Empirically_Estimating_Learning_Progress.html">122 nips-2012-Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress</a></p>

<p>Author: Feng Cao, Soumya Ray</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We deﬁne priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to ﬁnd an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually speciﬁed, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies. 1</p><p>5 0.83183217 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Transferring_Expectations_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">353 nips-2012-Transferring Expectations in Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

Leong</p><p>Abstract: We study how to automatically select and adapt multiple abstractions or representations of the world to support model-based reinforcement learning. We address the challenges of transfer learning in heterogeneous environments with varying tasks. We present an efﬁcient, online framework that, through a sequence of tasks, learns a set of relevant representations to be used in future tasks. Without predeﬁned mapping strategies, we introduce a general approach to support transfer learning across different state spaces. We demonstrate the potential impact of our system through improved jumpstart and faster convergence to near optimum policy in two benchmark domains. 1</p><p>6 0.82321978 <a title="122-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_through_Structured_Classification.html">162 nips-2012-Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Structured Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>3 0.79228568 <a title="122-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Persistent_Homology_for_Learning_Densities_with_Bounded_Support.html">269 nips-2012-Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian T. Pokorny, Hedvig Kjellström, Danica Kragic, Carl Ek</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate ‘hard’ topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of persistent homology can be combined with kernel-based methods from machine learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and – by incorporating persistent homology techniques in our approach – we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset by learning a motion model for a race car. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car. 1</p><p>4 0.78749633 <a title="122-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Locating_Changes_in_Highly_Dependent_Data_with_Unknown_Number_of_Change_Points.html">203 nips-2012-Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points</a></p>
<p>Author: Azadeh Khaleghi, Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multiple change point estimation is considered for sequences with unknown number of change points. A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed. In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form. The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations. 1</p><p>5 0.78747332 <a title="122-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Policy_Learning_from_Trajectory_Preference_Queries.html">3 nips-2012-A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Wilson, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning control policies via trajectory preference queries to an expert. In particular, the agent presents an expert with short runs of a pair of policies originating from the same state and the expert indicates which trajectory is preferred. The agent’s goal is to elicit a latent target policy from the expert with as few queries as possible. To tackle this problem we propose a novel Bayesian model of the querying process and introduce two methods that exploit this model to actively select expert queries. Experimental results on four benchmark problems indicate that our model can effectively learn policies from trajectory preference queries and that active query selection can be substantially more efﬁcient than random selection. 1</p><p>6 0.7869553 <a title="122-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Q-MKL%3A_Matrix-induced_Regularization_in_Multi-Kernel_Learning_with_Applications_to_Neuroimaging.html">284 nips-2012-Q-MKL: Matrix-induced Regularization in Multi-Kernel Learning with Applications to Neuroimaging</a></p>

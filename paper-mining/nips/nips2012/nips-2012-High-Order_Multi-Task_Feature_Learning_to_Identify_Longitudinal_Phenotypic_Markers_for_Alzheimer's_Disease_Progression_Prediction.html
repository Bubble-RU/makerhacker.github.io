<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.13549879 <a title="151-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Q-MKL%3A_Matrix-induced_Regularization_in_Multi-Kernel_Learning_with_Applications_to_Neuroimaging.html">284 nips-2012-Q-MKL: Matrix-induced Regularization in Multi-Kernel Learning with Applications to Neuroimaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Hinrichs, Vikas Singh, Jiming Peng, Sterling Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) generalizes SVMs to the setting where one simultaneously trains a linear classiﬁer and chooses an optimal combination of given base kernels. Model complexity is typically controlled using various norm regularizations on the base kernel mixing coefﬁcients. Existing methods neither regularize nor exploit potentially useful information pertaining to how kernels in the input set ‘interact’; that is, higher order kernel-pair relationships that can be easily obtained via unsupervised (similarity, geodesics), supervised (correlation in errors), or domain knowledge driven mechanisms (which features were used to construct the kernel?). We show that by substituting the norm penalty with an arbitrary quadratic function Q 0, one can impose a desired covariance structure on mixing weights, and use this as an inductive bias when learning the concept. This formulation signiﬁcantly generalizes the widely used 1- and 2-norm MKL objectives. We explore the model’s utility via experiments on a challenging Neuroimaging problem, where the goal is to predict a subject’s conversion to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by exploiting aggregate information from many distinct imaging modalities. Here, our new model outperforms the state of the art (p-values 10−3 ). We brieﬂy discuss ramiﬁcations in terms of learning bounds (Rademacher complexity). 1</p><p>6 0.12353005 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Ancestor_Sampling_for_Particle_Gibbs.html">41 nips-2012-Ancestor Sampling for Particle Gibbs</a></p>

<p>Author: Bonnie Kirkpatrick, Alexandre Bouchard-côté</p><p>Abstract: Pedigrees, or family trees, are directed graphs used to identify sites of the genome that are correlated with the presence or absence of a disease. With the advent of genotyping and sequencing technologies, there has been an explosion in the amount of data available, both in the number of individuals and in the number of sites. Some pedigrees number in the thousands of individuals. Meanwhile, analysis methods have remained limited to pedigrees of < 100 individuals which limits analyses to many small independent pedigrees. Disease models, such those used for the linkage analysis log-odds (LOD) estimator, have similarly been limited. This is because linkage analysis was originally designed with a different task in mind, that of ordering the sites in the genome, before there were technologies that could reveal the order. LODs are difﬁcult to interpret and nontrivial to extend to consider interactions among sites. These developments and difﬁculties call for the creation of modern methods of pedigree analysis. Drawing from recent advances in graphical model inference and transducer theory, we introduce a simple yet powerful formalism for expressing genetic disease models. We show that these disease models can be turned into accurate and computationally efﬁcient estimators. The technique we use for constructing the variational approximation has potential applications to inference in other large-scale graphical models. This method allows inference on larger pedigrees than previously analyzed in the literature, which improves disease site prediction. 1</p><p>5 0.46950606 <a title="151-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Event_Cascades_for_Alzheimer%27s_disease.html">276 nips-2012-Probabilistic Event Cascades for Alzheimer's disease</a></p>

<p>Author: Ognjen Arandjelovic</p><p>Abstract: The interaction between the patient’s expected outcome of an intervention and the inherent effects of that intervention can have extraordinary effects. Thus in clinical trials an effort is made to conceal the nature of the administered intervention from the participants in the trial i.e. to blind it. Yet, in practice perfect blinding is impossible to ensure or even verify. The current standard is follow up the trial with an auxiliary questionnaire, which allows trial participants to express their belief concerning the assigned intervention and which is used to compute a measure of the extent of blinding in the trial. If the estimated extent of blinding exceeds a threshold the trial is deemed sufﬁciently blinded; otherwise, the trial is deemed to have failed. In this paper we make several important contributions. Firstly, we identify a series of fundamental problems of the aforesaid practice and discuss them in context of the most commonly used blinding measures. Secondly, motivated by the highlighted problems, we formulate a novel method for handling imperfectly blinded trials. We too adopt a post-trial feedback questionnaire but interpret the collected data using an original approach, fundamentally different from those previously proposed. Unlike previous approaches, ours is void of any ad hoc free parameters, is robust to small changes in auxiliary data and is not predicated on any strong assumptions used to interpret participants’ feedback. 1</p><p>2 0.90378988 <a title="151-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_estimation_of_discrete_entropy_with_mixtures_of_stick-breaking_priors.html">57 nips-2012-Bayesian estimation of discrete entropy with mixtures of stick-breaking priors</a></p>

Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Shannon’s entropy H in the under-sampled regime, where the number of possible symbols may be unknown or countably inﬁnite. Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes provide tractable prior distributions over the space of countably inﬁnite discrete distributions, and have found major applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that they provide natural priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the analytic tractability of the moments of the induced posterior distribution over entropy H. We derive formulas for the posterior mean and variance of H given data. However, we show that a ﬁxed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior on H, meaning the prior strongly determines the estimate in the under-sampled regime. We therefore deﬁne a family of continuous mixing measures such that the resulting mixture of Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor processes produces an approximately ﬂat prior over H. We explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators and show that they perform well on data sampled from both exponential and power-law tailed distributions. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.89476007 <a title="151-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-High-Order_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning_to_Identify_Longitudinal_Phenotypic_Markers_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_Progression_Prediction.html">151 nips-2012-High-Order Multi-Task Feature Learning to Identify Longitudinal Phenotypic Markers for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang, Jingwen Yan, Sungeun Kim, Shannon Risacher, Andrew Saykin, Li Shen</p><p>Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in imaging and cognitive data by structured sparsity-inducing norms. The sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of imaging measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The empirical studies, using the longitudinal imaging and cognitive data of the ADNI cohort, have yielded promising results.</p><p>4 0.89284652 <a title="151-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Fully_Bayesian_inference_for_neural_models_with_negative-binomial_spiking.html">138 nips-2012-Fully Bayesian inference for neural models with negative-binomial spiking</a></p>
<p>Author: James Scott, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Characterizing the information carried by neural populations in the brain requires accurate statistical models of neural spike responses. The negative-binomial distribution provides a convenient model for over-dispersed spike counts, that is, responses with greater-than-Poisson variability. Here we describe a powerful data-augmentation framework for fully Bayesian inference in neural models with negative-binomial spiking. Our approach relies on a recently described latentvariable representation of the negative-binomial distribution, which equates it to a Polya-gamma mixture of normals. This framework provides a tractable, conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior that can be used to design efﬁcient EM and Gibbs sampling based algorithms for inference in regression and dynamic factor models. We apply the model to neural data from primate retina and show that it substantially outperforms Poisson regression on held-out data, and reveals latent structure underlying spike count correlations in simultaneously recorded spike trains. 1</p><p>5 0.84531665 <a title="151-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_from_the_Wisdom_of_Crowds_by_Minimax_Entropy.html">189 nips-2012-Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Sumit Basu, Yi Mao, John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: An important way to make large training sets is to gather noisy labels from crowds of nonexperts. We propose a minimax entropy principle to improve the quality of these labels. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over workers, items, and labels. By maximizing the entropy of this distribution, the method naturally infers item confusability and worker expertise. We infer the ground truth by minimizing the entropy of this distribution, which we show minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distribution and the unknown truth. We show that a simple coordinate descent scheme can optimize minimax entropy. Empirically, our results are substantially better than previously published methods for the same problem. 1</p><p>6 0.83110493 <a title="151-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Multiresolution_Gaussian_Processes.html">233 nips-2012-Multiresolution Gaussian Processes</a></p>

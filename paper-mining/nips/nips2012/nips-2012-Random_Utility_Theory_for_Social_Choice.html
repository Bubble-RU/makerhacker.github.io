<p>Author: Weiwei Cheng, Willem Waegeman, Volkmar Welker, Eyke Hüllermeier</p><p>Abstract: Several machine learning methods allow for abstaining from uncertain predictions. While being common for settings like conventional classiﬁcation, abstention has been studied much less in learning to rank. We address abstention for the label ranking setting, allowing the learner to declare certain pairs of labels as being incomparable and, thus, to predict partial instead of total orders. In our method, such predictions are produced via thresholding the probabilities of pairwise preferences between labels, as induced by a predicted probability distribution on the set of all rankings. We formally analyze this approach for the Mallows and the Plackett-Luce model, showing that it produces proper partial orders as predictions and characterizing the expressiveness of the induced class of partial orders. These theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the practical usefulness of the approach. 1</p><p>3 0.10136621 <a title="286-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Collaborative_Gaussian_Processes_for_Preference_Learning.html">74 nips-2012-Collaborative Gaussian Processes for Preference Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil Houlsby, Ferenc Huszar, Zoubin Ghahramani, Jose M. Hernández-lobato</p><p>Abstract: We present a new model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for learning pairwise preferences expressed by multiple users. Inference is simpliﬁed by using a preference kernel for GPs which allows us to combine supervised GP learning of user preferences with unsupervised dimensionality reduction for multi-user systems. The model not only exploits collaborative information from the shared structure in user behavior, but may also incorporate user features if they are available. Approximate inference is implemented using a combination of expectation propagation and variational Bayes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient active learning strategy for querying preferences. The proposed technique performs favorably on real-world data against state-of-the-art multi-user preference learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.096937425 <a title="286-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Rational_inference_of_relative_preferences.html">288 nips-2012-Rational inference of relative preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nisheeth Srivastava, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: Statistical decision theory axiomatically assumes that the relative desirability of different options that humans perceive is well described by assigning them optionspeciﬁc scalar utility functions. However, this assumption is refuted by observed human behavior, including studies wherein preferences have been shown to change systematically simply through variation in the set of choice options presented. In this paper, we show that interpreting desirability as a relative comparison between available options at any particular decision instance results in a rational theory of value-inference that explains heretofore intractable violations of rational choice behavior in human subjects. Complementarily, we also characterize the conditions under which a rational agent selecting optimal options indicated by dynamic value inference in our framework will behave identically to one whose preferences are encoded using a static ordinal utility function. 1</p><p>5 0.095986068 <a title="286-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_ranking_from_pair-wise_comparisons.html">165 nips-2012-Iterative ranking from pair-wise comparisons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Sewoong Oh, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: The question of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR’s TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, ﬁnding ‘scores’ for each object (e.g. player’s rating) is of interest to understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with edges present between two objects if they are compared; the scores turn out to be the stationary probability of this random walk. The algorithm is model independent. To establish the efﬁcacy of our method, however, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. We bound the ﬁnite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. This, in essence, leads to order-optimal dependence on the number of samples required to learn the scores well by our algorithm. Indeed, the experimental evaluation shows that our (model independent) algorithm performs as well as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the BTL model and outperforms a recently proposed algorithm by Ammar and Shah [1]. 1</p><p>6 0.094084129 <a title="286-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Statistical_Consistency_of_Ranking_Methods_in_A_Rank-Differentiable_Probability_Space.html">323 nips-2012-Statistical Consistency of Ranking Methods in A Rank-Differentiable Probability Space</a></p>

<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>4 0.65880477 <a title="286-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Statistical_Consistency_of_Ranking_Methods_in_A_Rank-Differentiable_Probability_Space.html">323 nips-2012-Statistical Consistency of Ranking Methods in A Rank-Differentiable Probability Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Lan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the statistical consistency of ranking methods. Recently, it was proven that many commonly used pairwise ranking methods are inconsistent with the weighted pairwise disagreement loss (WPDL), which can be viewed as the true loss of ranking, even in a low-noise setting. This result is interesting but also surprising, given that the pairwise ranking methods have been shown very effective in practice. In this paper, we argue that the aforementioned result might not be conclusive, depending on what kind of assumptions are used. We give a new assumption that the labels of objects to rank lie in a rank-differentiable probability space (RDPS), and prove that the pairwise ranking methods become consistent with WPDL under this assumption. What is especially inspiring is that RDPS is actually not stronger than but similar to the low-noise setting. Our studies provide theoretical justiﬁcations of some empirical ﬁndings on pairwise ranking methods that are unexplained before, which bridge the gap between theory and applications.</p><p>5 0.60848993 <a title="286-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_n-Choose-k_Models_for_Classification_and_Ranking.html">278 nips-2012-Probabilistic n-Choose-k Models for Classification and Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Swersky, Brendan J. Frey, Daniel Tarlow, Richard S. Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In categorical data there is often structure in the number of variables that take on each label. For example, the total number of objects in an image and the number of highly relevant documents per query in web search both tend to follow a structured distribution. In this paper, we study a probabilistic model that explicitly includes a prior distribution over such counts, along with a count-conditional likelihood that deﬁnes probabilities over all subsets of a given size. When labels are binary and the prior over counts is a Poisson-Binomial distribution, a standard logistic regression model is recovered, but for other count distributions, such priors induce global dependencies and combinatorics that appear to complicate learning and inference. However, we demonstrate that simple, efﬁcient learning procedures can be derived for more general forms of this model. We illustrate the utility of the formulation by exploring applications to multi-object classiﬁcation, learning to rank, and top-K classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.57909793 <a title="286-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_ranking_from_pair-wise_comparisons.html">165 nips-2012-Iterative ranking from pair-wise comparisons</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Mayr, Paul Stärke, Johannes Partzsch, Love Cederstroem, Rene Schüffny, Yao Shuai, Nan Du, Heidemarie Schmidt</p><p>Abstract: Memristive devices have recently been proposed as efﬁcient implementations of plastic synapses in neuromorphic systems. The plasticity in these memristive devices, i.e. their resistance change, is deﬁned by the applied waveforms. This behavior resembles biological synapses, whose plasticity is also triggered by mechanisms that are determined by local waveforms. However, learning in memristive devices has so far been approached mostly on a pragmatic technological level. The focus seems to be on ﬁnding any waveform that achieves spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), without regard to the biological veracity of said waveforms or to further important forms of plasticity. Bridging this gap, we make use of a plasticity model driven by neuron waveforms that explains a large number of experimental observations and adapt it to the characteristics of the recently introduced BiFeO3 memristive material. Based on this approach, we show STDP for the ﬁrst time for this material, with learning window replication superior to previous memristor-based STDP implementations. We also demonstrate in measurements that it is possible to overlay short and long term plasticity at a memristive device in the form of the well-known triplet plasticity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst implementations of triplet plasticity on any physical memristive device. 1</p><p>2 0.78228551 <a title="286-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Risk_Aversion_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_via_Near_Optimal_Chernoff_Bounds.html">296 nips-2012-Risk Aversion in Markov Decision Processes via Near Optimal Chernoff Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Teodor M. Moldovan, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: The expected return is a widely used objective in decision making under uncertainty. Many algorithms, such as value iteration, have been proposed to optimize it. In risk-aware settings, however, the expected return is often not an appropriate objective to optimize. We propose a new optimization objective for risk-aware planning and show that it has desirable theoretical properties. We also draw connections to previously proposed objectives for risk-aware planing: minmax, exponential utility, percentile and mean minus variance. Our method applies to an extended class of Markov decision processes: we allow costs to be stochastic as long as they are bounded. Additionally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm for optimizing the proposed objective. Synthetic and real-world experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method, at scale. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.76420689 <a title="286-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Random_Utility_Theory_for_Social_Choice.html">286 nips-2012-Random Utility Theory for Social Choice</a></p>

Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce. 1</p><p>4 0.74908876 <a title="286-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Collaborative_Ranking_With_17_Parameters.html">75 nips-2012-Collaborative Ranking With 17 Parameters</a></p>
<p>Author: Maksims Volkovs, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: The primary application of collaborate ﬁltering (CF) is to recommend a small set of items to a user, which entails ranking. Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhood- and model-based. Our novel method is highly efﬁcient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on datasets from one item domain yield excellent results on a dataset from very different item domain, without any retraining. 1</p><p>5 0.7222541 <a title="286-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-The_Lov%C3%A1sz_%CF%91_function%2C_SVMs_and_finding_large_dense_subgraphs.html">337 nips-2012-The Lovász ϑ function, SVMs and finding large dense subgraphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinay Jethava, Anders Martinsson, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Devdatt Dubhashi</p><p>Abstract: The Lov´ sz ϑ function of a graph, a fundamental tool in combinatorial optimizaa tion and approximation algorithms, is computed by solving a SDP. In this paper we establish that the Lov´ sz ϑ function is equivalent to a kernel learning problem a related to one class SVM. This interesting connection opens up many opportunities bridging graph theoretic algorithms and machine learning. We show that there exist graphs, which we call SVM − ϑ graphs, on which the Lov´ sz ϑ function a can be approximated well by a one-class SVM. This leads to novel use of SVM techniques for solving algorithmic problems in large graphs e.g. identifying a √ 1 planted clique of size Θ( n) in a random graph G(n, 2 ). A classic approach for this problem involves computing the ϑ function, however it is not scalable due to SDP computation. We show that the random graph with a planted clique is an example of SVM − ϑ graph. As a consequence a SVM based approach easily identiﬁes the clique in large graphs and is competitive with the state-of-the-art. We introduce the notion of common orthogonal labelling and show that it can be computed by solving a Multiple Kernel learning problem. It is further shown that such a labelling is extremely useful in identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs, which is known to be a computationally difﬁcult problem. The proposed algorithm achieves an order of magnitude scalability compared to state of the art methods. 1</p><p>6 0.69453466 <a title="286-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

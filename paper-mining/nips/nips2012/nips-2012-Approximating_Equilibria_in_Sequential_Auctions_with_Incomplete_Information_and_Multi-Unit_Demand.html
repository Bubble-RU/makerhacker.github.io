<p>Author: Neil Burch, Marc Lanctot, Duane Szafron, Richard G. Gibson</p><p>Abstract: Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, iterative algorithm for computing strategies in extensive-form games. The Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) variants reduce the per iteration time cost of CFR by traversing a smaller, sampled portion of the tree. The previous most effective instances of MCCFR can still be very slow in games with many player actions since they sample every action for a given player. In this paper, we present a new MCCFR algorithm, Average Strategy Sampling (AS), that samples a subset of the player’s actions according to the player’s average strategy. Our new algorithm is inspired by a new, tighter bound on the number of iterations required by CFR to converge to a given solution quality. In addition, we prove a similar, tighter bound for AS and other popular MCCFR variants. Finally, we validate our work by demonstrating that AS converges faster than previous MCCFR algorithms in both no-limit poker and Bluff. 1</p><p>3 0.096151859 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Robustness_and_risk-sensitivity_in_Markov_decision_processes.html">297 nips-2012-Robustness and risk-sensitivity in Markov decision processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Takayuki Osogami</p><p>Abstract: We uncover relations between robust MDPs and risk-sensitive MDPs. The objective of a robust MDP is to minimize a function, such as the expectation of cumulative cost, for the worst case when the parameters have uncertainties. The objective of a risk-sensitive MDP is to minimize a risk measure of the cumulative cost when the parameters are known. We show that a risk-sensitive MDP of minimizing the expected exponential utility is equivalent to a robust MDP of minimizing the worst-case expectation with a penalty for the deviation of the uncertain parameters from their nominal values, which is measured with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We also show that a risk-sensitive MDP of minimizing an iterated risk measure that is composed of certain coherent risk measures is equivalent to a robust MDP of minimizing the worst-case expectation when the possible deviations of uncertain parameters from their nominal values are characterized with a concave function. 1</p><p>4 0.086516261 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Tractable_Objectives_for_Robust_Policy_Optimization.html">348 nips-2012-Tractable Objectives for Robust Policy Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Katherine Chen, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Robust policy optimization acknowledges that risk-aversion plays a vital role in real-world decision-making. When faced with uncertainty about the effects of actions, the policy that maximizes expected utility over the unknown parameters of the system may also carry with it a risk of intolerably poor performance. One might prefer to accept lower utility in expectation in order to avoid, or reduce the likelihood of, unacceptable levels of utility under harmful parameter realizations. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty, but unlike other methods avoid making any distributional assumptions about the form of this uncertainty. Instead we focus on identifying optimization objectives for which solutions can be efﬁciently approximated. We introduce percentile measures: a very general class of objectives for robust policy optimization, which encompasses most existing approaches, including ones known to be intractable. We then introduce a broad subclass of this family for which robust policies can be approximated efﬁciently. Finally, we frame these objectives in the context of a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game and employ a no-regret algorithm to approximate an optimal policy, with computation only polynomial in the number of states and actions of the MDP. 1</p><p>5 0.060845319 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Sequences_of_Signals_with_Sparse_Increments_via_Differential__1-Minimization.html">120 nips-2012-Exact and Stable Recovery of Sequences of Signals with Sparse Increments via Differential  1-Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Demba Ba, Behtash Babadi, Patrick Purdon, Emery Brown</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, (xk )K , for which k=0 the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse (with Sk typically smaller than S1 ), based on linear measurements (yk = Ak xk + ek )K , where Ak and ek denote the meak=1 surement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each Ak obeys the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain order—depending only on Sk —we show that in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum of the ℓ1 -norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement constraints, recovers the sequence (xk )K exactly. This is an interesting result bek=1 cause this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing problem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recovery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an application to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity.</p><p>6 0.046041988 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Interpreting_prediction_markets%3A_a_stochastic_approach.html">161 nips-2012-Interpreting prediction markets: a stochastic approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Doina Precup, Joelle Pineau, Andre S. Barreto</p><p>Abstract: Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) is an algorithm for solving reinforcement learning tasks with continuous state spaces which builds a Markov decision process (MDP) based on a set of sample transitions. What sets KBSF apart from other kernel-based approaches is the fact that the size of its MDP is independent of the number of transitions, which makes it possible to control the trade-off between the quality of the resulting approximation and the associated computational cost. However, KBSF’s memory usage grows linearly with the number of transitions, precluding its application in scenarios where a large amount of data must be processed. In this paper we show that it is possible to construct KBSF’s MDP in a fully incremental way, thus freeing the space complexity of this algorithm from its dependence on the number of sample transitions. The incremental version of KBSF is able to process an arbitrary amount of data, which results in a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can be used to solve continuous MDPs in both off-line and on-line regimes. We present theoretical results showing that KBSF can approximate the value function that would be computed by conventional kernel-based learning with arbitrary precision. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the challenging threepole balancing task, in which the ability to process a large number of transitions is crucial for success. 1</p><p>6 0.52554286 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Risk_Aversion_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_via_Near_Optimal_Chernoff_Bounds.html">296 nips-2012-Risk Aversion in Markov Decision Processes via Near Optimal Chernoff Bounds</a></p>

In this paper, we combine methods from game theory and decision theory to search for approximate equilibria in sequential auction domains, in which bidders do not know their opponents’ values for goods, bidders only partially observe the actions of their opponents’, and bidders demand multiple goods. We restrict attention to two-phased strategies: ﬁrst predict (i.e., learn); second, optimize. We use best-reply dynamics [4] for prediction (i.e., to predict other bidders’ strategies), and then assuming ﬁxed other-bidder strategies, we estimate and solve the ensuing Markov decision processes (MDP) [18] for optimization. We exploit auction properties to represent the MDP in a more compact state space, and we use Monte Carlo simulation to make estimating the MDP tractable. We show how equilibria found using our search procedure compare to known equilibria for simpler auction domains, and we approximate an equilibrium for a more complex auction domain where analytical solutions are unknown. 1</p><p>2 0.48755586 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Shifting_Weights%3A_Adapting_Object_Detectors_from_Image_to_Video.html">311 nips-2012-Shifting Weights: Adapting Object Detectors from Image to Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Vignesh Ramanathan, Li Fei-fei, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Typical object detectors trained on images perform poorly on video, as there is a clear distinction in domain between the two types of data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of adapting object detectors learned from images to work well on videos. We treat the problem as one of unsupervised domain adaptation, in which we are given labeled data from the source domain (image), but only unlabeled data from the target domain (video). Our approach, self-paced domain adaptation, seeks to iteratively adapt the detector by re-training the detector with automatically discovered target domain examples, starting with the easiest ﬁrst. At each iteration, the algorithm adapts by considering an increased number of target domain examples, and a decreased number of source domain examples. To discover target domain examples from the vast amount of video data, we introduce a simple, robust approach that scores trajectory tracks instead of bounding boxes. We also show how rich and expressive features speciﬁc to the target domain can be incorporated under the same framework. We show promising results on the 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection [1] and LabelMe Video [2] datasets that illustrate the beneﬁt of our approach to adapt object detectors to video. 1</p><p>3 0.42441684 <a title="45-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_for_High_Dimensional_Linear_Quadratic_Systems.html">110 nips-2012-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for High Dimensional Linear Quadratic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Morteza Ibrahimi, Adel Javanmard, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of adaptive control of a high dimensional linear quadratic (LQ) system. Previous work established the asymptotic convergence to an optimal controller for various adaptive control schemes. More recently, for the average √ cost LQ problem, a regret bound of O( T ) was shown, apart form logarithmic factors. However, this bound scales exponentially with p, the dimension of the state space. In this work we consider the case where the matrices describing the dynamic of the LQ system are sparse and their dimensions are large. We present √ an adaptive control scheme that achieves a regret bound of O(p T ), apart from logarithmic factors. In particular, our algorithm has an average cost of (1 + ) times the optimum cost after T = polylog(p)O(1/ 2 ). This is in comparison to previous work on the dense dynamics where the algorithm requires time that scales exponentially with dimension in order to achieve regret of times the optimal cost. We believe that our result has prominent applications in the emerging area of computational advertising, in particular targeted online advertising and advertising in social networks. 1</p><p>4 0.42438656 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>5 0.42372155 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Policy_Learning_from_Trajectory_Preference_Queries.html">3 nips-2012-A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Wilson, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning control policies via trajectory preference queries to an expert. In particular, the agent presents an expert with short runs of a pair of policies originating from the same state and the expert indicates which trajectory is preferred. The agent’s goal is to elicit a latent target policy from the expert with as few queries as possible. To tackle this problem we propose a novel Bayesian model of the querying process and introduce two methods that exploit this model to actively select expert queries. Experimental results on four benchmark problems indicate that our model can effectively learn policies from trajectory preference queries and that active query selection can be substantially more efﬁcient than random selection. 1</p><p>6 0.42358902 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Exploration_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Empirically_Estimating_Learning_Progress.html">122 nips-2012-Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress</a></p>

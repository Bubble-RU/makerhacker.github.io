<p>Author: Michael Collins, Shay B. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent-variable PCFGs, which have been shown to be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known in the multilinear algebra literature. We also describe an error bound for this approximation, which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are well approximated, then the probability distribution over trees will also be well approximated. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data demonstrates a signiﬁcant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance. 1</p><p>3 0.06861005 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Sparse_Approximate_Manifolds_for_Differential_Geometric_MCMC.html">318 nips-2012-Sparse Approximate Manifolds for Differential Geometric MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mátyás A. Sustik</p><p>Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology is the development of proposal mechanisms to make moves distant from the current point, that are accepted with high probability and at low computational cost. The recent introduction of locally adaptive MCMC methods based on the natural underlying Riemannian geometry of such models goes some way to alleviating these problems for certain classes of models for which the metric tensor is analytically tractable, however computational efﬁciency is not assured due to the necessity of potentially high-dimensional matrix operations at each iteration. In this paper we ﬁrstly investigate a sampling-based approach for approximating the metric tensor and suggest a valid MCMC algorithm that extends the applicability of Riemannian Manifold MCMC methods to statistical models that do not admit an analytically computable metric tensor. Secondly, we show how the approximation scheme we consider naturally motivates the use of 1 regularisation to improve estimates and obtain a sparse approximate inverse of the metric, which enables stable and sparse approximations of the local geometry to be made. We demonstrate the application of this algorithm for inferring the parameters of a realistic system of ordinary differential equations using a biologically motivated robust Student-t error model, for which the Expected Fisher Information is analytically intractable. 1</p><p>4 0.060519245 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Geometric_take_on_Metric_Learning.html">9 nips-2012-A Geometric take on Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Søren Hauberg, Oren Freifeld, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Multi-metric learning techniques learn local metric tensors in different parts of a feature space. With such an approach, even simple classiﬁers can be competitive with the state-of-the-art because the distance measure locally adapts to the structure of the data. The learned distance measure is, however, non-metric, which has prevented multi-metric learning from generalizing to tasks such as dimensionality reduction and regression in a principled way. We prove that, with appropriate changes, multi-metric learning corresponds to learning the structure of a Riemannian manifold. We then show that this structure gives us a principled way to perform dimensionality reduction and regression according to the learned metrics. Algorithmically, we provide the ﬁrst practical algorithm for computing geodesics according to the learned metrics, as well as algorithms for computing exponential and logarithmic maps on the Riemannian manifold. Together, these tools let many Euclidean algorithms take advantage of multi-metric learning. We illustrate the approach on regression and dimensionality reduction tasks that involve predicting measurements of the human body from shape data. 1 Learning and Computing Distances Statistics relies on measuring distances. When the Euclidean metric is insufﬁcient, as is the case in many real problems, standard methods break down. This is a key motivation behind metric learning, which strives to learn good distance measures from data. In the most simple scenarios a single metric tensor is learned, but in recent years, several methods have proposed learning multiple metric tensors, such that different distance measures are applied in different parts of the feature space. This has proven to be a very powerful approach for classiﬁcation tasks [1, 2], but the approach has not generalized to other tasks. Here we consider the generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression; see Fig. 1 for an illustration of our approach. The main problem with generalizing multi-metric learning is that it is based on assumptions that make the feature space both non-smooth and non-metric. Speciﬁcally, it is often assumed that straight lines form geodesic curves and that the metric tensor stays constant along these lines. These assumptions are made because it is believed that computing the actual geodesics is intractable, requiring a discretization of the entire feature space [3]. We solve these problems by smoothing the transitions between different metric tensors, which ensures a metric space where geodesics can be computed. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the metric tensor at a given point in feature space is deﬁned as the weighted average of a set of learned metric tensors. In this model, we prove that the feature space becomes a chart for a Riemannian manifold. This ensures a metric feature space, i.e. dist(x, y) = 0 ⇔ x = y , dist(x, y) = dist(y, x) (symmetry), (1) dist(x, z) ≤ dist(x, y) + dist(y, z) (triangle inequality). To compute statistics according to the learned metric, we need to be able to compute distances, which implies that we need to compute geodesics. Based on the observation that geodesics are 1 (a) Local Metrics & Geodesics (b) Tangent Space Representation (c) First Principal Geodesic Figure 1: Illustration of Principal Geodesic Analysis. (a) Geodesics are computed between the mean and each data point. (b) Data is mapped to the Euclidean tangent space and the ﬁrst principal component is computed. (c) The principal component is mapped back to the feature space. smooth curves in Riemannian spaces, we derive an algorithm for computing geodesics that only requires a discretization of the geodesic rather than the entire feature space. Furthermore, we show how to compute the exponential and logarithmic maps of the manifold. With this we can map any point back and forth between a Euclidean tangent space and the manifold. This gives us a general strategy for incorporating the learned metric tensors in many Euclidean algorithms: map the data to the tangent of the manifold, perform the Euclidean analysis and map the results back to the manifold. Before deriving the algorithms (Sec. 3) we set the scene by an analysis of the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art methods (Sec. 2), which motivate our ﬁnal model. The model is general and can be used for many problems. Here we illustrate it with several challenging problems in 3D body shape modeling and analysis (Sec. 4). All proofs can be found in the supplementary material along with algorithmic details and further experimental results. 2 Background and Related Work Single-metric learning learns a metric tensor, M, such that distances are measured as dist2 (xi , xj ) = xi − xj 2 M ≡ (xi − xj )T M(xi − xj ) , (2) where M is a symmetric and positive deﬁnite D × D matrix. Classic approaches for ﬁnding such a metric tensor include PCA, where the metric is given by the inverse covariance matrix of the training data; and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), where the metric tensor is M = S−1 SB S−1 , with Sw W W and SB being the within class scatter and the between class scatter respectively [9]. A more recent approach tries to learn a metric tensor from triplets of data points (xi , xj , xk ), where the metric should obey the constraint that dist(xi , xj ) < dist(xi , xk ). Here the constraints are often chosen such that xi and xj belong to the same class, while xi and xk do not. Various relaxed versions of this idea have been suggested such that the metric can be learned by solving a semi-deﬁnite or a quadratic program [1, 2, 4–8]. Among the most popular approaches is the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) classiﬁer [5], which ﬁnds a linear transformation that satisﬁes local distance constraints, making the approach suitable for multi-modal classes. For many problems, a single global metric tensor is not enough, which motivates learning several local metric tensors. The classic work by Hastie and Tibshirani [9] advocates locally learning metric tensors according to LDA and using these as part of a kNN classiﬁer. In a somewhat similar fashion, Weinberger and Saul [5] cluster the training data and learn a separate metric tensor for each cluster using LMNN. A more extreme point of view was taken by Frome et al. [1, 2], who learn a diagonal metric tensor for every point in the training set, such that distance rankings are preserved. Similarly, Malisiewicz and Efros [6] ﬁnd a diagonal metric tensor for each training point such that the distance to a subset of the training data from the same class is kept small. Once a set of metric tensors {M1 , . . . , MR } has been learned, the distance dist(a, b) is measured according to (2) where “the nearest” metric tensor is used, i.e. R M(x) = r=1 wr (x) ˜ Mr , where wr (x) = ˜ ˜ j wj (x) 1 0 x − xr 2 r ≤ x − xj M otherwise 2 Mj , ∀j , (3) where x is either a or b depending on the algorithm. Note that this gives a non-metric distance function as it is not symmetric. To derive this equation, it is necessary to assume that 1) geodesics 2 −8 −8 Assumed Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 −8 Actual Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 Riemannian Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 −4 −4 −4 −2 −2 −2 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 4 4 6 −8 6 −8 −6 −4 −2 0 (a) 2 4 6 −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 6 −8 −6 (b) −4 −2 (c) 0 2 4 6 (d) Figure 2: (a)–(b) An illustrative example where straight lines do not form geodesics and where the metric tensor does not stay constant along lines; see text for details.

(d) An illustration of the exponential and logarithmic maps. form straight lines, and 2) the metric tensor stays constant along these lines [3]. Both assumptions are problematic, which we illustrate with a simple example in Fig. 2a–c. Assume we are given two metric tensors M1 = 2I and M2 = I positioned at x1 = (2, 2)T and x2 = (4, 4)T respectively. This gives rise to two regions in feature space in which x1 is nearest in the ﬁrst and x2 is nearest in the second, according to (3). This is illustrated in Fig. 2a. In the same ﬁgure, we also show the assumed straight-line geodesics between selected points in space. As can be seen, two of the lines goes through both regions, such that the assumption of constant metric tensors along the line is violated. Hence, it would seem natural to measure the length of the line, by adding the length of the line segments which pass through the different regions of feature space. This was suggested by Ramanan and Baker [3] who also proposed a polynomial time algorithm for measuring these line lengths. This gives a symmetric distance function. Properly computing line lengths according to the local metrics is, however, not enough to ensure that the distance function is metric. As can be seen in Fig. 2a the straight line does not form a geodesic as a shorter path can be found by circumventing the region with the “expensive” metric tensor M1 as illustrated in Fig. 2b. This issue makes it trivial to construct cases where the triangle inequality is violated, which again makes the line length measure non-metric. In summary, if we want a metric feature space, we can neither assume that geodesics are straight lines nor that the metric tensor stays constant along such lines. In practice, good results have been reported using (3) [1,3,5], so it seems obvious to ask: is metricity required? For kNN classiﬁers this does not appear to be the case, with many successes based on dissimilarities rather than distances [10]. We, however, want to generalize PCA and linear regression, which both seek to minimize the reconstruction error of points projected onto a subspace. As the notion of projection is hard to deﬁne sensibly in non-metric spaces, we consider metricity essential. In order to build a model with a metric feature space, we change the weights in (3) to be smooth functions. This impose a well-behaved geometric structure on the feature space, which we take advantage of in order to perform statistical analysis according to the learned metrics. However, ﬁrst we review the basics of Riemannian geometry as this provides the theoretical foundation of our work. 2.1 Geodesics and Riemannian Geometry We start by deﬁning Riemannian manifolds, which intuitively are smoothly curved spaces equipped with an inner product. Formally, they are smooth manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric [11]: Deﬁnition A Riemannian metric M on a manifold M is a smoothly varying inner product < a, b >x = aT M(x)b in the tangent space Tx M of each point x ∈ M . 3 Often Riemannian manifolds are represented by a chart; i.e. a parameter space for the curved surface. An example chart is the spherical coordinate system often used to represent spheres. While such charts are often ﬂat spaces, the curvature of the manifold arises from the smooth changes in the metric. On a Riemannian manifold M, the length of a smooth curve c : [0, 1] → M is deﬁned as the integral of the norm of the tangent vector (interpreted as speed) along the curve: 1 Length(c) = 1 c (λ) M(c(λ)) dλ c (λ)T M(c(λ))c (λ)dλ , = (4) 0 0 where c denotes the derivative of c and M(c(λ)) is the metric tensor at c(λ). A geodesic curve is then a length-minimizing curve connecting two given points x and y, i.e. (5) cgeo = arg min Length(c) with c(0) = x and c(1) = y . c The distance between x and y is deﬁned as the length of the geodesic. Given a tangent vector v ∈ Tx M, there exists a unique geodesic cv (t) with initial velocity v at x. The Riemannian exponential map, Expx , maps v to a point on the manifold along the geodesic cv at t = 1. This mapping preserves distances such that dist(cv (0), cv (1)) = v . The inverse of the exponential map is the Riemannian logarithmic map denoted Logx . Informally, the exponential and logarithmic maps move points back and forth between the manifold and the tangent space while preserving distances (see Fig. 2d for an illustration). This provides a general strategy for generalizing many Euclidean techniques to Riemannian domains: data points are mapped to the tangent space, where ordinary Euclidean techniques are applied and the results are mapped back to the manifold. 3 A Metric Feature Space With the preliminaries settled we deﬁne the new model. Let C = RD denote the feature space. We endow C with a metric tensor in every point x, which we deﬁne akin to (3), R M(x) = wr (x)Mr , where wr (x) = r=1 wr (x) ˜ R ˜ j=1 wj (x) , (6) with wr > 0. The only difference from (3) is that we shall not restrict ourselves to binary weight ˜ functions wr . We assume the metric tensors Mr have already been learned; Sec. 4 contain examples ˜ where they have been learned using LMNN [5] and LDA [9]. From the deﬁnition of a Riemannian metric, we trivially have the following result: Lemma 1 The space C = RD endowed with the metric tensor from (6) is a chart of a Riemannian manifold, iff the weights wr (x) change smoothly with x. Hence, by only considering smooth weight functions wr we get a well-studied geometric structure ˜ on the feature space, which ensures us that it is metric. To illustrate the implications we return to the example in Fig. 2. We change the weight functions from binary to squared exponentials, which gives the feature space shown in Fig. 2c. As can be seen, the metric tensor now changes smoothly, which also makes the geodesics smooth curves (a property we will use when computing the geodesics). It is worth noting that Ramanan and Baker [3] also consider the idea of smoothly averaging the metric tensor. They, however, only evaluate the metric tensor at the test point of their classiﬁer and then assume straight line geodesics with a constant metric tensor. Such assumptions violate the premise of a smoothly changing metric tensor and, again, the distance measure becomes non-metric. Lemma 1 shows that metric learning can be viewed as manifold learning. The main difference between our approach and techniques such as Isomap [12] is that, while Isomap learns an embedding of the data points, we learn the actual manifold structure. This gives us the beneﬁt that we can compute geodesics as well as the exponential and logarithmic maps. These provide us with mappings back and forth between the manifold and Euclidean representation of the data, which preserve distances as well as possible. The availability of such mappings is in stark contrast to e.g. Isomap. In the next section we will derive a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE’s) that geodesics in C have to satisfy, which provides us with algorithms for computing geodesics as well as exponential and logarithmic maps. With these we can generalize many Euclidean techniques. 4 3.1 Computing Geodesics, Maps and Statistics At minima of (4) we know that the Euler-Lagrange equation must hold [11], i.e. ∂L d ∂L , where L(λ, c, c ) = c (λ)T M(c(λ))c (λ) . = ∂c dλ ∂c As we have an explicit expression for the metric tensor we can compute (7) in closed form: (7) Theorem 2 Geodesic curves in C satisfy the following system of 2nd order ODE’s M(c(λ))c (λ) = − 1 ∂vec [M(c(λ))] 2 ∂c(λ) T (c (λ) ⊗ c (λ)) , (8) where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product and vec [·] stacks the columns of a matrix into a vector [13]. Proof See supplementary material. This result holds for any smooth weight functions wr . We, however, still need to compute ∂vec[M] , ˜ ∂c which depends on the speciﬁc choice of wr . Any smooth weighting scheme is applicable, but we ˜ restrict ourselves to the obvious smooth generalization of (3) and use squared exponentials. From this assumption, we get the following result Theorem 3 For wr (x) = exp − ρ x − xr ˜ 2 ∂vec [M(c)] = ∂c the derivative of the metric tensor from (6) is R ρ R j=1 2 Mr R 2 wj ˜ T r=1 T wj (c − xj ) Mj − (c − xr ) Mr ˜ wr vec [Mr ] ˜ . (9) j=1 Proof See supplementary material. Computing Geodesics. Any geodesic curve must be a solution to (8). Hence, to compute a geodesic between x and y, we can solve (8) subject to the constraints c(0) = x and c(1) = y . (10) This is a boundary value problem, which has a smooth solution. This allows us to solve the problem numerically using a standard three-stage Lobatto IIIa formula, which provides a fourth-order accurate C 1 –continuous solution [14]. Ramanan and Baker [3] discuss the possibility of computing geodesics, but arrive at the conclusion that this is intractable based on the assumption that it requires discretizing the entire feature space. Our solution avoids discretizing the feature space by discretizing the geodesic curve instead. As this is always one-dimensional the approach remains tractable in high-dimensional feature spaces. Computing Logarithmic Maps. Once a geodesic c is found, it follows from the deﬁnition of the logarithmic map, Logx (y), that it can be computed as v = Logx (y) = c (0) Length(c) . c (0) (11) In practice, we solve (8) by rewriting it as a system of ﬁrst order ODE’s, such that we compute both c and c simultaneously (see supplementary material for details). Computing Exponential Maps. Given a starting point x on the manifold and a vector v in the tangent space, the exponential map, Expx (v), ﬁnds the unique geodesic starting at x with initial velocity v. As the geodesic must fulﬁll (8), we can compute the exponential map by solving this system of ODE’s with the initial conditions c(0) = x and c (0) = v . (12) This initial value problem has a unique solution, which we ﬁnd numerically using a standard RungeKutta scheme [15]. 5 3.1.1 Generalizing PCA and Regression At this stage, we know that the feature space is Riemannian and we know how to compute geodesics and exponential and logarithmic maps. We now seek to generalize PCA and linear regression, which becomes straightforward since solutions are available in Riemannian spaces [16, 17]. These generalizations can be summarized as mapping the data to the tangent space at the mean, performing standard Euclidean analysis in the tangent and mapping the results back. The ﬁrst step is to compute the mean value on the manifold, which is deﬁned as the point that minimizes the sum-of-squares distances to the data points. Pennec [18] provides an efﬁcient gradient descent approach for computing this point, which we also summarize in the supplementary material. The empirical covariance of a set of points is deﬁned as the ordinary Euclidean covariance in the tangent space at the mean value [18]. With this in mind, it is not surprising that the principal components of a dataset have been generalized as the geodesics starting at the mean with initial velocity corresponding to the eigenvectors of the covariance [16], γvd (t) = Expµ (tvd ) , (13) th where vd denotes the d eigenvector of the covariance. This approach is called Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA), and the geodesic curve γvd is called the principal geodesic. An illustration of the approach can be seen in Fig. 1 and more algorithmic details are in the supplementary material. Linear regression has been generalized in a similar way [17] by performing regression in the tangent of the mean and mapping the resulting line back to the manifold using the exponential map. The idea of working in the tangent space is both efﬁcient and convenient, but comes with an element of approximation as the logarithmic map is only guarantied to preserve distances to the origin of the tangent and not between all pairs of data points. Practical experience, however, indicates that this is a good tradeoff; see [19] for a more in-depth discussion of when the approximation is suitable. 4 Experiments To illustrate the framework1 we consider an example in human body analysis, and then we analyze the scalability of the approach. But ﬁrst, to build intuition, Fig. 3a show synthetically generated data samples from two classes. We sample random points xr and learn a local LDA metric [9] by considering all data points within a radius; this locally pushes the two classes apart. We combine the local metrics using (6) and Fig. 3b show the data in the tangent space of the resulting manifold. As can be seen the two classes are now globally further apart, which shows the effect of local metrics. 4.1 Human Body Shape We consider a regression example concerning human body shape analysis. We study 986 female body laser scans from the CAESAR [20] data set; each shape is represented using the leading 35 principal components of the data learned using a SCAPE-like model [21, 22]. Each shape is associated with anthropometric measurements such as body height, shoe size, etc. We show results for shoulder to wrist distance and shoulder breadth, but results for more measurements are in the supplementary material. To predict the measurements from shape coefﬁcients, we learn local metrics and perform linear regression according to these. As a further experiment, we use PGA to reduce the dimensionality of the shape coefﬁcients according to the local metrics, and measure the quality of the reduction by performing linear regression to predict the measurements. As a baseline we use the corresponding Euclidean techniques. To learn the local metric we do the following. First we whiten the data such that the variance captured by PGA will only be due to the change of metric; this allows easy visualization of the impact of the learned metrics. We then cluster the body shapes into equal-sized clusters according to the measurement and learn a LMNN metric for each cluster [5], which we associate with the mean of each class. These push the clusters apart, which introduces variance along the directions where the measurement changes. From this we construct a Riemannian manifold according to (6), 1 Our software implementation for computing geodesics and performing manifold statistics is available at http://ps.is.tue.mpg.de/project/Smooth Metric Learning 6 30 Euclidean Model Riemannian Model 24 20 18 16 20 15 10 5 14 12 0 (a) 25 22 Running Time (sec.)

Right: regression error as a function of the dimensionality of the shape space; again the Euclidean metric and the Riemannian metric are compared. compute the mean value on the manifold, map the data to the tangent space at the mean and perform linear regression in the tangent space. As a ﬁrst visualization we plot the data expressed in the leading two dimensions of PGA in Fig. 4; as can be seen the learned metrics provide principal geodesics, which are more strongly related with the measurements than the Euclidean model. In order to predict the measurements from the body shape, we perform linear regression, both directly in the shape space according to the Euclidean metric and in the tangent space of the manifold corresponding to the learned metrics (using the logarithmic map from (11)). We measure the prediction error using leave-one-out cross-validation. To further illustrate the power of the PGA model, we repeat this experiment for different dimensionalities of the data. The results are plotted in Fig. 4, showing that regression according to the learned metrics outperforms the Euclidean model. To verify that the learned metrics improve accuracy, we average the prediction errors over all millimeter measurements. The result in Fig. 3c shows that much can be gained in lower dimensions by using the local metrics. To provide visual insights into the behavior of the learned metrics, we uniformly sample body shape along the ﬁrst principal geodesic (in the range ±7 times the standard deviation) according to the different metrics. The results are available as a movie in the supplementary material, but are also shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the learned metrics pick up intuitive relationships between body shape and the measurements, e.g. shoulder to wrist distance is related to overall body size, while shoulder breadth is related to body weight. 7 Shoulder to wrist distance Shoulder breadth Figure 5: Shapes corresponding to the mean (center) and ±7 times the standard deviations along the principal geodesics (left and right). Movies are available in the supplementary material. 4.2 Scalability The human body data set is small enough (986 samples in 35 dimensions) that computing a geodesic only takes a few seconds. To show that the current unoptimized Matlab implementation can handle somewhat larger datasets, we brieﬂy consider a dimensionality reduction task on the classic MNIST handwritten digit data set. We use the preprocessed data available with [3] where the original 28×28 gray scale images were deskewed and projected onto their leading 164 Euclidean principal components (which captures 95% of the variance in the original data). We learn one diagonal LMNN metric per class, which we associate with the mean of the class. From this we construct a Riemannian manifold from (6), compute the mean value on the manifold and compute geodesics between the mean and each data point; this is the computationally expensive part of performing PGA. Fig. 3d plots the average running time (sec) for the computation of geodesics as a function of the dimensionality of the training data. A geodesic can be computed in 100 dimensions in approximately 5 sec., whereas in 150 dimensions it takes about 30 sec. In this experiment, we train a PGA model on 60,000 data points, and test a nearest neighbor classiﬁer in the tangent space as we decrease the dimensionality of the model. Compared to a Euclidean model, this gives a modest improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy of 2.3 percent, when averaged across different dimensionalities. Plots of the results can be found in the supplementary material. 5 Discussion This work shows that multi-metric learning techniques are indeed applicable outside the realm of kNN classiﬁers. The idea of deﬁning the metric tensor at any given point as the weighted average of a ﬁnite set of learned metrics is quite natural from a modeling point of view, which is also validated by the Riemannian structure of the resulting space. This opens both a theoretical and a practical toolbox for analyzing and developing algorithms that use local metric tensors. Speciﬁcally, we show how to use local metric tensors for both regression and dimensionality reduction tasks. Others have attempted to solve non-classiﬁcation problems using local metrics, but we feel that our approach is the ﬁrst to have a solid theoretical backing. For example, Hastie and Tibshirani [9] use local LDA metrics for dimensionality reduction by averaging the local metrics and using the resulting metric as part of a Euclidean PCA, which essentially is a linear approach. Another approach was suggested by Hong et al. [23] who simply compute the principal components according to each metric separately, such that one low dimensional model is learned per metric. The suggested approach is, however, not difﬁculty-free in its current implementation. Currently, we are using off-the-shelf numerical solvers for computing geodesics, which can be computationally demanding. While we managed to analyze medium-sized datasets, we believe that the run-time can be drastically improved by developing specialized numerical solvers. In the experiments, we learned local metrics using techniques specialized for classiﬁcation tasks as this is all the current literature provides. We expect improvements by learning the metrics speciﬁcally for regression and dimensionality reduction, but doing so is currently an open problem.

<p>Author: James Lloyd, Peter Orbanz, Zoubin Ghahramani, Daniel M. Roy</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in the analysis of structured relational data like graphs, networks, databases, and matrices is to extract a summary of the common structure underlying relations between individual entities. Relational data are typically encoded in the form of arrays; invariance to the ordering of rows and columns corresponds to exchangeable arrays. Results in probability theory due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg show that exchangeable arrays can be represented in terms of a random measurable function which constitutes the natural model parameter in a Bayesian model. We obtain a ﬂexible yet simple Bayesian nonparametric model by placing a Gaussian process prior on the parameter function. Efﬁcient inference utilises elliptical slice sampling combined with a random sparse approximation to the Gaussian process. We demonstrate applications of the model to network data and clarify its relation to models in the literature, several of which emerge as special cases. 1</p><p>6 0.051931597 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Low-Rank_Subspace_Clustering.html">277 nips-2012-Probabilistic Low-Rank Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: For modeling data matrices, this paper introduces Probabilistic Co-Subspace Addition (PCSA) model by simultaneously capturing the dependent structures among both rows and columns. Brieﬂy, PCSA assumes that each entry of a matrix is generated by the additive combination of the linear mappings of two low-dimensional features, which distribute in the row-wise and column-wise latent subspaces respectively. In consequence, PCSA captures the dependencies among entries intricately, and is able to handle non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic densities. By formulating the posterior updating into the task of solving Sylvester equations, we propose an efﬁcient variational inference algorithm. Furthermore, PCSA is extended to tackling and ﬁlling missing values, to adapting model sparseness, and to modelling tensor data. In comparison with several state-of-art methods, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of Bayesian (sparse) PCSA on modeling matrix (tensor) data and ﬁlling missing values.</p><p>2 0.66213286 <a title="54-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Tensor_Decomposition_for_Fast_Parsing_with_Latent-Variable_PCFGs.html">334 nips-2012-Tensor Decomposition for Fast Parsing with Latent-Variable PCFGs</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Collins, Shay B. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent-variable PCFGs, which have been shown to be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known in the multilinear algebra literature. We also describe an error bound for this approximation, which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are well approximated, then the probability distribution over trees will also be well approximated. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data demonstrates a signiﬁcant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance. 1</p><p>3 0.60839814 <a title="54-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Sparse_Approximate_Manifolds_for_Differential_Geometric_MCMC.html">318 nips-2012-Sparse Approximate Manifolds for Differential Geometric MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mátyás A. Sustik</p><p>Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology is the development of proposal mechanisms to make moves distant from the current point, that are accepted with high probability and at low computational cost. The recent introduction of locally adaptive MCMC methods based on the natural underlying Riemannian geometry of such models goes some way to alleviating these problems for certain classes of models for which the metric tensor is analytically tractable, however computational efﬁciency is not assured due to the necessity of potentially high-dimensional matrix operations at each iteration. In this paper we ﬁrstly investigate a sampling-based approach for approximating the metric tensor and suggest a valid MCMC algorithm that extends the applicability of Riemannian Manifold MCMC methods to statistical models that do not admit an analytically computable metric tensor. Secondly, we show how the approximation scheme we consider naturally motivates the use of 1 regularisation to improve estimates and obtain a sparse approximate inverse of the metric, which enables stable and sparse approximations of the local geometry to be made. We demonstrate the application of this algorithm for inferring the parameters of a realistic system of ordinary differential equations using a biologically motivated robust Student-t error model, for which the Expected Fisher Information is analytically intractable. 1</p><p>4 0.5631749 <a title="54-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Multi-task_Vector_Field_Learning.html">225 nips-2012-Multi-task Vector Field Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Sen Yang, Chiyuan Zhang, Jieping Ye, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve generalization performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously and identifying the shared information among tasks. Most of existing MTL methods focus on learning linear models under the supervised setting. We propose a novel semi-supervised and nonlinear approach for MTL using vector ﬁelds. A vector ﬁeld is a smooth mapping from the manifold to the tangent spaces which can be viewed as a directional derivative of functions on the manifold. We argue that vector ﬁelds provide a natural way to exploit the geometric structure of data as well as the shared differential structure of tasks, both of which are crucial for semi-supervised multi-task learning. In this paper, we develop multi-task vector ﬁeld learning (MTVFL) which learns the predictor functions and the vector ﬁelds simultaneously. MTVFL has the following key properties. (1) The vector ﬁelds MTVFL learns are close to the gradient ﬁelds of the predictor functions. (2) Within each task, the vector ﬁeld is required to be as parallel as possible which is expected to span a low dimensional subspace. (3) The vector ﬁelds from all tasks share a low dimensional subspace. We formalize our idea in a regularization framework and also provide a convex relaxation method to solve the original non-convex problem. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.50733268 <a title="54-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_latent_factor_model_for_highly_multi-relational_data.html">22 nips-2012-A latent factor model for highly multi-relational data</a></p>
<p>Author: Rodolphe Jenatton, Nicolas L. Roux, Antoine Bordes, Guillaume R. Obozinski</p><p>Abstract: Many data such as social networks, movie preferences or knowledge bases are multi-relational, in that they describe multiple relations between entities. While there is a large body of work focused on modeling these data, modeling these multiple types of relations jointly remains challenging. Further, existing approaches tend to breakdown when the number of these types grows. In this paper, we propose a method for modeling large multi-relational datasets, with possibly thousands of relations. Our model is based on a bilinear structure, which captures various orders of interaction of the data, and also shares sparse latent factors across different relations. We illustrate the performance of our approach on standard tensor-factorization datasets where we attain, or outperform, state-of-the-art results. Finally, a NLP application demonstrates our scalability and the ability of our model to learn efﬁcient and semantically meaningful verb representations. 1</p><p>6 0.50273836 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Training_sparse_natural_image_models_with_a_fast_Gibbs_sampler_of_an_extended_state_space.html">349 nips-2012-Training sparse natural image models with a fast Gibbs sampler of an extended state space</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level 3D object detection. Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects in 3D by enclosing them with tight oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model [1] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efﬁciency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are continuous in our model.

Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: Early stages of sensory systems face the challenge of compressing information from numerous receptors onto a much smaller number of projection neurons, a so called communication bottleneck. To make more efficient use of limited bandwidth, compression may be achieved using predictive coding, whereby predictable, or redundant, components of the stimulus are removed. In the case of the retina, Srinivasan et al. (1982) suggested that feedforward inhibitory connections subtracting a linear prediction generated from nearby receptors implement such compression, resulting in biphasic center-surround receptive fields. However, feedback inhibitory circuits are common in early sensory circuits and furthermore their dynamics may be nonlinear. Can such circuits implement predictive coding as well? Here, solving the transient dynamics of nonlinear reciprocal feedback circuits through analogy to a signal-processing algorithm called linearized Bregman iteration we show that nonlinear predictive coding can be implemented in an inhibitory feedback circuit. In response to a step stimulus, interneuron activity in time constructs progressively less sparse but more accurate representations of the stimulus, a temporally evolving prediction. This analysis provides a powerful theoretical framework to interpret and understand the dynamics of early sensory processing in a variety of physiological experiments and yields novel predictions regarding the relation between activity and stimulus statistics.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.64666098 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_Probabilistic_Co-Subspace_Addition.html">54 nips-2012-Bayesian Probabilistic Co-Subspace Addition</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: For modeling data matrices, this paper introduces Probabilistic Co-Subspace Addition (PCSA) model by simultaneously capturing the dependent structures among both rows and columns. Brieﬂy, PCSA assumes that each entry of a matrix is generated by the additive combination of the linear mappings of two low-dimensional features, which distribute in the row-wise and column-wise latent subspaces respectively. In consequence, PCSA captures the dependencies among entries intricately, and is able to handle non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic densities. By formulating the posterior updating into the task of solving Sylvester equations, we propose an efﬁcient variational inference algorithm. Furthermore, PCSA is extended to tackling and ﬁlling missing values, to adapting model sparseness, and to modelling tensor data. In comparison with several state-of-art methods, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of Bayesian (sparse) PCSA on modeling matrix (tensor) data and ﬁlling missing values.</p><p>4 0.62479925 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Isotropic_Hashing.html">163 nips-2012-Isotropic Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Weihao Kong, Wu-jun Li</p><p>Abstract: Most existing hashing methods adopt some projection functions to project the original data into several dimensions of real values, and then each of these projected dimensions is quantized into one bit (zero or one) by thresholding. Typically, the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not veriﬁed by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to ﬁnd a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called isotropic hashing (IsoHash), to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions, which veriﬁes the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances. 1</p><p>5 0.60937464 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Spike-Coding_with_Multiplicative_Adaptation_in_a_Spike_Response_Model.html">112 nips-2012-Efficient Spike-Coding with Multiplicative Adaptation in a Spike Response Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: Neural adaptation underlies the ability of neurons to maximize encoded information over a wide dynamic range of input stimuli. Recent spiking neuron models like the adaptive Spike Response Model implement adaptation as additive ﬁxed-size fast spike-triggered threshold dynamics and slow spike-triggered currents. Such adaptation accurately models neural spiking behavior over a limited dynamic input range. To extend efﬁcient coding over large changes in dynamic input range, we propose a multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model where the spike-triggered adaptation dynamics are scaled multiplicatively by the adaptation state at the time of spiking. We show that, unlike the additive adaptation model, the ﬁring rate in our multiplicative adaptation model saturates to a realistic maximum spike-rate regardless of input magnitude. Additionally, when simulating variance switching experiments, the model quantitatively ﬁts experimental data over a wide dynamic range. Dynamic threshold models of adaptation furthermore suggest a straightforward interpretation of neural activity in terms of dynamic differential signal encoding with shifted and weighted exponential kernels. We show that when thus encoding rectiﬁed ﬁltered stimulus signals, the multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model achieves a high coding efﬁciency and maintains this efﬁciency over changes in the dynamic signal range of several orders of magnitude, without changing model parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.51749778 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Spectral_learning_of_linear_dynamics_from_generalised-linear_observations_with_application_to_neural_population_data.html">321 nips-2012-Spectral learning of linear dynamics from generalised-linear observations with application to neural population data</a></p>

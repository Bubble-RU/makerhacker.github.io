<p>Author: Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of general supervised learning when data can only be accessed through an (indeﬁnite) similarity function between data points. Existing work on learning with indeﬁnite kernels has concentrated solely on binary/multiclass classiﬁcation problems. We propose a model that is generic enough to handle any supervised learning task and also subsumes the model previously proposed for classiﬁcation. We give a “goodness” criterion for similarity functions w.r.t. a given supervised learning task and then adapt a well-known landmarking technique to provide efﬁcient algorithms for supervised learning using “good” similarity functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three important supervised learning problems: a) real-valued regression, b) ordinal regression and c) ranking where we show that our method guarantees bounded generalization error. Furthermore, for the case of real-valued regression, we give a natural goodness deﬁnition that, when used in conjunction with a recent result in sparse vector recovery, guarantees a sparse predictor with bounded generalization error. Finally, we report results of our learning algorithms on regression and ordinal regression tasks using non-PSD similarity functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, especially that of the sparse landmark selection algorithm that achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracies than the baseline methods while offering reduced computational costs. 1</p><p>3 0.24477115 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Angular_Quantization-based_Binary_Codes_for_Fast_Similarity_Search.html">42 nips-2012-Angular Quantization-based Binary Codes for Fast Similarity Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Yunchao Gong, Sanjiv Kumar, Vishal Verma, Svetlana Lazebnik</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of learning binary codes for efﬁcient retrieval of high-dimensional non-negative data that arises in vision and text applications where counts or frequencies are used as features. The similarity of such feature vectors is commonly measured using the cosine of the angle between them. In this work, we introduce a novel angular quantization-based binary coding (AQBC) technique for such data and analyze its properties. In its most basic form, AQBC works by mapping each non-negative feature vector onto the vertex of the binary hypercube with which it has the smallest angle. Even though the number of vertices (quantization landmarks) in this scheme grows exponentially with data dimensionality d, we propose a method for mapping feature vectors to their smallest-angle binary vertices that scales as O(d log d). Further, we propose a method for learning a linear transformation of the data to minimize the quantization error, and show that it results in improved binary codes. Experiments on image and text datasets show that the proposed AQBC method outperforms the state of the art. 1</p><p>4 0.18192051 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-3D_Object_Detection_and_Viewpoint_Estimation_with_a_Deformable_3D_Cuboid_Model.html">1 nips-2012-3D Object Detection and Viewpoint Estimation with a Deformable 3D Cuboid Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level 3D object detection. Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects in 3D by enclosing them with tight oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model [1] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efﬁciency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are continuous in our model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the stateof-the-art in both 2D [1] and 3D object detection [2]. 1</p><p>5 0.16667706 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>6 0.15941761 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Mixtures_of_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">180 nips-2012-Learning Mixtures of Tree Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we seek to detect rectangular cuboids and localize their corners in uncalibrated single-view images depicting everyday scenes. In contrast to recent approaches that rely on detecting vanishing points of the scene and grouping line segments to form cuboids, we build a discriminative parts-based detector that models the appearance of the cuboid corners and internal edges while enforcing consistency to a 3D cuboid model. Our model copes with different 3D viewpoints and aspect ratios and is able to detect cuboids across many different object categories. We introduce a database of images with cuboid annotations that spans a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and show qualitative and quantitative results on our collected database. Our model out-performs baseline detectors that use 2D constraints alone on the task of localizing cuboid corners. 1</p><p>5 0.44299313 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Generative_Model_for_Parts-based_Object_Segmentation.html">8 nips-2012-A Generative Model for Parts-based Object Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Eslami, Christopher Williams</p><p>Abstract: The Shape Boltzmann Machine (SBM) [1] has recently been introduced as a stateof-the-art model of foreground/background object shape. We extend the SBM to account for the foreground object’s parts. Our new model, the Multinomial SBM (MSBM), can capture both local and global statistics of part shapes accurately. We combine the MSBM with an appearance model to form a fully generative model of images of objects. Parts-based object segmentations are obtained simply by performing probabilistic inference in the model. We apply the model to two challenging datasets which exhibit signiﬁcant shape and appearance variability, and ﬁnd that it obtains results that are comparable to the state-of-the-art. There has been signiﬁcant focus in computer vision on object recognition and detection e.g. [2], but a strong desire remains to obtain richer descriptions of objects than just their bounding boxes. One such description is a parts-based object segmentation, in which an image is partitioned into multiple sets of pixels, each belonging to either a part of the object of interest, or its background. The signiﬁcance of parts in computer vision has been recognized since the earliest days of the ﬁeld (e.g. [3, 4, 5]), and there exists a rich history of work on probabilistic models for parts-based segmentation e.g. [6, 7]. Many such models only consider local neighborhood statistics, however several models have recently been proposed that aim to increase the accuracy of segmentations by also incorporating prior knowledge about the foreground object’s shape [8, 9, 10, 11]. In such cases, probabilistic techniques often mainly differ in how accurately they represent and learn about the variability exhibited by the shapes of the object’s parts. Accurate models of the shapes and appearances of parts can be necessary to perform inference in datasets that exhibit large amounts of variability. In general, the stronger the models of these two components, the more performance is improved. A generative model has the added beneﬁt of being able to generate samples, which allows us to visually inspect the quality of its understanding of the data and the problem. Recently, a generative probabilistic model known as the Shape Boltzmann Machine (SBM) has been used to model binary object shapes [1]. The SBM has been shown to constitute the state-of-the-art and it possesses several highly desirable characteristics: samples from the model look realistic, and it generalizes to generate samples that differ from the limited number of examples it is trained on. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) In order to account for object parts we extend the SBM to use multinomial visible units instead of binary ones, resulting in the Multinomial Shape Boltzmann Machine (MSBM), and we demonstrate that the MSBM constitutes a strong model of parts-based object shape. 2) We combine the MSBM with an appearance model to form a fully generative model of images of objects (see Fig. 1). We show how parts-based object segmentations can be obtained simply by performing probabilistic inference in the model. We apply our model to two challenging datasets and ﬁnd that in addition to being principled and fully generative, the model’s performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art. 1 Train labels Train images Test image Appearance model Joint Model Shape model Parsing Figure 1: Overview. Using annotated images separate models of shape and appearance are trained. Given an unseen test image, its parsing is obtained via inference in the proposed joint model. In Secs. 1 and 2 we present the model and propose efﬁcient inference and learning schemes. In Sec. 3 we compare and contrast the resulting joint model with existing work in the literature. We describe our experimental results in Sec. 4 and conclude with a discussion in Sec. 5. 1 Model We consider datasets of cropped images of an object class. We assume that the images are constructed through some combination of a ﬁxed number of parts. Given a dataset D = {Xd }, d = 1...n of such images X, each consisting of P pixels {xi }, i = 1...P , we wish to infer a segmentation S for the image. S consists of a labeling si for every pixel, where si is a 1-of-(L+1) encoded variable, and L is the ﬁxed number of parts that combine to generate the foreground. In other words, si = (sli ), P l = 0...L, sli 2 {0, 1} and l sli = 1. Note that the background is also treated as a ‘part’ (l = 0). Accurate inference of S is driven by models for 1) part shapes and 2) part appearances. Part shapes: Several types of models can be used to deﬁne probabilistic distributions over segmentations S. The simplest approach is to model each pixel si independently with categorical variables whose parameters are speciﬁed by the object’s mean shape (Fig. 2(a)). Markov Random Fields (MRFs, Fig. 2(b)) additionally model interactions between nearby pixels using pairwise potential functions that efﬁciently capture local properties of images like smoothness and continuity. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and their multi-layered counterparts Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs, Fig. 2(c)) make heavy use of hidden variables to efﬁciently deﬁne higher-order potentials that take into account the conﬁguration of larger groups of image pixels. The introduction of such hidden variables provides a way to efﬁciently capture complex, global properties of image pixels. RBMs and DBMs are powerful generative models, but they also have many parameters. Segmented images, however, are expensive to obtain and datasets are typically small (hundreds of examples). In order to learn a model that accurately captures the properties of part shapes we use DBMs but also impose carefully chosen connectivity and capacity constraints, following the structure of the Shape Boltzmann Machine (SBM) [1]. We further extend the model to account for multi-part shapes to obtain the Multinomial Shape Boltzmann Machine (MSBM). The MSBM has two layers of latent variables: h1 and h2 (collectively H = {h1 , h2 }), and deﬁnes a P Boltzmann distribution over segmentations p(S) = h1 ,h2 exp{ E(S, h1 , h2 |✓s )}/Z(✓s ) where X X X X X 1 2 E(S, h1 , h2 |✓s ) = bli sli + wlij sli h1 + c 1 h1 + wjk h1 h2 + c2 h2 , (1) j j j j k k k i,l j i,j,l j,k k where j and k range over the ﬁrst and second layer hidden variables, and ✓s = {W 1 , W 2 , b, c1 , c2 } are the shape model parameters. In the ﬁrst layer, local receptive ﬁelds are enforced by connecting each hidden unit in h1 only to a subset of the visible units, corresponding to one of four patches, as shown in Fig. 2(d,e). Each patch overlaps its neighbor by b pixels, which allows boundary continuity to be learned at the lowest layer. We share weights between the four sets of ﬁrst-layer hidden units and patches, and purposely restrict the number of units in h2 . These modiﬁcations signiﬁcantly reduce the number of parameters whilst taking into account an important property of shapes, namely that the strongest dependencies between pixels are typically local. 2 h2 1 1 h S S (a) Mean h S (b) MRF h2 h2 h1 S S (c) DBM b (d) SBM (e) 2D SBM Figure 2: Models of shape.

During pre-training, the means {µw } and covariances {⌃w } of these Gaussians are extracted by training a mixture model with W components on every pixel in the dataset, ignoring image and part structure. It is also assumed that each of the L parts can have different appearances in different images, and that these appearances can be clustered into K classes. The classes differ in how likely they are to use each of the W components when ‘coloring in’ the part. The generative process is as follows. For part l in an image, one of the K classes is chosen (represented by a 1-of-K indicator variable al ). Given al , the probability distribution deﬁned on pixels associated with part l is given by a Gaussian mixture model with means {µw } and covariances {⌃w } and mixing proportions { lkw }. The prior on A = {al } speciﬁes the probability ⇡lk of appearance class k being chosen for part l. Therefore appearance parameters ✓a = {⇡lk , lkw } (see Fig. 3) and: a p(xi |A, si , ✓ ) = p(A|✓a ) = Y l Y l a sli p(xi |al , ✓ ) p(al |✓a ) = = Y Y X YY l l k w lkw N (xi |µw , ⌃w ) !alk !sli (⇡lk )alk . , (2) (3) k Combining shapes and appearances: To summarize, the latent variables for X are A, S, H, and the model’s active parameters ✓ include shape parameters ✓s and appearance parameters ✓a , so that p(X, A, S, H|✓) = Y 1 p(A|✓a )p(S, H|✓s ) p(xi |A, si , ✓a ) , Z( ) i (4) where the parameter adjusts the relative contributions of the shape and appearance components. See Fig. 4 for an illustration of the complete graphical model. During learning, we ﬁnd the values of ✓ that maximize the likelihood of the training data D, and segmentation is performed on a previously-unseen image by querying the marginal distribution p(S|Xtest , ✓). Note that Z( ) is constant throughout the execution of the algorithms. We set via trial and error in our experiments. 3 n H ✓a si al H xi L+1 ✓s S X A P Figure 4: A model of shape and appearance. Left: The joint model. Pixels xi are modeled via appearance variables al . The model’s belief about each layer’s shape is captured by shape variables H. Segmentation variables si assign each pixel to a layer. Right: Schematic for an image X. 2 Inference and learning Inference: We approximate p(A, S, H|X, ✓) by drawing samples of A, S and H using block-Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The desired distribution p(S|X, ✓) can then be obtained by considering only the samples for S (see Algorithm 1). In order to sample p(A|S, H, X, ✓) we consider the conditional distribution of appearance class k being chosen for part l which is given by: Q P ·s ⇡lk i ( w lkw N (xi |µw , ⌃w )) li h Q P i. p(alk = 1|S, X, ✓) = P (5) K ·sli r=1 ⇡lr i( w lrw N (xi |µw , ⌃w )) Since the MSBM only has edges between each pair of adjacent layers, all hidden units within a layer are conditionally independent given the units in the other two layers. This property can be exploited to make inference in the shape model exact and efﬁcient. The conditional probabilities are: X X 1 2 p(h1 = 1|s, h2 , ✓) = ( wlij sli + wjk h2 + c1 ), (6) j k j i,l p(h2 k 1 = 1|h , ✓) = ( X k 2 wjk h1 j + c2 ), j (7) j where (y) = 1/(1 + exp( y)) is the sigmoid function. To sample from p(H|S, X, ✓) we iterate between Eqns. 6 and 7 multiple times and keep only the ﬁnal values of h1 and h2 . Finally, we draw samples for the pixels in p(S|A, H, X, ✓) independently: P 1 exp( j wlij h1 + bli ) p(xi |A, sli = 1, ✓) j p(sli = 1|A, H, X, ✓) = PL . (8) P 1 1 m=1 exp( j wmij hj + bmi ) p(xi |A, smi = 1, ✓) Seeding: Since the latent-space is extremely high-dimensional, in practice we ﬁnd it helpful to run several inference chains, each initializing S(1) to a different value. The ‘best’ inference is retained and the others are discarded. The computation of the likelihood p(X|✓) of image X is intractable, so we approximate the quality of each inference using a scoring function: 1X Score(X|✓) = p(X, A(t) , S(t) , H(t) |✓), (9) T t where {A(t) , S(t) , H(t) }, t = 1...T are the samples obtained from the posterior p(A, S, H|X, ✓). If the samples were drawn from the prior p(A, S, H|✓) the scoring function would be an unbiased estimator of p(X|✓), but would be wildly inaccurate due to the high probability of missing the important regions of latent space (see e.g. [12, p. 107-109] for further discussion of this issue). Learning: Learning of the model involves maximizing the log likelihood log p(D|✓a , ✓s ) of the training dataset D with respect to the model parameters ✓a and ✓s . Since training is partially supervised, in that for each image X its corresponding segmentation S is also given, we can learn the parameters of the shape and appearance components separately. For appearances, the learning of the mixing coefﬁcients and the histogram parameters decomposes into standard mixture updates independently for each part. For shapes, we follow the standard deep 4 Algorithm 1 MCMC inference algorithm. 1: procedure I NFER(X, ✓) 2: Initialize S(1) , H(1) 3: for t 2 : chain length do 4: A(t) ⇠ p(A|S(t 1) , H(t 1) , X, ✓) 5: S(t) ⇠ p(S|A(t) , H(t 1) , X, ✓) 6: H(t) ⇠ p(H|S(t) , ✓) 7: return {S(t) }t=burnin:chain length learning literature closely [13, 1]. In the pre-training phase we greedily train the model bottom up, one layer at a time. We begin by training an RBM on the observed data using stochastic maximum likelihood learning (SML; also referred to as ‘persistent CD’; [14, 13]). Once this RBM is trained, we infer the conditional mean of the hidden units for each training image. The resulting vectors then serve as the training data for a second RBM which is again trained using SML. We use the parameters of these two RBMs to initialize the parameters of the full MSBM model. In the second phase we perform approximate stochastic gradient ascent in the likelihood of the full model to ﬁnetune the parameters in an EM-like scheme as described in [13]. 3 Related work Existing probabilistic models of images can be categorized by the amount of variability they expect to encounter in the data and by how they model this variability. A signiﬁcant portion of the literature models images using only two parts: a foreground object and its background e.g. [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Models that account for the parts within the foreground object mainly differ in how accurately they learn about and represent the variability of the shapes of the object’s parts. In Probabilistic Index Maps (PIMs) [8] a mean partitioning is learned, and the deformable PIM [9] additionally allows for local deformations of this mean partitioning. Stel Component Analysis [10] accounts for larger amounts of shape variability by learning a number of different template means for the object that are blended together on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Factored Shapes and Appearances [11] models global properties of shape using a factor analysis-like model, and ‘masked’ RBMs have been used to model more local properties of shape [20]. However, none of these models constitute a strong model of shape in terms of realism of samples and generalization capabilities [1]. We demonstrate in Sec. 4 that, like the SBM, the MSBM does in fact possess these properties. The closest works to ours in terms of ability to deal with datasets that exhibit signiﬁcant variability in both shape and appearance are the works of Bo and Fowlkes [21] and Thomas et al. [22]. Bo and Fowlkes [21] present an algorithm for pedestrian segmentation that models the shapes of the parts using several template means. The different parts are composed using hand coded geometric constraints, which means that the model cannot be automatically extended to other application domains. The Implicit Shape Model (ISM) used in [22] is reliant on interest point detectors and deﬁnes distributions over segmentations only in the posterior, and therefore is not fully generative. The model presented here is entirely learned from data and fully generative, therefore it can be applied to new datasets and diagnosed with relative ease. Due to its modular structure, we also expect it to rapidly absorb future developments in shape and appearance models. 4 Experiments Penn-Fudan pedestrians: The ﬁrst dataset that we considered is Penn-Fudan pedestrians [23], consisting of 169 images of pedestrians (Fig. 6(a)). The images are annotated with ground-truth segmentations for L = 7 different parts (hair, face, upper and lower clothes, shoes, legs, arms; Fig. 6(d)). We compare the performance of the model with the algorithm of Bo and Fowlkes [21]. For the shape component, we trained an MSBM on the 684 images of a labeled version of the HumanEva dataset [24] (at 48 ⇥ 24 pixels; also ﬂipped horizontally) with overlap b = 4, and 400 and 50 hidden units in the ﬁrst and second layers respectively. Each layer was pre-trained for 3000 epochs (iterations). After pre-training, joint training was performed for 1000 epochs. 5 (c) Completion (a) Sampling (b) Diffs ! ! ! Figure 5: Learned shape model.

(b) Differences between the samples and their most similar counterparts in the training dataset. (c) Completion of occlusions (pink). To assess the realism and generalization characteristics of the learned MSBM we sample from it. In Fig. 5(a) we show a chain of unconstrained samples from an MSBM generated via block-Gibbs MCMC (1000 samples between frames). The model captures highly non-linear correlations in the data whilst preserving the object’s details (e.g. face and arms). To demonstrate that the model has not simply memorized the training data, in Fig. 5(b) we show the difference between the sampled shapes in Fig. 5(a) and their closest images in the training set (based on per-pixel label agreement). We see that the model generalizes in non-trivial ways to generate realistic shapes that it had not encountered during training. In Fig. 5(c) we show how the MSBM completes rectangular occlusions. The samples highlight the variability in possible completions captured by the model. Note how, e.g. the length of the person’s trousers on one leg affects the model’s predictions for the other, demonstrating the model’s knowledge about long-range dependencies. An interactive M ATLAB GUI for sampling from this MSBM has been included in the supplementary material. The Penn-Fudan dataset (at 200 ⇥ 100 pixels) was then split into 10 train/test cross-validation splits without replacement. We used the training images in each split to train the appearance component with a vocabulary of size W = 50 and K = 100 mixture components1 . We additionally constrained the model by sharing the appearance models for the arms and legs with that of the face. We assess the quality of the appearance model by performing the following experiment: for each test image, we used the scoring function described in Eq. 9 to evaluate a number of different proposal segmentations for that image. We considered 10 randomly chosen segmentations from the training dataset as well as the ground-truth segmentation for the test image, and found that the appearance model correctly assigns the highest score to the ground-truth 95% of the time. During inference, the shape and appearance models (which are deﬁned on images of different sizes), were combined at 200 ⇥ 100 pixels via M ATLAB’s imresize function, and we set = 0.8 (Eq. 8) via trial and error. Inference chains were seeded at 100 exemplar segmentations from the HumanEva dataset (obtained using the K-medoids algorithm with K = 100), and were run for 20 Gibbs iterations each (with 5 iterations of Eqs. 6 and 7 per Gibbs iteration). Our unoptimized M ATLAB implementation completed inference for each chain in around 7 seconds. We compute the conditional probability of each pixel belonging to different parts given the last set of samples obtained from the highest scoring chain, assign each pixel independently to the most likely part at that pixel, and report the percentage of correctly labeled pixels (see Table 1). We ﬁnd that accuracy can be improved using superpixels (SP) computed on X (pixels within a superpixel are all assigned the most common label within it; as with [21] we use gPb-OWT-UCM [25]). We also report the accuracy obtained, had the top scoring seed segmentation been returned as the ﬁnal segmentation for each image. Here the quality of the seed is determined solely by the appearance model. We observe that the model has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art but pedestrianspeciﬁc algorithm of [21], and that inference in the model signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of the segmentations over the baseline (top seed+SP). Qualitative results can be seen in Fig. 6(c). 1 We obtained the best quantitative results with these settings. The appearances exhibited by the parts in the dataset are highly varied, and the complexity of the appearance model reﬂects this fact. 6 Table 1: Penn-Fudan pedestrians. We report the percentage of correctly labeled pixels. The ﬁnal column is an average of the background, upper and lower body scores (as reported in [21]).

The images are annotated with ground-truth segmentations for L = 6 parts (body, wheel, window, bumper, license plate, headlight; Fig. 7(d)). We compare the performance of the model with the ISM of Thomas et al. [22], who also report their results on this dataset. The dataset was split into 10 train/test cross-validation splits without replacement. We used the training images in each split to train both the shape and appearance components. For the shape component, we trained an MSBM at 50 ⇥ 50 pixels with overlap b = 4, and 2000 and 100 hidden units in the ﬁrst and second layers respectively. Each layer was pre-trained for 3000 epochs and joint training was performed for 1000 epochs. The appearance model was trained with a vocabulary of size W = 50 and K = 100 mixture components and we set = 0.7. Inference chains were seeded at 50 exemplar segmentations (obtained using K-medoids). We ﬁnd that the use of superpixels does not help with this dataset (due to the poor quality of superpixels obtained for these images). Qualitative and quantitative results that show the performance of model to be comparable to the state-of-the-art ISM can be seen in Fig. 7(c) and Table 2. We believe the discrepancy in accuracy between the MSBM and ISM on the ‘license’ and ‘light’ labels to mainly be due to ISM’s use of interest-points, as they are able to locate such ﬁne structures accurately. By incorporating better models of part appearance into the generative model, we expect to see this discrepancy decrease. 5 Conclusions and future work In this paper we have shown how the SBM can be extended to obtain the MSBM, and presented a principled probabilistic model of images of objects that exploits the MSBM as its model for part shapes. We demonstrated how object segmentations can be obtained simply by performing MCMC inference in the model. The model can also be treated as a probabilistic evaluator of segmentations: given a proposal segmentation it can be used to estimate its likelihood. This leads us to believe that the combination of a generative model such as ours, with a discriminative, bottom-up segmentation algorithm could be highly effective. We are currently investigating how textured appearance models, which take into account the spatial structure of pixels, affect the learning and inference algorithms and the performance of the model.

<p>Author: Hiroki Terashima, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: The computational modelling of the primary auditory cortex (A1) has been less fruitful than that of the primary visual cortex (V1) due to the less organized properties of A1. Greater disorder has recently been demonstrated for the tonotopy of A1 that has traditionally been considered to be as ordered as the retinotopy of V1. This disorder appears to be incongruous, given the uniformity of the neocortex; however, we hypothesized that both A1 and V1 would adopt an efﬁcient coding strategy and that the disorder in A1 reﬂects natural sound statistics. To provide a computational model of the tonotopic disorder in A1, we used a model that was originally proposed for the smooth V1 map. In contrast to natural images, natural sounds exhibit distant correlations, which were learned and reﬂected in the disordered map. The auditory model predicted harmonic relationships among neighbouring A1 cells; furthermore, the same mechanism used to model V1 complex cells reproduced nonlinear responses similar to the pitch selectivity. These results contribute to the understanding of the sensory cortices of different modalities in a novel and integrated manner.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80837274 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Analyzing_3D_Objects_in_Cluttered_Images.html">40 nips-2012-Analyzing 3D Objects in Cluttered Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Hejrati, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to detecting and analyzing the 3D conﬁguration of objects in real-world images with heavy occlusion and clutter. We focus on the application of ﬁnding and analyzing cars. We do so with a two-stage model; the ﬁrst stage reasons about 2D shape and appearance variation due to within-class variation (station wagons look different than sedans) and changes in viewpoint. Rather than using a view-based model, we describe a compositional representation that models a large number of effective views and shapes using a small number of local view-based templates. We use this model to propose candidate detections and 2D estimates of shape. These estimates are then reﬁned by our second stage, using an explicit 3D model of shape and viewpoint. We use a morphable model to capture 3D within-class variation, and use a weak-perspective camera model to capture viewpoint. We learn all model parameters from 2D annotations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for detection, viewpoint estimation, and 3D shape reconstruction on challenging images from the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.80447066 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Better_Way_to_Pretrain_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">4 nips-2012-A Better Way to Pretrain Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We describe how the pretraining algorithm for Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) is related to the pretraining algorithm for Deep Belief Networks and we show that under certain conditions, the pretraining procedure improves the variational lower bound of a two-hidden-layer DBM. Based on this analysis, we develop a different method of pretraining DBMs that distributes the modelling work more evenly over the hidden layers. Our results on the MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the new pretraining algorithm allows us to learn better generative models. 1</p><p>4 0.77952015 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Selective_Labeling_via_Error_Bound_Minimization.html">305 nips-2012-Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang, Jiawei Han, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.76654136 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>6 0.76507521 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Searching_for_objects_driven_by_context.html">303 nips-2012-Searching for objects driven by context</a></p>

<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Musé, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graphical models are a very useful tool to describe and understand natural phenomena, from gene expression to climate change and social interactions. The topological structure of these graphs/networks is a fundamental part of the analysis, and in many cases the main goal of the study. However, little work has been done on incorporating prior topological knowledge onto the estimation of the underlying graphical models from sample data. In this work we propose extensions to the basic joint regression model for network estimation, which explicitly incorporate graph-topological constraints into the corresponding optimization approach. The ﬁrst proposed extension includes an eigenvector centrality constraint, thereby promoting this important prior topological property. The second developed extension promotes the formation of certain motifs, triangle-shaped ones in particular, which are known to exist for example in genetic regulatory networks. The presentation of the underlying formulations, which serve as examples of the introduction of topological constraints in network estimation, is complemented with examples in diverse datasets demonstrating the importance of incorporating such critical prior knowledge. 1</p><p>3 0.18110295 <a title="269-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Identifiability_and_Unmixing_of_Latent_Parse_Trees.html">156 nips-2012-Identifiability and Unmixing of Latent Parse Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Daniel J. Hsu, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores unsupervised learning of parsing models along two directions. First, which models are identiﬁable from inﬁnite data? We use a general technique for numerically checking identiﬁability based on the rank of a Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependency parsing models. Second, for identiﬁable models, how do we estimate the parameters efﬁciently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral methods [1] cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree varies across sentences. We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals with this additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models. 1</p><p>4 0.13353059 <a title="269-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_kernel_choice_for_large-scale_two-sample_tests.html">264 nips-2012-Optimal kernel choice for large-scale two-sample tests</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Dino Sejdinovic, Heiko Strathmann, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Massimiliano Pontil, Kenji Fukumizu, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: Given samples from distributions p and q, a two-sample test determines whether to reject the null hypothesis that p = q, based on the value of a test statistic measuring the distance between the samples. One choice of test statistic is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a distance between embeddings of the probability distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The kernel used in obtaining these embeddings is critical in ensuring the test has high power, and correctly distinguishes unlike distributions with high probability. A means of parameter selection for the two-sample test based on the MMD is proposed. For a given test level (an upper bound on the probability of making a Type I error), the kernel is chosen so as to maximize the test power, and minimize the probability of making a Type II error. The test statistic, test threshold, and optimization over the kernel parameters are obtained with cost linear in the sample size. These properties make the kernel selection and test procedures suited to data streams, where the observations cannot all be stored in memory. In experiments, the new kernel selection approach yields a more powerful test than earlier kernel selection heuristics.</p><p>5 0.10511053 <a title="269-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Joint_Modeling_of_a_Matrix_with_Associated_Text_via_Latent_Binary_Features.html">166 nips-2012-Joint Modeling of a Matrix with Associated Text via Latent Binary Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianxing Zhang, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A new methodology is developed for joint analysis of a matrix and accompanying documents, with the documents associated with the matrix rows/columns. The documents are modeled with a focused topic model, inferring interpretable latent binary features for each document. A new matrix decomposition is developed, with latent binary features associated with the rows/columns, and with imposition of a low-rank constraint. The matrix decomposition and topic model are coupled by sharing the latent binary feature vectors associated with each. The model is applied to roll-call data, with the associated documents deﬁned by the legislation. Advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated for prediction of votes on a new piece of legislation, based only on the observed text of legislation. The coupling of the text and legislation is also shown to yield insight into the properties of the matrix decomposition for roll-call data. 1</p><p>6 0.083693631 <a title="269-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Augmented-SVM%3A_Automatic_space_partitioning_for_combining_multiple_non-linear_dynamics.html">48 nips-2012-Augmented-SVM: Automatic space partitioning for combining multiple non-linear dynamics</a></p>

To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with ﬁnite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efﬁcient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry orders and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level. 1</p><p>4 0.54518586 <a title="269-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_kernel_choice_for_large-scale_two-sample_tests.html">264 nips-2012-Optimal kernel choice for large-scale two-sample tests</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm(s) in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting. This problem has been studied in the literature from two different perspectives: ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence. We propose a unifying approach that leads to a meta-algorithm called uniﬁed gap-based exploration (UGapE), with a common structure and similar theoretical analysis for these two settings. We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.91818053 <a title="269-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Mixability_in_Statistical_Learning.html">217 nips-2012-Mixability in Statistical Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Peter Grünwald, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and sequential prediction are two different but related formalisms to study the quality of predictions. Mapping out their relations and transferring ideas is an active area of investigation. We provide another piece of the puzzle by showing that an important concept in sequential prediction, the mixability of a loss, has a natural counterpart in the statistical setting, which we call stochastic mixability. Just as ordinary mixability characterizes fast rates for the worst-case regret in sequential prediction, stochastic mixability characterizes fast rates in statistical learning. We show that, in the special case of log-loss, stochastic mixability reduces to a well-known (but usually unnamed) martingale condition, which is used in existing convergence theorems for minimum description length and Bayesian inference. In the case of 0/1-loss, it reduces to the margin condition of Mammen and Tsybakov, and in the case that the model under consideration contains all possible predictors, it is equivalent to ordinary mixability. 1</p><p>3 0.9160766 <a title="269-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-GenDeR%3A_A_Generic_Diversified_Ranking_Algorithm.html">141 nips-2012-GenDeR: A Generic Diversified Ranking Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>4 0.90166336 <a title="269-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive_Exploration_in_Bayesian_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive Exploration in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Dongho Kim, Kee-eung Kim, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected longterm total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.89170569 <a title="269-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Persistent_Homology_for_Learning_Densities_with_Bounded_Support.html">269 nips-2012-Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian T. Pokorny, Hedvig Kjellström, Danica Kragic, Carl Ek</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate ‘hard’ topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of persistent homology can be combined with kernel-based methods from machine learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and – by incorporating persistent homology techniques in our approach – we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset by learning a motion model for a race car. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car. 1</p><p>6 0.87280238 <a title="269-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Halfspaces_with_the_Zero-One_Loss%3A_Time-Accuracy_Tradeoffs.html">174 nips-2012-Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs</a></p>

<p>Author: Dor Kedem, Stephen Tyree, Fei Sha, Gert R. Lanckriet, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two novel metric learning algorithms, χ2 -LMNN and GB-LMNN, which are explicitly designed to be non-linear and easy-to-use. The two approaches achieve this goal in fundamentally different ways: χ2 -LMNN inherits the computational beneﬁts of a linear mapping from linear metric learning, but uses a non-linear χ2 -distance to explicitly capture similarities within histogram data sets; GB-LMNN applies gradient-boosting to learn non-linear mappings directly in function space and takes advantage of this approach’s robustness, speed, parallelizability and insensitivity towards the single additional hyperparameter. On various benchmark data sets, we demonstrate these methods not only match the current state-of-the-art in terms of kNN classiﬁcation error, but in the case of χ2 -LMNN, obtain best results in 19 out of 20 learning settings. 1</p><p>3 0.10163799 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Hamming_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">148 nips-2012-Hamming Distance Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Norouzi, David M. Blei, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by large-scale multimedia applications we propose to learn mappings from high-dimensional data to binary codes that preserve semantic similarity. Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efﬁcient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a ﬂexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classiﬁcation results using no more than kNN on the binary codes. 1</p><p>4 0.099133089 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Parametric_Local_Metric_Learning_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">265 nips-2012-Parametric Local Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Wang, Alexandros Kalousis, Adam Woznica</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number of local unrelated metrics. While this ”independence” approach delivers an increased ﬂexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overﬁtting. We present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics deﬁned on anchor points over different regions of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several largescale classiﬁcation problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a signiﬁcant manner. 1</p><p>5 0.083301574 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Semi-Crowdsourced_Clustering%3A_Generalizing_Crowd_Labeling_by_Robust_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">307 nips-2012-Semi-Crowdsourced Clustering: Generalizing Crowd Labeling by Robust Distance Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinfeng Yi, Rong Jin, Shaili Jain, Tianbao Yang, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in data clustering is to deﬁne an appropriate similarity measure between two objects. Crowdclustering addresses this challenge by deﬁning the pairwise similarity based on the manual annotations obtained through crowdsourcing. Despite its encouraging results, a key limitation of crowdclustering is that it can only cluster objects when their manual annotations are available. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach for clustering, called semi-crowdsourced clustering that effectively combines the low-level features of objects with the manual annotations of a subset of the objects obtained via crowdsourcing. The key idea is to learn an appropriate similarity measure, based on the low-level features of objects and from the manual annotations of only a small portion of the data to be clustered. One difﬁculty in learning the pairwise similarity measure is that there is a signiﬁcant amount of noise and inter-worker variations in the manual annotations obtained via crowdsourcing. We address this difﬁculty by developing a metric learning algorithm based on the matrix completion method. Our empirical study with two real-world image data sets shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art distance metric learning algorithms in both clustering accuracy and computational efﬁciency. 1</p><p>6 0.083172873 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Geometric_take_on_Metric_Learning.html">9 nips-2012-A Geometric take on Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Søren Hauberg, Oren Freifeld, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Multi-metric learning techniques learn local metric tensors in different parts of a feature space. With such an approach, even simple classiﬁers can be competitive with the state-of-the-art because the distance measure locally adapts to the structure of the data. The learned distance measure is, however, non-metric, which has prevented multi-metric learning from generalizing to tasks such as dimensionality reduction and regression in a principled way. We prove that, with appropriate changes, multi-metric learning corresponds to learning the structure of a Riemannian manifold. We then show that this structure gives us a principled way to perform dimensionality reduction and regression according to the learned metrics. Algorithmically, we provide the ﬁrst practical algorithm for computing geodesics according to the learned metrics, as well as algorithms for computing exponential and logarithmic maps on the Riemannian manifold. Together, these tools let many Euclidean algorithms take advantage of multi-metric learning. We illustrate the approach on regression and dimensionality reduction tasks that involve predicting measurements of the human body from shape data. 1 Learning and Computing Distances Statistics relies on measuring distances. When the Euclidean metric is insufﬁcient, as is the case in many real problems, standard methods break down. This is a key motivation behind metric learning, which strives to learn good distance measures from data. In the most simple scenarios a single metric tensor is learned, but in recent years, several methods have proposed learning multiple metric tensors, such that different distance measures are applied in different parts of the feature space. This has proven to be a very powerful approach for classiﬁcation tasks [1, 2], but the approach has not generalized to other tasks. Here we consider the generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression; see Fig. 1 for an illustration of our approach. The main problem with generalizing multi-metric learning is that it is based on assumptions that make the feature space both non-smooth and non-metric. Speciﬁcally, it is often assumed that straight lines form geodesic curves and that the metric tensor stays constant along these lines. These assumptions are made because it is believed that computing the actual geodesics is intractable, requiring a discretization of the entire feature space [3]. We solve these problems by smoothing the transitions between different metric tensors, which ensures a metric space where geodesics can be computed. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the metric tensor at a given point in feature space is deﬁned as the weighted average of a set of learned metric tensors. In this model, we prove that the feature space becomes a chart for a Riemannian manifold. This ensures a metric feature space, i.e. dist(x, y) = 0 ⇔ x = y , dist(x, y) = dist(y, x) (symmetry), (1) dist(x, z) ≤ dist(x, y) + dist(y, z) (triangle inequality). To compute statistics according to the learned metric, we need to be able to compute distances, which implies that we need to compute geodesics. Based on the observation that geodesics are 1 (a) Local Metrics & Geodesics (b) Tangent Space Representation (c) First Principal Geodesic Figure 1: Illustration of Principal Geodesic Analysis. (a) Geodesics are computed between the mean and each data point. (b) Data is mapped to the Euclidean tangent space and the ﬁrst principal component is computed. (c) The principal component is mapped back to the feature space. smooth curves in Riemannian spaces, we derive an algorithm for computing geodesics that only requires a discretization of the geodesic rather than the entire feature space. Furthermore, we show how to compute the exponential and logarithmic maps of the manifold. With this we can map any point back and forth between a Euclidean tangent space and the manifold. This gives us a general strategy for incorporating the learned metric tensors in many Euclidean algorithms: map the data to the tangent of the manifold, perform the Euclidean analysis and map the results back to the manifold. Before deriving the algorithms (Sec. 3) we set the scene by an analysis of the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art methods (Sec. 2), which motivate our ﬁnal model. The model is general and can be used for many problems. Here we illustrate it with several challenging problems in 3D body shape modeling and analysis (Sec. 4). All proofs can be found in the supplementary material along with algorithmic details and further experimental results. 2 Background and Related Work Single-metric learning learns a metric tensor, M, such that distances are measured as dist2 (xi , xj ) = xi − xj 2 M ≡ (xi − xj )T M(xi − xj ) , (2) where M is a symmetric and positive deﬁnite D × D matrix. Classic approaches for ﬁnding such a metric tensor include PCA, where the metric is given by the inverse covariance matrix of the training data; and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), where the metric tensor is M = S−1 SB S−1 , with Sw W W and SB being the within class scatter and the between class scatter respectively [9]. A more recent approach tries to learn a metric tensor from triplets of data points (xi , xj , xk ), where the metric should obey the constraint that dist(xi , xj ) < dist(xi , xk ). Here the constraints are often chosen such that xi and xj belong to the same class, while xi and xk do not. Various relaxed versions of this idea have been suggested such that the metric can be learned by solving a semi-deﬁnite or a quadratic program [1, 2, 4–8]. Among the most popular approaches is the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) classiﬁer [5], which ﬁnds a linear transformation that satisﬁes local distance constraints, making the approach suitable for multi-modal classes. For many problems, a single global metric tensor is not enough, which motivates learning several local metric tensors. The classic work by Hastie and Tibshirani [9] advocates locally learning metric tensors according to LDA and using these as part of a kNN classiﬁer. In a somewhat similar fashion, Weinberger and Saul [5] cluster the training data and learn a separate metric tensor for each cluster using LMNN. A more extreme point of view was taken by Frome et al. [1, 2], who learn a diagonal metric tensor for every point in the training set, such that distance rankings are preserved. Similarly, Malisiewicz and Efros [6] ﬁnd a diagonal metric tensor for each training point such that the distance to a subset of the training data from the same class is kept small. Once a set of metric tensors {M1 , . . . , MR } has been learned, the distance dist(a, b) is measured according to (2) where “the nearest” metric tensor is used, i.e. R M(x) = r=1 wr (x) ˜ Mr , where wr (x) = ˜ ˜ j wj (x) 1 0 x − xr 2 r ≤ x − xj M otherwise 2 Mj , ∀j , (3) where x is either a or b depending on the algorithm. Note that this gives a non-metric distance function as it is not symmetric. To derive this equation, it is necessary to assume that 1) geodesics 2 −8 −8 Assumed Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 −8 Actual Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 Riemannian Geodesics Location of Metric Tensors Test Points −6 −4 −4 −4 −2 −2 −2 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 4 4 6 −8 6 −8 −6 −4 −2 0 (a) 2 4 6 −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 6 −8 −6 (b) −4 −2 (c) 0 2 4 6 (d) Figure 2: (a)–(b) An illustrative example where straight lines do not form geodesics and where the metric tensor does not stay constant along lines; see text for details.

(d) An illustration of the exponential and logarithmic maps. form straight lines, and 2) the metric tensor stays constant along these lines [3]. Both assumptions are problematic, which we illustrate with a simple example in Fig. 2a–c. Assume we are given two metric tensors M1 = 2I and M2 = I positioned at x1 = (2, 2)T and x2 = (4, 4)T respectively. This gives rise to two regions in feature space in which x1 is nearest in the ﬁrst and x2 is nearest in the second, according to (3). This is illustrated in Fig. 2a. In the same ﬁgure, we also show the assumed straight-line geodesics between selected points in space. As can be seen, two of the lines goes through both regions, such that the assumption of constant metric tensors along the line is violated. Hence, it would seem natural to measure the length of the line, by adding the length of the line segments which pass through the different regions of feature space. This was suggested by Ramanan and Baker [3] who also proposed a polynomial time algorithm for measuring these line lengths. This gives a symmetric distance function. Properly computing line lengths according to the local metrics is, however, not enough to ensure that the distance function is metric. As can be seen in Fig. 2a the straight line does not form a geodesic as a shorter path can be found by circumventing the region with the “expensive” metric tensor M1 as illustrated in Fig. 2b. This issue makes it trivial to construct cases where the triangle inequality is violated, which again makes the line length measure non-metric. In summary, if we want a metric feature space, we can neither assume that geodesics are straight lines nor that the metric tensor stays constant along such lines. In practice, good results have been reported using (3) [1,3,5], so it seems obvious to ask: is metricity required? For kNN classiﬁers this does not appear to be the case, with many successes based on dissimilarities rather than distances [10]. We, however, want to generalize PCA and linear regression, which both seek to minimize the reconstruction error of points projected onto a subspace. As the notion of projection is hard to deﬁne sensibly in non-metric spaces, we consider metricity essential. In order to build a model with a metric feature space, we change the weights in (3) to be smooth functions. This impose a well-behaved geometric structure on the feature space, which we take advantage of in order to perform statistical analysis according to the learned metrics. However, ﬁrst we review the basics of Riemannian geometry as this provides the theoretical foundation of our work. 2.1 Geodesics and Riemannian Geometry We start by deﬁning Riemannian manifolds, which intuitively are smoothly curved spaces equipped with an inner product. Formally, they are smooth manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric [11]: Deﬁnition A Riemannian metric M on a manifold M is a smoothly varying inner product < a, b >x = aT M(x)b in the tangent space Tx M of each point x ∈ M . 3 Often Riemannian manifolds are represented by a chart; i.e. a parameter space for the curved surface. An example chart is the spherical coordinate system often used to represent spheres. While such charts are often ﬂat spaces, the curvature of the manifold arises from the smooth changes in the metric. On a Riemannian manifold M, the length of a smooth curve c : [0, 1] → M is deﬁned as the integral of the norm of the tangent vector (interpreted as speed) along the curve: 1 Length(c) = 1 c (λ) M(c(λ)) dλ c (λ)T M(c(λ))c (λ)dλ , = (4) 0 0 where c denotes the derivative of c and M(c(λ)) is the metric tensor at c(λ). A geodesic curve is then a length-minimizing curve connecting two given points x and y, i.e. (5) cgeo = arg min Length(c) with c(0) = x and c(1) = y . c The distance between x and y is deﬁned as the length of the geodesic. Given a tangent vector v ∈ Tx M, there exists a unique geodesic cv (t) with initial velocity v at x. The Riemannian exponential map, Expx , maps v to a point on the manifold along the geodesic cv at t = 1. This mapping preserves distances such that dist(cv (0), cv (1)) = v . The inverse of the exponential map is the Riemannian logarithmic map denoted Logx . Informally, the exponential and logarithmic maps move points back and forth between the manifold and the tangent space while preserving distances (see Fig. 2d for an illustration). This provides a general strategy for generalizing many Euclidean techniques to Riemannian domains: data points are mapped to the tangent space, where ordinary Euclidean techniques are applied and the results are mapped back to the manifold. 3 A Metric Feature Space With the preliminaries settled we deﬁne the new model. Let C = RD denote the feature space. We endow C with a metric tensor in every point x, which we deﬁne akin to (3), R M(x) = wr (x)Mr , where wr (x) = r=1 wr (x) ˜ R ˜ j=1 wj (x) , (6) with wr > 0. The only difference from (3) is that we shall not restrict ourselves to binary weight ˜ functions wr . We assume the metric tensors Mr have already been learned; Sec. 4 contain examples ˜ where they have been learned using LMNN [5] and LDA [9]. From the deﬁnition of a Riemannian metric, we trivially have the following result: Lemma 1 The space C = RD endowed with the metric tensor from (6) is a chart of a Riemannian manifold, iff the weights wr (x) change smoothly with x. Hence, by only considering smooth weight functions wr we get a well-studied geometric structure ˜ on the feature space, which ensures us that it is metric. To illustrate the implications we return to the example in Fig. 2. We change the weight functions from binary to squared exponentials, which gives the feature space shown in Fig. 2c. As can be seen, the metric tensor now changes smoothly, which also makes the geodesics smooth curves (a property we will use when computing the geodesics). It is worth noting that Ramanan and Baker [3] also consider the idea of smoothly averaging the metric tensor. They, however, only evaluate the metric tensor at the test point of their classiﬁer and then assume straight line geodesics with a constant metric tensor. Such assumptions violate the premise of a smoothly changing metric tensor and, again, the distance measure becomes non-metric. Lemma 1 shows that metric learning can be viewed as manifold learning. The main difference between our approach and techniques such as Isomap [12] is that, while Isomap learns an embedding of the data points, we learn the actual manifold structure. This gives us the beneﬁt that we can compute geodesics as well as the exponential and logarithmic maps. These provide us with mappings back and forth between the manifold and Euclidean representation of the data, which preserve distances as well as possible. The availability of such mappings is in stark contrast to e.g. Isomap. In the next section we will derive a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE’s) that geodesics in C have to satisfy, which provides us with algorithms for computing geodesics as well as exponential and logarithmic maps. With these we can generalize many Euclidean techniques. 4 3.1 Computing Geodesics, Maps and Statistics At minima of (4) we know that the Euler-Lagrange equation must hold [11], i.e. ∂L d ∂L , where L(λ, c, c ) = c (λ)T M(c(λ))c (λ) . = ∂c dλ ∂c As we have an explicit expression for the metric tensor we can compute (7) in closed form: (7) Theorem 2 Geodesic curves in C satisfy the following system of 2nd order ODE’s M(c(λ))c (λ) = − 1 ∂vec [M(c(λ))] 2 ∂c(λ) T (c (λ) ⊗ c (λ)) , (8) where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product and vec [·] stacks the columns of a matrix into a vector [13]. Proof See supplementary material. This result holds for any smooth weight functions wr . We, however, still need to compute ∂vec[M] , ˜ ∂c which depends on the speciﬁc choice of wr . Any smooth weighting scheme is applicable, but we ˜ restrict ourselves to the obvious smooth generalization of (3) and use squared exponentials. From this assumption, we get the following result Theorem 3 For wr (x) = exp − ρ x − xr ˜ 2 ∂vec [M(c)] = ∂c the derivative of the metric tensor from (6) is R ρ R j=1 2 Mr R 2 wj ˜ T r=1 T wj (c − xj ) Mj − (c − xr ) Mr ˜ wr vec [Mr ] ˜ . (9) j=1 Proof See supplementary material. Computing Geodesics. Any geodesic curve must be a solution to (8). Hence, to compute a geodesic between x and y, we can solve (8) subject to the constraints c(0) = x and c(1) = y . (10) This is a boundary value problem, which has a smooth solution. This allows us to solve the problem numerically using a standard three-stage Lobatto IIIa formula, which provides a fourth-order accurate C 1 –continuous solution [14]. Ramanan and Baker [3] discuss the possibility of computing geodesics, but arrive at the conclusion that this is intractable based on the assumption that it requires discretizing the entire feature space. Our solution avoids discretizing the feature space by discretizing the geodesic curve instead. As this is always one-dimensional the approach remains tractable in high-dimensional feature spaces. Computing Logarithmic Maps. Once a geodesic c is found, it follows from the deﬁnition of the logarithmic map, Logx (y), that it can be computed as v = Logx (y) = c (0) Length(c) . c (0) (11) In practice, we solve (8) by rewriting it as a system of ﬁrst order ODE’s, such that we compute both c and c simultaneously (see supplementary material for details). Computing Exponential Maps. Given a starting point x on the manifold and a vector v in the tangent space, the exponential map, Expx (v), ﬁnds the unique geodesic starting at x with initial velocity v. As the geodesic must fulﬁll (8), we can compute the exponential map by solving this system of ODE’s with the initial conditions c(0) = x and c (0) = v . (12) This initial value problem has a unique solution, which we ﬁnd numerically using a standard RungeKutta scheme [15]. 5 3.1.1 Generalizing PCA and Regression At this stage, we know that the feature space is Riemannian and we know how to compute geodesics and exponential and logarithmic maps. We now seek to generalize PCA and linear regression, which becomes straightforward since solutions are available in Riemannian spaces [16, 17]. These generalizations can be summarized as mapping the data to the tangent space at the mean, performing standard Euclidean analysis in the tangent and mapping the results back. The ﬁrst step is to compute the mean value on the manifold, which is deﬁned as the point that minimizes the sum-of-squares distances to the data points. Pennec [18] provides an efﬁcient gradient descent approach for computing this point, which we also summarize in the supplementary material. The empirical covariance of a set of points is deﬁned as the ordinary Euclidean covariance in the tangent space at the mean value [18]. With this in mind, it is not surprising that the principal components of a dataset have been generalized as the geodesics starting at the mean with initial velocity corresponding to the eigenvectors of the covariance [16], γvd (t) = Expµ (tvd ) , (13) th where vd denotes the d eigenvector of the covariance. This approach is called Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA), and the geodesic curve γvd is called the principal geodesic. An illustration of the approach can be seen in Fig. 1 and more algorithmic details are in the supplementary material. Linear regression has been generalized in a similar way [17] by performing regression in the tangent of the mean and mapping the resulting line back to the manifold using the exponential map. The idea of working in the tangent space is both efﬁcient and convenient, but comes with an element of approximation as the logarithmic map is only guarantied to preserve distances to the origin of the tangent and not between all pairs of data points. Practical experience, however, indicates that this is a good tradeoff; see [19] for a more in-depth discussion of when the approximation is suitable. 4 Experiments To illustrate the framework1 we consider an example in human body analysis, and then we analyze the scalability of the approach. But ﬁrst, to build intuition, Fig. 3a show synthetically generated data samples from two classes. We sample random points xr and learn a local LDA metric [9] by considering all data points within a radius; this locally pushes the two classes apart. We combine the local metrics using (6) and Fig. 3b show the data in the tangent space of the resulting manifold. As can be seen the two classes are now globally further apart, which shows the effect of local metrics. 4.1 Human Body Shape We consider a regression example concerning human body shape analysis. We study 986 female body laser scans from the CAESAR [20] data set; each shape is represented using the leading 35 principal components of the data learned using a SCAPE-like model [21, 22]. Each shape is associated with anthropometric measurements such as body height, shoe size, etc. We show results for shoulder to wrist distance and shoulder breadth, but results for more measurements are in the supplementary material. To predict the measurements from shape coefﬁcients, we learn local metrics and perform linear regression according to these. As a further experiment, we use PGA to reduce the dimensionality of the shape coefﬁcients according to the local metrics, and measure the quality of the reduction by performing linear regression to predict the measurements. As a baseline we use the corresponding Euclidean techniques. To learn the local metric we do the following. First we whiten the data such that the variance captured by PGA will only be due to the change of metric; this allows easy visualization of the impact of the learned metrics. We then cluster the body shapes into equal-sized clusters according to the measurement and learn a LMNN metric for each cluster [5], which we associate with the mean of each class. These push the clusters apart, which introduces variance along the directions where the measurement changes. From this we construct a Riemannian manifold according to (6), 1 Our software implementation for computing geodesics and performing manifold statistics is available at http://ps.is.tue.mpg.de/project/Smooth Metric Learning 6 30 Euclidean Model Riemannian Model 24 20 18 16 20 15 10 5 14 12 0 (a) 25 22 Running Time (sec.)

Right: regression error as a function of the dimensionality of the shape space; again the Euclidean metric and the Riemannian metric are compared. compute the mean value on the manifold, map the data to the tangent space at the mean and perform linear regression in the tangent space. As a ﬁrst visualization we plot the data expressed in the leading two dimensions of PGA in Fig. 4; as can be seen the learned metrics provide principal geodesics, which are more strongly related with the measurements than the Euclidean model. In order to predict the measurements from the body shape, we perform linear regression, both directly in the shape space according to the Euclidean metric and in the tangent space of the manifold corresponding to the learned metrics (using the logarithmic map from (11)). We measure the prediction error using leave-one-out cross-validation. To further illustrate the power of the PGA model, we repeat this experiment for different dimensionalities of the data. The results are plotted in Fig. 4, showing that regression according to the learned metrics outperforms the Euclidean model. To verify that the learned metrics improve accuracy, we average the prediction errors over all millimeter measurements. The result in Fig. 3c shows that much can be gained in lower dimensions by using the local metrics. To provide visual insights into the behavior of the learned metrics, we uniformly sample body shape along the ﬁrst principal geodesic (in the range ±7 times the standard deviation) according to the different metrics. The results are available as a movie in the supplementary material, but are also shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the learned metrics pick up intuitive relationships between body shape and the measurements, e.g. shoulder to wrist distance is related to overall body size, while shoulder breadth is related to body weight. 7 Shoulder to wrist distance Shoulder breadth Figure 5: Shapes corresponding to the mean (center) and ±7 times the standard deviations along the principal geodesics (left and right). Movies are available in the supplementary material. 4.2 Scalability The human body data set is small enough (986 samples in 35 dimensions) that computing a geodesic only takes a few seconds. To show that the current unoptimized Matlab implementation can handle somewhat larger datasets, we brieﬂy consider a dimensionality reduction task on the classic MNIST handwritten digit data set. We use the preprocessed data available with [3] where the original 28×28 gray scale images were deskewed and projected onto their leading 164 Euclidean principal components (which captures 95% of the variance in the original data). We learn one diagonal LMNN metric per class, which we associate with the mean of the class. From this we construct a Riemannian manifold from (6), compute the mean value on the manifold and compute geodesics between the mean and each data point; this is the computationally expensive part of performing PGA. Fig. 3d plots the average running time (sec) for the computation of geodesics as a function of the dimensionality of the training data. A geodesic can be computed in 100 dimensions in approximately 5 sec., whereas in 150 dimensions it takes about 30 sec. In this experiment, we train a PGA model on 60,000 data points, and test a nearest neighbor classiﬁer in the tangent space as we decrease the dimensionality of the model. Compared to a Euclidean model, this gives a modest improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy of 2.3 percent, when averaged across different dimensionalities. Plots of the results can be found in the supplementary material. 5 Discussion This work shows that multi-metric learning techniques are indeed applicable outside the realm of kNN classiﬁers. The idea of deﬁning the metric tensor at any given point as the weighted average of a ﬁnite set of learned metrics is quite natural from a modeling point of view, which is also validated by the Riemannian structure of the resulting space. This opens both a theoretical and a practical toolbox for analyzing and developing algorithms that use local metric tensors. Speciﬁcally, we show how to use local metric tensors for both regression and dimensionality reduction tasks. Others have attempted to solve non-classiﬁcation problems using local metrics, but we feel that our approach is the ﬁrst to have a solid theoretical backing. For example, Hastie and Tibshirani [9] use local LDA metrics for dimensionality reduction by averaging the local metrics and using the resulting metric as part of a Euclidean PCA, which essentially is a linear approach. Another approach was suggested by Hong et al. [23] who simply compute the principal components according to each metric separately, such that one low dimensional model is learned per metric. The suggested approach is, however, not difﬁculty-free in its current implementation. Currently, we are using off-the-shelf numerical solvers for computing geodesics, which can be computationally demanding. While we managed to analyze medium-sized datasets, we believe that the run-time can be drastically improved by developing specialized numerical solvers. In the experiments, we learned local metrics using techniques specialized for classiﬁcation tasks as this is all the current literature provides. We expect improvements by learning the metrics speciﬁcally for regression and dimensionality reduction, but doing so is currently an open problem.

<p>Author: Madalina Fiterau, Artur Dubrawski</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, classiﬁcation systems often require human intervention in the loop. In such cases the decision process must be transparent and comprehensible, simultaneously requiring minimal assumptions on the underlying data distributions. To tackle this problem, we formulate an axis-aligned subspace-ﬁnding task under the assumption that query speciﬁc information dictates the complementary use of the subspaces. We develop a regression-based approach called RECIP that efﬁciently solves this problem by ﬁnding projections that minimize a nonparametric conditional entropy estimator. Experiments show that the method is accurate in identifying the informative projections of the dataset, picking the correct views to classify query points, and facilitates visual evaluation by users. 1 Introduction and problem statement In the domain of predictive analytics, many applications which keep human users in the loop require the use of simple classiﬁcation models. Often, it is required that a test-point be ‘explained’ (classiﬁed) using a simple low-dimensional projection of the original feature space. This is a Projection Retrieval for Classiﬁcation problem (PRC). The interaction with the user proceeds as follows: the user provides the system a query point; the system searches for a projection in which the point can be accurately classiﬁed; the system displays the classiﬁcation result as well as an illustration of how the classiﬁcation decision was reached in the selected projection. Solving the PRC problem is relevant in many practical applications. For instance, consider a nuclear threat detection system installed at a border check point. Vehicles crossing the border are scanned with sensors so that a large array of measurements of radioactivity and secondary contextual information is being collected. These observations are fed into a classiﬁcation system that determines whether the scanned vehicle may carry a threat. Given the potentially devastating consequences of a false negative, a border control agent is requested to validate the prediction and decide whether to submit the vehicle for a costly further inspection. With the positive classiﬁcation rate of the system under strict bounds because of limitations in the control process, the risk of false negatives is increased. Despite its crucial role, human intervention should only be withheld for cases in which there are reasons to doubt the validity of classiﬁcation. In order for a user to attest the validity of a decision, the user must have a good understanding of the classiﬁcation process, which happens more readily when the classiﬁer only uses the original dataset features rather than combinations of them, and when the discrimination models are low-dimensional. In this context, we aim to learn a set of classiﬁers in low-dimensional subspaces and a decision function which selects the subspace under which a test point is to be classiﬁed. Assume we are given a dataset {(x1 , y1 ) . . . (xn , yn )} ∈ X n × {0, 1}n and a class of discriminators H. The model will contain a set Π of subspaces of X ; Π ⊆ Π, where Π is the set of all axis-aligned subspaces of the original feature space, the power set of the features. To each projection πi ∈ Π corresponds one discriminator from a given hypothesis space hi ∈ H. It will also contain a selection function g : X → Π × H, which yields, for a query point x, the projection/discriminator pair with which this point will be classiﬁed. The notation π(x) refers to the projection of the point x onto the subspace 1 π while h(π(x)) represents the predicted label for x. Formally, we describe the model class as Md = {Π = {π : π ∈ Π, dim(π) ≤ d}, H = {hi : hi ∈ H, h : πi → Y, ∀i = 1 . . . |Π|}, g ∈ {f : X → {1 . . . |Π|}} . where dim(π) presents the dimensionality of the subspace determined by the projection π. Note that only projections up to size d will be considered, where d is a parameter speciﬁc to the application. The set H contains one discriminator from the hypothesis class H for each projection. Intuitively, the aim is to minimize the expected classiﬁcation error over Md , however, a notable modiﬁcation is that the projection and, implicitly, the discriminator, are chosen according to the data point that needs to be classiﬁed. Given a query x in the space X , g(x) will yield the subspace πg(x) onto which the query is projected and the discriminator hg(x) for it. Distinct test points can be handled using different combinations of subspaces and discriminators. We consider models that minimize 0/1 loss. Hence, the PRC problem can be stated as follows: M ∗ = arg min EX ,Y y = hg(x) (πg(x) (x)) M ∈Md There are limitations to the type of selection function g that can be learned. A simple example for which g can be recovered is a set of signal readings x for which, if one of the readings xi exceeds a threshold ti , the label can be predicted just based on xi . A more complex one is a dataset containing regulatory variables, that is, for xi in the interval [ak , bk ] the label only depends on (x1 . . . xnk ) k k datasets that fall into the latter category fulﬁll what we call the Subspace-Separability Assumption. This paper proposes an algorithm called RECIP that solves the PRC problem for a class of nonparametric classiﬁers. We evaluate the method on artiﬁcial data to show that indeed it correctly identiﬁes the underlying structure for data satisfying the Subspace-Separability Assumption. We show some case studies to illustrate how RECIP offers insight into applications requiring human intervention. The use of dimensionality reduction techniques is a common preprocessing step in applications where the use of simpliﬁed classiﬁcation models is preferable. Methods that learn linear combinations of features, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, are not quite appropriate for the task considered here, since we prefer to natively rely on the dimensions available in the original feature space. Feature selection methods, such as e.g. lasso, are suitable for identifying sets of relevant features, but do not consider interactions between them. Our work better ﬁts the areas of class dependent feature selection and context speciﬁc classiﬁcation, highly connected to the concept of Transductive Learning [6]. Other context-sensitive methods are Lazy and Data-Dependent Decision Trees, [5] and [10] respectively. In Ting et al [14], the Feating submodel selection relies on simple attribute splits followed by ﬁtting local predictors, though the algorithm itself is substantially different. Obozinski et al present a subspace selection method in the context of multitask learning [11]. Go et al propose a joint method for feature selection and subspace learning [7], however, their classiﬁcation model is not particularly query speciﬁc. Alternatively, algorithms that transform complex or unintelligible models with user-friendly equivalents have been proposed [3, 2, 1, 8]. Algorithms speciﬁcally designed to yield understandable models are a precious few. Here we note a rule learning method described in [12], even though the resulting rules can make visualization difﬁcult, while itemset mining [9] is not speciﬁcally designed for classiﬁcation. Unlike those approaches, our method is designed to retrieve subsets of the feature space designed for use in a way that is complementary to the basic task at hand (classiﬁcation) while providing query-speciﬁc information. 2 Recovering informative projections with RECIP To solve PRC, we need means by which to ascertain which projections are useful in terms of discriminating data from the two classes. Since our model allows the use of distinct projections depending on the query point, it is expected that each projection would potentially beneﬁt different areas of the feature space. A(π) refers to the area of the feature space where the projection π is selected. A(π) = {x ∈ X : πg(x) = π} The objective becomes min E(X ×Y) y = hg(x) (πg(x) (x)) M ∈Md = p(A(π))E y = hg(x) (πg(x) (x))|x ∈ A(π) min M ∈Md 2 π∈Π . The expected classiﬁcation error over A(π) is linked to the conditional entropy of Y |X. Fano’s inequality provides a lower bound on the error while Feder and Merhav [4] derive a tight upper bound on the minimal error probability in terms of the entropy. This means that conditional entropy characterizes the potential of a subset of the feature space to separate data, which is more generic than simply quantifying classiﬁcation accuracy for a speciﬁc discriminator. In view of this connection between classiﬁcation accuracy and entropy, we adapt the objective to: p(A(π))H(Y |π(X); X ∈ A(π)) min M ∈Md (1) π∈Π The method we propose optimizes an empirical analog of (1) which we develop below and for which we will need the following result. Proposition 2.1. Given a continuous variable X ∈ X and a binary variable Y , where X is sampled from the mixture model f (x) = p(y = 0)f0 (x) + p(y = 1)f1 (x) = p0 f0 (x) + p1 f1 (x) , then H(Y |X) = −p0 log p0 − p1 log p1 − DKL (f0 ||f ) − DKL (f1 ||f ) . Next, we will use the nonparametric estimator presented in [13] for Tsallis α-divergence. Given samples Ui ∼ U, with i = 1, n and Vj ∼ V with j = 1, m, the divergence is estimated as follows: ˆ Tα (U ||V ) = 1 1 1−α n n (n − 1)νk (Ui , U \ ui )d mνk (Ui , V )d i=1 1−α B(k, α) − 1 , (2) where d is the dimensionality of the variables U and V and νk (z, Z) represents the distance from z ˆ to its k th nearest neighbor of the set of points Z. For α ≈ 1 and n → ∞, Tα (u||v) ≈ DKL (u||v). 2.1 Local estimators of entropy We will now plug (2) in the formula obtained by Proposition 2.1 to estimate the quantity (1). We use the notation X0 to represent the n0 samples from X which have the labels Y equal to 0, and X1 to represent the n1 samples from X which have the labels set to 1. Also, Xy(x) represents the set of samples that have labels equal to the label of x and X¬y(x) the data that have labels opposite to the label of x. ˆ ˆ x ˆ x H(Y |X; X ∈ A) = −H(p0 ) − H(p1 ) − T (f0 ||f x ) − T (f1 ||f x ) + C α≈1 ˆ H(Y |X; X ∈ A) ∝ 1 n0 + 1 n1 ∝ 1 n0 + 1 n1 ∝ 1 n n0 (n0 − 1)νk (xi , X0 \ xi )d nνk (xi , X \ xi )d 1−α I[xi ∈ A] (n1 − 1)νk (xi , X1 \ xi )d nνk (xi , X \ xi )d 1−α I[xi ∈ A] (n0 − 1)νk (xi , X0 \ xi )d nνk (xi , X1 \ xi )d 1−α I[xi ∈ A] (n1 − 1)νk (xi , X1 \ xi )d nνk (xi , X0 \ xi )d 1−α I[xi ∈ A] i=1 n1 i=1 n0 i=1 n1 i=1 n I[xi ∈ A] i=1 (n − 1)νk (xi , Xy(xi ) \ xi )d nνk (xi , X¬y(xi ) \ xi )d 1−α The estimator for the entropy of the data that is classiﬁed with projection π is as follows: ˆ H(Y |π(X); X ∈ A(π)) ∝ 1 n n I[xi ∈ A(π)] i=1 (n − 1)νk (π(xi ), π(Xy(xi ) ) \ π(xi ))d nνk (π(xi ), π(X¬y(xi ) \ xi ))d 1−α (3) From 3 and using the fact that I[xi ∈ A(π)] = I[πg(xi ) = π] for which we use the notation I[g(xi ) → π], we estimate the objective as min M ∈Md π∈Π 1 n n I[g(xi ) → π] i=1 (n − 1)νk (π(xi ), π(Xy(xi ) ) \ π(xi ))d nνk (π(xi ), π(X¬y(xi ) \ xi ))d 3 1−α (4) Therefore, the contribution of each data point to the objective corresponds to a distance ratio on the projection π ∗ where the class of the point is obtained with the highest conﬁdence (data is separable in the neighborhood of the point). We start by computing the distance-based metric of each point on each projection of size up to d - there are d∗ such projections. This procedure yields an extended set of features Z, which we name local entropy estimates: Zij = νk (πj (xi ), πj (Xy(xi ) ) \ πj (xi )) νk (πj (xi ), πj (X¬y(xi ) ) \ πj (xi )) d(1−α) α≈1 j ∈ {1 . . . d∗ } (5) For each training data point, we compute the best distance ratio amid all the projections, which is simply Ti = minj∈[d∗ ] Zij . The objective can be then further rewritten as a function of the entropy estimates: n I[g(xi ) → πj ]Zij min M ∈Md (6) i=1 πj ∈Π From the deﬁnition of T, it is also clear that n n I[g(xi ) → πj ]Zij min M ∈Md 2.2 ≥ i=1 πj ∈Π Ti . (7) i=1 Projection selection as a combinatorial problem Considering form (6) of the objective, and given that the estimates Zij are constants, depending only on the training set, the projection retrieval problem is reduced to ﬁnding g for all training points, which will implicitly select the projection set of the model. Naturally, one might assume the bestperforming classiﬁcation model is the one containing all the axis-aligned subspaces. This model achieves the lower bound (7) for the training set. However, the larger the set of projections, the more values the function g takes, and thus the problem of selecting the correct projection becomes more difﬁcult. It becomes apparent that the number of projections should be somehow restricted to allow intepretability. Assuming a hard threshold of at most t projections, the optimization (6) becomes an entry selection problem over matrix Z where one value must be picked from each row under a limitation on the number of columns that can be used. This problem cannot be solved exactly in polynomial time. Instead, it can be formulated as an optimization problem under 1 constraints. 2.3 Projection retrieval through regularized regression To transform the projection retrieval to a regression problem we consider T, the minimum obtainable value of the entropy estimator for each point, as the output which the method needs to predict. Each row i of the parameter matrix B represents the degrees to which the entropy estimates on each projection contribute to the entropy estimator of point xi . Thus, the sum over each row of B is 1, and the regularization penalty applies to the number of non-zero columns in B. d∗ min ||T − (Z B B)J|Π|,1 ||2 2 +λ [Bi = 0] (8) i=1 subject to |Bk | 1 = 1 k = 1, n where (Z B)ij = Zij + Bij and J is a matrix of ones. The problem with this optimization is that it is not convex. A typical walk-around of this issue is to use the convex relaxation for Bi = 0, that is 1 norm. This would transform the penalized term d∗ d∗ n to i=1 |Bi | 1 . However, i=1 |Bi | 1 = k=1 |Bk | 1 = n , so this penalty really has no effect. An alternative mechanism to encourage the non-zero elements in B to populate a small number of columns is to add a penalty term in the form of Bδ, where δ is a d∗ -size column vector with each element representing the penalty for a column in B. With no prior information about which subspaces are more informative, δ starts as an all-1 vector. An initial value for B is obtained through the optimization (8). Since our goal is to handle data using a small number of projections, δ is then updated such that its value is lower for the denser columns in B. This update resembles the reweighing in adaptive lasso. The matrix B itself is updated, and this 2-step process continues until convergence of δ. Once δ converges, the projections corresponding to the non-zero columns of B are added to the model. The procedure is shown in Algorithm 1. 4 Algorithm 1: RECIP δ = [1 . . . 1] repeat |P I| b = arg minB ||T − i=1 < Z, B > ||2 + λ|Bδ| 1 2 subject to |Bk | 1 = 1 k = 1...n δk = |Bi | 1 i = . . . d∗ (update the differential penalty) δ δ = 1 − |δ| 1 until δ converges return Π = {πi ; |Bi | 1 > 0 ∀i = 1 . . . d∗ } 2.4 Lasso for projection selection We will compare our algorithm to lasso regularization that ranks the projections in terms of their potential for data separability. We write this as an 1 -penalized optimization on the extended feature set Z, with the objective T : minβ |T − Zβ|2 + λ|β| 1 . The lasso penalty to the coefﬁcient vector encourages sparsity. For a high enough λ, the sparsity pattern in β is indicative of the usefulness of the projections. The lasso on entropy contributions was not found to perform well as it is not query speciﬁc and will ﬁnd one projection for all data. We improved it by allowing it to iteratively ﬁnd projections - this robust version offers increased performance by reweighting the data thus focusing on different subsets of it. Although better than running lasso on entropy contributions, the robust lasso does not match RECIP’s performance as the projections are selected gradually rather than jointly. Running the standard lasso on the original design matrix yields a set of relevant variables and it is not immediately clear how the solution would translate to the desired class. 2.5 The selection function Once the projections are selected, the second stage of the algorithm deals with assigning the projection with which to classify a particular query point. An immediate way of selecting the correct projection starts by computing the local entropy estimator for each subspace with each class assignment. Then, we may select the label/subspace combination that minimizes the empirical entropy.

First, we analyze how well RECIP can identify subspaces in synthetic data whose distribution obeys the subspace separability assumption (3.1). As a point of reference, we also present classiﬁcation accuracy results (3.2) for both the synthetic data and a few real-world sets. This is to quantify the extent of the trade-off between ﬁdelity of attainable classiﬁers and desired informativeness of the projections chosen by RECIP. We expect RECIP’s classiﬁcation performance to be slightly, but not substantially worse when compared to relevant classiﬁcation algorithms trained to maximize classiﬁcation accuracy. Finally, we present a few examples (3.3) of informative projections recovered from real-world data and their utility in explaining to human users the decision processes applied to query points. A set of artiﬁcial data used in our experiments contains q batches of data points, each of them made classiﬁable with high accuracy using one of available 2-dimensional subspaces (x1 , x2 ) with k ∈ k k {1 . . . q}. The data in batch k also have the property that x1 > tk . This is done such that the group a k point belongs to can be detected from x1 , thus x1 is a regulatory variable. We control the amount of k k noise added to thusly created synthetic data by varying the proportion of noisy data points in each batch. The results below are for datasets with 7 features each, with number of batches q ranging between 1 and 7. We kept the number of features speciﬁcally low in order to prevent excessive variation between any two sets generated this way, and to enable computing meaningful estimates of the expectation and variance of performance, while enabling creation of complicated data in which synthetic patterns may substantially overlap (using 7 features and 7 2-dimensional patterns implies that dimensions of at least 4 of the patterns will overlap). We implemented our method 5 to be scalable to the size and dimensionality of data and although for brevity we do not include a discussion of this topic here, we have successfully run RECIP against data with 100 features. The parameter α is a value close to 1, because the Tsallis divergence converges to the KL divergence as alpha approaches 1. For the experiments on real-world data, d was set to n (all projections were considered). For the artiﬁcial data experiments, we reported results for d = 2 as they do not change signiﬁcantly for d >= 2 because this data was synthesized to contain bidimensional informative projections. In general, if d is too low, the correct full set of projections will not be found, but it may be recovered partially. If d is chosen too high, there is a risk that a given selected projection p will contain irrelevant features compared to the true projection p0 . However, this situation only occurs if the noise introduced by these features in the estimators makes the entropy contributions on p and p0 statistically indistinguishable for a large subset of data. The users will choose d according to the desired/acceptable complexity of the resulting model. If the results are to be visually interpreted by a human, values of 2 or 3 are reasonable for d. 3.1 Recovering informative projections Table 1 shows how well RECIP recovers the q subspaces corresponding to the synthesized batches of data. We measure precision (proportion of the recovered projections that are known to be informative), and recall (proportion of known informative projections that are recovered by the algorithm). in Table 1, rows correspond to the number of distinct synthetic batches injected in data, q, and subsequent columns correspond to the increasing amounts of noise in data. We note that the observed precision is nearly perfect: the algorithm makes only 2 mistakes over the entire set of experiments, and those occur for highly noisy setups. The recall is nearly perfect as long as there is little overlap among the dimensions, that is when the injections do not interfere with each other. As the number of projections increases, the chances for overlap among the affected features also increase, which makes the data more confusing resulting on a gradual drop of recall until only about 3 or 4 of the 7 known to be informative subspaces can be recovered. We have also used lasso as described in 2.4 in an attempt to recover projections. This setup only manages to recover one of the informative subspaces, regardless of how the regularization parameter is tuned. 3.2 Classiﬁcation accuracy Table 2 shows the classiﬁcation accuracy of RECIP, obtained using synthetic data. As expected, the observed performance is initially high when there are few known informative projections in data and it decreases as noise and ambiguity of the injected patterns increase. Most types of ensemble learners would use a voting scheme to arrive at the ﬁnal classiﬁcation of a testing sample, rather than use a model selection scheme. For this reason, we have also compared predictive accuracy revealed by RECIP against a method based on majority voting among multiple candidate subspaces. Table 4 shows that the accuracy of this technique is lower than the accuracy of RECIP, regardless of whether the informative projections are recovered by the algorithm or assumed to be known a priori. This conﬁrms the intuition that a selection-based approach can be more effective than voting for data which satisﬁes the subspace separability assumption. For reference, we have also classiﬁed the synthetic data using K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm using all available features at once. The results of that experiment are shown in Table 5. Since RECIP uses neighbor information, K-NN is conceptually the closest among the popular alternatives. Compared to RECIP, K-NN performs worse when there are fewer synthetic patterns injected in data to form informative projections. It is because some features used then by K-NN are noisy. As more features become informative, the K-NN accuracy improves. This example shows the beneﬁt of a selective approach to feature space and using a subset of the most explanatory projections to support not only explanatory analyses but also classiﬁcation tasks in such circumstances. 3.3 RECIP case studies using real-world data Table 3 summarizes the RECIP and K-NN performance on UCI datasets. We also test the methods using Cell dataset containing a set of measurements such as the area and perimeter biological cells with separate labels marking cells subjected to treatment and control cells. In Vowel data, the nearest-neighbor approach works exceptionally well, even outperforming random forests (0.94 accuracy), which is an indication that all features are jointly relevant. For d lower than the number of features, RECIP picks projections of only one feature, but if there is no such limitation, RECIP picks the space of all the features as informative. 6 Table 1: Projection recovery for artiﬁcial datasets with 1 . . . 7 informative features and noise level 0 . . . 0.2 in terms of mean and variance of Precision and Recall.

Not only does the importance of text in capital letters make sense for a spam ﬁltering dataset, but the points that select those projections are almost ﬂawlessly classiﬁed. Additionally, assuming the user would need to attest the validity of classiﬁcation for the ﬁrst plot, he/she would have no trouble seeing that the circled data points are located in a region predominantly populated with examples of spam, so any non-spam entry appears suspicious.

It is relevant in applications where the decision process must be easy to understand in order to enable human interpretation of the results. We have developed a principled, regression-based algorithm designed to recover small sets of low-dimensional subspaces that support interpretability. It optimizes the selection using individual data-point-speciﬁc entropy estimators. In this context, the proposed algorithm follows the idea of transductive learning, and the role of the resulting projections bears resemblance to high conﬁdence regions known in conformal prediction models. Empirical results obtained using simulated and real-world data show the effectiveness of our method in ﬁnding informative projections that enable accurate classiﬁcation while maintaining transparency of the underlying decision process.

<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for multiple reward functions. Most previous IRL algorithms assume that the behaviour data is obtained from an agent who is optimizing a single reward function, but this assumption is hard to guarantee in practice. Our approach is based on integrating the Dirichlet process mixture model into Bayesian IRL. We provide an efﬁcient Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm utilizing the gradient of the posterior to estimate the underlying reward functions, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous ones via experiments on a number of problem domains. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84302211 <a title="171-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Coincidence_Analysis%3A_A_Hidden_Variable_Model_for_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">171 nips-2012-Latent Coincidence Analysis: A Hidden Variable Model for Distance Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Der, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We describe a latent variable model for supervised dimensionality reduction and distance metric learning. The model discovers linear projections of high dimensional data that shrink the distance between similarly labeled inputs and expand the distance between diﬀerently labeled ones. The model’s continuous latent variables locate pairs of examples in a latent space of lower dimensionality. The model diﬀers signiﬁcantly from classical factor analysis in that the posterior distribution over these latent variables is not always multivariate Gaussian. Nevertheless we show that inference is completely tractable and derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. We also compare the model to other approaches in distance metric learning. The model’s main advantage is its simplicity: at each iteration of the EM algorithm, the distance metric is re-estimated by solving an unconstrained least-squares problem. Experiments show that these simple updates are highly eﬀective. 1</p><p>3 0.81850362 <a title="171-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>4 0.78985906 <a title="171-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Sampling and variational inference techniques are two standard methods for inference in probabilistic models, but for many problems, neither approach scales effectively to large-scale data. An alternative is to relax the probabilistic model into a non-probabilistic formulation which has a scalable associated algorithm. This can often be fulﬁlled by performing small-variance asymptotics, i.e., letting the variance of particular distributions in the model go to zero. For instance, in the context of clustering, such an approach yields connections between the kmeans and EM algorithms. In this paper, we explore small-variance asymptotics for exponential family Dirichlet process (DP) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models. Utilizing connections between exponential family distributions and Bregman divergences, we derive novel clustering algorithms from the asymptotic limit of the DP and HDP mixtures that features the scalability of existing hard clustering methods as well as the ﬂexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We focus on special cases of our analysis for discrete-data problems, including topic modeling, and we demonstrate the utility of our results by applying variants of our algorithms to problems arising in vision and document analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.78977597 <a title="171-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Multilabel_Classification_using_Bayesian_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2012-Multilabel Classification using Bayesian Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Raajay Viswanathan, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for multilabel classiďŹ cation using compressed sensing. The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classiďŹ cation is to ďŹ rst project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing over compression as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efďŹ cient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key beneďŹ ts of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show signiďŹ cant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case. Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model. 1</p><p>6 0.78891641 <a title="171-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Non-linear_Metric_Learning.html">242 nips-2012-Non-linear Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas Schön, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method in the family of particle MCMC methods that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PG-AS). Similarly to the existing PG with backward simulation (PG-BS) procedure, we use backward sampling to (considerably) improve the mixing of the PG kernel. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PG-BS, however, we achieve the same effect in a single forward sweep. We apply the PG-AS framework to the challenging class of non-Markovian state-space models. We develop a truncation strategy of these models that is applicable in principle to any backward-simulation-based method, but which is particularly well suited to the PG-AS framework. In particular, as we show in a simulation study, PG-AS can yield an order-of-magnitude improved accuracy relative to PG-BS due to its robustness to the truncation error. Several application examples are discussed, including Rao-Blackwellized particle smoothing and inference in degenerate state-space models. 1</p><p>3 0.28500745 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_active_learning_with_localized_priors_for_fast_receptive_field_characterization.html">56 nips-2012-Bayesian active learning with localized priors for fast receptive field characterization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mijung Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Active learning methods can dramatically improve the yield of neurophysiology experiments by adaptively selecting stimuli to probe a neuron’s receptive ﬁeld (RF). Bayesian active learning methods specify a posterior distribution over the RF given the data collected so far in the experiment, and select a stimulus on each time step that maximally reduces posterior uncertainty. However, existing methods tend to employ simple Gaussian priors over the RF and do not exploit uncertainty at the level of hyperparameters. Incorporating this uncertainty can substantially speed up active learning, particularly when RFs are smooth, sparse, or local in space and time. Here we describe a novel framework for active learning under hierarchical, conditionally Gaussian priors. Our algorithm uses sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (“particle ﬁltering” with MCMC) to construct a mixture-of-Gaussians representation of the RF posterior, and selects optimal stimuli using an approximate infomax criterion. The core elements of this algorithm are parallelizable, making it computationally efﬁcient for real-time experiments. We apply our algorithm to simulated and real neural data, and show that it can provide highly accurate receptive ﬁeld estimates from very limited data, even with a small number of hyperparameter samples. 1</p><p>4 0.20080931 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-MCMC_for_continuous-time_discrete-state_systems.html">205 nips-2012-MCMC for continuous-time discrete-state systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinayak Rao, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple and novel framework for MCMC inference in continuoustime discrete-state systems with pure jump trajectories. We construct an exact MCMC sampler for such systems by alternately sampling a random discretization of time given a trajectory of the system, and then a new trajectory given the discretization. The ﬁrst step can be performed efﬁciently using properties of the Poisson process, while the second step can avail of discrete-time MCMC techniques based on the forward-backward algorithm. We show the advantage of our approach compared to particle MCMC and a uniformization-based sampler. 1</p><p>5 0.14445703 <a title="118-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Marginalized_Particle_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">11 nips-2012-A Marginalized Particle Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey Dean, Greg Corrado, Rajat Monga, Kai Chen, Matthieu Devin, Mark Mao, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Andrew Senior, Paul Tucker, Ke Yang, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.59539729 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Image_Descriptors_with_the_Boosting-Trick.html">176 nips-2012-Learning Image Descriptors with the Boosting-Trick</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomasz Trzcinski, Mario Christoudias, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we apply boosting to learn complex non-linear local visual feature representations, drawing inspiration from its successful application to visual object detection. The main goal of local feature descriptors is to distinctively represent a salient image region while remaining invariant to viewpoint and illumination changes. This representation can be improved using machine learning, however, past approaches have been mostly limited to learning linear feature mappings in either the original input or a kernelized input feature space. While kernelized methods have proven somewhat effective for learning non-linear local feature descriptors, they rely heavily on the choice of an appropriate kernel function whose selection is often difﬁcult and non-intuitive. We propose to use the boosting-trick to obtain a non-linear mapping of the input to a high-dimensional feature space. The non-linear feature mapping obtained with the boosting-trick is highly intuitive. We employ gradient-based weak learners resulting in a learned descriptor that closely resembles the well-known SIFT. As demonstrated in our experiments, the resulting descriptor can be learned directly from intensity patches achieving state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>4 0.57023609 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Identifiability_and_Unmixing_of_Latent_Parse_Trees.html">156 nips-2012-Identifiability and Unmixing of Latent Parse Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Daniel J. Hsu, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores unsupervised learning of parsing models along two directions. First, which models are identiﬁable from inﬁnite data? We use a general technique for numerically checking identiﬁability based on the rank of a Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependency parsing models. Second, for identiﬁable models, how do we estimate the parameters efﬁciently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral methods [1] cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree varies across sentences. We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals with this additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models. 1</p><p>5 0.51686877 <a title="118-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>6 0.51447642 <a title="118-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>

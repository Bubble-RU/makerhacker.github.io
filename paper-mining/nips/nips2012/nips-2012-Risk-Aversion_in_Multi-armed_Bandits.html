<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm(s) in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting. This problem has been studied in the literature from two different perspectives: ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence. We propose a unifying approach that leads to a meta-algorithm called uniﬁed gap-based exploration (UGapE), with a common structure and similar theoretical analysis for these two settings. We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.24881068 <a title="295-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Continuous_Reinforcement_Learning.html">259 nips-2012-Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Brendan Mcmahan, Matthew Streeter</p><p>Abstract: Some of the most compelling applications of online convex optimization, including online prediction and classiﬁcation, are unconstrained: the natural feasible set is Rn . Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in this setting unless constraints on the comparator point ˚ are known in advance. We present algox rithms that, without such prior knowledge, offer near-optimal regret bounds with respect to any choice of ˚. In particular, regret with respect to ˚ = 0 is constant. x x We then prove lower bounds showing that our guarantees are near-optimal in this setting. 1</p><p>5 0.15282154 <a title="295-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Hierarchical_Optimistic_Region_Selection_driven_by_Curiosity.html">149 nips-2012-Hierarchical Optimistic Region Selection driven by Curiosity</a></p>
<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to take a step forwards making the term “intrinsic motivation” from reinforcement learning theoretically well founded, focusing on curiositydriven learning. To that end, we consider the setting where, a ﬁxed partition P of a continuous space X being given, and a process ν deﬁned on X being unknown, we are asked to sequentially decide which cell of the partition to select as well as where to sample ν in that cell, in order to minimize a loss function that is inspired from previous work on curiosity-driven learning. The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem. The resulting procedure, called Hierarchical Optimistic Region SElection driven by Curiosity (HORSE.C) is provided together with a ﬁnite-time regret analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.13015111 <a title="295-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Mirror_Descent_Meets_Fixed_Share_%28and_feels_no_regret%29.html">216 nips-2012-Mirror Descent Meets Fixed Share (and feels no regret)</a></p>

<p>Author: Morteza Ibrahimi, Adel Javanmard, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of adaptive control of a high dimensional linear quadratic (LQ) system. Previous work established the asymptotic convergence to an optimal controller for various adaptive control schemes. More recently, for the average √ cost LQ problem, a regret bound of O( T ) was shown, apart form logarithmic factors. However, this bound scales exponentially with p, the dimension of the state space. In this work we consider the case where the matrices describing the dynamic of the LQ system are sparse and their dimensions are large. We present √ an adaptive control scheme that achieves a regret bound of O(p T ), apart from logarithmic factors. In particular, our algorithm has an average cost of (1 + ) times the optimum cost after T = polylog(p)O(1/ 2 ). This is in comparison to previous work on the dense dynamics where the algorithm requires time that scales exponentially with dimension in order to achieve regret of times the optimal cost. We believe that our result has prominent applications in the emerging area of computational advertising, in particular targeted online advertising and advertising in social networks. 1</p><p>6 0.41236675 <a title="295-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Many_Player_Actions.html">109 nips-2012-Efficient Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization in Games with Many Player Actions</a></p>

<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Peter Grünwald, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and sequential prediction are two different but related formalisms to study the quality of predictions. Mapping out their relations and transferring ideas is an active area of investigation. We provide another piece of the puzzle by showing that an important concept in sequential prediction, the mixability of a loss, has a natural counterpart in the statistical setting, which we call stochastic mixability. Just as ordinary mixability characterizes fast rates for the worst-case regret in sequential prediction, stochastic mixability characterizes fast rates in statistical learning. We show that, in the special case of log-loss, stochastic mixability reduces to a well-known (but usually unnamed) martingale condition, which is used in existing convergence theorems for minimum description length and Bayesian inference. In the case of 0/1-loss, it reduces to the margin condition of Mammen and Tsybakov, and in the case that the model under consideration contains all possible predictors, it is equivalent to ordinary mixability. 1</p><p>3 0.92188305 <a title="295-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-GenDeR%3A_A_Generic_Diversified_Ranking_Algorithm.html">141 nips-2012-GenDeR: A Generic Diversified Ranking Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>4 0.91959083 <a title="295-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive_Exploration_in_Bayesian_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive Exploration in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Dongho Kim, Kee-eung Kim, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected longterm total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems. 1</p><p>5 0.91075671 <a title="295-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Persistent_Homology_for_Learning_Densities_with_Bounded_Support.html">269 nips-2012-Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian T. Pokorny, Hedvig Kjellström, Danica Kragic, Carl Ek</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate ‘hard’ topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of persistent homology can be combined with kernel-based methods from machine learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and – by incorporating persistent homology techniques in our approach – we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset by learning a motion model for a race car. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car. 1</p><p>6 0.88979906 <a title="295-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Halfspaces_with_the_Zero-One_Loss%3A_Time-Accuracy_Tradeoffs.html">174 nips-2012-Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs</a></p>

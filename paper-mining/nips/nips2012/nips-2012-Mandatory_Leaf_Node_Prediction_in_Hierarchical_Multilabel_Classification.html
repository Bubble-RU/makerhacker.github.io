<p>Author: Nilesh Dalvi, Aditya Parameswaran, Vibhor Rastogi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of debugging large pipelines by human labeling. We represent the execution of a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph of AND and OR nodes, where each node represents a data item produced by some operator in the pipeline. We assume that each operator assigns a conﬁdence to each of its output data. We want to reduce the uncertainty in the output by issuing queries to a human, where a query consists of checking if a given data item is correct. In this paper, we consider the problem of asking the optimal set of queries to minimize the resulting output uncertainty. We perform a detailed evaluation of the complexity of the problem for various classes of graphs. We give efﬁcient algorithms for the problem for trees, and show that, for a general dag, the problem is intractable. 1</p><p>3 0.16499944 <a title="207-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Multilabel_Classification_using_Bayesian_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2012-Multilabel Classification using Bayesian Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Raajay Viswanathan, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for multilabel classiďŹ cation using compressed sensing. The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classiďŹ cation is to ďŹ rst project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing over compression as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efďŹ cient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key beneďŹ ts of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show signiďŹ cant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case. Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model. 1</p><p>4 0.15247126 <a title="207-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_models_for_Large-scale_Hierarchical_Classification.html">58 nips-2012-Bayesian models for Large-scale Hierarchical Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang, Bing Bai, Alexandru Niculescu-mizil</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in hierarchical classiﬁcation is to leverage the hierarchical relations among classes for improving classiﬁcation performance. An even greater challenge is to do so in a manner that is computationally feasible for large scale problems. This paper proposes a set of Bayesian methods to model hierarchical dependencies among class labels using multivariate logistic regression. Speciﬁcally, the parent-child relationships are modeled by placing a hierarchical prior over the children nodes centered around the parameters of their parents; thereby encouraging classes nearby in the hierarchy to share similar model parameters. We present variational algorithms for tractable posterior inference in these models, and provide a parallel implementation that can comfortably handle largescale problems with hundreds of thousands of dimensions and tens of thousands of classes. We run a comparative evaluation on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets that highlights the scalability of our approach and shows improved performance over the other state-of-the-art hierarchical methods. 1</p><p>5 0.10015145 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_the_Architecture_of_Sum-Product_Networks_Using_Clustering_on_Variables.html">191 nips-2012-Learning the Architecture of Sum-Product Networks Using Clustering on Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Dennis, Dan Ventura</p><p>Abstract: The sum-product network (SPN) is a recently-proposed deep model consisting of a network of sum and product nodes, and has been shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep models on certain difﬁcult tasks such as image completion. Designing an SPN network architecture that is suitable for the task at hand is an open question. We propose an algorithm for learning the SPN architecture from data. The idea is to cluster variables (as opposed to data instances) in order to identify variable subsets that strongly interact with one another. Nodes in the SPN network are then allocated towards explaining these interactions. Experimental evidence shows that learning the SPN architecture signiﬁcantly improves its performance compared to using a previously-proposed static architecture. 1</p><p>6 0.10005538 <a title="207-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We present very eﬃcient active learning algorithms for link classiﬁcation in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph G = (V, E) such that |E| = Ω(|V |3/2 ) by querying O(|V |3/2 ) edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of O(k) by querying at most order of |V | + (|V |/k)3/2 edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order |E| + |V | log |V |. 1</p><p>5 0.57798845 <a title="207-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-The_Time-Marginalized_Coalescent_Prior_for_Hierarchical_Clustering.html">339 nips-2012-The Time-Marginalized Coalescent Prior for Hierarchical Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Levi Boyles, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new prior for use in Nonparametric Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering. The prior is constructed by marginalizing out the time information of Kingman’s coalescent, providing a prior over tree structures which we call the Time-Marginalized Coalescent (TMC). This allows for models which factorize the tree structure and times, providing two beneﬁts: more ﬂexible priors may be constructed and more efﬁcient Gibbs type inference can be used. We demonstrate this on an example model for density estimation and show the TMC achieves competitive experimental results. 1</p><p>6 0.54338688 <a title="207-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Context-Sensitive_Decision_Forests_for_Object_Detection.html">81 nips-2012-Context-Sensitive Decision Forests for Object Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianqiu Ji, Jianmin Li, Shuicheng Yan, Bo Zhang, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Sign-random-projection locality-sensitive hashing (SRP-LSH) is a probabilistic dimension reduction method which provides an unbiased estimate of angular similarity, yet suffers from the large variance of its estimation. In this work, we propose the Super-Bit locality-sensitive hashing (SBLSH). It is easy to implement, which orthogonalizes the random projection vectors in batches, and it is theoretically guaranteed that SBLSH also provides an unbiased estimate of angular similarity, yet with a smaller variance when the angle to estimate is within (0, ⇡/2]. The extensive experiments on real data well validate that given the same length of binary code, SBLSH may achieve signiﬁcant mean squared error reduction in estimating pairwise angular similarity. Moreover, SBLSH shows the superiority over SRP-LSH in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.36697143 <a title="207-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.36653998 <a title="207-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Caron, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an inﬁnite number of choice items. Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior speciﬁed by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books. 1</p><p>6 0.36416766 <a title="207-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Human_memory_search_as_a_random_walk_in_a_semantic_network.html">155 nips-2012-Human memory search as a random walk in a semantic network</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohsen Hejrati, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to detecting and analyzing the 3D conﬁguration of objects in real-world images with heavy occlusion and clutter. We focus on the application of ﬁnding and analyzing cars. We do so with a two-stage model; the ﬁrst stage reasons about 2D shape and appearance variation due to within-class variation (station wagons look different than sedans) and changes in viewpoint. Rather than using a view-based model, we describe a compositional representation that models a large number of effective views and shapes using a small number of local view-based templates. We use this model to propose candidate detections and 2D estimates of shape. These estimates are then reﬁned by our second stage, using an explicit 3D model of shape and viewpoint. We use a morphable model to capture 3D within-class variation, and use a weak-perspective camera model to capture viewpoint. We learn all model parameters from 2D annotations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for detection, viewpoint estimation, and 3D shape reconstruction on challenging images from the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.12442686 <a title="357-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Memorability_of_Image_Regions.html">210 nips-2012-Memorability of Image Regions</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: While long term human visual memory can store a remarkable amount of visual information, it tends to degrade over time. Recent works have shown that image memorability is an intrinsic property of an image that can be reliably estimated using state-of-the-art image features and machine learning algorithms. However, the class of features and image information that is forgotten has not been explored yet. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework that models how and which local regions from an image may be forgotten using a data-driven approach that combines local and global images features. The model automatically discovers memorability maps of individual images without any human annotation. We incorporate multiple image region attributes in our algorithm, leading to improved memorability prediction of images as compared to previous works. 1</p><p>4 0.1191555 <a title="357-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>5 0.097907893 <a title="357-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-3D_Object_Detection_and_Viewpoint_Estimation_with_a_Deformable_3D_Cuboid_Model.html">1 nips-2012-3D Object Detection and Viewpoint Estimation with a Deformable 3D Cuboid Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level 3D object detection. Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects in 3D by enclosing them with tight oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model [1] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efﬁciency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are continuous in our model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the stateof-the-art in both 2D [1] and 3D object detection [2]. 1</p><p>6 0.093880348 <a title="357-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Representations_and_Codes_for_Image_Auto-Annotation.html">92 nips-2012-Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Mezuman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Although human object recognition is supposedly robust to viewpoint, much research on human perception indicates that there is a preferred or “canonical” view of objects. This phenomenon was discovered more than 30 years ago but the canonical view of only a small number of categories has been validated experimentally. Moreover, the explanation for why humans prefer the canonical view over other views remains elusive. In this paper we ask: Can we use Internet image collections to learn more about canonical views? We start by manually ﬁnding the most common view in the results returned by Internet search engines when queried with the objects used in psychophysical experiments. Our results clearly show that the most likely view in the search engine corresponds to the same view preferred by human subjects in experiments. We also present a simple method to ﬁnd the most likely view in an image collection and apply it to hundreds of categories. Using the new data we have collected we present strong evidence against the two most prominent formal theories of canonical views and provide novel constraints for new theories. 1</p><p>3 0.75065047 <a title="357-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Localizing_3D_cuboids_in_single-view_images.html">201 nips-2012-Localizing 3D cuboids in single-view images</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we seek to detect rectangular cuboids and localize their corners in uncalibrated single-view images depicting everyday scenes. In contrast to recent approaches that rely on detecting vanishing points of the scene and grouping line segments to form cuboids, we build a discriminative parts-based detector that models the appearance of the cuboid corners and internal edges while enforcing consistency to a 3D cuboid model. Our model copes with different 3D viewpoints and aspect ratios and is able to detect cuboids across many different object categories. We introduce a database of images with cuboid annotations that spans a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and show qualitative and quantitative results on our collected database. Our model out-performs baseline detectors that use 2D constraints alone on the task of localizing cuboid corners. 1</p><p>4 0.72824138 <a title="357-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Memorability_of_Image_Regions.html">210 nips-2012-Memorability of Image Regions</a></p>

<p>Author: Chunxiao Zhou, Jiseong Park, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel and computationally fast algorithm for computing weighted v-statistics in resampling both univariate and multivariate data is proposed. To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with ﬁnite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efﬁcient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry orders and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level. 1</p><p>3 0.66248602 <a title="357-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Memorability_of_Image_Regions.html">210 nips-2012-Memorability of Image Regions</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: While long term human visual memory can store a remarkable amount of visual information, it tends to degrade over time. Recent works have shown that image memorability is an intrinsic property of an image that can be reliably estimated using state-of-the-art image features and machine learning algorithms. However, the class of features and image information that is forgotten has not been explored yet. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework that models how and which local regions from an image may be forgotten using a data-driven approach that combines local and global images features. The model automatically discovers memorability maps of individual images without any human annotation. We incorporate multiple image region attributes in our algorithm, leading to improved memorability prediction of images as compared to previous works. 1</p><p>4 0.65401387 <a title="357-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Coupling_Nonparametric_Mixtures_via_Latent_Dirichlet_Processes.html">89 nips-2012-Coupling Nonparametric Mixtures via Latent Dirichlet Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dahua Lin, John W. Fisher</p><p>Abstract: Mixture distributions are often used to model complex data. In this paper, we develop a new method that jointly estimates mixture models over multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependencies between them. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a set of latent Dirichlet processes as sources of component models (atoms), and for each data set, we construct a nonparametric mixture model by combining sub-sampled versions of the latent DPs. Each mixture model may acquire atoms from different latent DPs, while each atom may be shared by multiple mixtures. This multi-to-multi association distinguishes the proposed method from previous ones that require the model structure to be a tree or a chain, allowing more ﬂexible designs. We also derive a sampling algorithm that jointly infers the model parameters and present experiments on both document analysis and image modeling. 1</p><p>5 0.6450184 <a title="357-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Natural_Images%2C_Gaussian_Mixtures_and_Dead_Leaves.html">235 nips-2012-Natural Images, Gaussian Mixtures and Dead Leaves</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Simple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) learned from pixels of natural image patches have been recently shown to be surprisingly strong performers in modeling the statistics of natural images. Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models. 1 GMMs and natural image statistics models Many models for the statistics of natural image patches have been suggested in recent years. Finding good models for natural images is important to many different research areas - computer vision, biological vision and neuroscience among others. Recently, there has been a growing interest in comparing different aspects of models for natural images such as log-likelihood and multi-information reduction performance, and much progress has been achieved [1,2, 3,4,5, 6]. Out of these results there is one which is particularly interesting: simple, unconstrained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with a relatively small number of mixture components learned from image patches are extraordinarily good in modeling image statistics [6, 4]. This is a surprising result due to the simplicity of GMMs and their ubiquity. Another surprising aspect of this result is that many of the current models may be thought of as GMMs with an exponential or infinite number of components, having different constraints on the covariance structure of the mixture components. In this work we study the nature of GMMs learned from natural image patches. We start with a thorough comparison to some popular and cutting edge image models. We show that indeed, GMMs are excellent performers in modeling natural image patches. We then analyze what properties of natural images these GMMs capture, their dependence on the number of components in the mixture and their relation to the structure of the world around us. Finally, we show that the learned GMM suggests a strong connection between natural image statistics and a simple variant of the dead leaves model [7, 8] , explicitly modeling occlusions and explaining some of the success of GMMs in modeling natural images. 1 3.5 .,...- ••.......-.-.. -..---'-. 1 ~~6\8161·· -.. .-.. --...--.-- ---..-.- -. --------------MII+··+ilIl ..... .. . . ~ '[25 . . . ---- ] B'II 1_ -- ~2 ;t:: fI 1 - --- ,---- ._.. : 61.5 .....

<p>Author: Zhirong Yang, Tele Hao, Onur Dikmen, Xi Chen, Erkki Oja</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising relaxation technique for clustering analysis. However, conventional NMF methods that directly approximate the pairwise similarities using the least square error often yield mediocre performance for data in curved manifolds because they can capture only the immediate similarities between data samples. Here we propose a new NMF clustering method which replaces the approximated matrix with its smoothed version using random walk. Our method can thus accommodate farther relationships between data samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel regularization in the proposed objective function in order to improve over spectral clustering. The new learning objective is optimized by a multiplicative Majorization-Minimization algorithm with a scalable implementation for learning the factorizing matrix. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method has strong performance in terms of cluster purity. 1</p><p>3 0.063635238 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Scalable_CUR_Matrix_Decomposition_Algorithm%3A_Lower_Time_Complexity_and_Tighter_Bound.html">17 nips-2012-A Scalable CUR Matrix Decomposition Algorithm: Lower Time Complexity and Tighter Bound</a></p>
<p>Author: Shusen Wang, Zhihua Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The CUR matrix decomposition is an important extension of Nystr¨ m approximao tion to a general matrix. It approximates any data matrix in terms of a small number of its columns and rows. In this paper we propose a novel randomized CUR algorithm with an expected relative-error bound. The proposed algorithm has the advantages over the existing relative-error CUR algorithms that it possesses tighter theoretical bound and lower time complexity, and that it can avoid maintaining the whole data matrix in main memory. Finally, experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement over the existing relative-error algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.054799128 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_nonconvex_inexact_proximal_splitting.html">300 nips-2012-Scalable nonconvex inexact proximal splitting</a></p>
<p>Author: Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: We study a class of large-scale, nonsmooth, and nonconvex optimization problems. In particular, we focus on nonconvex problems with composite objectives. This class includes the extensively studied class of convex composite objective problems as a subclass. To solve composite nonconvex problems we introduce a powerful new framework based on asymptotically nonvanishing errors, avoiding the common stronger assumption of vanishing errors. Within our new framework we derive both batch and incremental proximal splitting algorithms. To our knowledge, our work is ﬁrst to develop and analyze incremental nonconvex proximalsplitting algorithms, even if we were to disregard the ability to handle nonvanishing errors. We illustrate one instance of our general framework by showing an application to large-scale nonsmooth matrix factorization. 1</p><p>5 0.053687576 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_optimization_and_sparse_statistical_recovery%3A_Optimal_algorithms_for_high_dimensions.html">325 nips-2012-Stochastic optimization and sparse statistical recovery: Optimal algorithms for high dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic optimization algorithms for problems in which the expected loss is strongly convex, and the optimum is (approximately) sparse. Previous approaches are able to exploit only one of these two structures, yielding a O(d/T ) convergence rate for strongly convex objectives in d dimensions and O( s(log d)/T ) convergence rate when the optimum is s-sparse. Our algorithm is based on successively solving a series of ℓ1 -regularized optimization problems using Nesterov’s dual averaging algorithm. We establish that the error of our solution after T iterations is at most O(s(log d)/T ), with natural extensions to approximate sparsity. Our results apply to locally Lipschitz losses including the logistic, exponential, hinge and least-squares losses. By recourse to statistical minimax results, we show that our convergence rates are optimal up to constants. The effectiveness of our approach is also conﬁrmed in numerical simulations where we compare to several baselines on a least-squares regression problem.</p><p>6 0.052853625 <a title="125-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Spectral_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">19 nips-2012-A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mert Pilanci, Laurent E. Ghaoui, Venkat Chandrasekaran</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of cardinality penalized optimization of a convex function over the probability simplex with additional convex constraints. The classical 1 regularizer fails to promote sparsity on the probability simplex since 1 norm on the probability simplex is trivially constant. We propose a direct relaxation of the minimum cardinality problem and show that it can be efﬁciently solved using convex programming. As a ﬁrst application we consider recovering a sparse probability measure given moment constraints, in which our formulation becomes linear programming, hence can be solved very efﬁciently. A sufﬁcient condition for exact recovery of the minimum cardinality solution is derived for arbitrary afﬁne constraints. We then develop a penalized version for the noisy setting which can be solved using second order cone programs. The proposed method outperforms known rescaling heuristics based on 1 norm. As a second application we consider convex clustering using a sparse Gaussian mixture and compare our results with the well known soft k-means algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.61744732 <a title="125-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Forging_The_Graphs%3A_A_Low_Rank_and_Positive_Semidefinite_Graph_Learning_Approach.html">135 nips-2012-Forging The Graphs: A Low Rank and Positive Semidefinite Graph Learning Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Dijun Luo, Heng Huang, Feiping Nie, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: In many graph-based machine learning and data mining approaches, the quality of the graph is critical. However, in real-world applications, especially in semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning, the evaluation of the quality of a graph is often expensive and sometimes even impossible, due the cost or the unavailability of ground truth. In this paper, we proposed a robust approach with convex optimization to “forge” a graph: with an input of a graph, to learn a graph with higher quality. Our major concern is that an ideal graph shall satisfy all the following constraints: non-negative, symmetric, low rank, and positive semidefinite. We develop a graph learning algorithm by solving a convex optimization problem and further develop an efﬁcient optimization to obtain global optimal solutions with theoretical guarantees. With only one non-sensitive parameter, our method is shown by experimental results to be robust and achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning and clustering under various settings. As a preprocessing of graphs, our method has a wide range of potential applications machine learning and data mining.</p><p>5 0.60863817 <a title="125-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Feature_Clustering_for_Accelerating_Parallel_Coordinate_Descent.html">131 nips-2012-Feature Clustering for Accelerating Parallel Coordinate Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Chad Scherrer, Ambuj Tewari, Mahantesh Halappanavar, David Haglin</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale `1 -regularized loss minimization problems arise in high-dimensional applications such as compressed sensing and high-dimensional supervised learning, including classiﬁcation and regression problems. High-performance algorithms and implementations are critical to efﬁciently solving these problems. Building upon previous work on coordinate descent algorithms for `1 -regularized problems, we introduce a novel family of algorithms called block-greedy coordinate descent that includes, as special cases, several existing algorithms such as SCD, Greedy CD, Shotgun, and Thread-Greedy. We give a uniﬁed convergence analysis for the family of block-greedy algorithms. The analysis suggests that block-greedy coordinate descent can better exploit parallelism if features are clustered so that the maximum inner product between features in different blocks is small. Our theoretical convergence analysis is supported with experimental results using data from diverse real-world applications. We hope that algorithmic approaches and convergence analysis we provide will not only advance the ﬁeld, but will also encourage researchers to systematically explore the design space of algorithms for solving large-scale `1 -regularization problems. 1</p><p>6 0.60515219 <a title="125-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-CPRL_--_An_Extension_of_Compressive_Sensing_to_the_Phase_Retrieval_Problem.html">63 nips-2012-CPRL -- An Extension of Compressive Sensing to the Phase Retrieval Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate</p><p>Abstract: First-order probabilistic models combine the power of ﬁrst-order logic, the de facto tool for handling relational structure, with probabilistic graphical models, the de facto tool for handling uncertainty. Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms for them have been the subject of much recent research. The main idea in these algorithms is to improve the accuracy and scalability of existing graphical models’ inference algorithms by exploiting symmetry in the ﬁrst-order representation. In this paper, we consider blocked Gibbs sampling, an advanced MCMC scheme, and lift it to the ﬁrst-order level. We propose to achieve this by partitioning the ﬁrst-order atoms in the model into a set of disjoint clusters such that exact lifted inference is polynomial in each cluster given an assignment to all other atoms not in the cluster. We propose an approach for constructing the clusters and show how it can be used to trade accuracy with computational complexity in a principled manner. Our experimental evaluation shows that lifted Gibbs sampling is superior to the propositional algorithm in terms of accuracy, scalability and convergence.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73182434 <a title="125-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Factoring_nonnegative_matrices_with_linear_programs.html">125 nips-2012-Factoring nonnegative matrices with linear programs</a></p>

An optimized C++ implementation can factor a multigigabyte matrix in a matter of minutes. 1</p><p>3 0.69069767 <a title="125-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Mixtures_of_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">180 nips-2012-Learning Mixtures of Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Furong Huang, Daniel J. Hsu, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We consider unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models, where the class variable is hidden and each mixture component can have a potentially different Markov graph structure and parameters over the observed variables. We propose a novel method for estimating the mixture components with provable guarantees. Our output is a tree-mixture model which serves as a good approximation to the underlying graphical model mixture. The sample and computational requirements for our method scale as poly(p, r), for an r-component mixture of pvariate graphical models, for a wide class of models which includes tree mixtures and mixtures over bounded degree graphs. Keywords: Graphical models, mixture models, spectral methods, tree approximation.</p><p>4 0.6499607 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Locating_Changes_in_Highly_Dependent_Data_with_Unknown_Number_of_Change_Points.html">203 nips-2012-Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points</a></p>
<p>Author: Azadeh Khaleghi, Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multiple change point estimation is considered for sequences with unknown number of change points. A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed. In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form. The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations. 1</p><p>5 0.64540279 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Online_Sum-Product_Computation_Over_Trees.html">260 nips-2012-Online Sum-Product Computation Over Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Stephen Pasteris, Fabio Vitale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of performing efﬁcient sum-product computations in an online setting over a tree. A natural application of our methods is to compute the marginal distribution at a vertex in a tree-structured Markov random ﬁeld. Belief propagation can be used to solve this problem, but requires time linear in the size of the tree, and is therefore too slow in an online setting where we are continuously receiving new data and computing individual marginals. With our method we aim to update the data and compute marginals in time that is no more than logarithmic in the size of the tree, and is often signiﬁcantly less. We accomplish this via a hierarchical covering structure that caches previous local sum-product computations. Our contribution is three-fold: we i) give a linear time algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal hierarchical cover of a tree; ii) give a sum-productlike algorithm to efﬁciently compute marginals with respect to this cover; and iii) apply “i” and “ii” to ﬁnd an efﬁcient algorithm with a regret bound for the online allocation problem in a multi-task setting. 1</p><p>6 0.64421618 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Sparse_Graphs.html">69 nips-2012-Clustering Sparse Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, John W. Fisher</p><p>Abstract: Mixture distributions are often used to model complex data. In this paper, we develop a new method that jointly estimates mixture models over multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependencies between them. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a set of latent Dirichlet processes as sources of component models (atoms), and for each data set, we construct a nonparametric mixture model by combining sub-sampled versions of the latent DPs. Each mixture model may acquire atoms from different latent DPs, while each atom may be shared by multiple mixtures. This multi-to-multi association distinguishes the proposed method from previous ones that require the model structure to be a tree or a chain, allowing more ﬂexible designs. We also derive a sampling algorithm that jointly infers the model parameters and present experiments on both document analysis and image modeling. 1</p><p>3 0.19796425 <a title="315-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate</p><p>Abstract: First-order probabilistic models combine the power of ﬁrst-order logic, the de facto tool for handling relational structure, with probabilistic graphical models, the de facto tool for handling uncertainty. Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms for them have been the subject of much recent research. The main idea in these algorithms is to improve the accuracy and scalability of existing graphical models’ inference algorithms by exploiting symmetry in the ﬁrst-order representation. In this paper, we consider blocked Gibbs sampling, an advanced MCMC scheme, and lift it to the ﬁrst-order level. We propose to achieve this by partitioning the ﬁrst-order atoms in the model into a set of disjoint clusters such that exact lifted inference is polynomial in each cluster given an assignment to all other atoms not in the cluster. We propose an approach for constructing the clusters and show how it can be used to trade accuracy with computational complexity in a principled manner. Our experimental evaluation shows that lifted Gibbs sampling is superior to the propositional algorithm in terms of accuracy, scalability and convergence.</p><p>5 0.11678913 <a title="315-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_bipartite_graphs.html">59 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for bipartite graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Grégoire Montavon, Katja Hansen, Siamac Fazli, Matthias Rupp, Franziska Biegler, Andreas Ziehe, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Anatole V. Lilienfeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of molecular energetics in chemical compound space is a crucial ingredient for rational compound design. The inherently graph-like, non-vectorial nature of molecular data gives rise to a unique and difﬁcult machine learning problem. In this paper, we adopt a learning-from-scratch approach where quantum-mechanical molecular energies are predicted directly from the raw molecular geometry. The study suggests a beneﬁt from setting ﬂexible priors and enforcing invariance stochastically rather than structurally. Our results improve the state-of-the-art by a factor of almost three, bringing statistical methods one step closer to chemical accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.58853835 <a title="315-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

<p>Author: Du Tran, Junsong Yuan</p><p>Abstract: Structured output learning has been successfully applied to object localization, where the mapping between an image and an object bounding box can be well captured. Its extension to action localization in videos, however, is much more challenging, because we need to predict the locations of the action patterns both spatially and temporally, i.e., identifying a sequence of bounding boxes that track the action in video. The problem becomes intractable due to the exponentially large size of the structured video space where actions could occur. We propose a novel structured learning approach for spatio-temporal action localization. The mapping between a video and a spatio-temporal action trajectory is learned. The intractable inference and learning problems are addressed by leveraging an efﬁcient Max-Path search method, thus making it feasible to optimize the model over the whole structured space. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.56786376 <a title="315-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.html">158 nips-2012-ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of ﬁve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a ﬁnal 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry. 1</p><p>4 0.52653855 <a title="315-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Entropy_Estimations_Using_Correlated_Symmetric_Stable_Random_Projections.html">119 nips-2012-Entropy Estimations Using Correlated Symmetric Stable Random Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Cun-hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Methods for efﬁciently estimating Shannon entropy of data streams have important applications in learning, data mining, and network anomaly detections (e.g., the DDoS attacks). For nonnegative data streams, the method of Compressed Counting (CC) [11, 13] based on maximally-skewed stable random projections can provide accurate estimates of the Shannon entropy using small storage. However, CC is no longer applicable when entries of data streams can be below zero, which is a common scenario when comparing two streams. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for entropy estimation in general data streams which allow negative entries. In our method, the Shannon entropy is approximated by the ﬁnite difference of two correlated frequency moments estimated from correlated samples of symmetric stable random variables. Interestingly, the estimator for the moment we recommend for entropy estimation barely has bounded variance itself, whereas the common geometric mean estimator (which has bounded higher-order moments) is not sufﬁcient for entropy estimation. Our experiments conﬁrm that this method is able to well approximate the Shannon entropy using small storage.</p><p>5 0.52151388 <a title="315-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Recognizing_Activities_by_Attribute_Dynamics.html">289 nips-2012-Recognizing Activities by Attribute Dynamics</a></p>

A generative model, denoted the binary dynamic system (BDS), is proposed to learn both the distribution and dynamics of different activities in this space. The BDS is a non-linear dynamic system, which extends both the binary principal component analysis (PCA) and classical linear dynamic systems (LDS), by combining binary observation variables with a hidden Gauss-Markov state process. In this way, it integrates the representation power of semantic modeling with the ability of dynamic systems to capture the temporal structure of time-varying processes. An algorithm for learning BDS parameters, inspired by a popular LDS learning method from dynamic textures, is proposed. A similarity measure between BDSs, which generalizes the BinetCauchy kernel for LDS, is then introduced and used to design activity classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The proposed method is shown to outperform similar classiÄ?Ĺš ers derived from the kernel dynamic system (KDS) and state-of-the-art approaches for dynamics-based or attribute-based action recognition. 1</p><p>6 0.52050829 <a title="315-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Coupling_Nonparametric_Mixtures_via_Latent_Dirichlet_Processes.html">89 nips-2012-Coupling Nonparametric Mixtures via Latent Dirichlet Processes</a></p>

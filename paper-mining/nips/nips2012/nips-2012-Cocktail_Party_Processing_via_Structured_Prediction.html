<p>Author: Dan Ciresan, Alessandro Giusti, Luca M. Gambardella, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: We address a central problem of neuroanatomy, namely, the automatic segmentation of neuronal structures depicted in stacks of electron microscopy (EM) images. This is necessary to efﬁciently map 3D brain structure and connectivity. To segment biological neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep artiﬁcial neural network as a pixel classiﬁer. The label of each pixel (membrane or nonmembrane) is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability for each class. The classiﬁer is trained by plain gradient descent on a 512 × 512 × 30 stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same size (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation Challenge. Even without problem-speciﬁc postprocessing, our approach outperforms competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. rand error, warping error and pixel error. For pixel error, our approach is the only one outperforming a second human observer. 1</p><p>3 0.14812745 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Slice_Normalized_Dynamic_Markov_Logic_Networks.html">314 nips-2012-Slice Normalized Dynamic Markov Logic Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Tivadar Papai, Henry Kautz, Daniel Stefankovic</p><p>Abstract: Markov logic is a widely used tool in statistical relational learning, which uses a weighted ﬁrst-order logic knowledge base to specify a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). In many applications, a Markov logic network (MLN) is trained in one domain, but used in a different one. This paper focuses on dynamic Markov logic networks, where the size of the discretized time-domain typically varies between training and testing. It has been previously pointed out that the marginal probabilities of truth assignments to ground atoms can change if one extends or reduces the domains of predicates in an MLN. We show that in addition to this problem, the standard way of unrolling a Markov logic theory into a MRF may result in time-inhomogeneity of the underlying Markov chain. Furthermore, even if these representational problems are not signiﬁcant for a given domain, we show that the more practical problem of generating samples in a sequential conditional random ﬁeld for the next slice relying on the samples from the previous slice has high computational cost in the general case, due to the need to estimate a normalization factor for each sample. We propose a new discriminative model, slice normalized dynamic Markov logic networks (SN-DMLN), that suffers from none of these issues. It supports efﬁcient online inference, and can directly model inﬂuences between variables within a time slice that do not have a causal direction, in contrast with fully directed models (e.g., DBNs). Experimental results show an improvement in accuracy over previous approaches to online inference in dynamic Markov logic networks. 1</p><p>4 0.13998625 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Mixing_Properties_of_Conditional_Markov_Chains_with_Unbounded_Feature_Functions.html">218 nips-2012-Mixing Properties of Conditional Markov Chains with Unbounded Feature Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Sinn, Bei Chen</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Markov Chains (also known as Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields in the literature) are a versatile class of discriminative models for the distribution of a sequence of hidden states conditional on a sequence of observable variables. Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been ﬁrst studied in [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: ﬁrst, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identiﬁability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given. 1</p><p>5 0.1206219 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-conﬁdence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T 1/2 log T ) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-conﬁdence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance. 1</p><p>6 0.1046277 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Hierarchical_spike_coding_of_sound.html">150 nips-2012-Hierarchical spike coding of sound</a></p>

<p>Author: Sourish Chaudhuri, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: Approaches to audio classiﬁcation and retrieval tasks largely rely on detectionbased discriminative models. We submit that such models make a simplistic assumption in mapping acoustics directly to semantics, whereas the actual process is likely more complex. We present a generative model that maps acoustics in a hierarchical manner to increasingly higher-level semantics. Our model has two layers with the ﬁrst layer modeling generalized sound units with no clear semantic associations, while the second layer models local patterns over these sound units. We evaluate our model on a large-scale retrieval task from TRECVID 2011, and report signiﬁcant improvements over standard baselines. 1</p><p>3 0.58151728 <a title="72-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Slice_Normalized_Dynamic_Markov_Logic_Networks.html">314 nips-2012-Slice Normalized Dynamic Markov Logic Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Hyunsin Park, Sungrack Yun, Sanghyuk Park, Jongmin Kim, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For phoneme classiﬁcation, this paper describes an acoustic model based on the variational Gaussian process dynamical system (VGPDS). The nonlinear and nonparametric acoustic model is adopted to overcome the limitations of classical hidden Markov models (HMMs) in modeling speech. The Gaussian process prior on the dynamics and emission functions respectively enable the complex dynamic structure and long-range dependency of speech to be better represented than that by an HMM. In addition, a variance constraint in the VGPDS is introduced to eliminate the sparse approximation error in the kernel matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with three experimental results, including parameter estimation and classiﬁcation performance, on the synthetic and benchmark datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.5101217 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Controlled_Recognition_Bounds_for_Visual_Learning_and_Exploration.html">83 nips-2012-Controlled Recognition Bounds for Visual Learning and Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Vasiliy Karasev, Alessandro Chiuso, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe the tradeoff between the performance in a visual recognition problem and the control authority that the agent can exercise on the sensing process. We focus on the problem of “visual search” of an object in an otherwise known and static scene, propose a measure of control authority, and relate it to the expected risk and its proxy (conditional entropy of the posterior density). We show this analytically, as well as empirically by simulation using the simplest known model that captures the phenomenology of image formation, including scaling and occlusions. We show that a “passive” agent given a training set can provide no guarantees on performance beyond what is afforded by the priors, and that an “omnipotent” agent, capable of inﬁnite control authority, can achieve arbitrarily good performance (asymptotically). In between these limiting cases, the tradeoff can be characterized empirically. 1</p><p>6 0.50392145 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Putting_Bayes_to_sleep.html">283 nips-2012-Putting Bayes to sleep</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies a novel discriminative part-based model to represent and recognize object shapes with an “And-Or graph”. We deﬁne this model consisting of three layers: the leaf-nodes with collaborative edges for localizing local parts, the or-nodes specifying the switch of leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the global veriﬁcation. A discriminative learning algorithm, extended from the CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e.g., the conﬁguration of the leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration. The advantages of our method are two-fold. (i) The And-Or graph model enables us to handle well large intra-class variance and background clutters for object shape detection from images. (ii) The proposed learning algorithm is able to obtain the And-Or graph representation without requiring elaborate supervision and initialization. We validate the proposed method on several challenging databases (e.g., INRIA-Horse, ETHZ-Shape, and UIUC-People), and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.60475302 <a title="72-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Automatic_Feature_Induction_for_Stagewise_Collaborative_Filtering.html">49 nips-2012-Automatic Feature Induction for Stagewise Collaborative Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Joonseok Lee, Mingxuan Sun, Guy Lebanon, Seung-jean Kim</p><p>Abstract: Recent approaches to collaborative ﬁltering have concentrated on estimating an algebraic or statistical model, and using the model for predicting missing ratings. In this paper we observe that different models have relative advantages in different regions of the input space. This motivates our approach of using stagewise linear combinations of collaborative ﬁltering algorithms, with non-constant combination coefﬁcients based on kernel smoothing. The resulting stagewise model is computationally scalable and outperforms a wide selection of state-of-the-art collaborative ﬁltering algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.58102202 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Dimensionality_Dependent_PAC-Bayes_Margin_Bound.html">98 nips-2012-Dimensionality Dependent PAC-Bayes Margin Bound</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi Jin, Liwei Wang</p><p>Abstract: Margin is one of the most important concepts in machine learning. Previous margin bounds, both for SVM and for boosting, are dimensionality independent. A major advantage of this dimensionality independency is that it can explain the excellent performance of SVM whose feature spaces are often of high or inﬁnite dimension. In this paper we address the problem whether such dimensionality independency is intrinsic for the margin bounds. We prove a dimensionality dependent PAC-Bayes margin bound. The bound is monotone increasing with respect to the dimension when keeping all other factors ﬁxed. We show that our bound is strictly sharper than a previously well-known PAC-Bayes margin bound if the feature space is of ﬁnite dimension; and the two bounds tend to be equivalent as the dimension goes to inﬁnity. In addition, we show that the VC bound for linear classiﬁers can be recovered from our bound under mild conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and ﬁnd that the new bound is useful for model selection and is usually signiﬁcantly sharper than the dimensionality independent PAC-Bayes margin bound as well as the VC bound for linear classiﬁers.</p><p>5 0.51937795 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Compressive_neural_representation_of_sparse%2C_high-dimensional_probabilities.html">79 nips-2012-Compressive neural representation of sparse, high-dimensional probabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Xaq Pitkow</p><p>Abstract: This paper shows how sparse, high-dimensional probability distributions could be represented by neurons with exponential compression. The representation is a novel application of compressive sensing to sparse probability distributions rather than to the usual sparse signals. The compressive measurements correspond to expected values of nonlinear functions of the probabilistically distributed variables. When these expected values are estimated by sampling, the quality of the compressed representation is limited only by the quality of sampling. Since the compression preserves the geometric structure of the space of sparse probability distributions, probabilistic computation can be performed in the compressed domain. Interestingly, functions satisfying the requirements of compressive sensing can be implemented as simple perceptrons. If we use perceptrons as a simple model of feedforward computation by neurons, these results show that the mean activity of a relatively small number of neurons can accurately represent a highdimensional joint distribution implicitly, even without accounting for any noise correlations. This comprises a novel hypothesis for how neurons could encode probabilities in the brain. 1</p><p>6 0.49968642 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Supervised_Learning_with_Similarity_Functions.html">330 nips-2012-Supervised Learning with Similarity Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Du Tran, Junsong Yuan</p><p>Abstract: Structured output learning has been successfully applied to object localization, where the mapping between an image and an object bounding box can be well captured. Its extension to action localization in videos, however, is much more challenging, because we need to predict the locations of the action patterns both spatially and temporally, i.e., identifying a sequence of bounding boxes that track the action in video. The problem becomes intractable due to the exponentially large size of the structured video space where actions could occur. We propose a novel structured learning approach for spatio-temporal action localization. The mapping between a video and a spatio-temporal action trajectory is learned. The intractable inference and learning problems are addressed by leveraging an efﬁcient Max-Path search method, thus making it feasible to optimize the model over the whole structured space. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.3246505 <a title="311-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Will Zou, Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We apply salient feature detection and tracking in videos to simulate ﬁxations and smooth pursuit in human vision. With tracked sequences as input, a hierarchical network of modules learns invariant features using a temporal slowness constraint. The network encodes invariance which are increasingly complex with hierarchy. Although learned from videos, our features are spatial instead of spatial-temporal, and well suited for extracting features from still images. We applied our features to four datasets (COIL-100, Caltech 101, STL-10, PubFig), and observe a consistent improvement of 4% to 5% in classiﬁcation accuracy. With this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy 61% on STL-10 dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.24070638 <a title="311-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>5 0.18249029 <a title="311-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Generalization_Bounds_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">142 nips-2012-Generalization Bounds for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Zhang, Lei Zhang, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new framework to study the generalization bound of the learning process for domain adaptation. We consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation settings: one is domain adaptation with multiple sources and the other is domain adaptation combining source and target data. In particular, we use the integral probability metric to measure the difference between two domains. Then, we develop the speciﬁc Hoeffding-type deviation inequality and symmetrization inequality for either kind of domain adaptation to achieve the corresponding generalization bound based on the uniform entropy number. By using the resultant generalization bound, we analyze the asymptotic convergence and the rate of convergence of the learning process for domain adaptation. Meanwhile, we discuss the factors that affect the asymptotic behavior of the learning process. The numerical experiments support our results. 1</p><p>6 0.14103296 <a title="311-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-On_the_connections_between_saliency_and_tracking.html">256 nips-2012-On the connections between saliency and tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Vijay Mahadevan, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: A model connecting visual tracking and saliency has recently been proposed. This model is based on the saliency hypothesis for tracking which postulates that tracking is achieved by the top-down tuning, based on target features, of discriminant center-surround saliency mechanisms over time. In this work, we identify three main predictions that must hold if the hypothesis were true: 1) tracking reliability should be larger for salient than for non-salient targets, 2) tracking reliability should have a dependence on the deﬁning variables of saliency, namely feature contrast and distractor heterogeneity, and must replicate the dependence of saliency on these variables, and 3) saliency and tracking can be implemented with common low level neural mechanisms. We conﬁrm that the ﬁrst two predictions hold by reporting results from a set of human behavior studies on the connection between saliency and tracking. We also show that the third prediction holds by constructing a common neurophysiologically plausible architecture that can computationally solve both saliency and tracking. This architecture is fully compliant with the standard physiological models of V1 and MT, and with what is known about attentional control in area LIP, while explaining the results of the human behavior experiments.</p><p>4 0.70471185 <a title="311-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Recognizing_Activities_by_Attribute_Dynamics.html">289 nips-2012-Recognizing Activities by Attribute Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Weixin Li, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the dynamic structure of human activities in the attributes space. A video sequence is Ä?Ĺš rst represented in a semantic feature space, where each feature encodes the probability of occurrence of an activity attribute at a given time. A generative model, denoted the binary dynamic system (BDS), is proposed to learn both the distribution and dynamics of different activities in this space. The BDS is a non-linear dynamic system, which extends both the binary principal component analysis (PCA) and classical linear dynamic systems (LDS), by combining binary observation variables with a hidden Gauss-Markov state process. In this way, it integrates the representation power of semantic modeling with the ability of dynamic systems to capture the temporal structure of time-varying processes. An algorithm for learning BDS parameters, inspired by a popular LDS learning method from dynamic textures, is proposed. A similarity measure between BDSs, which generalizes the BinetCauchy kernel for LDS, is then introduced and used to design activity classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The proposed method is shown to outperform similar classiÄ?Ĺš ers derived from the kernel dynamic system (KDS) and state-of-the-art approaches for dynamics-based or attribute-based action recognition. 1</p><p>5 0.65341347 <a title="311-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>

We show promising results on the 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection [1] and LabelMe Video [2] datasets that illustrate the beneﬁt of our approach to adapt object detectors to video. 1</p><p>2 0.78920621 <a title="311-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Approximating_Equilibria_in_Sequential_Auctions_with_Incomplete_Information_and_Multi-Unit_Demand.html">45 nips-2012-Approximating Equilibria in Sequential Auctions with Incomplete Information and Multi-Unit Demand</a></p>
<p>Author: Amy Greenwald, Jiacui Li, Eric Sodomka</p><p>Abstract: In many large economic markets, goods are sold through sequential auctions. Examples include eBay, online ad auctions, wireless spectrum auctions, and the Dutch ﬂower auctions. In this paper, we combine methods from game theory and decision theory to search for approximate equilibria in sequential auction domains, in which bidders do not know their opponents’ values for goods, bidders only partially observe the actions of their opponents’, and bidders demand multiple goods. We restrict attention to two-phased strategies: ﬁrst predict (i.e., learn); second, optimize. We use best-reply dynamics [4] for prediction (i.e., to predict other bidders’ strategies), and then assuming ﬁxed other-bidder strategies, we estimate and solve the ensuing Markov decision processes (MDP) [18] for optimization. We exploit auction properties to represent the MDP in a more compact state space, and we use Monte Carlo simulation to make estimating the MDP tractable. We show how equilibria found using our search procedure compare to known equilibria for simpler auction domains, and we approximate an equilibrium for a more complex auction domain where analytical solutions are unknown. 1</p><p>3 0.73113209 <a title="311-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Searching_for_objects_driven_by_context.html">303 nips-2012-Searching for objects driven by context</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Nicolas Heess, Yee W. Teh, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: The dominant visual search paradigm for object class detection is sliding windows. Although simple and effective, it is also wasteful, unnatural and rigidly hardwired. We propose strategies to search for objects which intelligently explore the space of windows by making sequential observations at locations decided based on previous observations. Our strategies adapt to the class being searched and to the content of a particular test image, exploiting context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. In addition to being more elegant than sliding windows, we demonstrate experimentally on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset that our strategies evaluate two orders of magnitude fewer windows while achieving higher object detection performance. 1</p><p>4 0.72445893 <a title="311-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Karayev, Tobias Baumgartner, Mario Fritz, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method signiﬁcantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains 66% better AP than a random ordering, and 14% better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least 11% better performance. Our method is easily extensible, as it treats detectors and classiﬁers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning. 1</p><p>5 0.72272718 <a title="311-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-A_systematic_approach_to_extracting_semantic_information_from_functional_MRI_data.html">28 nips-2012-A systematic approach to extracting semantic information from functional MRI data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francisco Pereira, Matthew Botvinick</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel classiﬁcation method for functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets with tens of classes. The method is designed to make predictions using information from as many brain locations as possible, instead of resorting to feature selection, and does this by decomposing the pattern of brain activation into differently informative sub-regions. We provide results over a complex semantic processing dataset that show that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art feature selection and also suggest how the method may be used to perform group or exploratory analyses of complex class structure. 1</p><p>6 0.72033346 <a title="311-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>

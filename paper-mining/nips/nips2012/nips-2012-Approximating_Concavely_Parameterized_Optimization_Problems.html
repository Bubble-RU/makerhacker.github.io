<p>Author: Paul Vernaza, Drew Bagnell</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling is a popular choice for sequence analysis in applications such as natural language processing, where the sequences are embedded in discrete, tractably-sized spaces. We consider the problem of applying MaxEnt to distributions over paths in continuous spaces of high dimensionality— a problem for which inference is generally intractable. Our main contribution is to show that this intractability can be avoided as long as the constrained features possess a certain kind of low dimensional structure. In this case, we show that the associated partition function is symmetric and that this symmetry can be exploited to compute the partition function efﬁciently in a compressed form. Empirical results are given showing an application of our method to learning models of high-dimensional human motion capture data. 1</p><p>3 0.14074084 <a title="44-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Calibrated_Elastic_Regularization_in_Matrix_Completion.html">64 nips-2012-Calibrated Elastic Regularization in Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Tingni Sun, Cun-hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of matrix completion, which is to estimate a matrix from observations in a small subset of indices. We propose a calibrated spectrum elastic net method with a sum of the nuclear and Frobenius penalties and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the convex minimization problem. The iterative algorithm alternates between imputing the missing entries in the incomplete matrix by the current guess and estimating the matrix by a scaled soft-thresholding singular value decomposition of the imputed matrix until the resulting matrix converges. A calibration step follows to correct the bias caused by the Frobenius penalty. Under proper coherence conditions and for suitable penalties levels, we prove that the proposed estimator achieves an error bound of nearly optimal order and in proportion to the noise level. This provides a uniﬁed analysis of the noisy and noiseless matrix completion problems. Simulation results are presented to compare our proposal with previous ones. 1</p><p>4 0.10159171 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Recursive_Perceptual_Representations.html">197 nips-2012-Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Oriol Vinyals, Yangqing Jia, Li Deng, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become very popular in vision as part of state-of-the-art object recognition and other classiﬁcation tasks but require high dimensional feature spaces for good performance. Deep learning methods can ﬁnd more compact representations but current methods employ multilayer perceptrons that require solving a difﬁcult, non-convex optimization problem. We propose a deep non-linear classiﬁer whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications. The use of random projections is key to our method, as we show in the experiments section, in which we observe a consistent improvement over previous –often more complicated– methods on several vision and speech benchmarks. 1</p><p>5 0.099506594 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Factorial_LDA%3A_Sparse_Multi-Dimensional_Text_Models.html">124 nips-2012-Factorial LDA: Sparse Multi-Dimensional Text Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>6 0.094665371 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Continuous_Reinforcement_Learning.html">259 nips-2012-Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Zohar Karnin</p><p>Abstract: We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classiﬁcation formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classiﬁcation problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known. 1</p><p>3 0.55629396 <a title="44-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Distributed_Non-Stochastic_Experts.html">102 nips-2012-Distributed Non-Stochastic Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Varun Kanade, Zhenming Liu, Bozidar Radunovic</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to k sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator. At each time-step t, one of the k site nodes has to pick an expert from the set {1, . . . , n}, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon T , while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum. The two extreme solutions to this problem are: (i) Full communication: This essentially simulates the nondistributed setting to obtain the optimal O( log(n)T ) regret bound at the cost of T communication. (ii) No communication: Each site runs an independent copy – the regret is O( log(n)kT ) and the communication is 0. This paper shows the √ difﬁculty of simultaneously achieving regret asymptotically better than kT and communication better than T . We give a novel algorithm that for an oblivious √ adversary achieves a non-trivial trade-off: regret O( k 5(1+ )/6 T ) and communication O(T /k ), for any value of ∈ (0, 1/5). We also consider a variant of the model, where the coordinator picks the expert. In this model, we show that the label-efﬁcient forecaster of Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2005) already gives us strategy that is near optimal in regret vs communication trade-off. 1</p><p>4 0.55568987 <a title="44-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Halfspaces_with_the_Zero-One_Loss%3A_Time-Accuracy_Tradeoffs.html">174 nips-2012-Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aharon Birnbaum, Shai S. Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: Given α, ϵ, we study the time complexity required to improperly learn a halfspace with misclassiﬁcation error rate of at most (1 + α) L∗ + ϵ, where L∗ is the γ γ optimal γ-margin error rate. For α = 1/γ, polynomial time and sample complexity is achievable using the hinge-loss. For α = 0, Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2011] showed that poly(1/γ) time is impossible, while learning is possible in ˜ time exp(O(1/γ)). An immediate question, which this paper tackles, is what is achievable if α ∈ (0, 1/γ). We derive positive results interpolating between the polynomial time for α = 1/γ and the exponential time for α = 0. In particular, we show that there are cases in which α = o(1/γ) but the problem is still solvable in polynomial time. Our results naturally extend to the adversarial online learning model and to the PAC learning with malicious noise model. 1</p><p>5 0.55150861 <a title="44-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Online_Sum-Product_Computation_Over_Trees.html">260 nips-2012-Online Sum-Product Computation Over Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Stephen Pasteris, Fabio Vitale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of performing efﬁcient sum-product computations in an online setting over a tree. A natural application of our methods is to compute the marginal distribution at a vertex in a tree-structured Markov random ﬁeld. Belief propagation can be used to solve this problem, but requires time linear in the size of the tree, and is therefore too slow in an online setting where we are continuously receiving new data and computing individual marginals. With our method we aim to update the data and compute marginals in time that is no more than logarithmic in the size of the tree, and is often signiﬁcantly less. We accomplish this via a hierarchical covering structure that caches previous local sum-product computations. Our contribution is three-fold: we i) give a linear time algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal hierarchical cover of a tree; ii) give a sum-productlike algorithm to efﬁciently compute marginals with respect to this cover; and iii) apply “i” and “ii” to ﬁnd an efﬁcient algorithm with a regret bound for the online allocation problem in a multi-task setting. 1</p><p>6 0.54565966 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Calibrated_Elastic_Regularization_in_Matrix_Completion.html">64 nips-2012-Calibrated Elastic Regularization in Matrix Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Lloyd Elliott, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for genetic sequence data in which a set of genetic sequences is modelled using a Markov model of partitions. The partitions at consecutive locations in the genome are related by the splitting and merging of their clusters. Our model can be thought of as a discrete analogue of the continuous fragmentation-coagulation process [Teh et al 2011], preserving the important properties of projectivity, exchangeability and reversibility, while being more scalable. We apply this model to the problem of genotype imputation, showing improved computational efﬁciency while maintaining accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art genotype imputation methods. 1</p><p>2 0.77283102 <a title="44-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Exponential_Concentration_for_Mutual_Information_Estimation_with_Application_to_Forests.html">123 nips-2012-Exponential Concentration for Mutual Information Estimation with Application to Forests</a></p>

Previous results on mutual information estimation only bounded expected error. The advantage of having the exponential inequality is that, combined with the union bound, we can guarantee accurate estimators of the mutual information for many pairs of random variables simultaneously. As an application, we show how to use such a result to optimally estimate the density function and graph of a distribution which is Markov to a forest graph. 1</p><p>3 0.7662276 <a title="44-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Nonconvex_Penalization_Using_Laplace_Exponents_and_Concave_Conjugates.html">244 nips-2012-Nonconvex Penalization Using Laplace Exponents and Concave Conjugates</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Bojun Tu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study sparsity-inducing nonconvex penalty functions using L´ vy e processes. We deﬁne such a penalty as the Laplace exponent of a subordinator. Accordingly, we propose a novel approach for the construction of sparsityinducing nonconvex penalties. Particularly, we show that the nonconvex logarithmic (LOG) and exponential (EXP) penalty functions are the Laplace exponents of Gamma and compound Poisson subordinators, respectively. Additionally, we explore the concave conjugate of nonconvex penalties. We ﬁnd that the LOG and EXP penalties are the concave conjugates of negative Kullback-Leiber (KL) distance functions. Furthermore, the relationship between these two penalties is due to asymmetricity of the KL distance. 1</p><p>4 0.74574083 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Rational_inference_of_relative_preferences.html">288 nips-2012-Rational inference of relative preferences</a></p>

However, this assumption is refuted by observed human behavior, including studies wherein preferences have been shown to change systematically simply through variation in the set of choice options presented. In this paper, we show that interpreting desirability as a relative comparison between available options at any particular decision instance results in a rational theory of value-inference that explains heretofore intractable violations of rational choice behavior in human subjects. Complementarily, we also characterize the conditions under which a rational agent selecting optimal options indicated by dynamic value inference in our framework will behave identically to one whose preferences are encoded using a static ordinal utility function. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.72380096 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Approximating_Concavely_Parameterized_Optimization_Problems.html">44 nips-2012-Approximating Concavely Parameterized Optimization Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Joachim Giesen, Jens Mueller, Soeren Laue, Sascha Swiercy</p><p>Abstract: We consider an abstract class of optimization problems that are parameterized concavely in a single parameter, and show that the solution path along the √ parameter can always be approximated with accuracy ε > 0 by a set of size O(1/ ε). A √ lower bound of size Ω(1/ ε) shows that the upper bound is tight up to a constant factor. We also devise an algorithm that calls a step-size oracle and computes an √ approximate path of size O(1/ ε). Finally, we provide an implementation of the oracle for soft-margin support vector machines, and a parameterized semi-deﬁnite program for matrix completion. 1</p><p>6 0.7234332 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Collaborative_Gaussian_Processes_for_Preference_Learning.html">74 nips-2012-Collaborative Gaussian Processes for Preference Learning</a></p>

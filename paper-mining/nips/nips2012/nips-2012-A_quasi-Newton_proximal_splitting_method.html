<p>Author: Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: We study a class of large-scale, nonsmooth, and nonconvex optimization problems. In particular, we focus on nonconvex problems with composite objectives. This class includes the extensively studied class of convex composite objective problems as a subclass. To solve composite nonconvex problems we introduce a powerful new framework based on asymptotically nonvanishing errors, avoiding the common stronger assumption of vanishing errors. Within our new framework we derive both batch and incremental proximal splitting algorithms. To our knowledge, our work is ﬁrst to develop and analyze incremental nonconvex proximalsplitting algorithms, even if we were to disregard the ability to handle nonvanishing errors. We illustrate one instance of our general framework by showing an application to large-scale nonsmooth matrix factorization. 1</p><p>4 0.25763178 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Sequences_of_Signals_with_Sparse_Increments_via_Differential__1-Minimization.html">120 nips-2012-Exact and Stable Recovery of Sequences of Signals with Sparse Increments via Differential  1-Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Demba Ba, Behtash Babadi, Patrick Purdon, Emery Brown</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, (xk )K , for which k=0 the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse (with Sk typically smaller than S1 ), based on linear measurements (yk = Ak xk + ek )K , where Ak and ek denote the meak=1 surement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each Ak obeys the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain order—depending only on Sk —we show that in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum of the ℓ1 -norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement constraints, recovers the sequence (xk )K exactly. This is an interesting result bek=1 cause this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing problem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recovery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an application to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity.</p><p>5 0.17991503 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Convex_Formulation_for_Learning_Scale-Free_Networks_via_Submodular_Relaxation.html">6 nips-2012-A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Defazio, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data. We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lov´ sz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes a such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset.</p><p>6 0.1722067 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Newton-Like_Methods_for_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation.html">240 nips-2012-Newton-Like Methods for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Figen Oztoprak, Jorge Nocedal, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: We propose two classes of second-order optimization methods for solving the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. The ﬁrst approach, which we call the Newton-LASSO method, minimizes a piecewise quadratic model of the objective function at every iteration to generate a step. We employ the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA) to solve this subproblem. The second approach, which we call the Orthant-Based Newton method, is a two-phase algorithm that ﬁrst identiﬁes an orthant face and then minimizes a smooth quadratic approximation of the objective function using the conjugate gradient method. These methods exploit the structure of the Hessian to efﬁciently compute the search direction and to avoid explicitly storing the Hessian. We also propose a limited memory BFGS variant of the orthant-based Newton method. Numerical results, including comparisons with the method implemented in the QUIC software [1], suggest that all the techniques described in this paper constitute useful tools for the solution of the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. 1</p><p>6 0.58917868 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Stochastic_Gradient_Method_with_an_Exponential_Convergence__Rate_for_Finite_Training_Sets.html">20 nips-2012-A Stochastic Gradient Method with an Exponential Convergence  Rate for Finite Training Sets</a></p>

Using a state space model established by the data construction procedure, our MPGP recursively ﬁlters out the estimation of hidden function values by a Gaussian mixture. Meanwhile, it provides a new online method for training hyperparameters with a number of weighted particles. We demonstrate the estimated performance of our MPGP on both simulated and real large data sets. The results show that our MPGP is a robust estimation algorithm with high computational efﬁciency, which outperforms other state-of-art sparse GP methods. 1</p><p>2 0.8625744 <a title="27-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive_Deep_Learning_for_3D_Object_Classification.html">87 nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive Deep Learning for 3D Object Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Brody Huval, Bharath Bath, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D sensing technologies make it possible to easily record color and depth images which together can improve object recognition. Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, ﬁxed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efﬁcient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs. 1</p><p>3 0.82203078 <a title="27-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Ancestor_Sampling_for_Particle_Gibbs.html">41 nips-2012-Ancestor Sampling for Particle Gibbs</a></p>
<p>Author: Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas Schön, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method in the family of particle MCMC methods that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PG-AS). Similarly to the existing PG with backward simulation (PG-BS) procedure, we use backward sampling to (considerably) improve the mixing of the PG kernel. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PG-BS, however, we achieve the same effect in a single forward sweep. We apply the PG-AS framework to the challenging class of non-Markovian state-space models. We develop a truncation strategy of these models that is applicable in principle to any backward-simulation-based method, but which is particularly well suited to the PG-AS framework. In particular, as we show in a simulation study, PG-AS can yield an order-of-magnitude improved accuracy relative to PG-BS due to its robustness to the truncation error. Several application examples are discussed, including Rao-Blackwellized particle smoothing and inference in degenerate state-space models. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.81538063 <a title="27-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-A_quasi-Newton_proximal_splitting_method.html">27 nips-2012-A quasi-Newton proximal splitting method</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Becker, Jalal Fadili</p><p>Abstract: A new result in convex analysis on the calculation of proximity operators in certain scaled norms is derived. We describe efﬁcient implementations of the proximity calculation for a useful class of functions; the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem. The second part of the paper applies the previous result to acceleration of convex minimization problems, and leads to an elegant quasi-Newton method. The optimization method compares favorably against state-of-the-art alternatives. The algorithm has extensive applications including signal processing, sparse recovery and machine learning and classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.80250776 <a title="27-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Label_Trees_for_Probabilistic_Modelling_of_Implicit_Feedback.html">178 nips-2012-Learning Label Trees for Probabilistic Modelling of Implicit Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: User preferences for items can be inferred from either explicit feedback, such as item ratings, or implicit feedback, such as rental histories. Research in collaborative ﬁltering has concentrated on explicit feedback, resulting in the development of accurate and scalable models. However, since explicit feedback is often difﬁcult to collect it is important to develop effective models that take advantage of the more widely available implicit feedback. We introduce a probabilistic approach to collaborative ﬁltering with implicit feedback based on modelling the user’s item selection process. In the interests of scalability, we restrict our attention to treestructured distributions over items and develop a principled and efﬁcient algorithm for learning item trees from data. We also identify a problem with a widely used protocol for evaluating implicit feedback models and propose a way of addressing it using a small quantity of explicit feedback data. 1</p><p>6 0.75500196 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Nonparametric_Reduced_Rank_Regression.html">247 nips-2012-Nonparametric Reduced Rank Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>3 0.11037888 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Tensor_Decomposition_for_Fast_Parsing_with_Latent-Variable_PCFGs.html">334 nips-2012-Tensor Decomposition for Fast Parsing with Latent-Variable PCFGs</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Collins, Shay B. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent-variable PCFGs, which have been shown to be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known in the multilinear algebra literature. We also describe an error bound for this approximation, which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are well approximated, then the probability distribution over trees will also be well approximated. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data demonstrates a signiﬁcant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance. 1</p><p>4 0.088615127 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Hamming_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">148 nips-2012-Hamming Distance Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Norouzi, David M. Blei, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by large-scale multimedia applications we propose to learn mappings from high-dimensional data to binary codes that preserve semantic similarity. Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efﬁcient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a ﬂexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classiﬁcation results using no more than kNN on the binary codes. 1</p><p>5 0.078898422 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Joint_Modeling_of_a_Matrix_with_Associated_Text_via_Latent_Binary_Features.html">166 nips-2012-Joint Modeling of a Matrix with Associated Text via Latent Binary Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianxing Zhang, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A new methodology is developed for joint analysis of a matrix and accompanying documents, with the documents associated with the matrix rows/columns. The documents are modeled with a focused topic model, inferring interpretable latent binary features for each document. A new matrix decomposition is developed, with latent binary features associated with the rows/columns, and with imposition of a low-rank constraint. The matrix decomposition and topic model are coupled by sharing the latent binary feature vectors associated with each. The model is applied to roll-call data, with the associated documents deﬁned by the legislation. Advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated for prediction of votes on a new piece of legislation, based only on the observed text of legislation. The coupling of the text and legislation is also shown to yield insight into the properties of the matrix decomposition for roll-call data. 1</p><p>6 0.073322117 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_through_Structured_Classification.html">162 nips-2012-Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Structured Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Weiwei Cheng, Willem Waegeman, Volkmar Welker, Eyke Hüllermeier</p><p>Abstract: Several machine learning methods allow for abstaining from uncertain predictions. While being common for settings like conventional classiﬁcation, abstention has been studied much less in learning to rank. We address abstention for the label ranking setting, allowing the learner to declare certain pairs of labels as being incomparable and, thus, to predict partial instead of total orders. In our method, such predictions are produced via thresholding the probabilities of pairwise preferences between labels, as induced by a predicted probability distribution on the set of all rankings. We formally analyze this approach for the Mallows and the Plackett-Luce model, showing that it produces proper partial orders as predictions and characterizing the expressiveness of the induced class of partial orders. These theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the practical usefulness of the approach. 1</p><p>4 0.56700236 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Statistical_Consistency_of_Ranking_Methods_in_A_Rank-Differentiable_Probability_Space.html">323 nips-2012-Statistical Consistency of Ranking Methods in A Rank-Differentiable Probability Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Lan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the statistical consistency of ranking methods. Recently, it was proven that many commonly used pairwise ranking methods are inconsistent with the weighted pairwise disagreement loss (WPDL), which can be viewed as the true loss of ranking, even in a low-noise setting. This result is interesting but also surprising, given that the pairwise ranking methods have been shown very effective in practice. In this paper, we argue that the aforementioned result might not be conclusive, depending on what kind of assumptions are used. We give a new assumption that the labels of objects to rank lie in a rank-differentiable probability space (RDPS), and prove that the pairwise ranking methods become consistent with WPDL under this assumption. What is especially inspiring is that RDPS is actually not stronger than but similar to the low-noise setting. Our studies provide theoretical justiﬁcations of some empirical ﬁndings on pairwise ranking methods that are unexplained before, which bridge the gap between theory and applications.</p><p>5 0.56593841 <a title="22-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Tensor_Decomposition_for_Fast_Parsing_with_Latent-Variable_PCFGs.html">334 nips-2012-Tensor Decomposition for Fast Parsing with Latent-Variable PCFGs</a></p>

<p>Author: Rishabh Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of discrete divergences on sets (equivalently binary vectors) that we call the submodular-Bregman divergences. We consider two kinds, deﬁned either from tight modular upper or tight modular lower bounds of a submodular function. We show that the properties of these divergences are analogous to the (standard continuous) Bregman divergence. We demonstrate how they generalize many useful divergences, including the weighted Hamming distance, squared weighted Hamming, weighted precision, recall, conditional mutual information, and a generalized KL-divergence on sets. We also show that the generalized Bregman divergence on the Lov´ sz extension of a submodular function, which we a call the Lov´ sz-Bregman divergence, is a continuous extension of a submodular a Bregman divergence. We point out a number of applications, and in particular show that a proximal algorithm deﬁned through the submodular Bregman divergence provides a framework for many mirror-descent style algorithms related to submodular function optimization. We also show that a generalization of the k-means algorithm using the Lov´ sz Bregman divergence is natural in clustering scenarios where a ordering is important. A unique property of this algorithm is that computing the mean ordering is extremely efﬁcient unlike other order based distance measures. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72049904 <a title="22-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-A_latent_factor_model_for_highly_multi-relational_data.html">22 nips-2012-A latent factor model for highly multi-relational data</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Cobi Cario</p><p>Abstract: The empirical success of the belief propagation approximate inference algorithm has inspired numerous theoretical and algorithmic advances. Yet, for continuous non-Gaussian domains performing belief propagation remains a challenging task: recent innovations such as nonparametric or kernel belief propagation, while useful, come with a substantial computational cost and offer little theoretical guarantees, even for tree structured models. In this work we present Nonparanormal BP for performing efﬁcient inference on distributions parameterized by a Gaussian copulas network and any univariate marginals. For tree structured networks, our approach is guaranteed to be exact for this powerful class of non-Gaussian models. Importantly, the method is as efﬁcient as standard Gaussian BP, and its convergence properties do not depend on the complexity of the univariate marginals, even when a nonparametric representation is used. 1</p><p>4 0.70235592 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Scaled_Gradients_on_Grassmann_Manifolds_for_Matrix_Completion.html">301 nips-2012-Scaled Gradients on Grassmann Manifolds for Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Thanh Ngo, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes gradient methods based on a scaled metric on the Grassmann manifold for low-rank matrix completion. The proposed methods signiﬁcantly improve canonical gradient methods, especially on ill-conditioned matrices, while maintaining established global convegence and exact recovery guarantees. A connection between a form of subspace iteration for matrix completion and the scaled gradient descent procedure is also established. The proposed conjugate gradient method based on the scaled gradient outperforms several existing algorithms for matrix completion and is competitive with recently proposed methods. 1</p><p>5 0.68070471 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Communication-Efficient_Algorithms_for_Statistical_Optimization.html">76 nips-2012-Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Statistical Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, Martin J. Wainwright, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: We study two communication-efﬁcient algorithms for distributed statistical optimization on large-scale data. The ﬁrst algorithm is an averaging method that distributes the N data samples evenly to m machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error that decays as √ O(N −1 + (N/m)−2 ). Whenever m ≤ N , this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of the bootstrap. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as O(N −1 + (N/m)−3 ), and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on largescale problems from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods efﬁciently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which consists of N ≈ 2.4 × 108 samples and d ≥ 700, 000 dimensions. 1</p><p>6 0.64380801 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Classification_Calibration_Dimension_for_General_Multiclass_Losses.html">67 nips-2012-Classification Calibration Dimension for General Multiclass Losses</a></p>

<p>Author: Rishabh Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of discrete divergences on sets (equivalently binary vectors) that we call the submodular-Bregman divergences. We consider two kinds, deﬁned either from tight modular upper or tight modular lower bounds of a submodular function. We show that the properties of these divergences are analogous to the (standard continuous) Bregman divergence. We demonstrate how they generalize many useful divergences, including the weighted Hamming distance, squared weighted Hamming, weighted precision, recall, conditional mutual information, and a generalized KL-divergence on sets. We also show that the generalized Bregman divergence on the Lov´ sz extension of a submodular function, which we a call the Lov´ sz-Bregman divergence, is a continuous extension of a submodular a Bregman divergence. We point out a number of applications, and in particular show that a proximal algorithm deﬁned through the submodular Bregman divergence provides a framework for many mirror-descent style algorithms related to submodular function optimization. We also show that a generalization of the k-means algorithm using the Lov´ sz Bregman divergence is natural in clustering scenarios where a ordering is important. A unique property of this algorithm is that computing the mean ordering is extremely efﬁcient unlike other order based distance measures. 1</p><p>3 0.28679115 <a title="6-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Selecting_Diverse_Features_via_Spectral_Regularization.html">304 nips-2012-Selecting Diverse Features via Spectral Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhimanyu Das, Anirban Dasgupta, Ravi Kumar</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of diverse feature selection in linear regression: selecting a small subset of diverse features that can predict a given objective. Diversity is useful for several reasons such as interpretability, robustness to noise, etc. We propose several spectral regularizers that capture a notion of diversity of features and show that these are all submodular set functions. These regularizers, when added to the objective function for linear regression, result in approximately submodular functions, which can then be maximized by efﬁcient greedy and local search algorithms, with provable guarantees. We compare our algorithms to traditional greedy and 1 -regularization schemes and show that we obtain a more diverse set of features that result in the regression problem being stable under perturbations. 1</p><p>4 0.24406688 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Proximal_Newton-type_methods_for_convex_optimization.html">282 nips-2012-Proximal Newton-type methods for convex optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Michael Saunders</p><p>Abstract: We seek to solve convex optimization problems in composite form: minimize f (x) := g(x) + h(x), n x∈R where g is convex and continuously differentiable and h : Rn → R is a convex but not necessarily differentiable function whose proximal mapping can be evaluated efﬁciently. We derive a generalization of Newton-type methods to handle such convex but nonsmooth objective functions. We prove such methods are globally convergent and achieve superlinear rates of convergence in the vicinity of an optimal solution. We also demonstrate the performance of these methods using problems of relevance in machine learning and statistics. 1</p><p>5 0.2282715 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Near-Optimal_MAP_Inference_for_Determinantal_Point_Processes.html">236 nips-2012-Near-Optimal MAP Inference for Determinantal Point Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater, Alex Kulesza, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have recently been proposed as computationally efﬁcient probabilistic models of diverse sets for a variety of applications, including document summarization, image search, and pose estimation. Many DPP inference operations, including normalization and sampling, are tractable; however, ﬁnding the most likely conﬁguration (MAP), which is often required in practice for decoding, is NP-hard, so we must resort to approximate inference. This optimization problem, which also arises in experimental design and sensor placement, involves ﬁnding the largest principal minor of a positive semideﬁnite matrix. Because the objective is log-submodular, greedy algorithms have been used in the past with some empirical success; however, these methods only give approximation guarantees in the special case of monotone objectives, which correspond to a restricted class of DPPs. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for approximating the MAP problem based on continuous techniques for submodular function maximization. Our method involves a novel continuous relaxation of the log-probability function, which, in contrast to the multilinear extension used for general submodular functions, can be evaluated and differentiated exactly and efﬁciently. We obtain a practical algorithm with a 1/4-approximation guarantee for a more general class of non-monotone DPPs; our algorithm also extends to MAP inference under complex polytope constraints, making it possible to combine DPPs with Markov random ﬁelds, weighted matchings, and other models. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard and recent methods on both synthetic and real-world data. 1</p><p>6 0.21017902 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation.html">164 nips-2012-Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Delong, Olga Veksler, Anton Osokin, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Inference in high-order graphical models has become important in recent years. Several approaches are based, for example, on generalized message-passing, or on transformation to a pairwise model with extra ‘auxiliary’ variables. We focus on a special case where a much more efﬁcient transformation is possible. Instead of adding variables, we transform the original problem into a comparatively small instance of submodular vertex-cover. These vertex-cover instances can then be attacked by existing algorithms (e.g. belief propagation, QPBO), where they often run 4–15 times faster and ﬁnd better solutions than when applied to the original problem. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data, then we show applications within a fast hierarchical clustering and model-ﬁtting framework. 1</p><p>6 0.55812061 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Structured_Learning_of_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">327 nips-2012-Structured Learning of Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>2 0.90089172 <a title="6-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning.html">51 nips-2012-Bayesian Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually speciﬁed, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.89881593 <a title="6-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Convex_Formulation_for_Learning_Scale-Free_Networks_via_Submodular_Relaxation.html">6 nips-2012-A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Defazio, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data. We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lov´ sz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes a such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset.</p><p>4 0.89728993 <a title="6-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Trajectory-Based_Short-Sighted_Probabilistic_Planning.html">350 nips-2012-Trajectory-Based Short-Sighted Probabilistic Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Felipe Trevizan, Manuela Veloso</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic planning captures the uncertainty of plan execution by probabilistically modeling the effects of actions in the environment, and therefore the probability of reaching different states from a given state and action. In order to compute a solution for a probabilistic planning problem, planners need to manage the uncertainty associated with the different paths from the initial state to a goal state. Several approaches to manage uncertainty were proposed, e.g., consider all paths at once, perform determinization of actions, and sampling. In this paper, we introduce trajectory-based short-sighted Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs), a novel approach to manage uncertainty for probabilistic planning problems in which states reachable with low probability are substituted by artiﬁcial goals that heuristically estimate their cost to reach a goal state. We also extend the theoretical results of Short-Sighted Probabilistic Planner (SSiPP) [1] by proving that SSiPP always ﬁnishes and is asymptotically optimal under sufﬁcient conditions on the structure of short-sighted SSPs. We empirically compare SSiPP using trajectorybased short-sighted SSPs with the winners of the previous probabilistic planning competitions and other state-of-the-art planners in the triangle tireworld problems. Trajectory-based SSiPP outperforms all the competitors and is the only planner able to scale up to problem number 60, a problem in which the optimal solution contains approximately 1070 states. 1</p><p>5 0.8893984 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Low-Rank_Subspace_Clustering.html">277 nips-2012-Probabilistic Low-Rank Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: S. D. Babacan, Shinichi Nakajima, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering data points into lowdimensional subspaces in the presence of outliers. We pose the problem using a density estimation formulation with an associated generative model. Based on this probability model, we ﬁrst develop an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and then derive its global solution. In addition, we develop two Bayesian methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) approximation, which are capable of automatic dimensionality selection. While the ﬁrst method is based on an alternating optimization scheme for all unknowns, the second method makes use of recent results in VB matrix factorization leading to fast and effective estimation. Both methods are extended to handle sparse outliers for robustness and can handle missing values. Experimental results suggest that proposed methods are very effective in subspace clustering and identifying outliers. 1</p><p>6 0.86990488 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>

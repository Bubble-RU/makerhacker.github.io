<p>Author: Jayadev Acharya, Hirakendu Das, Alon Orlitsky</p><p>Abstract: The minimax KL-divergence of any distribution from all distributions in a collection P has several practical implications. In compression, it is called redundancy and represents the least additional number of bits over the entropy needed to encode the output of any distribution in P. In online estimation and learning, it is the lowest expected log-loss regret when guessing a sequence of random values generated by a distribution in P. In hypothesis testing, it upper bounds the largest number of distinguishable distributions in P. Motivated by problems ranging from population estimation to text classiﬁcation and speech recognition, several machine-learning and information-theory researchers have recently considered label-invariant observations and properties induced by i.i.d. distributions. A sufﬁcient statistic for all these properties is the data’s proﬁle, the multiset of the number of times each data element appears. Improving on a sequence of previous works, we show that the redundancy of the collection of distributions induced over proﬁles by length-n i.i.d. sequences is between 0.3 · n1/3 and n1/3 log2 n, in particular, establishing its exact growth power. 1</p><p>3 0.10281956 <a title="194-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_Inference_of_Overlapping_Communities.html">298 nips-2012-Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities</a></p>

Our algorithm is based on stochastic variational inference in the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). It naturally interleaves subsampling the network with estimating its community structure. We apply our algorithm on ten large, real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes. It converges several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for MMSB, ﬁnds hundreds of communities in large real-world networks, and detects the true communities in 280 benchmark networks with equal or better accuracy compared to other scalable algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.087438755 <a title="194-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Networks_of_Heterogeneous_Influence.html">182 nips-2012-Learning Networks of Heterogeneous Influence</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Ming Yuan, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Information, disease, and inﬂuence diffuse over networks of entities in both natural systems and human society. Analyzing these transmission networks plays an important role in understanding the diffusion processes and predicting future events. However, the underlying transmission networks are often hidden and incomplete, and we observe only the time stamps when cascades of events happen. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of uncovering the hidden network only from the cascades. The structure discovery problem is complicated by the fact that the inﬂuence between networked entities is heterogeneous, which can not be described by a simple parametric model. Therefore, we propose a kernelbased method which can capture a diverse range of different types of inﬂuence without any prior assumption. In both synthetic and real cascade data, we show that our model can better recover the underlying diffusion network and drastically improve the estimation of the transmission functions among networked entities. 1</p><p>5 0.082103737 <a title="194-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Partially_Observable_Models_Using_Temporally_Abstract_Decision_Trees.html">183 nips-2012-Learning Partially Observable Models Using Temporally Abstract Decision Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik Talvitie</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces timeline trees, which are partial models of partially observable environments. Timeline trees are given some speciﬁc predictions to make and learn a decision tree over history. The main idea of timeline trees is to use temporally abstract features to identify and split on features of key events, spread arbitrarily far apart in the past (whereas previous decision-tree-based methods have been limited to a ﬁnite sufﬁx of history). Experiments demonstrate that timeline trees can learn to make high quality predictions in complex, partially observable environments with high-dimensional observations (e.g. an arcade game). 1</p><p>6 0.076818444 <a title="194-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Sparse_Graphs.html">69 nips-2012-Clustering Sparse Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, Junming Yin, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue for representing networks as a bag of triangular motifs, particularly for important network problems that current model-based approaches handle poorly due to computational bottlenecks incurred by using edge representations. Such approaches require both 1-edges and 0-edges (missing edges) to be provided as input, and as a consequence, approximate inference algorithms for these models usually require Ω(N 2 ) time per iteration, precluding their application to larger real-world networks. In contrast, triangular modeling requires less computation, while providing equivalent or better inference quality. A triangular motif is a vertex triple containing 2 or 3 edges, and the number of such motifs is 2 Θ( i Di ) (where Di is the degree of vertex i), which is much smaller than N 2 for low-maximum-degree networks. Using this representation, we develop a novel mixed-membership network model and approximate inference algorithm suitable for large networks with low max-degree. For networks with high maximum degree, the triangular motifs can be naturally subsampled in a node-centric fashion, allowing for much faster inference at a small cost in accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach, when compared to that of an edge-based model, has faster runtime and improved accuracy for mixed-membership community detection. We conclude with a large-scale demonstration on an N ≈ 280, 000-node network, which is infeasible for network models with Ω(N 2 ) inference cost. 1</p><p>5 0.55270982 <a title="194-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Linear_Time_Active_Learning_Algorithm_for_Link_Classification.html">10 nips-2012-A Linear Time Active Learning Algorithm for Link Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We present very eﬃcient active learning algorithms for link classiﬁcation in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph G = (V, E) such that |E| = Ω(|V |3/2 ) by querying O(|V |3/2 ) edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of O(k) by querying at most order of |V | + (|V |/k)3/2 edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order |E| + |V | log |V |. 1</p><p>6 0.54440272 <a title="194-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Partially_Observable_Models_Using_Temporally_Abstract_Decision_Trees.html">183 nips-2012-Learning Partially Observable Models Using Temporally Abstract Decision Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Daniel Alexander</p><p>Abstract: Accurate and detailed models of neurodegenerative disease progression are crucially important for reliable early diagnosis and the determination of effective treatments. We introduce the ALPACA (Alzheimer’s disease Probabilistic Cascades) model, a generative model linking latent Alzheimer’s progression dynamics to observable biomarker data. In contrast with previous works which model disease progression as a ﬁxed event ordering, we explicitly model the variability over such orderings among patients which is more realistic, particularly for highly detailed progression models. We describe efﬁcient learning algorithms for ALPACA and discuss promising experimental results on a real cohort of Alzheimer’s patients from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77975237 <a title="194-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Learning_to_Discover_Social_Circles_in_Ego_Networks.html">194 nips-2012-Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: James Lloyd, Peter Orbanz, Zoubin Ghahramani, Daniel M. Roy</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in the analysis of structured relational data like graphs, networks, databases, and matrices is to extract a summary of the common structure underlying relations between individual entities. Relational data are typically encoded in the form of arrays; invariance to the ordering of rows and columns corresponds to exchangeable arrays. Results in probability theory due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg show that exchangeable arrays can be represented in terms of a random measurable function which constitutes the natural model parameter in a Bayesian model. We obtain a ﬂexible yet simple Bayesian nonparametric model by placing a Gaussian process prior on the parameter function. Efﬁcient inference utilises elliptical slice sampling combined with a random sparse approximation to the Gaussian process. We demonstrate applications of the model to network data and clarify its relation to models in the literature, several of which emerge as special cases. 1</p><p>4 0.75782537 <a title="194-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Minimizing_Sparse_High-Order_Energies_by_Submodular_Vertex-Cover.html">214 nips-2012-Minimizing Sparse High-Order Energies by Submodular Vertex-Cover</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Delong, Olga Veksler, Anton Osokin, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Inference in high-order graphical models has become important in recent years. Several approaches are based, for example, on generalized message-passing, or on transformation to a pairwise model with extra ‘auxiliary’ variables. We focus on a special case where a much more efﬁcient transformation is possible. Instead of adding variables, we transform the original problem into a comparatively small instance of submodular vertex-cover. These vertex-cover instances can then be attacked by existing algorithms (e.g. belief propagation, QPBO), where they often run 4–15 times faster and ﬁnd better solutions than when applied to the original problem. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data, then we show applications within a fast hierarchical clustering and model-ﬁtting framework. 1</p><p>5 0.72717762 <a title="194-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Non-parametric_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_via_the_Kernel_Method.html">243 nips-2012-Non-parametric Approximate Dynamic Programming via the Kernel Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikhil Bhat, Vivek Farias, Ciamac C. Moallemi</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel non-parametric approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that enjoys graceful approximation and sample complexity guarantees. In particular, we establish both theoretically and computationally that our proposal can serve as a viable alternative to state-of-the-art parametric ADP algorithms, freeing the designer from carefully specifying an approximation architecture. We accomplish this by developing a kernel-based mathematical program for ADP. Via a computational study on a controlled queueing network, we show that our procedure is competitive with parametric ADP approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.65845972 <a title="194-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Diffusion_Decision_Making_for_Adaptive_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">97 nips-2012-Diffusion Decision Making for Adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

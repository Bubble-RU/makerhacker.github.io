<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>4 0.1776074 <a title="241-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_with_Only_One_Projection.html">324 nips-2012-Stochastic Gradient Descent with Only One Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin, Shenghuo Zhu, Jinfeng Yi</p><p>Abstract: Although many variants of stochastic gradient descent have been proposed for large-scale convex optimization, most of them require projecting the solution at each iteration to ensure that the obtained solution stays within the feasible domain. For complex domains (e.g., positive semideﬁnite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing novel stochastic optimization algorithms that do not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, √ the proposed algorithms achieve an O(1/ T ) convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an O(ln T /T ) rate for strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function. 1</p><p>5 0.16710676 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Multiple_Reward_Functions.html">245 nips-2012-Nonparametric Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Reward Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for multiple reward functions. Most previous IRL algorithms assume that the behaviour data is obtained from an agent who is optimizing a single reward function, but this assumption is hard to guarantee in practice. Our approach is based on integrating the Dirichlet process mixture model into Bayesian IRL. We provide an efﬁcient Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm utilizing the gradient of the posterior to estimate the underlying reward functions, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous ones via experiments on a number of problem domains. 1</p><p>6 0.16058286 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Mirror_Descent_Meets_Fixed_Share_%28and_feels_no_regret%29.html">216 nips-2012-Mirror Descent Meets Fixed Share (and feels no regret)</a></p>

<p>Author: Varun Kanade, Zhenming Liu, Bozidar Radunovic</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to k sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator. At each time-step t, one of the k site nodes has to pick an expert from the set {1, . . . , n}, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon T , while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum. The two extreme solutions to this problem are: (i) Full communication: This essentially simulates the nondistributed setting to obtain the optimal O( log(n)T ) regret bound at the cost of T communication. (ii) No communication: Each site runs an independent copy – the regret is O( log(n)kT ) and the communication is 0. This paper shows the √ difﬁculty of simultaneously achieving regret asymptotically better than kT and communication better than T . We give a novel algorithm that for an oblivious √ adversary achieves a non-trivial trade-off: regret O( k 5(1+ )/6 T ) and communication O(T /k ), for any value of ∈ (0, 1/5). We also consider a variant of the model, where the coordinator picks the expert. In this model, we show that the label-efﬁcient forecaster of Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2005) already gives us strategy that is near optimal in regret vs communication trade-off. 1</p><p>4 0.61041874 <a title="241-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Pierre Gaillard, Gabor Lugosi, Gilles Stoltz</p><p>Abstract: Mirror descent with an entropic regularizer is known to achieve shifting regret bounds that are logarithmic in the dimension. This is done using either a carefully designed projection or by a weight sharing technique. Via a novel uniﬁed analysis, we show that these two approaches deliver essentially equivalent bounds on a notion of regret generalizing shifting, adaptive, discounted, and other related regrets. Our analysis also captures and extends the generalized weight sharing technique of Bousquet and Warmuth, and can be reﬁned in several ways, including improvements for small losses and adaptive tuning of parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.53183132 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Best_Arm_Identification%3A_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence.html">61 nips-2012-Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence</a></p>

Previous results on mutual information estimation only bounded expected error. The advantage of having the exponential inequality is that, combined with the union bound, we can guarantee accurate estimators of the mutual information for many pairs of random variables simultaneously. As an application, we show how to use such a result to optimally estimate the density function and graph of a distribution which is Markov to a forest graph. 1</p><p>2 0.86744702 <a title="241-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_imputation_of_genetic_data_with_a_discrete_fragmentation-coagulation_process.html">299 nips-2012-Scalable imputation of genetic data with a discrete fragmentation-coagulation process</a></p>

Teh</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for genetic sequence data in which a set of genetic sequences is modelled using a Markov model of partitions. The partitions at consecutive locations in the genome are related by the splitting and merging of their clusters. Our model can be thought of as a discrete analogue of the continuous fragmentation-coagulation process [Teh et al 2011], preserving the important properties of projectivity, exchangeability and reversibility, while being more scalable. We apply this model to the problem of genotype imputation, showing improved computational efﬁciency while maintaining accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art genotype imputation methods. 1</p><p>3 0.84882164 <a title="241-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Persistent_Homology_for_Learning_Densities_with_Bounded_Support.html">269 nips-2012-Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian T. Pokorny, Hedvig Kjellström, Danica Kragic, Carl Ek</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate ‘hard’ topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of persistent homology can be combined with kernel-based methods from machine learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and – by incorporating persistent homology techniques in our approach – we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset by learning a motion model for a race car. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.84284383 <a title="241-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-No-Regret_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Online_Convex_Optimization.html">241 nips-2012-No-Regret Algorithms for Unconstrained Online Convex Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongho Kim, Kee-eung Kim, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected longterm total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems. 1</p><p>6 0.83988023 <a title="241-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Best_Arm_Identification%3A_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence.html">61 nips-2012-Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence</a></p>

<p>Author: Abdeslam Boularias, Jan R. Peters, Oliver B. Kroemer</p><p>Abstract: We use a graphical model for representing policies in Markov Decision Processes. This new representation can easily incorporate domain knowledge in the form of a state similarity graph that loosely indicates which states are supposed to have similar optimal actions. A bias is then introduced into the policy search process by sampling policies from a distribution that assigns high probabilities to policies that agree with the provided state similarity graph, i.e. smoother policies. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We also present forward and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms for learning such policy distributions. We illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach on two problems: cart-balancing with swing-up, and teaching a robot to grasp unknown objects. 1</p><p>3 0.17387335 <a title="88-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Bayes-Adaptive_Reinforcement_Learning_using_Sample-Based_Search.html">108 nips-2012-Efficient Bayes-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning using Sample-Based Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Guez, David Silver, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayesoptimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a signiﬁcant margin on several well-known benchmark problems – because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an inﬁnite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration. 1</p><p>4 0.16910668 <a title="88-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Use_of_Non-Stationary_Policies_for_Stationary_Infinite-Horizon_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">255 nips-2012-On the Use of Non-Stationary Policies for Stationary Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Bruno Scherrer, Boris Lesner</p><p>Abstract: We consider inﬁnite-horizon stationary γ-discounted Markov Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. Using Value and Policy Iteration with some error at each iteration, it is well-known that one 2γ can compute stationary policies that are (1−γ)2 -optimal. After arguing that this guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy Iteration for com2γ puting non-stationary policies that can be up to 1−γ -optimal, which constitutes a signiﬁcant improvement in the usual situation when γ is close to 1. Surprisingly, this shows that the problem of “computing near-optimal non-stationary policies” is much simpler than that of “computing near-optimal stationary policies”. 1</p><p>5 0.16493326 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Exploration_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Empirically_Estimating_Learning_Progress.html">122 nips-2012-Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress</a></p>
<p>Author: Manuel Lopes, Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Pierre-yves Oudeyer</p><p>Abstract: Formal exploration approaches in model-based reinforcement learning estimate the accuracy of the currently learned model without consideration of the empirical prediction error. For example, PAC-MDP approaches such as R- MAX base their model certainty on the amount of collected data, while Bayesian approaches assume a prior over the transition dynamics. We propose extensions to such approaches which drive exploration solely based on empirical estimates of the learner’s accuracy and learning progress. We provide a “sanity check” theoretical analysis, discussing the behavior of our extensions in the standard stationary ﬁnite state-action case. We then provide experimental studies demonstrating the robustness of these exploration measures in cases of non-stationary environments or where original approaches are misled by wrong domain assumptions. 1</p><p>6 0.16330084 <a title="88-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Tractable_Objectives_for_Robust_Policy_Optimization.html">348 nips-2012-Tractable Objectives for Robust Policy Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Edouard Klein, Matthieu Geist, Bilal Piot, Olivier Pietquin</p><p>Abstract: This paper adresses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward for which a demonstrated expert behavior is optimal. We introduce a new algorithm, SCIRL, whose principle is to use the so-called feature expectation of the expert as the parameterization of the score function of a multiclass classiﬁer. This approach produces a reward function for which the expert policy is provably near-optimal. Contrary to most of existing IRL algorithms, SCIRL does not require solving the direct RL problem. Moreover, with an appropriate heuristic, it can succeed with only trajectories sampled according to the expert behavior. This is illustrated on a car driving simulator. 1</p><p>5 0.76469529 <a title="88-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Transferring_Expectations_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">353 nips-2012-Transferring Expectations in Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Trung Nguyen, Tomi Silander, Tze Y. Leong</p><p>Abstract: We study how to automatically select and adapt multiple abstractions or representations of the world to support model-based reinforcement learning. We address the challenges of transfer learning in heterogeneous environments with varying tasks. We present an efﬁcient, online framework that, through a sequence of tasks, learns a set of relevant representations to be used in future tasks. Without predeﬁned mapping strategies, we introduce a general approach to support transfer learning across different state spaces. We demonstrate the potential impact of our system through improved jumpstart and faster convergence to near optimum policy in two benchmark domains. 1</p><p>6 0.73126507 <a title="88-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Multiple_Reward_Functions.html">245 nips-2012-Nonparametric Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Reward Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm(s) in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting. This problem has been studied in the literature from two different perspectives: ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence. We propose a unifying approach that leads to a meta-algorithm called uniﬁed gap-based exploration (UGapE), with a common structure and similar theoretical analysis for these two settings. We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.90681732 <a title="88-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Mixability_in_Statistical_Learning.html">217 nips-2012-Mixability in Statistical Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Peter Grünwald, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and sequential prediction are two different but related formalisms to study the quality of predictions. Mapping out their relations and transferring ideas is an active area of investigation. We provide another piece of the puzzle by showing that an important concept in sequential prediction, the mixability of a loss, has a natural counterpart in the statistical setting, which we call stochastic mixability. Just as ordinary mixability characterizes fast rates for the worst-case regret in sequential prediction, stochastic mixability characterizes fast rates in statistical learning. We show that, in the special case of log-loss, stochastic mixability reduces to a well-known (but usually unnamed) martingale condition, which is used in existing convergence theorems for minimum description length and Bayesian inference. In the case of 0/1-loss, it reduces to the margin condition of Mammen and Tsybakov, and in the case that the model under consideration contains all possible predictors, it is equivalent to ordinary mixability. 1</p><p>3 0.90491408 <a title="88-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-GenDeR%3A_A_Generic_Diversified_Ranking_Algorithm.html">141 nips-2012-GenDeR: A Generic Diversified Ranking Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8890925 <a title="88-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive_Exploration_in_Bayesian_Reinforcement_Learning.html">88 nips-2012-Cost-Sensitive Exploration in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and – by incorporating persistent homology techniques in our approach – we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset by learning a motion model for a race car. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car. 1</p><p>6 0.86156267 <a title="88-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Halfspaces_with_the_Zero-One_Loss%3A_Time-Accuracy_Tradeoffs.html">174 nips-2012-Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs</a></p>

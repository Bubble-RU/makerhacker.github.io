<p>Author: Fang Han, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose two new principal component analysis methods in this paper utilizing a semiparametric model. The according methods are named Copula Component Analysis (COCA) and Copula PCA. The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspeciﬁed marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. The COCA and Copula PCA accordingly estimate the leading eigenvectors of the correlation and covariance matrices of the latent Gaussian distribution. The robust nonparametric rank-based correlation coefﬁcient estimator, Spearman’s rho, is exploited in estimation. We prove that, under suitable conditions, although the marginal distributions can be arbitrarily continuous, the COCA and Copula PCA estimators obtain fast estimation rates and are feature selection consistent in the setting where the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. Careful numerical experiments on the synthetic and real data are conducted to back up the theoretical results. We also discuss the relationship with the transelliptical component analysis proposed by Han and Liu (2012). 1</p><p>3 0.56687433 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Non-Parametric_Copulas.html">308 nips-2012-Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Non-Parametric Copulas</a></p>
<p>Author: David Lopez-paz, Jose M. Hernández-lobato, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: A new framework based on the theory of copulas is proposed to address semisupervised domain adaptation problems. The presented method factorizes any multivariate density into a product of marginal distributions and bivariate copula functions. Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected and corrected to adapt a density model accross different learning domains. Importantly, we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this factorization in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression problems with real-world data illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.31553093 <a title="5-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Adaptive_Learning_of_Smoothing_Functions%3A_Application_to_Electricity_Load_Forecasting.html">35 nips-2012-Adaptive Learning of Smoothing Functions: Application to Electricity Load Forecasting</a></p>
<p>Author: Amadou Ba, Mathieu Sinn, Yannig Goude, Pascal Pompey</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an efﬁcient online learning algorithm to track the smoothing functions of Additive Models. The key idea is to combine the linear representation of Additive Models with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlter. In order to quickly track changes in the model and put more weight on recent data, the RLS ﬁlter uses a forgetting factor which exponentially weights down observations by the order of their arrival. The tracking behaviour is further enhanced by using an adaptive forgetting factor which is updated based on the gradient of the a priori errors. Using results from Lyapunov stability theory, upper bounds for the learning rate are analyzed. The proposed algorithm is applied to 5 years of electricity load data provided by the French utility company Electricit´ de France (EDF). e Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it achieves a superior performance in terms of model tracking and prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.13024776 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Generalization_Bounds_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">142 nips-2012-Generalization Bounds for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Zhang, Lei Zhang, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new framework to study the generalization bound of the learning process for domain adaptation. We consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation settings: one is domain adaptation with multiple sources and the other is domain adaptation combining source and target data. In particular, we use the integral probability metric to measure the difference between two domains. Then, we develop the speciﬁc Hoeffding-type deviation inequality and symmetrization inequality for either kind of domain adaptation to achieve the corresponding generalization bound based on the uniform entropy number. By using the resultant generalization bound, we analyze the asymptotic convergence and the rate of convergence of the learning process for domain adaptation. Meanwhile, we discuss the factors that affect the asymptotic behavior of the learning process. The numerical experiments support our results. 1</p><p>6 0.11751391 <a title="5-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-On_the_connections_between_saliency_and_tracking.html">256 nips-2012-On the connections between saliency and tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Miguel Lázaro-gredilla</p><p>Abstract: Warped Gaussian processes (WGP) [1] model output observations in regression tasks as a parametric nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian process (GP). The use of this nonlinear transformation, which is included as part of the probabilistic model, was shown to enhance performance by providing a better prior model on several data sets. In order to learn its parameters, maximum likelihood was used. In this work we show that it is possible to use a non-parametric nonlinear transformation in WGP and variationally integrate it out. The resulting Bayesian WGP is then able to work in scenarios in which the maximum likelihood WGP failed: Low data regime, data with censored values, classiﬁcation, etc. We demonstrate the superior performance of Bayesian warped GPs on several real data sets.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71665484 <a title="5-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-A_Conditional_Multinomial_Mixture_Model_for_Superset_Label_Learning.html">5 nips-2012-A Conditional Multinomial Mixture Model for Superset Label Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Stephen Pasteris, Fabio Vitale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of performing efﬁcient sum-product computations in an online setting over a tree. A natural application of our methods is to compute the marginal distribution at a vertex in a tree-structured Markov random ﬁeld. Belief propagation can be used to solve this problem, but requires time linear in the size of the tree, and is therefore too slow in an online setting where we are continuously receiving new data and computing individual marginals. With our method we aim to update the data and compute marginals in time that is no more than logarithmic in the size of the tree, and is often signiﬁcantly less. We accomplish this via a hierarchical covering structure that caches previous local sum-product computations. Our contribution is three-fold: we i) give a linear time algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal hierarchical cover of a tree; ii) give a sum-productlike algorithm to efﬁciently compute marginals with respect to this cover; and iii) apply “i” and “ii” to ﬁnd an efﬁcient algorithm with a regret bound for the online allocation problem in a multi-task setting. 1</p><p>4 0.62908602 <a title="5-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>5 0.62623739 <a title="5-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Phoneme_Classification_using_Constrained_Variational_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_System.html">270 nips-2012-Phoneme Classification using Constrained Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical System</a></p>
<p>Author: Hyunsin Park, Sungrack Yun, Sanghyuk Park, Jongmin Kim, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For phoneme classiﬁcation, this paper describes an acoustic model based on the variational Gaussian process dynamical system (VGPDS). The nonlinear and nonparametric acoustic model is adopted to overcome the limitations of classical hidden Markov models (HMMs) in modeling speech. The Gaussian process prior on the dynamics and emission functions respectively enable the complex dynamic structure and long-range dependency of speech to be better represented than that by an HMM. In addition, a variance constraint in the VGPDS is introduced to eliminate the sparse approximation error in the kernel matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with three experimental results, including parameter estimation and classiﬁcation performance, on the synthetic and benchmark datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.62538308 <a title="5-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Dual-Space_Analysis_of_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">104 nips-2012-Dual-Space Analysis of the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanjeev Arora, Rong Ge, Ankur Moitra, Sushant Sachdeva</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has provable performance guarantees. In particular, suppose we are given samples of the form y = Ax + η where A is an unknown n × n matrix and x is a random variable whose components are independent and have a fourth moment strictly less than that of a standard Gaussian random variable and η is an n-dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance Σ: We give an algorithm that provable recovers A and Σ up to an additive and whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in n and 1/ . To accomplish this, we introduce a novel “quasi-whitening” step that may be useful in other contexts in which the covariance of Gaussian noise is not known in advance. We also give a general framework for ﬁnding all local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately ﬁnding just one) and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we ﬁnd the columns of A one by one via local search. 1</p><p>3 0.16938047 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Hierarchical_spike_coding_of_sound.html">150 nips-2012-Hierarchical spike coding of sound</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Chaitanya Ekanadham, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Natural sounds exhibit complex statistical regularities at multiple scales. Acoustic events underlying speech, for example, are characterized by precise temporal and frequency relationships, but they can also vary substantially according to the pitch, duration, and other high-level properties of speech production. Learning this structure from data while capturing the inherent variability is an important ﬁrst step in building auditory processing systems, as well as understanding the mechanisms of auditory perception. Here we develop Hierarchical Spike Coding, a two-layer probabilistic generative model for complex acoustic structure. The ﬁrst layer consists of a sparse spiking representation that encodes the sound using kernels positioned precisely in time and frequency. Patterns in the positions of ﬁrst layer spikes are learned from the data: on a coarse scale, statistical regularities are encoded by a second-layer spiking representation, while ﬁne-scale structure is captured by recurrent interactions within the ﬁrst layer. When ﬁt to speech data, the second layer acoustic features include harmonic stacks, sweeps, frequency modulations, and precise temporal onsets, which can be composed to represent complex acoustic events. Unlike spectrogram-based methods, the model gives a probability distribution over sound pressure waveforms. This allows us to use the second-layer representation to synthesize sounds directly, and to perform model-based denoising, on which we demonstrate a signiﬁcant improvement over standard methods. 1</p><p>4 0.16015773 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Natural_Images%2C_Gaussian_Mixtures_and_Dead_Leaves.html">235 nips-2012-Natural Images, Gaussian Mixtures and Dead Leaves</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Simple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) learned from pixels of natural image patches have been recently shown to be surprisingly strong performers in modeling the statistics of natural images. Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models. 1 GMMs and natural image statistics models Many models for the statistics of natural image patches have been suggested in recent years. Finding good models for natural images is important to many different research areas - computer vision, biological vision and neuroscience among others. Recently, there has been a growing interest in comparing different aspects of models for natural images such as log-likelihood and multi-information reduction performance, and much progress has been achieved [1,2, 3,4,5, 6]. Out of these results there is one which is particularly interesting: simple, unconstrained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with a relatively small number of mixture components learned from image patches are extraordinarily good in modeling image statistics [6, 4]. This is a surprising result due to the simplicity of GMMs and their ubiquity. Another surprising aspect of this result is that many of the current models may be thought of as GMMs with an exponential or infinite number of components, having different constraints on the covariance structure of the mixture components. In this work we study the nature of GMMs learned from natural image patches. We start with a thorough comparison to some popular and cutting edge image models. We show that indeed, GMMs are excellent performers in modeling natural image patches. We then analyze what properties of natural images these GMMs capture, their dependence on the number of components in the mixture and their relation to the structure of the world around us. Finally, we show that the learned GMM suggests a strong connection between natural image statistics and a simple variant of the dead leaves model [7, 8] , explicitly modeling occlusions and explaining some of the success of GMMs in modeling natural images. 1 3.5 .,...- ••.......-.-.. -..---'-. 1 ~~6\8161·· -.. .-.. --...--.-- ---..-.- -. --------------MII+··+ilIl ..... .. . . ~ '[25 . . . ---- ] B'II 1_ -- ~2 ;t:: fI 1 - --- ,---- ._.. : 61.5 .....

<p>Author: Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of maximum marginal prediction (MMP) in probabilistic graphical models, a task that occurs, for example, as the Bayes optimal decision rule under a Hamming loss. MMP is typically performed as a two-stage procedure: one estimates each variable’s marginal probability and then forms a prediction from the states of maximal probability. In this work we propose a simple yet effective technique for accelerating MMP when inference is sampling-based: instead of the above two-stage procedure we directly estimate the posterior probability of each decision variable. This allows us to identify the point of time when we are sufﬁciently certain about any individual decision. Whenever this is the case, we dynamically prune the variables we are conﬁdent about from the underlying factor graph. Consequently, at any time only samples of variables whose decision is still uncertain need to be created. Experiments in two prototypical scenarios, multi-label classiﬁcation and image inpainting, show that adaptive sampling can drastically accelerate MMP without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.11983732 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.html">158 nips-2012-ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryan Kiros, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and ﬁx an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efﬁcient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones. 1</p><p>4 0.64558434 <a title="159-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_to_Align_from_Scratch.html">193 nips-2012-Learning to Align from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Author: Gary Huang, Marwan Mattar, Honglak Lee, Erik G. Learned-miller</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised joint alignment of images has been demonstrated to improve performance on recognition tasks such as face veriﬁcation. Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly aligned examples. However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of complex, real-world images has required the careful selection of feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape. In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Speciﬁcally, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the speciﬁc data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned ﬁlters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW). Using the aligned images produced by our proposed unsupervised algorithm, we achieve higher accuracy in face veriﬁcation compared to prior work in both unsupervised and supervised alignment. We also match the accuracy for the best available commercial method. 1</p><p>5 0.61515749 <a title="159-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_about_Canonical_Views_from_Internet_Image_Collections.html">185 nips-2012-Learning about Canonical Views from Internet Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Mezuman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Although human object recognition is supposedly robust to viewpoint, much research on human perception indicates that there is a preferred or “canonical” view of objects. This phenomenon was discovered more than 30 years ago but the canonical view of only a small number of categories has been validated experimentally. Moreover, the explanation for why humans prefer the canonical view over other views remains elusive. In this paper we ask: Can we use Internet image collections to learn more about canonical views? We start by manually ﬁnding the most common view in the results returned by Internet search engines when queried with the objects used in psychophysical experiments. Our results clearly show that the most likely view in the search engine corresponds to the same view preferred by human subjects in experiments. We also present a simple method to ﬁnd the most likely view in an image collection and apply it to hundreds of categories. Using the new data we have collected we present strong evidence against the two most prominent formal theories of canonical views and provide novel constraints for new theories. 1</p><p>6 0.59297425 <a title="159-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Compressive_Sensing_MRI_with_Wavelet_Tree_Sparsity.html">78 nips-2012-Compressive Sensing MRI with Wavelet Tree Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Junyuan Xie, Linli Xu, Enhong Chen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to low-level vision problems that combines sparse coding and deep networks pre-trained with denoising auto-encoder (DA). We propose an alternative training scheme that successfully adapts DA, originally designed for unsupervised feature learning, to the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. Our method’s performance in the image denoising task is comparable to that of KSVD which is a widely used sparse coding technique. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Speciﬁcally, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning. 1</p><p>2 0.77037311 <a title="159-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Neuronal_Spike_Generation_Mechanism_as_an_Oversampling%2C_Noise-shaping_A-to-D_converter.html">239 nips-2012-Neuronal Spike Generation Mechanism as an Oversampling, Noise-shaping A-to-D converter</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitri B. Chklovskii, Daniel Soudry</p><p>Abstract: We test the hypothesis that the neuronal spike generation mechanism is an analog-to-digital (AD) converter encoding rectified low-pass filtered summed synaptic currents into a spike train linearly decodable in postsynaptic neurons. Faithful encoding of an analog waveform by a binary signal requires that the spike generation mechanism has a sampling rate exceeding the Nyquist rate of the analog signal. Such oversampling is consistent with the experimental observation that the precision of the spikegeneration mechanism is an order of magnitude greater than the cut -off frequency of low-pass filtering in dendrites. Additional improvement in the coding accuracy may be achieved by noise-shaping, a technique used in signal processing. If noise-shaping were used in neurons, it would reduce coding error relative to Poisson spike generator for frequencies below Nyquist by introducing correlations into spike times. By using experimental data from three different classes of neurons, we demonstrate that biological neurons utilize noise-shaping. Therefore, the spike-generation mechanism can be viewed as an oversampling and noise-shaping AD converter. The nature of the neural spike code remains a central problem in neuroscience [1-3]. In particular, no consensus exists on whether information is encoded in firing rates [4, 5] or individual spike timing [6, 7]. On the single-neuron level, evidence exists to support both points of view. On the one hand, post-synaptic currents are low-pass-filtered by dendrites with the cut-off frequency of approximately 30Hz [8], Figure 1B, providing ammunition for the firing rate camp: if the signal reaching the soma is slowly varying, why would precise spike timing be necessary? On the other hand, the ability of the spike-generation mechanism to encode harmonics of the injected current up to about 300Hz [9, 10], Figure 1B, points at its exquisite temporal precision [11]. Yet, in view of the slow variation of the somatic current, such precision may seem gratuitous and puzzling. The timescale mismatch between gradual variation of the somatic current and high precision of spike generation has been addressed previously. Existing explanations often rely on the population nature of the neural code [10, 12]. Although this is a distinct possibility, the question remains whether invoking population coding is necessary. Other possible explanations for the timescale mismatch include the possibility that some synaptic currents (for example, GABAergic) may be generated by synapses proximal to the soma and therefore not subject to low-pass filtering or that the high frequency harmonics are so strong in the pre-synaptic spike that despite attenuation, their trace is still present. Although in some cases, these explanations could apply, for the majority of synaptic inputs to typical neurons there is a glaring mismatch. The perceived mismatch between the time scales of somatic currents and the spike-generation mechanism can be resolved naturally if one views spike trains as digitally encoding analog somatic currents [13-15], Figure 1A. Although somatic currents vary slowly, information that could be communicated by their analog amplitude far exceeds that of binary signals, such as all- or-none spikes, of the same sampling rate. Therefore, faithful digital encoding requires sampling rate of the digital signal to be much higher than the cut-off frequency of the analog signal, socalled over-sampling. Although the spike generation mechanism operates in continuous time, the high temporal precision of the spikegeneration mechanism may be viewed as a manifestation of oversampling, which is needed for the digital encoding of the analog signal. Therefore, the extra order of magnitude in temporal precision available to the spike-generation mechanism relative to somatic current, Figure 1B, is necessary to faithfully encode the amplitude of the analog signal, thus potentially reconciling the firing rate and the spike timing points of view [13-15]. Figure 1. Hybrid digital-analog operation of neuronal circuits. A. Post-synaptic currents are low-pass filtered and summed in dendrites (black) to produce a somatic current (blue). This analog signal is converted by the spike generation mechanism into a sequence of all-or-none spikes (green), a digital signal. Spikes propagate along an axon and are chemically transduced across synapses (gray) into post-synatpic currents (black), whose amplitude reflects synaptic weights, thus converting digital signal back to analog. B. Frequency response function for dendrites (blue, adapted from [8]) and for the spike generation mechanism (green, adapted from [9]). Note one order of magnitude gap between the cut off frequencies. C. Amplitude of the summed postsynaptic currents depends strongly on spike timing. If the blue spike arrives just 5ms later, as shown in red, the EPSCs sum to a value already 20% less. Therefore, the extra precision of the digital signal may be used to communicate the amplitude of the analog signal. In signal processing, efficient AD conversion combines the principle of oversampling with that of noise-shaping, which utilizes correlations in the digital signal to allow more accurate encoding of the analog amplitude. This is exemplified by a family of AD converters called modulators [16], of which the basic one is analogous to an integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron [13-15]. The analogy between the basic modulator and the IF neuron led to the suggestion that neurons also use noise-shaping to encode incoming analog current waveform in the digital spike train [13]. However, the hypothesis of noise-shaping AD conversion has never been tested experimentally in biological neurons. In this paper, by analyzing existing experimental datasets, we demonstrate that noise-shaping is present in three different classes of neurons from vertebrates and invertebrates. This lends support to the view that neurons act as oversampling and noise-shaping AD converters and accounts for the mismatch between the slowly varying somatic currents and precise spike timing. Moreover, we show that the degree of noise-shaping in biological neurons exceeds that used by basic  modulators or IF neurons and propose viewing more complicated models in the noise-shaping framework. This paper is organized as follows: We review the principles of oversampling and noise-shaping in Section 2. In Section 3, we present experimental evidence for noise-shaping AD conversion in neurons. In Section 4 we argue that rectification of somatic currents may improve energy efficiency and/or implement de-noising. 2 . Oversampling and noise-shaping in AD converters To understand how oversampling can lead to more accurate encoding of the analog signal amplitude in a digital form, we first consider a Poisson spike encoder, whose rate of spiking is modulated by the signal amplitude, Figure 2A. Such an AD converter samples an analog signal at discrete time points and generates a spike with a probability given by the (normalized) signal amplitude. Because of the binary nature of spike trains, the resulting spike train encodes the signal with a large error even when the sampling is done at Nyquist rate, i.e. the lowest rate for alias-free sampling. To reduce the encoding error a Poisson encoder can sample at frequencies, fs , higher than Nyquist, fN – hence, the term oversampling, Figure 2B. When combined with decoding by lowpass filtering (down to Nyquist) on the receiving end, this leads to a reduction of the error, which can be estimated as follows. The number of samples over a Nyquist half-period (1/2fN) is given by the oversampling ratio: . As the normalized signal amplitude, , stays roughly constant over the Nyquist half-period, it can be encoded by spikes generated with a fixed probability, x. For a Poisson process the variance in the number of spikes is equal to the mean, . Therefore, the mean relative error of the signal decoded by averaging over the Nyquist half-period: , (1) indicating that oversampling reduces transmission error. However, the weak dependence of the error on the oversampling frequency indicates diminishing returns on the investment in oversampling and motivates one to search for other ways to lower the error. Figure 2. Oversampling and noise-shaping in AD conversion. A. Analog somatic current (blue) and its digital code (green). The difference between the green and the blue curves is encoding error. B. Digital output of oversampling Poisson encoder over one Nyquist half-period. C. Error power spectrum of a Nyquist (dark green) and oversampled (light green) Poisson encoder. Although the total error power is the same, the fraction surviving low-pass filtering during decoding (solid green) is smaller in oversampled case. D. Basic  modulator. E. Signal at the output of the integrator. F. Digital output of the  modulator over one Nyquist period. G. Error power spectrum of the  modulator (brown) is shifted to higher frequencies and low-pass filtered during decoding. The remaining error power (solid brown) is smaller than for Poisson encoder. To reduce encoding error beyond the ½ power of the oversampling ratio, the principle of noiseshaping was put forward [17]. To illustrate noise-shaping consider a basic AD converter called  [18], Figure 2D. In the basic  modulator, the previous quantized signal is fed back and subtracted from the incoming signal and then the difference is integrated in time. Rather than quantizing the input signal, as would be done in the Poisson encoder,  modulator quantizes the integral of the difference between the incoming analog signal and the previous quantized signal, Figure 2F. One can see that, in the oversampling regime, the quantization error of the basic  modulator is significantly less than that of the Poisson encoder. As the variance in the number of spikes over the Nyquist period is less than one, the mean relative error of the signal is at most, , which is better than the Poisson encoder. To gain additional insight and understand the origin of the term noise-shaping, we repeat the above analysis in the Fourier domain. First, the Poisson encoder has a flat power spectrum up to the sampling frequency, Figure 2C. Oversampling preserves the total error power but extends the frequency range resulting in the lower error power below Nyquist. Second, a more detailed analysis of the basic  modulator, where the dynamics is linearized by replacing the quantization device with a random noise injection [19], shows that the quantization noise is effectively differentiated. Taking the derivative in time is equivalent to multiplying the power spectrum of the quantization noise by frequency squared. Such reduction of noise power at low frequencies is an example of noise shaping, Figure 2G. Under the additional assumption of the white quantization noise, such analysis yields: , (2) which for R >> 1 is significantly better performance than for the Poisson encoder, Eq.(1). As mentioned previously, the basic  modulator, Figure 2D, in the continuous-time regime is nothing other than an IF neuron [13, 20, 21]. In the IF neuron, quantization is implemented by the spike generation mechanism and the negative feedback corresponds to the after-spike reset. Note that resetting the integrator to zero is strictly equivalent to subtraction only for continuous-time operation. In discrete-time computer simulations, the integrator value may exceed the threshold, and, therefore, subtraction of the threshold value rather than reset must be used. Next, motivated by the -IF analogy, we look for the signs of noise-shaping AD conversion in real neurons. 3 . Experimental evidence of noise-shaping AD conversion in real neurons In order to determine whether noise-shaping AD conversion takes place in biological neurons, we analyzed three experimental datasets, where spike trains were generated by time-varying somatic currents: 1) rat somatosensory cortex L5 pyramidal neurons [9], 2) mouse olfactory mitral cells [22, 23], and 3) fruit fly olfactory receptor neurons [24]. In the first two datasets, the current was injected through an electrode in whole-cell patch clamp mode, while in the third, the recording was extracellular and the intrinsic somatic current could be measured because the glial compartment included only one active neuron. Testing the noise-shaping AD conversion hypothesis is complicated by the fact that encoded and decoded signals are hard to measure accurately. First, as somatic current is rectified by the spikegeneration mechanism, only its super-threshold component can be encoded faithfully making it hard to know exactly what is being encoded. Second, decoding in the dendrites is not accessible in these single-neuron recordings. In view of these difficulties, we start by simply computing the power spectrum of the reconstruction error obtained by subtracting a scaled and shifted, but otherwise unaltered, spike train from the somatic current. The scaling factor was determined by the total weight of the decoding linear filter and the shift was optimized to maximize information capacity, see below. At the frequencies below 20Hz the error contains significantly lower power than the input signal, Figure 3, indicating that the spike generation mechanism may be viewed as an AD converter. Furthermore, the error power spectrum of the biological neuron is below that of the Poisson encoder, thus indicating the presence of noise-shaping. For dataset 3 we also plot the error power spectrum of the IF neuron, the threshold of which is chosen to generate the same number of spikes as the biological neuron. 4 somatic current biological neuron error Poisson encoder error I&F; neuron error 10 1 10 0 Spectral power, a.u.

Power spectra of the somatic current (blue), difference between the somatic current and the digital spike train of the biological neuron (black), of the Poisson encoder (green) and of the IF neuron (red). Left: datset 1, right: dataset 3. Although the simple analysis presented above indicates noise-shaping, subtracting the spike train from the input signal, Figure 3, does not accurately quantify the error when decoding involves additional filtering. An example of such additional encoding/decoding is predictive coding, which will be discussed below [25]. To take such decoding filter into account, we computed a decoded waveform by convolving the spike train with the optimal linear filter, which predicts the somatic current from the spike train with the least mean squared error. Our linear decoding analysis lends additional support to the noise-shaping AD conversion hypothesis [13-15]. First, the optimal linear filter shape is similar to unitary post-synaptic currents, Figure 4B, thus supporting the view that dendrites reconstruct the somatic current of the presynaptic neuron by low-pass filtering the spike train in accordance with the noise-shaping principle [13]. Second, we found that linear decoding using an optimal filter accounts for 60-80% of the somatic current variance. Naturally, such prediction works better for neurons in suprathreshold regime, i.e. with high firing rates, an issue to which we return in Section 4. To avoid complications associated with rectification for now we focused on neurons which were in suprathreshold regime by monitoring that the relationship between predicted and actual current is close to linear. 2 10 C D 1 10 somatic current biological neuron error Poisson encoder error Spectral power, a.u.

Power spectra of the somatic current (blue), the decdoding error of the biological neuron (black), the Poisson encoder (green), and IF neuron (red) for dataset 1 (C) dataset 3 (D). Next, we analyzed the spectral distribution of the reconstruction error calculated by subtracting the decoded spike train, i.e. convolved with the computed optimal linear filter, from the somatic current. We found that at low frequencies the error power is significantly lower than in the input signal, Figure 4C,D. This observation confirms that signals below the dendritic cut-off frequency of 20-30Hz can be efficiently communicated using spike trains. To quantify the effect of noise-shaping we computed information capacity of different encoders: where S(f) and N(f) are the power spectra of the somatic current and encoding error correspondingly and the sum is computed only over the frequencies for which S(f) > N(f). Because the plots in Figure 4C,D use semi-logrithmic scale, the information capacity can be estimated from the area between a somatic current (blue) power spectrum and an error power spectrum. We find that the biological spike generation mechanism has higher information capacity than the Poisson encoder and IF neurons. Therefore, neurons act as AD converters with stronger noise-shaping than IF neurons. We now return to the predictive nature of the spike generation mechanism. Given the causal nature of the spike generation mechanism it is surprising that the optimal filters for all three datasets carry most of their weight following a spike, Figure 4B. This indicates that the spike generation mechanism is capable of making predictions, which are possible in these experiments because somatic currents are temporally correlated. We note that these observations make delay-free reconstruction of the signal possible, thus allowing fast operation of neural circuits [27]. The predictive nature of the encoder can be captured by a  modulator embedded in a predictive coding feedback loop [28], Figure 5A. We verified by simulation that such a nested architecture generates a similar optimal linear filter with most of its weight in the time following a spike, Figure 5A right. Of course such prediction is only possible for correlated inputs implying that the shape of the optimal linear filter depends on the statistics of the inputs. The role of predictive coding is to reduce the dynamic range of the signal that enters , thus avoiding overloading. A possible biological implementation for such integrating feedback could be Ca2+ 2+ concentration and Ca dependent potassium channels [25, 29]. Figure 5. Enhanced  modulators. A.  modulator combined with predictive coder. In such device, the optimal decoding filter computed for correlated inputs has most of its weight following a spike, similar to experimental measurements, Figure 4B. B. Second-order  modulator possesses stronger noise-shaping properties. Because such circuit contains an internal state variable it generates a non-periodic spike train in response to a constant input. Bottom trace shows a typical result of a simulation. Black – spikes, blue – input current. 4 . Possible reasons for current rectification: energy efficiency and de-noising We have shown that at high firing rates biological neurons encode somatic current into a linearly decodable spike train. However, at low firing rates linear decoding cannot faithfully reproduce the somatic current because of rectification in the spike generation mechanism. If the objective of spike generation is faithful AD conversion, why would such rectification exist? We see two potential reasons: energy efficiency and de-noising. It is widely believed that minimizing metabolic costs is an important consideration in brain design and operation [30, 31]. Moreover, spikes are known to consume a significant fraction of the metabolic budget [30, 32] placing a premium on their total number. Thus, we can postulate that neuronal spike trains find a trade-off between the mean squared error in the decoded spike train relative to the input signal and the total number of spikes, as expressed by the following cost function over a time interval T: , (3) where x is the analog input signal, s is the binary spike sequence composed of zeros and ones, and is the linear filter. To demonstrate how solving Eq.(3) would lead to thresholding, let us consider a simplified version taken over a Nyquist period, during which the input signal stays constant: (4) where and normalized by w. Minimizing such a cost function reduces to choosing the lowest lying parabola for a given , Figure 6A. Therefore, thresholding is a natural outcome of minimizing a cost function combining the decoding error and the energy cost, Eq.(3). In addition to energy efficiency, there may be a computational reason for thresholding somatic current in neurons. To illustrate this point, we note that the cost function in Eq. (3) for continuous variables, st, may be viewed as a non-negative version of the L1-norm regularized linear regression called LASSO [33], which is commonly used for de-noising of sparse and Laplacian signals [34]. Such cost function can be minimized by iteratively applying a gradient descent and a shrinkage steps [35], which is equivalent to thresholding (one-sided in case of non-negative variables), Figure 6B,C. Therefore, neurons may be encoding a de-noised input signal. Figure 6. Possible reasons for rectification in neurons. A. Cost function combining encoding error squared with metabolic expense vs. input signal for different values of the spike number N, Eq.(4). Note that the optimal number of spikes jumps from zero to one as a function of input. B.

The parabolas (red) illustrate the quadratic loglikelihood term in (3) for different values of the measurement, s, while the linear function (blue) reflects the linear log-prior term in (3). C. The minimum of the combined cost function in B is at zero if s , and grows linearly with s, if s >. 5 . Di scu ssi on In this paper, we demonstrated that the neuronal spike-generation mechanism can be viewed as an oversampling and noise-shaping AD converter, which encodes a rectified low-pass filtered somatic current as a digital spike train. Rectification by the spike generation mechanism may subserve both energy efficiency and de-noising. As the degree of noise-shaping in biological neurons exceeds that in IF neurons, or basic , we suggest that neurons should be modeled by more advanced  modulators, e.g. Figure 5B. Interestingly,  modulators can be also viewed as coders with error prediction feedback [19]. Many publications studied various aspects of spike generation in neurons yet we believe that the framework [13-15] we adopt is different and discuss its relationship to some of the studies. Our framework is different from previous proposals to cast neurons as predictors [36, 37] because a different quantity is being predicted. The possibility of perfect decoding from a spike train with infinite temporal precision has been proven in [38]. Here, we are concerned with a more practical issue of how reconstruction error scales with the over-sampling ratio. Also, we consider linear decoding which sets our work apart from [39]. Finally, previous experiments addressing noiseshaping [40] studied the power spectrum of the spike train rather than that of the encoding error. Our work is aimed at understanding biological and computational principles of spike-generation and decoding and is not meant as a substitute for the existing phenomenological spike-generation models [41], which allow efficient fitting of parameters and prediction of spike trains [42]. Yet, the theoretical framework [13-15] we adopt may assist in building better models of spike generation for a given somatic current waveform. First, having interpreted spike generation as AD conversion, we can draw on the rich experience in signal processing to attack the problem. Second, this framework suggests a natural metric to compare the performance of different spike generation models in the high firing rate regime: a mean squared error between the injected current waveform and the filtered version of the spike train produced by a model provided the total number of spikes is the same as in the experimental data. The AD conversion framework adds justification to the previously proposed spike distance obtained by subtracting low-pass filtered spike trains [43]. As the framework [13-15] we adopt relies on viewing neuronal computation as an analog-digital hybrid, which requires AD and DA conversion at every step, one may wonder about the reason for such a hybrid scheme. Starting with the early days of computers, the analog mode is known to be advantageous for computation. For example, performing addition of many variables in one step is possible in the analog mode simply by Kirchhoff law, but would require hundreds of logical gates in the digital mode [44]. However, the analog mode is vulnerable to noise build-up over many stages of computation and is inferior in precisely communicating information over long distances under limited energy budget [30, 31]. While early analog computers were displaced by their digital counterparts, evolution combined analog and digital modes into a computational hybrid [44], thus necessitating efficient AD and DA conversion, which was the focus of the present study.

<p>Author: Jeff Beck, Alexandre Pouget, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that humans and animals typically reason probabilistically about their environment. This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efﬁcient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be naturally implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identiﬁcation of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classiﬁcation, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb’s rule and describe an extension of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes. 1 Introduction to Probabilistic Inference in Cortex Probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning provides a coherent and, in many ways, optimal framework for dealing with complex problems in an uncertain world. It is, therefore, somewhat reassuring that behavioural experiments reliably demonstrate that humans and animals behave in a manner consistent with optimal probabilistic reasoning when performing a wide variety of perceptual [1, 2, 3], motor [4, 5, 6], and cognitive tasks[7]. This remarkable ability requires a neural code that represents probability distribution functions of task relevant stimuli rather than just single values. While there 1 are many ways to represent functions, Bayes rule tells us that when it comes to probability distribution functions, there is only one statistically optimal way to do it. More precisely, Bayes Rule states that any pattern of activity, r, that efﬁciently represents a probability distribution over some task relevant quantity s, must satisfy the relationship p(s|r) ∝ p(r|s)p(s), where p(r|s) is the stimulus conditioned likelihood function that speciﬁes the form of neural variability, p(s) gives the prior belief regarding the stimulus, and p(s|r) gives the posterior distribution over values of the stimulus, s given the representation r . Of course, it is unlikely that the nervous system consistently achieves this level of optimality. None-the-less, Bayes rule suggests the existence of a link between neural variability as characterized by the likelihood function p(r|s) and the state of belief of a mature statistical learning machine such as the brain. The so called Probabilistic Population Coding (or PPC) framework[8, 9, 10] takes this link seriously by proposing that the function encoded by a pattern of neural activity r is, in fact, the likelihood function p(r|s). When this is the case, the precise form of the neural variability informs the nature of the neural code. For example, the exponential family of statistical models with linear sufﬁcient statistics has been shown to be ﬂexible enough to model the ﬁrst and second order statistics of in vivo recordings in awake behaving monkeys[9, 11, 12] and anesthetized cats[13]. When the likelihood function is modeled in this way, the log posterior probability over the stimulus is linearly encoded by neural activity, i.e. log p(s|r) = h(s) · r − log Z(r) (1) Here, the stimulus dependent kernel, h(s), is a vector of functions of s, the dot represents a standard dot product, and Z(r) is the partition function which serves to normalize the posterior. This log linear form for a posterior distribution is highly computationally convenient and allows for evidence integration to be implemented via linear operations on neural activity[14, 8]. Proponents of this kind of linear PPC have demonstrated how to build biologically plausible neural networks capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference that are needed to optimally perform the behavioural tasks listed above. This includes, linear PPC implementations of cue combination[8], evidence integration over time, maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior estimation[9], coordinate transformation/auditory localization[10], object tracking/Kalman ﬁltering[10], explaining away[10], and visual search[15]. Moreover, each of these neural computations has required only a single recurrently connected layer of neurons that is capable of just two non-linear operations: coincidence detection and divisive normalization, both of which are widely observed in cortex[16, 17]. Unfortunately, this research program has been a piecemeal effort that has largely proceeded by building neural networks designed deal with particular problems. As a result, there have been no proposals for a general principle by which neural network implementations of linear PPCs might be generated and no suggestions regarding how to deal with complex (intractable) problems of probabilistic inference. In this work, we will partially address this short coming by showing that Variation Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm provides a general scheme for approximate inference and learning with linear PPCs. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the VBEM algorithm and show how it naturally leads to a linear PPC representation of the posterior as well as constraints on the neural network dynamics which build that PPC representation. Because this section describes the VB-PPC approach rather abstractly, the remainder of the paper is dedicated to concrete applications. As a motivating example, we consider the problem of inferring the concentrations of odors in an olfactory scene from a complex pattern of spikes in a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In section 3, we argue that this requires solving a spike pattern demixing problem which is indicative of the generic problem faced by many layers of cortex. We then show that this demixing problem is equivalent to the problem addressed by a class of models for text documents know as probabilistic topic models, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA[18]. In section 4, we apply the VB-PPC approach to build a neural network implementation of probabilistic inference and learning for LDA. This derivation shows that causal inference with linear PPC’s also critically relies on divisive normalization. This result suggests that this particular non-linearity may be involved in very general and fundamental probabilistic computation, rather than simply playing a role in gain modulation. In this section, we also show how this formulation allows for a probabilistic treatment of learning and show that a simple variation of Hebb’s rule can implement Bayesian learning in neural circuits. 2 We conclude this work by generalizing this approach to time varying inputs by introducing the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) which can infer short term ﬂuctuations in the concentrations of individual topics/odors and can be used to model foraging and other tracking tasks. 2 Variational Bayesian Inference with linear Probabilistic Population Codes Variational Bayesian (VB) inference refers to a class of deterministic methods for approximating the intractable integrals which arise in the context of probabilistic reasoning. Properly implemented it can result a fast alternative to sampling based methods of inference such as MCMC[19] sampling. Generically, the goal of any Bayesian inference algorithm is to infer a posterior distribution over behaviourally relevant latent variables Z given observations X and a generative model which speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Θ, Z). This task is confounded by the fact that the generative model includes latent parameters Θ which must be marginalized out, i.e. we wish to compute, p(Z|X) ∝ p(X, Θ, Z)dΘ (2) When the number of latent parameters is large this integral can be quite unwieldy. The VB algorithms simplify this marginalization by approximating the complex joint distribution over behaviourally relevant latents and parameters, p(Θ, Z|X), with a distribution q(Θ, Z) for which integrals of this form are easier to deal with in some sense. There is some art to choosing the particular form for the approximating distribution to make the above integral tractable, however, a factorized approximation is common, i.e. q(Θ, Z) = qΘ (Θ)qZ (Z). Regardless, for any given observation X, the approximate posterior is found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Θ, Z) and p(Θ, Z|X). When a factorized posterior is assumed, the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm ﬁnds a local minimum of the KL divergence by iteratively updating, qΘ (Θ) and qZ (Z) according to the scheme n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qZ (Z) and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qΘ (Θ) (3) Here the brackets indicate an expected value taken with respect to the subscripted probability distribution function and the tilde indicates equality up to a constant which is independent of Θ and Z. The key property to note here is that the approximate posterior which results from this procedure is in an exponential family form and is therefore representable by a linear PPC (Eq. 1). This feature allows for the straightforward construction of networks which implement the VBEM algorithm with linear PPC’s in the following way. If rn and rn are patterns of activity that use a linear PPC representation Θ Z of the relevant posteriors, then n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ hΘ (Θ) · rn Θ and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ hZ (Z) · rn+1 . Z (4) Here the stimulus dependent kernels hZ (Z) and hΘ (Θ) are chosen so that their outer product results in a basis that spans the function space on Z × Θ given by log p(X, Θ, Z) for every X. This choice guarantees that there exist functions fΘ (X, rn ) and fZ (X, rn ) such that Z Θ rn = fΘ (X, rn ) Θ Z and rn+1 = fZ (X, rn ) Θ Z (5) satisfy Eq. 3. When this is the case, simply iterating the discrete dynamical system described by Eq. 5 until convergence will ﬁnd the VBEM approximation to the posterior. This is one way to build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm. However, its not the only way. In general, any dynamical system which has stable ﬁxed points in common with Eq. 5 can also be said to implement the VBEM algorithm. In the example below we will take advantage of this ﬂexibility in order to build biologically plausible neural network implementations. 3 Response! to Mixture ! of Odors! Single	  Odor	  Response	  Cause Intensity	  Figure 1: (Left) Each cause (e.g. coffee) in isolation results in a pattern of neural activity (top). When multiple causes contribute to a scene this results in an overall pattern of neural activity which is a mixture of these patterns weighted by the intensities (bottom). (Right) The resulting pattern can be represented by a raster, where each spike is colored by its corresponding latent cause. 3 Probabilistic Topic Models for Spike Train Demixing Consider the problem of odor identiﬁcation depicted in Fig. 1. A typical mammalian olfactory system consists of a few hundred different types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), each of which responds to a wide range of volatile chemicals. This results in a highly distributed code for each odor. Since, a typical olfactory scene consists of many different odors at different concentrations, the pattern of ORN spike trains represents a complex mixture. Described in this way, it is easy to see that the problem faced by early olfactory cortex can be described as the task of demixing spike trains to infer latent causes (odor intensities). In many ways this olfactory problem is a generic problem faced by each cortical layer as it tries to make sense of the activity of the neurons in the layer below. The input patterns of activity consist of spikes (or spike counts) labeled by the axons which deliver them and summarized by a histogram which indicates how many spikes come from each input neuron. Of course, just because a spike came from a particular neuron does not mean that it had a particular cause, just as any particular ORN spike could have been caused by any one of a large number of volatile chemicals. Like olfactory codes, cortical codes are often distributed and multiple latent causes can be present at the same time. Regardless, this spike or histogram demixing problem is formally equivalent to a class of demixing problems which arise in the context of probabilistic topic models used for document modeling. A simple but successful example of this kind of topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [18]. LDA assumes that word order in documents is irrelevant and, therefore, models documents as histograms of word counts. It also assumes that there are K topics and that each of these topics appears in different proportions in each document, e.g. 80% of the words in a document might be concerned with coffee and 20% with strawberries. Words from a given topic are themselves drawn from a distribution over words associated with that topic, e.g. when talking about coffee you have a 5% chance of using the word ’bitter’. The goal of LDA is to infer both the distribution over topics discussed in each document and the distribution of words associated with each topic. We can map the generative model for LDA onto the task of spike demixing in cortex by letting topics become latent causes or odors, words become neurons, word occurrences become spikes, word distributions associated with each topic become patterns of neural activity associated with each cause, and different documents become the observed patterns of neural activity on different trials. This equivalence is made explicit in Fig. 2 which describes the standard generative model for LDA applied to documents on the left and mixtures of spikes on the right. 4 LDA Inference and Network Implementation In this section we will apply the VB-PPC formulation to build a biologically plausible network capable of approximating probabilistic inference for spike pattern demixing. For simplicity, we will use the equivalent Gamma-Poisson formulation of LDA which directly models word and topic counts 4 1. For each topic k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Distribution over words βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For document d = 1, . . . , D, (a) Distribution over topics θd ∼ Dirichlet(α0 ) (b) For word m = 1, . . . , Ωd i.

Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne, Rd,j to be the number of times neuron j ﬁres during trial d. Similarly, we let Nd,j,k to be the number of times a spike in neuron j comes from cause k in trial d. These new variables play the roles of the cause and neuron assignment variables, zd,m and ωd,m by simply counting them up. If we let cd,k be an un-normalized intensity of cause j such that θd,k = cd,k / k cd,k then the generative model, Rd,j = k Nd,j,k Nd,j,k ∼ Poisson(βj,k cd,k ) 0 cd,k ∼ Gamma(αk , C −1 ). (6) is equivalent to the topic models described above. Here the parameter C is a scale parameter which sets the expected total number of spikes from the population on each trial. Note that, the problem of inferring the wj,k and cd,k is a non-negative matrix factorization problem similar to that considered by Lee and Seung[20]. The primary difference is that, here, we are attempting to infer a probability distribution over these quantities rather than maximum likelihood estimates. See supplement for details. Following the prescription laid out in section 2, we approximate the posterior over latent variables given a set of input patterns, Rd , d = 1, . . . , D, with a factorized distribution of the form, qN (N)qc (c)qβ (β). This results in marginal posterior distributions q (β:,k |η:,k ), q cd,k |αd,k , C −1 + 1 ), and q (Nd,j,: | log pd,j,: , Rd,i ) which are Dirichlet, Gamma, and Multinomial respectively. Here, the parameters η:,k , αd,k , and log pd,j,: are the natural parameters of these distributions. The VBEM update algorithm yields update rules for these parameters which are summarized in Fig. 3 Algorithm1.

Before we move on to the neural network implementation, note that this standard formulation of variational inference for LDA utilizes a batch learning scheme that is not biologically plausible. Fortunately, an online version of this variational algorithm was recently proposed and shown to give 5 superior results when compared to the batch learning algorithm[21]. This algorithm replaces the sum over d in update equation for ηj,k with an incremental update based upon only the most recently observed pattern of spikes. See Fig. 3 Algorithm 2. 4.1 Neural Network Implementation Recall that the goal was to build a neural network that implements the VBEM algorithm for the underlying latent causes of a mixture of spikes using a neural code that represents the posterior distribution via a linear PPC. A linear PPC represents the natural parameters of a posterior distribution via a linear operation on neural activity. Since the primary quantity of interest here is the posterior distribution over odor concentrations, qc (c|α), this means that we need a pattern of activity rα which is linearly related to the αk ’s in the equations above. One way to accomplish this is to simply assume that the ﬁring rates of output neurons are equal to the positive valued αk parameters. Fig. 4 depicts the overall network architecture. Input patterns of activity, R, are transmitted to the synapses of a population of output neurons which represent the αk ’s. The output activity is pooled to ¯ form an un-normalized prediction of the activity of each input neuron, Rj , given the output layer’s current state of belief about the latent causes of the Rj . The activity at each synapse targeted by input neuron j is then inhibited divisively by this prediction. This results in a dendrite that reports to the ¯ soma a quantity, Nj,k , which represents the fraction of unexplained spikes from input neuron j that could be explained by latent cause k. A continuous time dynamical system with this feature and the property that it shares its ﬁxed points with the LDA algorithm is given by d ¯ Nj,k dt d αk dt ¯ ¯ = wj,k Rj − Rj Nj,k = (7) ¯ Nj,k exp (ψ (¯k )) (α0 − αk ) + exp (ψ (αk )) η (8) i ¯ where Rj = k wj,k exp (ψ (αk )), and wj,k = exp (ψ (ηj,k )). Note that, despite its form, it is Eq. 7 which implements the required divisive normalization operation since, in the steady state, ¯ ¯ Nj,k = wj,k Rj /Rj . Regardless, this network has a variety of interesting properties that align well with biology. It predicts that a balance of excitation and inhibition is maintained in the dendrites via divisive normalization and that the role of inhibitory neurons is to predict the input spikes which target individual dendrites. It also predicts superlinear facilitation. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal term on the right of Eq. 8 indicates that more active cells will be more sensitive to their dendritic inputs. Alternatively, this could be implemented via recurrent excitation at the population level. In either case, this is the mechanism by which the network implements a sparse prior on topic concentrations and stands in stark contrast to the winner take all mechanisms which rely on competitive mutual inhibition mechanisms. Additionally, the ηj in Eq. 8 represents a cell wide ’leak’ parameter that indicates that the total leak should be ¯ roughly proportional to the sum total weight of the synapses which drive the neuron. This predicts that cells that are highly sensitive to input should also decay back to baseline more quickly. This implementation also predicts Hebbian learning of synaptic weights. To observe this fact, note that the online update rule for the ηj,k parameters can be implemented by simply correlating the activity at ¯ each synapse, Nj,k with activity at the soma αj via the equation: τL d ¯ wj,k = exp (ψ (¯k )) (η0 − 1/2 − wj,k ) + Nj,k exp ψ (αk ) η dt (9) where τL is a long time constant for learning and we have used the fact that exp (ψ (ηjk )) ≈ ηjk −1/2 for x > 1. For a detailed derivation see the supplementary material. 5 Dynamic Document Model LDA is a rather simple generative model that makes several unrealistic assumptions about mixtures of sensory and cortical spikes.

This makes LDA a rather poor computational model for a task like olfactory foraging which requires the animal to track the rise a fall of odor intensities as it navigates its environment. We can model this more complicated task by replacing the static cause or odor intensity parameters with dynamic odor intensity parameters whose behavior is governed by an exponentiated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with drift and diffusion matrices given by (Λ and ΣD ). We call this variant of LDA the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) as it could be used to model smooth changes in the distribution of topics over the course of a single document. 5.1 DDM Model Thus the generative model for the DDM is as follows: 1. For latent cause k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Cause distribution over spikes βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For scene t = 1, . . . , T , (a) Log intensity of causes c(t) ∼ Normal(Λct−1 , ΣD ) (b) Number of spikes in neuron j resulting from cause k, Nj,k (t) ∼ Poisson(βj,k exp ck (t)) (c) Number of spikes in neuron j, Rj (t) = k Nj,k (t) This model bears many similarities to the Correlated and Dynamic topic models[22], but models dynamics over a short time scale, where the dynamic relationship (Λ, ΣD ) is important. 5.2 Network Implementation Once again the quantity of interest is the current distribution of latent causes, p(c(t)|R(τ ), τ = 0..T ). If no spikes occur then no evidence is presented and posterior inference over c(t) is simply given by an undriven Kalman ﬁlter with parameters (Λ, ΣD ). A recurrent neural network which uses a linear PPC to encode a posterior that evolves according to a Kalman ﬁlter has the property that neural responses are linearly related to the inverse covariance matrix of the posterior as well as that inverse covariance matrix times the posterior mean. In the absence of evidence, it is easy to show that these quantities must evolve according to recurrent dynamics which implement divisive normalization[10]. Thus, the patterns of neural activity which linearly encode them must do so as well. When a new spike arrives, optimal inference is no longer possible and a variational approximation must be utilized. As is shown in the supplement, this variational approximation is similar to the variational approximation used for LDA. As a result, a network which can divisively inhibit its synapses is able to implement approximate Bayesian inference. Curiously, this implies that the addition of spatial and temporal correlations to the latent causes adds very little complexity to the VB-PPC network implementation of probabilistic inference. All that is required is an additional inhibitory population which targets the somata in the output population.

Black shows true concentration, blue and red (indistinguishable) show MAP estimates for the network and VBEM algorithms. 6 Experimental Results We compared the PPC neural network implementations of the variational inference with the standard VBEM algorithm. This comparison is necessary because the two algorithms are not guaranteed to converge to the same solution due to the fact that we only required that the neural network dynamics have the same ﬁxed points as the standard VBEM algorithm. As a result, it is possible for the two algorithms to converge to different local minima of the KL divergence. For the network implementation of LDA we ﬁnd good agreement between the neural network and VBEM estimates of the natural parameters of the posterior. See Fig. 6(left) which shows the two algorithms estimates of the shape parameter of the posterior distribution over topic (odor) concentrations (a quantity which is proportional to the expected concentration). This agreement, however, is not perfect, especially when posterior predicted concentrations are low. In part, this is due to the fact we are presenting the network with difﬁcult inference problems for which the true posterior distribution over topics (odors) is highly correlated and multimodal. As a result, the objective function (KL divergence) is littered with local minima. Additionally, the discrete iterations of the VBEM algorithm can take very large steps in the space of natural parameters while the neural network implementation cannot. In contrast, the network implementation of the DDM is in much better agreement with the VBEM estimation. See Fig. 6(right). This is because the smooth temporal dynamics of the topics eliminate the need for the VBEM algorithm to take large steps. As a result, the smooth network dynamics are better able to accurately track the VBEM algorithms output. For simulation details please see the supplement. 7 Discussion and Conclusion In this work we presented a general framework for inference and learning with linear Probabilistic Population codes. This framework takes advantage of the fact that the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm generates approximate posterior distributions which are in an exponential family form. This is precisely the form needed in order to make probability distributions representable by a linear PPC. We then outlined a general means by which one can build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm using this kind of neural code. We applied this VB-PPC framework to generate a biologically plausible neural network for spike train demixing. We chose this problem because it has many of the features of the canonical problem faced by nearly every layer of cortex, i.e. that of inferring the latent causes of complex mixtures of spike trains in the layer below. Curiously, this very complicated problem of probabilistic inference and learning ended up having a remarkably simple network solution, requiring only that neurons be capable of implementing divisive normalization via dendritically targeted inhibition and superlinear facilitation. Moreover, we showed that extending this approach to the more complex dynamic case in which latent causes change in intensity over time does not substantially increase the complexity of the neural circuit. Finally, we would like to note that, while we utilized a rate coding scheme for our linear PPC, the basic equations would still apply to any spike based log probability codes such as that considered Beorlin and Deneve[23]. 8 References [1] Daniel Kersten, Pascal Mamassian, and Alan Yuille.

<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>5 0.68282616 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">229 nips-2012-Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitish Srivastava, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: A Deep Boltzmann Machine is described for learning a generative model of data that consists of multiple and diverse input modalities. The model can be used to extract a uniﬁed representation that fuses modalities together. We ﬁnd that this representation is useful for classiﬁcation and information retrieval tasks. The model works by learning a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs. It uses states of latent variables as representations of the input. The model can extract this representation even when some modalities are absent by sampling from the conditional distribution over them and ﬁlling them in. Our experimental results on bi-modal data consisting of images and text show that the Multimodal DBM can learn a good generative model of the joint space of image and text inputs that is useful for information retrieval from both unimodal and multimodal queries. We further demonstrate that this model signiﬁcantly outperforms SVMs and LDA on discriminative tasks. Finally, we compare our model to other deep learning methods, including autoencoders and deep belief networks, and show that it achieves noticeable gains. 1</p><p>6 0.67905074 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Projection_Retrieval_for_Classification.html">279 nips-2012-Projection Retrieval for Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yung-kyun Noh, Frank Park, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: This paper sheds light on some fundamental connections of the diffusion decision making model of neuroscience and cognitive psychology with k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation. We show that conventional k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation can be viewed as a special problem of the diffusion decision model in the asymptotic situation. By applying the optimal strategy associated with the diffusion decision model, an adaptive rule is developed for determining appropriate values of k in knearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Making use of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and Bayesian analysis, we propose ﬁve different criteria for adaptively acquiring nearest neighbors. Experiments with both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our classiﬁcation criteria. 1</p><p>3 0.14486882 <a title="105-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Image_Denoising_and_Inpainting_with_Deep_Neural_Networks.html">159 nips-2012-Image Denoising and Inpainting with Deep Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Junyuan Xie, Linli Xu, Enhong Chen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to low-level vision problems that combines sparse coding and deep networks pre-trained with denoising auto-encoder (DA). We propose an alternative training scheme that successfully adapts DA, originally designed for unsupervised feature learning, to the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. Our method’s performance in the image denoising task is comparable to that of KSVD which is a widely used sparse coding technique. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Speciﬁcally, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning. 1</p><p>4 0.13715687 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Convergence_Rate_Analysis_of_MAP_Coordinate_Minimization_Algorithms.html">84 nips-2012-Convergence Rate Analysis of MAP Coordinate Minimization Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Meshi, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Finding maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignments in graphical models is an important task in many applications. Since the problem is generally hard, linear programming (LP) relaxations are often used. Solving these relaxations efﬁciently is thus an important practical problem. In recent years, several authors have proposed message passing updates corresponding to coordinate descent in the dual LP. However, these are generally not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. One approach to remedy this is to smooth the LP, and perform coordinate descent on the smoothed dual. However, little is known about the convergence rate of this procedure. Here we perform a thorough rate analysis of such schemes and derive primal and dual convergence rates. We also provide a simple dual to primal mapping that yields feasible primal solutions with a guaranteed rate of convergence. Empirical evaluation supports our theoretical claims and shows that the method is highly competitive with state of the art approaches that yield global optima. 1</p><p>5 0.1287441 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_as_MAP_Inference_in_Discrete_Graphical_Models.html">186 nips-2012-Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianghang Liu, James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We present a new formulation for binary classiﬁcation. Instead of relying on convex losses and regularizers such as in SVMs, logistic regression and boosting, or instead non-convex but continuous formulations such as those encountered in neural networks and deep belief networks, our framework entails a non-convex but discrete formulation, where estimation amounts to ﬁnding a MAP conﬁguration in a graphical model whose potential functions are low-dimensional discrete surrogates for the misclassiﬁcation loss. We argue that such a discrete formulation can naturally account for a number of issues that are typically encountered in either the convex or the continuous non-convex approaches, or both. By reducing the learning problem to a MAP inference problem, we can immediately translate the guarantees available for many inference settings to the learning problem itself. We empirically demonstrate in a number of experiments that this approach is promising in dealing with issues such as severe label noise, while still having global optimality guarantees. Due to the discrete nature of the formulation, it also allows for direct regularization through cardinality-based penalties, such as the 0 pseudo-norm, thus providing the ability to perform feature selection and trade-oﬀ interpretability and predictability in a principled manner. We also outline a number of open problems arising from the formulation. 1</p><p>6 0.12795933 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Continuous_Relaxations_for_Discrete_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo.html">82 nips-2012-Continuous Relaxations for Discrete Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a></p>

<p>Author: Yichuan Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Amos J. Storkey, Charles A. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization, but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difﬁcult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation inference algorithms on a number of illustrative problems. 1</p><p>3 0.71034348 <a title="105-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Training_sparse_natural_image_models_with_a_fast_Gibbs_sampler_of_an_extended_state_space.html">349 nips-2012-Training sparse natural image models with a fast Gibbs sampler of an extended state space</a></p>
<p>Author: Lucas Theis, Jascha Sohl-dickstein, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: We present a new learning strategy based on an efﬁcient blocked Gibbs sampler for sparse overcomplete linear models. Particular emphasis is placed on statistical image modeling, where overcomplete models have played an important role in discovering sparse representations. Our Gibbs sampler is faster than general purpose sampling schemes while also requiring no tuning as it is free of parameters. Using the Gibbs sampler and a persistent variant of expectation maximization, we are able to extract highly sparse distributions over latent sources from data. When applied to natural images, our algorithm learns source distributions which resemble spike-and-slab distributions. We evaluate the likelihood and quantitatively compare the performance of the overcomplete linear model to its complete counterpart as well as a product of experts model, which represents another overcomplete generalization of the complete linear model. In contrast to previous claims, we ﬁnd that overcomplete representations lead to signiﬁcant improvements, but that the overcomplete linear model still underperforms other models. 1</p><p>4 0.65999991 <a title="105-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Variational_Inference_for_Crowdsourcing.html">359 nips-2012-Variational Inference for Crowdsourcing</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Jian Peng, Alex Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a popular paradigm for labeling large datasets. However, it has given rise to the computational task of aggregating the crowdsourced labels provided by a collection of unreliable annotators. We approach this problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in graphical models, and applying approximate variational methods, including belief propagation (BP) and mean ﬁeld (MF). We show that our BP algorithm generalizes both majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger et al. [1], while our MF method is closely related to a commonly used EM algorithm. In both cases, we ﬁnd that the performance of the algorithms critically depends on the choice of a prior distribution on the workers’ reliability; by choosing the prior properly, both BP and MF (and EM) perform surprisingly well on both simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms based on more complicated modeling assumptions. 1</p><p>5 0.64695036 <a title="105-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Nonparanormal_Belief_Propagation_%28NPNBP%29.html">248 nips-2012-Nonparanormal Belief Propagation (NPNBP)</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Cobi Cario</p><p>Abstract: The empirical success of the belief propagation approximate inference algorithm has inspired numerous theoretical and algorithmic advances. Yet, for continuous non-Gaussian domains performing belief propagation remains a challenging task: recent innovations such as nonparametric or kernel belief propagation, while useful, come with a substantial computational cost and offer little theoretical guarantees, even for tree structured models. In this work we present Nonparanormal BP for performing efﬁcient inference on distributions parameterized by a Gaussian copulas network and any univariate marginals. For tree structured networks, our approach is guaranteed to be exact for this powerful class of non-Gaussian models. Importantly, the method is as efﬁcient as standard Gaussian BP, and its convergence properties do not depend on the complexity of the univariate marginals, even when a nonparametric representation is used. 1</p><p>6 0.62827677 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Density_Propagation_and_Improved_Bounds_on_the_Partition_Function.html">96 nips-2012-Density Propagation and Improved Bounds on the Partition Function</a></p>

<p>Author: Angela Eigenstetter, Bjorn Ommer</p><p>Abstract: Category-level object detection has a crucial need for informative object representations. This demand has led to feature descriptors of ever increasing dimensionality like co-occurrence statistics and self-similarity. In this paper we propose a new object representation based on curvature self-similarity that goes beyond the currently popular approximation of objects using straight lines. However, like all descriptors using second order statistics, ours also exhibits a high dimensionality. Although improving discriminability, the high dimensionality becomes a critical issue due to lack of generalization ability and curse of dimensionality. Given only a limited amount of training data, even sophisticated learning algorithms such as the popular kernel methods are not able to suppress noisy or superﬂuous dimensions of such high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a natural need for feature selection when using present-day informative features and, particularly, curvature self-similarity. We therefore suggest an embedded feature selection method for SVMs that reduces complexity and improves generalization capability of object models. By successfully integrating the proposed curvature self-similarity representation together with the embedded feature selection in a widely used state-of-the-art object detection framework we show the general pertinence of the approach. 1</p><p>3 0.8157807 <a title="105-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Locating_Changes_in_Highly_Dependent_Data_with_Unknown_Number_of_Change_Points.html">203 nips-2012-Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points</a></p>
<p>Author: Azadeh Khaleghi, Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multiple change point estimation is considered for sequences with unknown number of change points. A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed. In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form. The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations. 1</p><p>4 0.81031066 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Caron, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an inﬁnite number of choice items. Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior speciﬁed by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books. 1</p><p>5 0.80688632 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Ensemble_weighted_kernel_estimators_for_multivariate_entropy_estimation.html">117 nips-2012-Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kumar Sricharan, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: The problem of estimation of entropy functionals of probability densities has received much attention in the information theory, machine learning and statistics communities. Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, for large feature dimension d, kernel plug-in estimators suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality: the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order O(T −γ/d ), where T is the number of samples, and γ > 0 is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for suﬃciently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order O(T −1 ). Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed oﬄine. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates. 1</p><p>6 0.80655497 <a title="105-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Calibrated_Elastic_Regularization_in_Matrix_Completion.html">64 nips-2012-Calibrated Elastic Regularization in Matrix Completion</a></p>

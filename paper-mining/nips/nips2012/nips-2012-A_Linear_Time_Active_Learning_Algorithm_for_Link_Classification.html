<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Musé, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graphical models are a very useful tool to describe and understand natural phenomena, from gene expression to climate change and social interactions. The topological structure of these graphs/networks is a fundamental part of the analysis, and in many cases the main goal of the study. However, little work has been done on incorporating prior topological knowledge onto the estimation of the underlying graphical models from sample data. In this work we propose extensions to the basic joint regression model for network estimation, which explicitly incorporate graph-topological constraints into the corresponding optimization approach. The ﬁrst proposed extension includes an eigenvector centrality constraint, thereby promoting this important prior topological property. The second developed extension promotes the formation of certain motifs, triangle-shaped ones in particular, which are known to exist for example in genetic regulatory networks. The presentation of the underlying formulations, which serve as examples of the introduction of topological constraints in network estimation, is complemented with examples in diverse datasets demonstrating the importance of incorporating such critical prior knowledge. 1</p><p>3 0.12162382 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Structure_estimation_for_discrete_graphical_models%3A_Generalized_covariance_matrices_and_their_inverses.html">326 nips-2012-Structure estimation for discrete graphical models: Generalized covariance matrices and their inverses</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a curious relationship between the structure of a discrete graphical model and the support of the inverse of a generalized covariance matrix. We show that for certain graph structures, the support of the inverse covariance matrix of indicator variables on the vertices of a graph reﬂects the conditional independence structure of the graph. Our work extends results that have previously been established only in the context of multivariate Gaussian graphical models, thereby addressing an open question about the signiﬁcance of the inverse covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian distribution. Based on our population-level results, we show how the graphical Lasso may be used to recover the edge structure of certain classes of discrete graphical models, and present simulations to verify our theoretical results. 1</p><p>4 0.11409631 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Ragupathyraj Valluvan</p><p>Abstract: Graphical model selection refers to the problem of estimating the unknown graph structure given observations at the nodes in the model. We consider a challenging instance of this problem when some of the nodes are latent or hidden. We characterize conditions for tractable graph estimation and develop efﬁcient methods with provable guarantees. We consider the class of Ising models Markov on locally tree-like graphs, which are in the regime of correlation decay. We propose an efﬁcient method for graph estimation, and establish its structural consistency −δη(η+1)−2 when the number of samples n scales as n = Ω(θmin log p), where θmin is the minimum edge potential, δ is the depth (i.e., distance from a hidden node to the nearest observed nodes), and η is a parameter which depends on the minimum and maximum node and edge potentials in the Ising model. The proposed method is practical to implement and provides ﬂexibility to control the number of latent variables and the cycle lengths in the output graph. We also present necessary conditions for graph estimation by any method and show that our method nearly matches the lower bound on sample requirements. Keywords: Graphical model selection, latent variables, quartet methods, locally tree-like graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.10534195 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Simple_and_Practical_Algorithm_for_Differentially_Private_Data_Release.html">18 nips-2012-A Simple and Practical Algorithm for Differentially Private Data Release</a></p>

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, Junming Yin, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue for representing networks as a bag of triangular motifs, particularly for important network problems that current model-based approaches handle poorly due to computational bottlenecks incurred by using edge representations. Such approaches require both 1-edges and 0-edges (missing edges) to be provided as input, and as a consequence, approximate inference algorithms for these models usually require Ω(N 2 ) time per iteration, precluding their application to larger real-world networks. In contrast, triangular modeling requires less computation, while providing equivalent or better inference quality. A triangular motif is a vertex triple containing 2 or 3 edges, and the number of such motifs is 2 Θ( i Di ) (where Di is the degree of vertex i), which is much smaller than N 2 for low-maximum-degree networks. Using this representation, we develop a novel mixed-membership network model and approximate inference algorithm suitable for large networks with low max-degree. For networks with high maximum degree, the triangular motifs can be naturally subsampled in a node-centric fashion, allowing for much faster inference at a small cost in accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach, when compared to that of an edge-based model, has faster runtime and improved accuracy for mixed-membership community detection. We conclude with a large-scale demonstration on an N ≈ 280, 000-node network, which is infeasible for network models with Ω(N 2 ) inference cost. 1</p><p>3 0.72034162 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_Inference_of_Overlapping_Communities.html">298 nips-2012-Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities</a></p>
<p>Author: Prem Gopalan, Sean Gerrish, Michael Freedman, David M. Blei, David M. Mimno</p><p>Abstract: We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference of overlapping communities in large networks. Our algorithm is based on stochastic variational inference in the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). It naturally interleaves subsampling the network with estimating its community structure. We apply our algorithm on ten large, real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes. It converges several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for MMSB, ﬁnds hundreds of communities in large real-world networks, and detects the true communities in 280 benchmark networks with equal or better accuracy compared to other scalable algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.71631414 <a title="10-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Fiedler_Random_Fields%3A_A_Large-Scale_Spectral_Approach_to_Statistical_Network_Modeling.html">132 nips-2012-Fiedler Random Fields: A Large-Scale Spectral Approach to Statistical Network Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonino Freno, Mikaela Keller, Marc Tommasi</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some speciﬁc graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network properties. Second, we use the deﬁned statistic to develop the Fiedler random ﬁeld model, which allows for efﬁcient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random ﬁelds, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches.</p><p>5 0.68680722 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Minimizing_Uncertainty_in_Pipelines.html">215 nips-2012-Minimizing Uncertainty in Pipelines</a></p>
<p>Author: Nilesh Dalvi, Aditya Parameswaran, Vibhor Rastogi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of debugging large pipelines by human labeling. We represent the execution of a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph of AND and OR nodes, where each node represents a data item produced by some operator in the pipeline. We assume that each operator assigns a conﬁdence to each of its output data. We want to reduce the uncertainty in the output by issuing queries to a human, where a query consists of checking if a given data item is correct. In this paper, we consider the problem of asking the optimal set of queries to minimize the resulting output uncertainty. We perform a detailed evaluation of the complexity of the problem for various classes of graphs. We give efﬁcient algorithms for the problem for trees, and show that, for a general dag, the problem is intractable. 1</p><p>6 0.66907859 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Zhen, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Hashing-based methods provide a very promising approach to large-scale similarity search. To obtain compact hash codes, a recent trend seeks to learn the hash functions from data automatically. In this paper, we study hash function learning in the context of multimodal data. We propose a novel multimodal hash function learning method, called Co-Regularized Hashing (CRH), based on a boosted coregularization framework. The hash functions for each bit of the hash codes are learned by solving DC (difference of convex functions) programs, while the learning for multiple bits proceeds via a boosting procedure so that the bias introduced by the hash functions can be sequentially minimized. We empirically compare CRH with two state-of-the-art multimodal hash function learning methods on two publicly available data sets. 1</p><p>2 0.72223729 <a title="10-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Networks_of_Heterogeneous_Influence.html">182 nips-2012-Learning Networks of Heterogeneous Influence</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Ming Yuan, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Information, disease, and inﬂuence diffuse over networks of entities in both natural systems and human society. Analyzing these transmission networks plays an important role in understanding the diffusion processes and predicting future events. However, the underlying transmission networks are often hidden and incomplete, and we observe only the time stamps when cascades of events happen. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of uncovering the hidden network only from the cascades. The structure discovery problem is complicated by the fact that the inﬂuence between networked entities is heterogeneous, which can not be described by a simple parametric model. Therefore, we propose a kernelbased method which can capture a diverse range of different types of inﬂuence without any prior assumption. In both synthetic and real cascade data, we show that our model can better recover the underlying diffusion network and drastically improve the estimation of the transmission functions among networked entities. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71901834 <a title="10-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Linear_Time_Active_Learning_Algorithm_for_Link_Classification.html">10 nips-2012-A Linear Time Active Learning Algorithm for Link Classification</a></p>

The running time of this algorithm is at most of order |E| + |V | log |V |. 1</p><p>4 0.66737086 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Gradient_Weights_help_Nonparametric_Regressors.html">145 nips-2012-Gradient Weights help Nonparametric Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe, Abdeslam Boularias</p><p>Abstract: In regression problems over Rd , the unknown function f often varies more in some coordinates than in others. We show that weighting each coordinate i with the estimated norm of the ith derivative of f is an efﬁcient way to signiﬁcantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors, e.g. kernel and k-NN regressors. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. Moreover, the proposed estimator is efﬁciently learned online. 1</p><p>5 0.58792275 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>6 0.58358878 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Use_of_Non-Stationary_Policies_for_Stationary_Infinite-Horizon_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">255 nips-2012-On the Use of Non-Stationary Policies for Stationary Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies a novel discriminative part-based model to represent and recognize object shapes with an “And-Or graph”. We deﬁne this model consisting of three layers: the leaf-nodes with collaborative edges for localizing local parts, the or-nodes specifying the switch of leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the global veriﬁcation. A discriminative learning algorithm, extended from the CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e.g., the conﬁguration of the leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration. The advantages of our method are two-fold. (i) The And-Or graph model enables us to handle well large intra-class variance and background clutters for object shape detection from images. (ii) The proposed learning algorithm is able to obtain the And-Or graph representation without requiring elaborate supervision and initialization. We validate the proposed method on several challenging databases (e.g., INRIA-Horse, ETHZ-Shape, and UIUC-People), and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.13551442 <a title="101-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Representations_and_Codes_for_Image_Auto-Annotation.html">92 nips-2012-Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Kiros, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and ﬁx an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efﬁcient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones. 1</p><p>4 0.12841916 <a title="101-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Visual_Recognition_using_Embedded_Feature_Selection_for_Curvature_Self-Similarity.html">360 nips-2012-Visual Recognition using Embedded Feature Selection for Curvature Self-Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela Eigenstetter, Bjorn Ommer</p><p>Abstract: Category-level object detection has a crucial need for informative object representations. This demand has led to feature descriptors of ever increasing dimensionality like co-occurrence statistics and self-similarity. In this paper we propose a new object representation based on curvature self-similarity that goes beyond the currently popular approximation of objects using straight lines. However, like all descriptors using second order statistics, ours also exhibits a high dimensionality. Although improving discriminability, the high dimensionality becomes a critical issue due to lack of generalization ability and curse of dimensionality. Given only a limited amount of training data, even sophisticated learning algorithms such as the popular kernel methods are not able to suppress noisy or superﬂuous dimensions of such high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a natural need for feature selection when using present-day informative features and, particularly, curvature self-similarity. We therefore suggest an embedded feature selection method for SVMs that reduces complexity and improves generalization capability of object models. By successfully integrating the proposed curvature self-similarity representation together with the embedded feature selection in a widely used state-of-the-art object detection framework we show the general pertinence of the approach. 1</p><p>5 0.1241685 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive_Deep_Learning_for_3D_Object_Classification.html">87 nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive Deep Learning for 3D Object Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Brody Huval, Bharath Bath, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D sensing technologies make it possible to easily record color and depth images which together can improve object recognition. Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, ﬁxed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efﬁcient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs. 1</p><p>6 0.098054036 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Mezuman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Although human object recognition is supposedly robust to viewpoint, much research on human perception indicates that there is a preferred or “canonical” view of objects. This phenomenon was discovered more than 30 years ago but the canonical view of only a small number of categories has been validated experimentally. Moreover, the explanation for why humans prefer the canonical view over other views remains elusive. In this paper we ask: Can we use Internet image collections to learn more about canonical views? We start by manually ﬁnding the most common view in the results returned by Internet search engines when queried with the objects used in psychophysical experiments. Our results clearly show that the most likely view in the search engine corresponds to the same view preferred by human subjects in experiments. We also present a simple method to ﬁnd the most likely view in an image collection and apply it to hundreds of categories. Using the new data we have collected we present strong evidence against the two most prominent formal theories of canonical views and provide novel constraints for new theories. 1</p><p>4 0.68719918 <a title="101-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Memorability_of_Image_Regions.html">210 nips-2012-Memorability of Image Regions</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: While long term human visual memory can store a remarkable amount of visual information, it tends to degrade over time. Recent works have shown that image memorability is an intrinsic property of an image that can be reliably estimated using state-of-the-art image features and machine learning algorithms. However, the class of features and image information that is forgotten has not been explored yet. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework that models how and which local regions from an image may be forgotten using a data-driven approach that combines local and global images features. The model automatically discovers memorability maps of individual images without any human annotation. We incorporate multiple image region attributes in our algorithm, leading to improved memorability prediction of images as compared to previous works. 1</p><p>5 0.67758816 <a title="101-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Unsupervised_Template_Learning_for_Fine-Grained_Object_Recognition.html">357 nips-2012-Unsupervised Template Learning for Fine-Grained Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Shulin Yang, Liefeng Bo, Jue Wang, Linda G. Shapiro</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition refers to a subordinate level of recognition, such as recognizing different species of animals and plants. It differs from recognition of basic categories, such as humans, tables, and computers, in that there are global similarities in shape and structure shared cross different categories, and the differences are in the details of object parts. We suggest that the key to identifying the ﬁne-grained differences lies in ﬁnding the right alignment of image regions that contain the same object parts. We propose a template model for the purpose, which captures common shape patterns of object parts, as well as the cooccurrence relation of the shape patterns. Once the image regions are aligned, extracted features are used for classiﬁcation. Learning of the template model is efﬁcient, and the recognition results we achieve signiﬁcantly outperform the stateof-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.66649312 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Dynamical_And-Or_Graph_Learning_for_Object_Shape_Modeling_and_Detection.html">106 nips-2012-Dynamical And-Or Graph Learning for Object Shape Modeling and Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Hyun S. Park, Eakta Jain, Yaser Sheikh</p><p>Abstract: A gaze concurrence is a point in 3D where the gaze directions of two or more people intersect. It is a strong indicator of social saliency because the attention of the participating group is focused on that point. In scenes occupied by large groups of people, multiple concurrences may occur and transition over time. In this paper, we present a method to construct a 3D social saliency ďŹ eld and locate multiple gaze concurrences that occur in a social scene from videos taken by head-mounted cameras. We model the gaze as a cone-shaped distribution emanating from the center of the eyes, capturing the variation of eye-in-head motion. We calibrate the parameters of this distribution by exploiting the ďŹ xed relationship between the primary gaze ray and the head-mounted camera pose. The resulting gaze model enables us to build a social saliency ďŹ eld in 3D. We estimate the number and 3D locations of the gaze concurrences via provably convergent modeseeking in the social saliency ďŹ eld. Our algorithm is applied to reconstruct multiple gaze concurrences in several real world scenes and evaluated quantitatively against motion-captured ground truth. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76979727 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Discriminatively_Trained_Sparse_Code_Gradients_for_Contour_Detection.html">101 nips-2012-Discriminatively Trained Sparse Code Gradients for Contour Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Ren Xiaofeng, Liefeng Bo</p><p>Abstract: Finding contours in natural images is a fundamental problem that serves as the basis of many tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator. In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding. We use K-SVD for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for computing sparse codes on oriented local neighborhoods, and apply multi-scale pooling and power transforms before classifying them with linear SVMs. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and ﬁnd contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours). Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth maps and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as veriﬁed on the NYU Depth Dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.76467276 <a title="101-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_systematic_approach_to_extracting_semantic_information_from_functional_MRI_data.html">28 nips-2012-A systematic approach to extracting semantic information from functional MRI data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francisco Pereira, Matthew Botvinick</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel classiﬁcation method for functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets with tens of classes. The method is designed to make predictions using information from as many brain locations as possible, instead of resorting to feature selection, and does this by decomposing the pattern of brain activation into differently informative sub-regions. We provide results over a complex semantic processing dataset that show that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art feature selection and also suggest how the method may be used to perform group or exploratory analyses of complex class structure. 1</p><p>4 0.73676831 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Transelliptical_Component_Analysis.html">351 nips-2012-Transelliptical Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Han, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a high dimensional semiparametric scale-invariant principle component analysis, named TCA, by utilize the natural connection between the elliptical distribution family and the principal component analysis. Elliptical distribution family includes many well-known multivariate distributions like multivariate Gaussian, t and logistic and it is extended to the meta-elliptical by Fang et.al (2002) using the copula techniques. In this paper we extend the meta-elliptical distribution family to a even larger family, called transelliptical. We prove that TCA can obtain a near-optimal s log d/n estimation consistency rate in recovering the leading eigenvector of the latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family, even if the distributions are very heavy-tailed, have inﬁnite second moments, do not have densities and possess arbitrarily continuous marginal distributions. A feature selection result with explicit rate is also provided. TCA is further implemented in both numerical simulations and largescale stock data to illustrate its empirical usefulness. Both theories and experiments conﬁrm that TCA can achieve model ﬂexibility, estimation accuracy and robustness at almost no cost. 1</p><p>5 0.69715494 <a title="101-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Minimizing_Uncertainty_in_Pipelines.html">215 nips-2012-Minimizing Uncertainty in Pipelines</a></p>
<p>Author: Nilesh Dalvi, Aditya Parameswaran, Vibhor Rastogi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of debugging large pipelines by human labeling. We represent the execution of a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph of AND and OR nodes, where each node represents a data item produced by some operator in the pipeline. We assume that each operator assigns a conﬁdence to each of its output data. We want to reduce the uncertainty in the output by issuing queries to a human, where a query consists of checking if a given data item is correct. In this paper, we consider the problem of asking the optimal set of queries to minimize the resulting output uncertainty. We perform a detailed evaluation of the complexity of the problem for various classes of graphs. We give efﬁcient algorithms for the problem for trees, and show that, for a general dag, the problem is intractable. 1</p><p>6 0.65170074 <a title="101-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2012-261-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4757-online-allocation-and-homogeneous-partitioning-for-piecewise-constant-mean-approximation.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: In the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal of a learner is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of arms, recent results show that it is possible to derive strategies based on ﬁnite-time conﬁdence bounds that are competitive with the best possible strategy. We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a ﬁnite partition P of a continuous sampling space X ⊂ Rd . Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is ﬁxed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper conﬁdence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order on the class of α−H¨ lder functions. o 1 Setting and Previous work Let us consider some space X ⊂ Rd , and Y ⊂ R. We call X the input space or sampling space, Y the output space or value space. We consider the problem of estimating with uniform precision the function f : X ⊂ Rd → Y ⊂ R. We assume that we can query n times the function f , anywhere in the domain, and observe noisy samples of this function. These samples are collected sequentially, and our aim is to design an adaptive procedure that selects wisely where on the domain to query the function, according to the information provided by the previous samples. More formally: Observed process We consider an unknown Y-valued process deﬁned on X , written ν : X → M+ (Y), where M+ (Y) refers to the set of all probability measures on Y, such that for all x ∈ X , 1 1 def the random variable Y (x) ∼ ν(x) has mean f (x) = E[Y (x)|x] ∈ R. We write for convenience the model in the following way Y (x) = f (x) + noise(x) , def where noise(x) = Y (x) − E[Y (x)|x] is the centered random variable corresponding to the noise, o with unknown variance σ 2 (x). We assume throughout this paper that f is α-H¨ lder. Partition We consider we can deﬁne a partition P of the input space X , with ﬁnitely many P regions {Rp }1≤p≤P that are assumed to be convex and not degenerated, i.e. such that the interior of each region Rp has positive Lebesgue volume vp . Moreover, with each region Rp is associated a sampling distribution in that region, written µp ∈ M+ (Rp ). Thus, when we decide to sample in 1 region Rp , a new sample X ∈ Rp is generated according to X ∼ µp . Allocation. We consider that we have a ﬁnite budget of n ∈ N samples that we can use in order to allocate samples as we wish among the regions {Rp }1≤p≤P . For illustration, let us assume that we deterministically allocate Tp,n ∈ N samples in region Rp , with the constraint that the allocation {Tp,n }1≤p≤P must some to n. In region Rp , we thus sample points {Xp,i }1≤p≤P at random 1 according to the sampling distribution µp , and then get the corresponding values {Yp,i }1≤i≤Tp,n , where Yp,i ∼ ν(Xp,i ). In the sequel, the distribution µp is assumed to be the uniform distribution dλ(x)1x∈R over region Rp , i.e. the density of µp is λ(Rp ) p where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Note that this is not restrictive since we are in an active, not passive setting. Piecewise constant mean-approximation. We use the collected samples in order to build a pieceˆ wise constant approximation fn of the mean f , and measure the accuracy of approximation on a region Rp with the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error, namely � � � � � ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = Eµ ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 , ˆ (f (x) − fn E p λ(Rp ) Rp ˆ where mp,n is the constant value that takes fn on the region Rp . A natural choice for the estimator ˆ mp,n is to use the empirical mean that is unbiased and asymptotically optimal for this criterion. ˆ Thus we consider the following estimate (histogram) ˆ fn (x) = P � p=1 mp,n I{x ∈ Rp } where mp,n = ˆ ˆ Tp,n 1 � Tp,n Yp,i . i=1 Pseudo loss Note that, since the Tp,n are deterministic, the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error of this estimator can be written in the following form � � � � � � ˆ Eµp ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 ˆ = Eµp ,ν (f (X) − Eµp [f (X)])2 + Eµp ,ν (Eµp [f (X)] − mp,n )2 � � � � = Vµp f (X) + Vµp ,ν mp,n ˆ � � � � 1 Vµp ,ν Y (X) . = Vµp f (X) + Tp,n Now, using the following immediate decomposition � � � � � Vµp ,ν Y (X) = Vµp f (X) + σ 2 (x)µp (dx) , Rp we deduce that the maximal expected quadratic norm of the approximation error over the regions def {Rp }1≤p≤P , that depends on the choice of the considered allocation strategy A = {Tp,n }1≤p≤P is thus given by the following so-called pseudo-loss � � � � � � Tp,n + 1 1 def 2 (1) Vµp f (X) + Eµ σ (X) . Ln (A) = max 1≤ p ≤P Tp,n Tp,n p Our goal is to minimize this pseudo-loss. Note that this is a local measure of performance, as opposed to a more usual yet less challenging global quadratic error. Eventually, as the number of �� �2 � ˆ cells tends to ∞, this local measure of performance approaches supx∈X Eν f (x) − fn (x) . At this point, let us also introduce, for convenience, the notation Qp (Tp,n ) that denotes the term inside the max, in order to emphasize the dependency on the quadratic error with the allocation. Previous work There is a huge literature on the topic of functional estimation in batch setting. Since it is a rather old and well studied question in statistics, many books have been written on this topic, such as Bosq and Lecoutre [1987], Rosenblatt [1991], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], where piecewise constant meano approximation are also called “partitioning estimate” or “regressogram” (ﬁrst introduced by Tukey [1947]). The minimax-optimal rate of approximation on the class of α-H¨ lder functions is known o 2α to be in O(n− 2α+d ) (see e.g. Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002]). o In such setting, a dataset {(Xi , Yi )}i≤n is given to the learner, and a typical question is thus to try to ﬁnd the best possible histogram in order to minimize a approximation error. Thus the dataset is ﬁxed and we typically resort to techniques such as model selection where each model corresponds to one histogram (see Arlot [2007] for an extensive study of such). However, we here ask a very different question, that is how to optimally sample in an online setting in order to minimize the approximation error of some histogram. Thus we choose the histogram 2 before we see any sample, then it is ﬁxed and we need to decide which cell to sample from at each time step. Motivation for this setting comes naturally from some recent works in the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit problem Antos et al. [2010], Carpentier et al. [2011]. In these works, the objective is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of distributions (arms), which would correspond to the special case when X = {1, . . . , P } is a ﬁnite set in our setting. Intuitively, we reduce the problem to such bandit problem with ﬁnite set of arms (regions), and our setting answers the question whether it is possible to extend those results to the case when the arms do not correspond to a singleton, but rather to a continuous region. We show that the answer is positive, yet non trivial. This is non trivial due to the variance estimation in each region: points x in some region may have different means f(x), so that standard estimators for the variance are biased, contrary to the point-wise case and thus ﬁnite-arm techniques may yield disastrous results. (Estimating the variance of the distribution in a continuous region actually needs to take into account not only the point-wise noise but also the variation of the function f and the noise level σ 2 in that region.) We describe a way, inspired from quasi Monte-Carlo techniques, to correct this bias so that we can handle the additional error. Also, it is worth mentioning that this setting can be informally linked to a notion of curiosity-driven learning (see Schmidhuber [2010], Baranes and Oudeyer [2009]), since we want to decide in which region of the space to sample, without explicit reward but optimizing the goal to understand the unknown environment. Outline Section 2 provides more intuition about the pseudo-loss and a result about the optimal oracle strategy when the domain is partitioned in a minimax-optimal way on the class of α−H¨ lder o functions. Section 3 presents our assumptions, that are basically to have a sub-Gaussian noise and smooth mean and variance functions, then our estimator of the pseudo-loss together with its concentration properties, before introducing our sampling procedure, called OAHPA-pcma. Finally, the performance of this procedure is provided and discussed in Section 4. 2 The pseudo-loss: study and optimal strategies 2.1 More intuition on each term in the pseudo-loss It is natural to look at what happens to each of the two terms that appear in equation 1 when one makes Rp shrink towards a point. More precisely, let xp be the mean of X ∼ µp and let us look at the limit of Vµp (f (X)) when vp goes to 0. Assuming that f is differentiable, we get �2 � �� lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim Eµp f (X) − f (xp ) − E[f (X) − f (xp )] vp →0 vp →0 = = = lim Eµp �� �X − xp , ∇f (xp )� − E[�X − xp , ∇f (xp )�] vp →0 � � lim Eµp �X − xp , ∇f (xp )�2 vp →0 � � lim ∇f (xp )T Eµp (X − xp )(X − xp )T ∇f (xp ) . �2 � vp →0 Therefore, if we introduce Σp to be the covariance matrix of the random variable X ∼ µp , then we simply have lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim ||∇f (xp )||2 p . Σ vp →0 vp →0 Example with hyper-cubic regions An important example is when Rp is a hypercube with side 1/d length vp and µp is the uniform distribution over the region Rp . In that case (see Lemma 1), we dx have µp (dx) = , and 2/d vp vp . ||∇f (xp )||2 p = ||∇f (xp )||2 Σ 12 More generally, when f is α−differentiable, i.e. that ∀a ∈ X , ∃∇α f (a, ·) ∈ Sd (0, 1)R such that ∀x ∈ Sd (0, 1), limh→0 f (a+hx)−f (a) = ∇α f (a, x), then it is not too difﬁcult to show that for such hα hyper-cubic regions, we have � � � 2α � Vµp f (X) = O vpd sup |∇α f (xp , u)|2 . S(0,1) � � On the other hand, by direct computation, the second term is such that limvp →0 Eµp σ 2 (X) = � � � � σ 2 (xp ). Thus, while Vµp f (X) vanishes, Eµp σ 2 (X) stays bounded away from 0 (unless ν is deterministic). 3 2.2 Oracle allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation. We now assume that we are allowed to choose the partition P depending on n, thus P = Pn , amongst all homogeneous partitions of the space, i.e. partitions such that all cells have the same volume, and come from a regular grid of the space. Thus the only free parameter is the number of cells Pn of the partition. An exact yet not explicit oracle algorithm. The minimization of the pseudo-loss (1) does not yield to a closed-form solution in general. However, we can still derive the order of the optimal loss (see [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012, Lemma 2] in the full version of the paper for an example of minimax yet non adaptive oracle � algorithm given in closed-form solution): � � −β � � � −α� � � Lemma 1 In the case when Vµp f (X) = Ω Pn and Rp σ 2 (x)µp (dx) = Ω Pn , then an � optimal allocation and partitioning strategy An satisﬁes that� � � � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � , L − Vµp f (X) � as soon as there exists, for such range of Pn , a constant L such that � � � � � Pn � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � = n. L − Vµp f (X) p=1 1 � Pn = Ω(n max(1+α� −β� ,1) ) and def � Tp,n = The pseudo-loss of such an algorithm A� , optimal amongst the allocations strategies that use the n � partition Pn in Pn regions, is then given by � � � � def max(1 − β , 1 − α ) − 1. where γ = Ln (A� ) = Ω nγ n max(1 + α� − β � , 1) The condition involving the constant L is here to ensure that the partition is not degenerate. It is morally satisﬁed as soon as the variance of f and the noise are bounded and n is large enough. This Lemma applies to the important class W 1,2 (R) of functions that admit a weak derivative that o belongs to L2 (R). Indeed these functions are H¨ lder with coefﬁcient α = 1/2, i.e. we have o W 1,2 (R) ⊂ C 0,1/2 (R). The standard Brownian motion is an example of function that is 1/2-H¨ lder. More generally, for k = d + α with α = 1/2 when d is odd and α = 1 when d is even, we have the 2 inclusion W k,2 (Rd ) ⊂ C 0,α (Rd ) , where W k,2 (Rd ) is the set of functions that admit a k th weak derivative belonging to L2 (Rd ). Thus the previous Lemma applies to sufﬁciently smooth functions with smoothness linearly increasing with the dimension d of the input space X . Important remark Note that this Lemma gives us a choice of the partition that is minimax-optimal, and an allocation strategy on that partition that is not only minimax-optimal but also adaptive to the function f itself. Thus it provides a way to decide in a minimax way what is the good number of regions, and then to provide the best oracle way to allocate the budget. We can deduce the following immediate corollary on the class of α−H¨ lder functions observed in a o non-negligible noise of bounded variance (i.e. in the setting β � = 0 and α� = 2α ). d Corollary 1 Consider that f is α−H¨ lder and the noise is of bounded variance. Then a minimaxo d � d+2α ) and an optimal allocation achieves the rate L (A� ) = optimal partition satisﬁes Pn = Ω(n n n � −2α � Ω n d+2α . Moreover, the strategy of Lemma 1 is optimal amongst the allocations strategies that � use the partition Pn in Pn regions. � −2α � The rate Ω n d+2α is minimax-optimal on the class of α−H¨ lder functions (see Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], o o Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980]), and it is thus interesting to consider an initial numd � � d+2α ). After having built the partition, if the quantities ber �� � 2 �� � � of�regions Pn that is of order Pn = Ω(n Vµp f p≤P and Eµp σ p≤P are known to the learner, it is optimal, in the aim of minimizing � the pseudo-loss, to allocate to each region the number of samples Tp,n provided in Lemma 1. Our objective in this paper is, after having chosen beforehand a minimax-optimal partition, to allocate 4 the samples properly in the regions, without having any access to those quantities. It is then �� � � necessary to balance between exploration, i.e. allocating the samples in order to estimate Vµp f p≤P � � �� and Eµp σ 2 p≤P , and exploitation, i.e. use the estimates to target the optimal allocation. 3 Online algorithms for allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation In this section, we now turn to the design of algorithms that are fully online, with the goal to be competitive against the kind of oracle algorithms considered in Section 2.2. We now assume that the space X = [0, 1]d is divided in Pn hyper-cubic regions of same measure (the Lebesgue measure on 1 [0, 1]d ) vp = v = Pn . The goal of an algorithm is to minimize the quadratic error of approximation of f by a constant over each cell, in expectation, which we write as � � � � � � 2 λ(dx) ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = max E , max E (f (x) − fn (f (x) − mp,n ) ˆ 1≤p≤Pn 1≤p≤Pn λ(Rp ) λ(Rp ) Rp Rp ˆ where fn is the histogram estimate of the function f on the partition P and mp,n is the empirical ˆ mean deﬁned on region Rp with the samples (Xi , Yi ) such that Xi ∈ Rp . To do so, an algorithm is only allowed to specify at each time step t, the next point Xt where to sample, based on all the past samples {(Xs , Ys )}s < ∞ satisﬁes that λ2 σ 2 (x) , ∀λ ∈ R+ log E exp[λ noise(x)] ≤ 2 and we further assume that it satisﬁes the following slightly stronger second property (that is for instance exactly veriﬁed for a Gaussian variable, looking at the moment generating function): � � � � 1 λ2 σ 2 (x) ∀λ, γ ∈ R+ log E exp λnoise(x) + γnoise(x)2 ≤ − log 1 − 2γσ 2 (x) . 2(1 − 2γσ 2 (x)) 2 5 The function f is assumed to be (L, α)-H¨ lder, meaning that it satiﬁes o � ∀x, x ∈ X f (x) − f (x� ) ≤ L||x − x� ||α . Similarly, the function σ 2 is assumed to be (M, β)-H¨ lder i.e. it satisﬁes o � 2 2 � ∀x, x ∈ X σ (x) − σ (x ) ≤ M ||x − x� ||β . We assume that Y is a convex and compact subset of R, thus w.l.g. that it is [0, 1], and that it is known that ||σ 2 ||∞ , which is thus ﬁnite, is bounded by the constant 1. 3.2 Empirical estimation of the quadratic approximation error on each cell We deﬁne the sampling distribution µp in the region Rp for each p ∈ {1, . . . , Pn } as a quasi-uniform ˜ sampling scheme using the uniform distribution over the sub-regions. More precisely at time t ≤ n, if we decide to sample in the region Rp according to µp , we sample uniformly in each sub-region ˜ one sample, resulting in a new batch of samples {(Xt,k , Yt,k )}1≤k≤K , where Xt,k ∼ µp,k . Note that due to this sampling process, the number of points Tp,t sampled in sub-region Rp at time t is always Tp,t a multiple of K and that moreover for all k, k � ∈ {1, . . . , K} we have that Tp,k,t = Tp,k� ,t = K . Now this speciﬁc sampling is used in order to be able to estimate the variances Vµp f and Eµp σ 2 , � so that the best proportions Tp,n can be computed as accurately as possible. Indeed, as explained in � � � � Lemma 1, we have that Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � def � � . Tp,n = L − Vµp f (X) ˆ Variance estimation We now introduce two estimators. The ﬁrst estimator is written Vp,t and is def ˆ built in the following way. First,let us introduce the empirical estimate fp,k,t of the mean fp,k = � � Eµp,k f (X) of f in sub-region Rp,k . Similarly, to avoid some cumbersome notations, we introduce � � � � � � def def def 2 fp = Eµp f (X) and vp,k = Vµp,k f (X) for the function f , and then σp,k = Eµp,k σ 2 (X) for the variance of the noise σ 2 . We now deﬁne the empirical variance estimator to be K 1 � ˆ ˆ (fp,k,t − mp,t )2 , ˆ Vp,t = K −1 k=1 that is a biased estimator. Indeed, for a deterministic Tp,t , it is not difﬁcult to show that we have � K K � � � � � � �� � � � � 2 1 �� 1 � ˆ E Vp,t + Eµp,k f − Eµp f = Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 . K −1 Tp,t k=1 k=1 � � The leading term in this decomposition, that is given by the ﬁrst sum, is closed to Vµp f since, by using the assumption that f is (L, α)−H¨ lder, we have the following inequality o � � K � �� �� � �1 � � � � 2 2L2 dα � Eµp,k f − Eµp f − Vµp f (X) � ≤ , � �K (KPn )2α/d k=1 where we also used that the diameter of a sub-region Rp,k is given by diam(Rp,k ) = d1/2 . (KPn )1/d ˆ Then, the second term also contributes to the bias, essentially due to the fact that V[fp,k,t ] = � � � � 2 def def 1 1 2 2 2 Tp,k,t (vp,k + σp,k ) and not Tp,t (vk + σk ) (with vp = Vµp f (X) and σp = Eµp σ (X) ). ˆ p,k,t In order to correct this term, we now introduce the second estimator σ 2 that estimates the variance � � � � � � of the outputs in a region Rp,k , i.e. Vµp,k ,ν Y (X) = Vµp,k f (X) + Eµp,k σ 2 . It is deﬁned as �2 t t �� 1 1 � def ˆ p,k,t = Yi − Yj I{Xj ∈ Rp,k } I{Xi ∈ Rp,k } . σ2 Tp,k,t − 1 i=1 Tp,k,t j=1 Now, we combine the two previous estimators to form the following estimator K 1 �� 1 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ ˆ σ − . Qp,t = Vp,t − K Tp,k,t Tp,t p,k,t k=1 ˆ The following proposition provides a high-probability bound on the difference between Qp,t and the quantity we want to estimate. We report the detailed proof in [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012]. 6 ˆ Proposition 1 By the assumption that f is (L, α)-H¨ lder, the bias of the estimator Qp,t , and for o deterministic Tp,t , is given by � K � � � � � � � � � 2 1 � 2L2 dα ˆ − Vµp f (X) ≤ . Eµp,k f − Eµp f E Qp,t − Qp (Tp,t ) = K (KPn )2α/d k=1 Moreover, it satisﬁes that for all δ ∈ [0, 1], there exists an event of probability higher than 1 − δ such that on this event, we have � � � � � � K K � � � � 8 log(4/δ) � σ 2 �1 � � � � ˆ p,k,t 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ � Qp,t − E Qp,t � ≤ � √ +o σ p,k . � � (K − 1)2 T2 T K K k=1 p,k,t p,k,t k=1 We also state the following Lemma that we are going to use in the analysis, and that takes into account randomness of the stopping times Tp,k,t . Lemma 2 Let {Xp,k,u }p≤P, k≤K, u≤n be samples potentially sampled in region Rp,k . We introduce qp,u to be the�equivalent of Qp (Tp,t ) with explicitly ﬁxed value of Tp,t = u. Let also qp,u be the ˆ � ˆ p,t but computed with the ﬁrst u samples in estimate of E qp,u , that is to say the equivalent of Q each region Rp,k (i.e. Tp,t = u). Let us deﬁne the event � � � � � � � AK log(4nP/δ)V � � ˆp,t 2L2 dα � � ξn,P,K (δ) = + ω : � qp,u (ω) − E qp,u � ≤ ˆ , u K −1 (KPn )2α/d p≤P u≤n �K 1 ˆ ˆ ˆ p,k,t and where A ≤ 4 is a numerical constant. Then it where Vp,t = Vp (Tp,t ) = K−1 k=1 σ 2 holds that � � P ξn,P,K (δ) ≥ 1 − δ . Note that, with the notations of this Lemma, Proposition 1 above is thus about qp,u . ˆ 3.3 The Online allocation and homogeneous partitioning algorithm for piecewise constant mean-approximation (OAHPA-pcma) We are now ready to state the algorithm that we propose for minimizing the quadratic error of approximation of f . The algorithm is described in Figure 1. Although it looks similar, this algorithm is ˆ quite different from a normal UCB algorithm since Qp,t decreases in expectation with Tp,t . Indeed, � � � � � �� �K � 1 its expectation is close to Vµp f + KTp,t k=1 Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 .

We remind that the objective is to minimize for an algorithm A the pseudo-loss Ln (A). Theorem 1 (Main result) Let γ = � maxp Tp,n � minp Tp,n be the distortion factor of the optimal allocation stratdef d d egy, and let � > 0. Then with the choice of the number of regions Pn = n 2α+d �2+ 2α , and of the 2d d def def 8L2 α number of sub-regions K = C 4α+d �−2− α , where C = Ad1−α then the pseudo-loss of the OAHPApcma algorithm satisﬁes, under the assumptions of Section 3.1 and on an event of probability higher than 1 − δ, � � � � � 2α 1 + �γC � log(1/δ) Ln (A� ) + o n− 2α+d , Ln (A) ≤ n for some numerical constant C � not depending on n, where A� is the oracle of Lemma 1. n 7 Minimax-optimal partitioning and �-adaptive performance Theorem 1 provides a high probability bound on the performance of the OAHPA-pcma allocation strategy. It shows that this performance is competitive with that of an optimal (i.e. adaptive to the function f , see Lemma 1) allocation d A� on a partition with a number of cells Pn chosen to be of minimax order n 2α+d for the class of 2α α-H¨ lder functions. In particular, since Ln (A� ) = O(n d+2α ) on that class, we recover the same o n minimax order as what is obtained in the batch learning setting, when using for instance wavelets, or Kernel estimates (see e.g. Stone [1980], Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981]). But moreover, due to the adaptivity of A� to the function itself, this procedure is also �-adaptive to the function and not n only minimax-optimal on the class, on that partition (see Section 2.2). Naturally, the performance of the method increases, in the same way than for any classical functional estimation method, when the smoothness of the function increases. Similarly, in agreement with the classical curse of dimension, the higher the dimension of the domain, the less efﬁcient the method. Limitations In this work, we assume that the smoothness α of the function is available to the learner, which enables her to calibrate Pn properly. Now it makes sense to combine the OAHPApcma procedure with existing methods that enable to estimate this smoothness online (under a slightly stronger assumption than H¨ lder, such as H¨ lder functions that attain their exponents, o o see Gin´ and Nickl [2010]). It is thus interesting, when no preliminary knowledge on the smoothness e of f is available, to spend some of the initial budget in order to estimate α. We have seen that the OAHPA-pcma procedure, although very simple, manages to get minimax optimal results. Now the downside of the simplicity of the OAHPA-pcma strategy is two-fold. � The ﬁrst limitation is that the factor (1 + �γC � log(1/δ)) = (1 + O(�)) appearing in the bound before Ln (A� ) is not 1, but higher than 1. Of course it is generally difﬁcult to get a constant 1 in the batch setting (see Arlot [2007]), and similarly this is a difﬁcult task in our online setting too: If � is chosen to be small, then the error with respect to the optimal allocation is small. However, since Pn is expressed as an increasing function of �, this implies that the minimax bound on the loss for partition P increases also with �. That said, in the view of the work on active learning multi-armed bandit that we extend, we would still prefer to get the optimal constant 1. The second limitation is more problematic: since K is chosen irrespective of the region Rp , this causes the presence of the factor γ. Thus the algorithm will essentially no longer enjoy near-optimal performance guarantees when the optimal allocation strategy is highly not homogeneous. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we considered online regression with histograms in an active setting (we select in which bean to sample), and when we can choose the histogram in a class of homogeneous histograms. Since the (unknown) noise is heteroscedastic and we compete not only with the minimax allocation oracle on α-H¨ lder functions but with the adaptive oracle o that uses a minimax optimal histogram and allocates samples adaptively to the target function, this is an extremely challenging (and very practical) setting. Our contribution can be seen as a non trivial extension of the setting of active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm corresponds to one continuous region of a sampling space, as opposed to a singleton, which can also be seen as a problem of non parametric function approximation. This new setting offers interesting challenges: We provided a simple procedure, based on the computation of upper conﬁdence bounds of the estimation of the local quadratic error of approximation, and provided a performance analysis that shows that OAHPA-pcma is ﬁrst order �-optimal with respect to the function, for a partition chosen to be minimax-optimal on the class of α-H¨ lder functions. However, this simplicity also o has a drawback if one is interested in building exactly ﬁrst order optimal procedure, and going beyond these limitations is deﬁnitely not trivial: A more optimal but much more complex algorithm would indeed need to tune a different factor Kp in each cell in an online way, i.e. deﬁne some Kp,t that evolves with time, and redeﬁne sub-regions accordingly. Now, the analysis of the OAHPA-pcma already makes use of powerful tools such as empirical-Bernstein bounds for variance estimation (and not only for mean estimation), which make it non trivial; in order to handle possibly evolving subregions and deal with the progressive reﬁnement of the regions, we would need even more intricate analysis, due to the fact that we are online and active. This interesting next step is postponed to future work.

</p><p>2 We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a ﬁnite partition P of a continuous sampling space X ⊂ Rd . [sent-8, score-0.286]
</p><p>3 Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is ﬁxed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. [sent-9, score-0.54]
</p><p>4 Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper conﬁdence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order on the class of α−H¨ lder functions. [sent-10, score-0.339]
</p><p>5 These samples are collected sequentially, and our aim is to design an adaptive procedure that selects wisely where on the domain to query the function, according to the information provided by the previous samples. [sent-15, score-0.107]
</p><p>6 More formally: Observed process We consider an unknown Y-valued process deﬁned on X , written ν : X → M+ (Y), where M+ (Y) refers to the set of all probability measures on Y, such that for all x ∈ X , 1 1 def  the random variable Y (x) ∼ ν(x) has mean f (x) = E[Y (x)|x] ∈ R. [sent-16, score-0.29]
</p><p>7 We write for convenience the model in the following way Y (x) = f (x) + noise(x) , def  where noise(x) = Y (x) − E[Y (x)|x] is the centered random variable corresponding to the noise, o with unknown variance σ 2 (x). [sent-17, score-0.341]
</p><p>8 Partition We consider we can deﬁne a partition P of the input space X , with ﬁnitely many P regions {Rp }1≤p≤P that are assumed to be convex and not degenerated, i. [sent-19, score-0.216]
</p><p>9 such that the interior of each region Rp has positive Lebesgue volume vp . [sent-21, score-0.493]
</p><p>10 Moreover, with each region Rp is associated a sampling distribution in that region, written µp ∈ M+ (Rp ). [sent-22, score-0.243]
</p><p>11 Thus, when we decide to sample in 1 region Rp , a new sample X ∈ Rp is generated according to X ∼ µp . [sent-23, score-0.292]
</p><p>12 We consider that we have a ﬁnite budget of n ∈ N samples that we can use in order to allocate samples as we wish among the regions {Rp }1≤p≤P . [sent-25, score-0.304]
</p><p>13 For illustration, let us assume that we deterministically allocate Tp,n ∈ N samples in region Rp , with the constraint that the allocation {Tp,n }1≤p≤P must some to n. [sent-26, score-0.493]
</p><p>14 In region Rp , we thus sample points {Xp,i }1≤p≤P at random 1  according to the sampling distribution µp , and then get the corresponding values {Yp,i }1≤i≤Tp,n , where Yp,i ∼ ν(Xp,i ). [sent-27, score-0.241]
</p><p>15 In the sequel, the distribution µp is assumed to be the uniform distribution dλ(x)1x∈R  over region Rp , i. [sent-28, score-0.178]
</p><p>16 A natural choice for the estimator ˆ mp,n is to use the empirical mean that is unbiased and asymptotically optimal for this criterion. [sent-34, score-0.098]
</p><p>17 ˆ Thus we consider the following estimate (histogram) ˆ fn (x) =  P � p=1  mp,n I{x ∈ Rp } where mp,n = ˆ ˆ  Tp,n 1 �  Tp,n  Yp,i . [sent-35, score-0.119]
</p><p>18 Note that this is a local measure of performance, as opposed to a more usual yet less challenging global quadratic error. [sent-39, score-0.091]
</p><p>19 Eventually, as the number of �� �2 � ˆ cells tends to ∞, this local measure of performance approaches supx∈X Eν f (x) − fn (x) . [sent-40, score-0.144]
</p><p>20 At  this point, let us also introduce, for convenience, the notation Qp (Tp,n ) that denotes the term inside the max, in order to emphasize the dependency on the quadratic error with the allocation. [sent-41, score-0.064]
</p><p>21 Previous work  There is a huge literature on the topic of functional estimation in batch setting. [sent-42, score-0.072]
</p><p>22 [2002], where piecewise constant meano approximation are also called “partitioning estimate” or “regressogram” (ﬁrst introduced by Tukey [1947]). [sent-44, score-0.171]
</p><p>23 The minimax-optimal rate of approximation on the class of α-H¨ lder functions is known o 2α to be in O(n− 2α+d ) (see e. [sent-45, score-0.343]
</p><p>24 o In such setting, a dataset {(Xi , Yi )}i≤n is given to the learner, and a typical question is thus to try to ﬁnd the best possible histogram in order to minimize a approximation error. [sent-49, score-0.134]
</p><p>25 Thus the dataset is ﬁxed and we typically resort to techniques such as model selection where each model corresponds to one histogram (see Arlot [2007] for an extensive study of such). [sent-50, score-0.069]
</p><p>26 However, we here ask a very different question, that is how to optimally sample in an online setting in order to minimize the approximation error of some histogram. [sent-51, score-0.175]
</p><p>27 Thus we choose the histogram 2  before we see any sample, then it is ﬁxed and we need to decide which cell to sample from at each time step. [sent-52, score-0.207]
</p><p>28 Motivation for this setting comes naturally from some recent works in the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit problem Antos et al. [sent-53, score-0.179]
</p><p>29 Intuitively, we reduce the problem to such bandit problem with ﬁnite set of arms (regions), and our setting answers the question whether it is possible to extend those results to the case when the arms do not correspond to a singleton, but rather to a continuous region. [sent-60, score-0.253]
</p><p>30 We show that the answer is positive, yet non trivial. [sent-61, score-0.104]
</p><p>31 This is non trivial due to the variance estimation in each region: points x in some region may have different means f(x), so that standard estimators for the variance are biased, contrary to the point-wise case and thus ﬁnite-arm techniques may yield disastrous results. [sent-62, score-0.452]
</p><p>32 (Estimating the variance of the distribution in a continuous region actually needs to take into account not only the point-wise noise but also the variation of the function f and the noise level σ 2 in that region. [sent-63, score-0.358]
</p><p>33 Outline Section 2 provides more intuition about the pseudo-loss and a result about the optimal oracle strategy when the domain is partitioned in a minimax-optimal way on the class of α−H¨ lder o functions. [sent-66, score-0.497]
</p><p>34 Section 3 presents our assumptions, that are basically to have a sub-Gaussian noise and smooth mean and variance functions, then our estimator of the pseudo-loss together with its concentration properties, before introducing our sampling procedure, called OAHPA-pcma.

</p><p>36 More precisely, let xp be the mean of X ∼ µp and let us look at the limit of Vµp (f (X)) when vp goes to 0. [sent-71, score-0.588]
</p><p>37 Assuming that f is differentiable, we get �2 � �� lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim Eµp f (X) − f (xp ) − E[f (X) − f (xp )] vp →0  vp →0  = = =  lim Eµp  ��  �X − xp , ∇f (xp )� − E[�X − xp , ∇f (xp )�] vp →0 � � lim Eµp �X − xp , ∇f (xp )�2 vp →0 � � lim ∇f (xp )T Eµp (X − xp )(X − xp )T ∇f (xp ) .

</p><p>42 We now assume that we are allowed to choose the partition P depending on n, thus P = Pn , amongst all homogeneous partitions of the space, i. [sent-83, score-0.246]
</p><p>43 partitions such that all cells have the same volume, and come from a regular grid of the space. [sent-85, score-0.051]

</p><p>46 where γ = Ln (A� ) = Ω nγ n max(1 + α� − β � , 1)  The condition involving the constant L is here to ensure that the partition is not degenerate. [sent-91, score-0.155]
</p><p>47 It is morally satisﬁed as soon as the variance of f and the noise are bounded and n is large enough. [sent-92, score-0.145]
</p><p>48 This Lemma applies to the important class W 1,2 (R) of functions that admit a weak derivative that o belongs to L2 (R). [sent-93, score-0.055]
</p><p>49 Indeed these functions are H¨ lder with coefﬁcient α = 1/2, i. [sent-94, score-0.276]
</p><p>50 Thus the previous Lemma applies to sufﬁciently smooth functions with smoothness linearly increasing with the dimension d of the input space X . [sent-99, score-0.052]
</p><p>51 Important remark Note that this Lemma gives us a choice of the partition that is minimax-optimal, and an allocation strategy on that partition that is not only minimax-optimal but also adaptive to the function f itself. [sent-100, score-0.489]
</p><p>52 Thus it provides a way to decide in a minimax way what is the good number of regions, and then to provide the best oracle way to allocate the budget. [sent-101, score-0.401]
</p><p>53 We can deduce the following immediate corollary on the class of α−H¨ lder functions observed in a o non-negligible noise of bounded variance (i. [sent-102, score-0.454]

[sent-117, score-0.58]
</p><p>62 We now assume that the space X = [0, 1]d is divided in Pn hyper-cubic regions of same measure (the Lebesgue measure on 1 [0, 1]d ) vp = v = Pn . [sent-119, score-0.416]

</p><p>65 More precisely at time t ≤ n, if we decide to sample in the region Rp according to µp , we sample uniformly in each sub-region ˜ one sample, resulting in a new batch of samples {(Xt,k , Yt,k )}1≤k≤K , where Xt,k ∼ µp,k . [sent-135, score-0.373]
</p><p>66 Now this speciﬁc sampling is used in order to be able to estimate the variances Vµp f and Eµp σ 2 , � so that the best proportions Tp,n can be computed as accurately as possible. [sent-140, score-0.062]

</p><p>70 We now deﬁne the empirical variance estimator to be K 1 � ˆ ˆ (fp,k,t − mp,t )2 , ˆ Vp,t = K −1 k=1  that is a biased estimator. [sent-146, score-0.113]

</p><p>72 ˆ p,k,t In order to correct this term, we now introduce the second estimator σ 2 that estimates the variance � � � � � � of the outputs in a region Rp,k , i. [sent-150, score-0.291]

</p><p>87 In particular, since Ln (A� ) = O(n d+2α ) on that class, we recover the same o n minimax order as what is obtained in the batch learning setting, when using for instance wavelets, or Kernel estimates (see e. [sent-188, score-0.129]
</p><p>88 But moreover, due to the adaptivity of A� to the function itself, this procedure is also �-adaptive to the function and not n only minimax-optimal on the class, on that partition (see Section 2. [sent-191, score-0.14]
</p><p>89 Naturally, the performance of the method increases, in the same way than for any classical functional estimation method, when the smoothness of the function increases. [sent-193, score-0.113]
</p><p>90 Limitations In this work, we assume that the smoothness α of the function is available to the learner, which enables her to calibrate Pn properly. [sent-195, score-0.052]
</p><p>91 Now it makes sense to combine the OAHPApcma procedure with existing methods that enable to estimate this smoothness online (under a slightly stronger assumption than H¨ lder, such as H¨ lder functions that attain their exponents, o o see Gin´ and Nickl [2010]). [sent-196, score-0.434]
</p><p>92 It is thus interesting, when no preliminary knowledge on the smoothness e of f is available, to spend some of the initial budget in order to estimate α. [sent-197, score-0.103]
</p><p>93 We have seen that the OAHPA-pcma procedure, although very simple, manages to get minimax optimal results. [sent-198, score-0.135]
</p><p>94 Of course it is generally difﬁcult to get a constant 1 in the batch setting (see Arlot [2007]), and similarly this is a difﬁcult task in our online setting too: If � is chosen to be small, then the error with respect to the optimal allocation is small. [sent-201, score-0.41]
</p><p>95 However, since Pn is expressed as an increasing function of �, this implies that the minimax bound on the loss for partition P increases also with �. [sent-202, score-0.209]
</p><p>96 That said, in the view of the work on active learning multi-armed bandit that we extend, we would still prefer to get the optimal constant 1. [sent-203, score-0.204]
</p><p>97 The second limitation is more problematic: since K is chosen irrespective of the region Rp , this causes the presence of the factor γ. [sent-204, score-0.178]
</p><p>98 Thus the algorithm will essentially no longer enjoy near-optimal performance guarantees when the optimal allocation strategy is highly not homogeneous. [sent-205, score-0.264]

<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: In the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal of a learner is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of arms, recent results show that it is possible to derive strategies based on ﬁnite-time conﬁdence bounds that are competitive with the best possible strategy. We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a ﬁnite partition P of a continuous sampling space X ⊂ Rd . Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is ﬁxed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper conﬁdence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order on the class of α−H¨ lder functions. o 1 Setting and Previous work Let us consider some space X ⊂ Rd , and Y ⊂ R. We call X the input space or sampling space, Y the output space or value space. We consider the problem of estimating with uniform precision the function f : X ⊂ Rd → Y ⊂ R. We assume that we can query n times the function f , anywhere in the domain, and observe noisy samples of this function. These samples are collected sequentially, and our aim is to design an adaptive procedure that selects wisely where on the domain to query the function, according to the information provided by the previous samples. More formally: Observed process We consider an unknown Y-valued process deﬁned on X , written ν : X → M+ (Y), where M+ (Y) refers to the set of all probability measures on Y, such that for all x ∈ X , 1 1 def the random variable Y (x) ∼ ν(x) has mean f (x) = E[Y (x)|x] ∈ R. We write for convenience the model in the following way Y (x) = f (x) + noise(x) , def where noise(x) = Y (x) − E[Y (x)|x] is the centered random variable corresponding to the noise, o with unknown variance σ 2 (x). We assume throughout this paper that f is α-H¨ lder. Partition We consider we can deﬁne a partition P of the input space X , with ﬁnitely many P regions {Rp }1≤p≤P that are assumed to be convex and not degenerated, i.e. such that the interior of each region Rp has positive Lebesgue volume vp . Moreover, with each region Rp is associated a sampling distribution in that region, written µp ∈ M+ (Rp ). Thus, when we decide to sample in 1 region Rp , a new sample X ∈ Rp is generated according to X ∼ µp . Allocation. We consider that we have a ﬁnite budget of n ∈ N samples that we can use in order to allocate samples as we wish among the regions {Rp }1≤p≤P . For illustration, let us assume that we deterministically allocate Tp,n ∈ N samples in region Rp , with the constraint that the allocation {Tp,n }1≤p≤P must some to n. In region Rp , we thus sample points {Xp,i }1≤p≤P at random 1 according to the sampling distribution µp , and then get the corresponding values {Yp,i }1≤i≤Tp,n , where Yp,i ∼ ν(Xp,i ). In the sequel, the distribution µp is assumed to be the uniform distribution dλ(x)1x∈R over region Rp , i.e. the density of µp is λ(Rp ) p where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Note that this is not restrictive since we are in an active, not passive setting. Piecewise constant mean-approximation. We use the collected samples in order to build a pieceˆ wise constant approximation fn of the mean f , and measure the accuracy of approximation on a region Rp with the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error, namely � � � � � ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = Eµ ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 , ˆ (f (x) − fn E p λ(Rp ) Rp ˆ where mp,n is the constant value that takes fn on the region Rp . A natural choice for the estimator ˆ mp,n is to use the empirical mean that is unbiased and asymptotically optimal for this criterion. ˆ Thus we consider the following estimate (histogram) ˆ fn (x) = P � p=1 mp,n I{x ∈ Rp } where mp,n = ˆ ˆ Tp,n 1 � Tp,n Yp,i . i=1 Pseudo loss Note that, since the Tp,n are deterministic, the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error of this estimator can be written in the following form � � � � � � ˆ Eµp ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 ˆ = Eµp ,ν (f (X) − Eµp [f (X)])2 + Eµp ,ν (Eµp [f (X)] − mp,n )2 � � � � = Vµp f (X) + Vµp ,ν mp,n ˆ � � � � 1 Vµp ,ν Y (X) . = Vµp f (X) + Tp,n Now, using the following immediate decomposition � � � � � Vµp ,ν Y (X) = Vµp f (X) + σ 2 (x)µp (dx) , Rp we deduce that the maximal expected quadratic norm of the approximation error over the regions def {Rp }1≤p≤P , that depends on the choice of the considered allocation strategy A = {Tp,n }1≤p≤P is thus given by the following so-called pseudo-loss � � � � � � Tp,n + 1 1 def 2 (1) Vµp f (X) + Eµ σ (X) . Ln (A) = max 1≤ p ≤P Tp,n Tp,n p Our goal is to minimize this pseudo-loss. Note that this is a local measure of performance, as opposed to a more usual yet less challenging global quadratic error. Eventually, as the number of �� �2 � ˆ cells tends to ∞, this local measure of performance approaches supx∈X Eν f (x) − fn (x) . At this point, let us also introduce, for convenience, the notation Qp (Tp,n ) that denotes the term inside the max, in order to emphasize the dependency on the quadratic error with the allocation. Previous work There is a huge literature on the topic of functional estimation in batch setting. Since it is a rather old and well studied question in statistics, many books have been written on this topic, such as Bosq and Lecoutre [1987], Rosenblatt [1991], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], where piecewise constant meano approximation are also called “partitioning estimate” or “regressogram” (ﬁrst introduced by Tukey [1947]). The minimax-optimal rate of approximation on the class of α-H¨ lder functions is known o 2α to be in O(n− 2α+d ) (see e.g. Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002]). o In such setting, a dataset {(Xi , Yi )}i≤n is given to the learner, and a typical question is thus to try to ﬁnd the best possible histogram in order to minimize a approximation error. Thus the dataset is ﬁxed and we typically resort to techniques such as model selection where each model corresponds to one histogram (see Arlot [2007] for an extensive study of such). However, we here ask a very different question, that is how to optimally sample in an online setting in order to minimize the approximation error of some histogram. Thus we choose the histogram 2 before we see any sample, then it is ﬁxed and we need to decide which cell to sample from at each time step. Motivation for this setting comes naturally from some recent works in the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit problem Antos et al. [2010], Carpentier et al. [2011]. In these works, the objective is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of distributions (arms), which would correspond to the special case when X = {1, . . . , P } is a ﬁnite set in our setting. Intuitively, we reduce the problem to such bandit problem with ﬁnite set of arms (regions), and our setting answers the question whether it is possible to extend those results to the case when the arms do not correspond to a singleton, but rather to a continuous region. We show that the answer is positive, yet non trivial. This is non trivial due to the variance estimation in each region: points x in some region may have different means f(x), so that standard estimators for the variance are biased, contrary to the point-wise case and thus ﬁnite-arm techniques may yield disastrous results. (Estimating the variance of the distribution in a continuous region actually needs to take into account not only the point-wise noise but also the variation of the function f and the noise level σ 2 in that region.) We describe a way, inspired from quasi Monte-Carlo techniques, to correct this bias so that we can handle the additional error. Also, it is worth mentioning that this setting can be informally linked to a notion of curiosity-driven learning (see Schmidhuber [2010], Baranes and Oudeyer [2009]), since we want to decide in which region of the space to sample, without explicit reward but optimizing the goal to understand the unknown environment. Outline Section 2 provides more intuition about the pseudo-loss and a result about the optimal oracle strategy when the domain is partitioned in a minimax-optimal way on the class of α−H¨ lder o functions. Section 3 presents our assumptions, that are basically to have a sub-Gaussian noise and smooth mean and variance functions, then our estimator of the pseudo-loss together with its concentration properties, before introducing our sampling procedure, called OAHPA-pcma. Finally, the performance of this procedure is provided and discussed in Section 4. 2 The pseudo-loss: study and optimal strategies 2.1 More intuition on each term in the pseudo-loss It is natural to look at what happens to each of the two terms that appear in equation 1 when one makes Rp shrink towards a point. More precisely, let xp be the mean of X ∼ µp and let us look at the limit of Vµp (f (X)) when vp goes to 0. Assuming that f is differentiable, we get �2 � �� lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim Eµp f (X) − f (xp ) − E[f (X) − f (xp )] vp →0 vp →0 = = = lim Eµp �� �X − xp , ∇f (xp )� − E[�X − xp , ∇f (xp )�] vp →0 � � lim Eµp �X − xp , ∇f (xp )�2 vp →0 � � lim ∇f (xp )T Eµp (X − xp )(X − xp )T ∇f (xp ) . �2 � vp →0 Therefore, if we introduce Σp to be the covariance matrix of the random variable X ∼ µp , then we simply have lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim ||∇f (xp )||2 p . Σ vp →0 vp →0 Example with hyper-cubic regions An important example is when Rp is a hypercube with side 1/d length vp and µp is the uniform distribution over the region Rp . In that case (see Lemma 1), we dx have µp (dx) = , and 2/d vp vp . ||∇f (xp )||2 p = ||∇f (xp )||2 Σ 12 More generally, when f is α−differentiable, i.e. that ∀a ∈ X , ∃∇α f (a, ·) ∈ Sd (0, 1)R such that ∀x ∈ Sd (0, 1), limh→0 f (a+hx)−f (a) = ∇α f (a, x), then it is not too difﬁcult to show that for such hα hyper-cubic regions, we have � � � 2α � Vµp f (X) = O vpd sup |∇α f (xp , u)|2 . S(0,1) � � On the other hand, by direct computation, the second term is such that limvp →0 Eµp σ 2 (X) = � � � � σ 2 (xp ). Thus, while Vµp f (X) vanishes, Eµp σ 2 (X) stays bounded away from 0 (unless ν is deterministic). 3 2.2 Oracle allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation. We now assume that we are allowed to choose the partition P depending on n, thus P = Pn , amongst all homogeneous partitions of the space, i.e. partitions such that all cells have the same volume, and come from a regular grid of the space. Thus the only free parameter is the number of cells Pn of the partition. An exact yet not explicit oracle algorithm. The minimization of the pseudo-loss (1) does not yield to a closed-form solution in general. However, we can still derive the order of the optimal loss (see [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012, Lemma 2] in the full version of the paper for an example of minimax yet non adaptive oracle � algorithm given in closed-form solution): � � −β � � � −α� � � Lemma 1 In the case when Vµp f (X) = Ω Pn and Rp σ 2 (x)µp (dx) = Ω Pn , then an � optimal allocation and partitioning strategy An satisﬁes that� � � � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � , L − Vµp f (X) � as soon as there exists, for such range of Pn , a constant L such that � � � � � Pn � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � = n. L − Vµp f (X) p=1 1 � Pn = Ω(n max(1+α� −β� ,1) ) and def � Tp,n = The pseudo-loss of such an algorithm A� , optimal amongst the allocations strategies that use the n � partition Pn in Pn regions, is then given by � � � � def max(1 − β , 1 − α ) − 1. where γ = Ln (A� ) = Ω nγ n max(1 + α� − β � , 1) The condition involving the constant L is here to ensure that the partition is not degenerate. It is morally satisﬁed as soon as the variance of f and the noise are bounded and n is large enough. This Lemma applies to the important class W 1,2 (R) of functions that admit a weak derivative that o belongs to L2 (R). Indeed these functions are H¨ lder with coefﬁcient α = 1/2, i.e. we have o W 1,2 (R) ⊂ C 0,1/2 (R). The standard Brownian motion is an example of function that is 1/2-H¨ lder. More generally, for k = d + α with α = 1/2 when d is odd and α = 1 when d is even, we have the 2 inclusion W k,2 (Rd ) ⊂ C 0,α (Rd ) , where W k,2 (Rd ) is the set of functions that admit a k th weak derivative belonging to L2 (Rd ). Thus the previous Lemma applies to sufﬁciently smooth functions with smoothness linearly increasing with the dimension d of the input space X . Important remark Note that this Lemma gives us a choice of the partition that is minimax-optimal, and an allocation strategy on that partition that is not only minimax-optimal but also adaptive to the function f itself. Thus it provides a way to decide in a minimax way what is the good number of regions, and then to provide the best oracle way to allocate the budget. We can deduce the following immediate corollary on the class of α−H¨ lder functions observed in a o non-negligible noise of bounded variance (i.e. in the setting β � = 0 and α� = 2α ). d Corollary 1 Consider that f is α−H¨ lder and the noise is of bounded variance. Then a minimaxo d � d+2α ) and an optimal allocation achieves the rate L (A� ) = optimal partition satisﬁes Pn = Ω(n n n � −2α � Ω n d+2α . Moreover, the strategy of Lemma 1 is optimal amongst the allocations strategies that � use the partition Pn in Pn regions. � −2α � The rate Ω n d+2α is minimax-optimal on the class of α−H¨ lder functions (see Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], o o Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980]), and it is thus interesting to consider an initial numd � � d+2α ). After having built the partition, if the quantities ber �� � 2 �� � � of�regions Pn that is of order Pn = Ω(n Vµp f p≤P and Eµp σ p≤P are known to the learner, it is optimal, in the aim of minimizing � the pseudo-loss, to allocate to each region the number of samples Tp,n provided in Lemma 1. Our objective in this paper is, after having chosen beforehand a minimax-optimal partition, to allocate 4 the samples properly in the regions, without having any access to those quantities. It is then �� � � necessary to balance between exploration, i.e. allocating the samples in order to estimate Vµp f p≤P � � �� and Eµp σ 2 p≤P , and exploitation, i.e. use the estimates to target the optimal allocation. 3 Online algorithms for allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation In this section, we now turn to the design of algorithms that are fully online, with the goal to be competitive against the kind of oracle algorithms considered in Section 2.2. We now assume that the space X = [0, 1]d is divided in Pn hyper-cubic regions of same measure (the Lebesgue measure on 1 [0, 1]d ) vp = v = Pn . The goal of an algorithm is to minimize the quadratic error of approximation of f by a constant over each cell, in expectation, which we write as � � � � � � 2 λ(dx) ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = max E , max E (f (x) − fn (f (x) − mp,n ) ˆ 1≤p≤Pn 1≤p≤Pn λ(Rp ) λ(Rp ) Rp Rp ˆ where fn is the histogram estimate of the function f on the partition P and mp,n is the empirical ˆ mean deﬁned on region Rp with the samples (Xi , Yi ) such that Xi ∈ Rp . To do so, an algorithm is only allowed to specify at each time step t, the next point Xt where to sample, based on all the past samples {(Xs , Ys )}s < ∞ satisﬁes that λ2 σ 2 (x) , ∀λ ∈ R+ log E exp[λ noise(x)] ≤ 2 and we further assume that it satisﬁes the following slightly stronger second property (that is for instance exactly veriﬁed for a Gaussian variable, looking at the moment generating function): � � � � 1 λ2 σ 2 (x) ∀λ, γ ∈ R+ log E exp λnoise(x) + γnoise(x)2 ≤ − log 1 − 2γσ 2 (x) . 2(1 − 2γσ 2 (x)) 2 5 The function f is assumed to be (L, α)-H¨ lder, meaning that it satiﬁes o � ∀x, x ∈ X f (x) − f (x� ) ≤ L||x − x� ||α . Similarly, the function σ 2 is assumed to be (M, β)-H¨ lder i.e. it satisﬁes o � 2 2 � ∀x, x ∈ X σ (x) − σ (x ) ≤ M ||x − x� ||β . We assume that Y is a convex and compact subset of R, thus w.l.g. that it is [0, 1], and that it is known that ||σ 2 ||∞ , which is thus ﬁnite, is bounded by the constant 1. 3.2 Empirical estimation of the quadratic approximation error on each cell We deﬁne the sampling distribution µp in the region Rp for each p ∈ {1, . . . , Pn } as a quasi-uniform ˜ sampling scheme using the uniform distribution over the sub-regions. More precisely at time t ≤ n, if we decide to sample in the region Rp according to µp , we sample uniformly in each sub-region ˜ one sample, resulting in a new batch of samples {(Xt,k , Yt,k )}1≤k≤K , where Xt,k ∼ µp,k . Note that due to this sampling process, the number of points Tp,t sampled in sub-region Rp at time t is always Tp,t a multiple of K and that moreover for all k, k � ∈ {1, . . . , K} we have that Tp,k,t = Tp,k� ,t = K . Now this speciﬁc sampling is used in order to be able to estimate the variances Vµp f and Eµp σ 2 , � so that the best proportions Tp,n can be computed as accurately as possible. Indeed, as explained in � � � � Lemma 1, we have that Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � def � � . Tp,n = L − Vµp f (X) ˆ Variance estimation We now introduce two estimators. The ﬁrst estimator is written Vp,t and is def ˆ built in the following way. First,let us introduce the empirical estimate fp,k,t of the mean fp,k = � � Eµp,k f (X) of f in sub-region Rp,k . Similarly, to avoid some cumbersome notations, we introduce � � � � � � def def def 2 fp = Eµp f (X) and vp,k = Vµp,k f (X) for the function f , and then σp,k = Eµp,k σ 2 (X) for the variance of the noise σ 2 . We now deﬁne the empirical variance estimator to be K 1 � ˆ ˆ (fp,k,t − mp,t )2 , ˆ Vp,t = K −1 k=1 that is a biased estimator. Indeed, for a deterministic Tp,t , it is not difﬁcult to show that we have � K K � � � � � � �� � � � � 2 1 �� 1 � ˆ E Vp,t + Eµp,k f − Eµp f = Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 . K −1 Tp,t k=1 k=1 � � The leading term in this decomposition, that is given by the ﬁrst sum, is closed to Vµp f since, by using the assumption that f is (L, α)−H¨ lder, we have the following inequality o � � K � �� �� � �1 � � � � 2 2L2 dα � Eµp,k f − Eµp f − Vµp f (X) � ≤ , � �K (KPn )2α/d k=1 where we also used that the diameter of a sub-region Rp,k is given by diam(Rp,k ) = d1/2 . (KPn )1/d ˆ Then, the second term also contributes to the bias, essentially due to the fact that V[fp,k,t ] = � � � � 2 def def 1 1 2 2 2 Tp,k,t (vp,k + σp,k ) and not Tp,t (vk + σk ) (with vp = Vµp f (X) and σp = Eµp σ (X) ). ˆ p,k,t In order to correct this term, we now introduce the second estimator σ 2 that estimates the variance � � � � � � of the outputs in a region Rp,k , i.e. Vµp,k ,ν Y (X) = Vµp,k f (X) + Eµp,k σ 2 . It is deﬁned as �2 t t �� 1 1 � def ˆ p,k,t = Yi − Yj I{Xj ∈ Rp,k } I{Xi ∈ Rp,k } . σ2 Tp,k,t − 1 i=1 Tp,k,t j=1 Now, we combine the two previous estimators to form the following estimator K 1 �� 1 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ ˆ σ − . Qp,t = Vp,t − K Tp,k,t Tp,t p,k,t k=1 ˆ The following proposition provides a high-probability bound on the difference between Qp,t and the quantity we want to estimate. We report the detailed proof in [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012]. 6 ˆ Proposition 1 By the assumption that f is (L, α)-H¨ lder, the bias of the estimator Qp,t , and for o deterministic Tp,t , is given by � K � � � � � � � � � 2 1 � 2L2 dα ˆ − Vµp f (X) ≤ . Eµp,k f − Eµp f E Qp,t − Qp (Tp,t ) = K (KPn )2α/d k=1 Moreover, it satisﬁes that for all δ ∈ [0, 1], there exists an event of probability higher than 1 − δ such that on this event, we have � � � � � � K K � � � � 8 log(4/δ) � σ 2 �1 � � � � ˆ p,k,t 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ � Qp,t − E Qp,t � ≤ � √ +o σ p,k . � � (K − 1)2 T2 T K K k=1 p,k,t p,k,t k=1 We also state the following Lemma that we are going to use in the analysis, and that takes into account randomness of the stopping times Tp,k,t . Lemma 2 Let {Xp,k,u }p≤P, k≤K, u≤n be samples potentially sampled in region Rp,k . We introduce qp,u to be the�equivalent of Qp (Tp,t ) with explicitly ﬁxed value of Tp,t = u. Let also qp,u be the ˆ � ˆ p,t but computed with the ﬁrst u samples in estimate of E qp,u , that is to say the equivalent of Q each region Rp,k (i.e. Tp,t = u).

Then it where Vp,t = Vp (Tp,t ) = K−1 k=1 σ 2 holds that � � P ξn,P,K (δ) ≥ 1 − δ . Note that, with the notations of this Lemma, Proposition 1 above is thus about qp,u . ˆ 3.3 The Online allocation and homogeneous partitioning algorithm for piecewise constant mean-approximation (OAHPA-pcma) We are now ready to state the algorithm that we propose for minimizing the quadratic error of approximation of f . The algorithm is described in Figure 1. Although it looks similar, this algorithm is ˆ quite different from a normal UCB algorithm since Qp,t decreases in expectation with Tp,t .

Then with the choice of the number of regions Pn = n 2α+d �2+ 2α , and of the 2d d def def 8L2 α number of sub-regions K = C 4α+d �−2− α , where C = Ad1−α then the pseudo-loss of the OAHPApcma algorithm satisﬁes, under the assumptions of Section 3.1 and on an event of probability higher than 1 − δ, � � � � � 2α 1 + �γC � log(1/δ) Ln (A� ) + o n− 2α+d , Ln (A) ≤ n for some numerical constant C � not depending on n, where A� is the oracle of Lemma 1. n 7 Minimax-optimal partitioning and �-adaptive performance Theorem 1 provides a high probability bound on the performance of the OAHPA-pcma allocation strategy. It shows that this performance is competitive with that of an optimal (i.e. adaptive to the function f , see Lemma 1) allocation d A� on a partition with a number of cells Pn chosen to be of minimax order n 2α+d for the class of 2α α-H¨ lder functions. In particular, since Ln (A� ) = O(n d+2α ) on that class, we recover the same o n minimax order as what is obtained in the batch learning setting, when using for instance wavelets, or Kernel estimates (see e.g. Stone [1980], Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981]). But moreover, due to the adaptivity of A� to the function itself, this procedure is also �-adaptive to the function and not n only minimax-optimal on the class, on that partition (see Section 2.2). Naturally, the performance of the method increases, in the same way than for any classical functional estimation method, when the smoothness of the function increases. Similarly, in agreement with the classical curse of dimension, the higher the dimension of the domain, the less efﬁcient the method. Limitations In this work, we assume that the smoothness α of the function is available to the learner, which enables her to calibrate Pn properly. Now it makes sense to combine the OAHPApcma procedure with existing methods that enable to estimate this smoothness online (under a slightly stronger assumption than H¨ lder, such as H¨ lder functions that attain their exponents, o o see Gin´ and Nickl [2010]). It is thus interesting, when no preliminary knowledge on the smoothness e of f is available, to spend some of the initial budget in order to estimate α. We have seen that the OAHPA-pcma procedure, although very simple, manages to get minimax optimal results. Now the downside of the simplicity of the OAHPA-pcma strategy is two-fold. � The ﬁrst limitation is that the factor (1 + �γC � log(1/δ)) = (1 + O(�)) appearing in the bound before Ln (A� ) is not 1, but higher than 1. Of course it is generally difﬁcult to get a constant 1 in the batch setting (see Arlot [2007]), and similarly this is a difﬁcult task in our online setting too: If � is chosen to be small, then the error with respect to the optimal allocation is small. However, since Pn is expressed as an increasing function of �, this implies that the minimax bound on the loss for partition P increases also with �. That said, in the view of the work on active learning multi-armed bandit that we extend, we would still prefer to get the optimal constant 1. The second limitation is more problematic: since K is chosen irrespective of the region Rp , this causes the presence of the factor γ. Thus the algorithm will essentially no longer enjoy near-optimal performance guarantees when the optimal allocation strategy is highly not homogeneous. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we considered online regression with histograms in an active setting (we select in which bean to sample), and when we can choose the histogram in a class of homogeneous histograms. Since the (unknown) noise is heteroscedastic and we compete not only with the minimax allocation oracle on α-H¨ lder functions but with the adaptive oracle o that uses a minimax optimal histogram and allocates samples adaptively to the target function, this is an extremely challenging (and very practical) setting. Our contribution can be seen as a non trivial extension of the setting of active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm corresponds to one continuous region of a sampling space, as opposed to a singleton, which can also be seen as a problem of non parametric function approximation. This new setting offers interesting challenges: We provided a simple procedure, based on the computation of upper conﬁdence bounds of the estimation of the local quadratic error of approximation, and provided a performance analysis that shows that OAHPA-pcma is ﬁrst order �-optimal with respect to the function, for a partition chosen to be minimax-optimal on the class of α-H¨ lder functions. However, this simplicity also o has a drawback if one is interested in building exactly ﬁrst order optimal procedure, and going beyond these limitations is deﬁnitely not trivial: A more optimal but much more complex algorithm would indeed need to tune a different factor Kp in each cell in an online way, i.e. deﬁne some Kp,t that evolves with time, and redeﬁne sub-regions accordingly. Now, the analysis of the OAHPA-pcma already makes use of powerful tools such as empirical-Bernstein bounds for variance estimation (and not only for mean estimation), which make it non trivial; in order to handle possibly evolving subregions and deal with the progressive reﬁnement of the regions, we would need even more intricate analysis, due to the fact that we are online and active. This interesting next step is postponed to future work.

<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to take a step forwards making the term “intrinsic motivation” from reinforcement learning theoretically well founded, focusing on curiositydriven learning. To that end, we consider the setting where, a ﬁxed partition P of a continuous space X being given, and a process ν deﬁned on X being unknown, we are asked to sequentially decide which cell of the partition to select as well as where to sample ν in that cell, in order to minimize a loss function that is inspired from previous work on curiosity-driven learning. The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem. The resulting procedure, called Hierarchical Optimistic Region SElection driven by Curiosity (HORSE.C) is provided together with a ﬁnite-time regret analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.11416852 <a title="261-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-A_new_metric_on_the_manifold_of_kernel_matrices_with_application_to_matrix_geometric_means.html">25 nips-2012-A new metric on the manifold of kernel matrices with application to matrix geometric means</a></p>
<p>Author: Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric positive deﬁnite (spd) matrices pervade numerous scientiﬁc disciplines, including machine learning and optimization. We consider the key task of measuring distances between two spd matrices; a task that is often nontrivial whenever the distance function must respect the non-Euclidean geometry of spd matrices. Typical non-Euclidean distance measures such as the Riemannian metric δR (X, Y ) = log(Y −1/2 XY −1/2 ) F , are computationally demanding and also complicated to use. To allay some of these difﬁculties, we introduce a new metric on spd matrices, which not only respects non-Euclidean geometry but also offers faster computation than δR while being less complicated to use. We support our claims theoretically by listing a set of theorems that relate our metric to δR (X, Y ), and experimentally by studying the nonconvex problem of computing matrix geometric means based on squared distances. 1</p><p>4 0.10329921 <a title="261-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Local_Supervised_Learning_through_Space_Partitioning.html">200 nips-2012-Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Wang, Venkatesh Saligrama</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach for supervised learning based on adaptively partitioning the feature space into different regions and learning local region-speciﬁc classiﬁers. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem that incorporates both partitioning and classiﬁcation in to a single global objective. We show that space partitioning can be equivalently reformulated as a supervised learning problem and consequently any discriminative learning method can be utilized in conjunction with our approach. Nevertheless, we consider locally linear schemes by learning linear partitions and linear region classiﬁers. Locally linear schemes can not only approximate complex decision boundaries and ensure low training error but also provide tight control on over-ﬁtting and generalization error. We train locally linear classiﬁers by using LDA, logistic regression and perceptrons, and so our scheme is scalable to large data sizes and high-dimensions. We present experimental results demonstrating improved performance over state of the art classiﬁcation techniques on benchmark datasets. We also show improved robustness to label noise.</p><p>5 0.097593307 <a title="261-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Sequences_of_Signals_with_Sparse_Increments_via_Differential__1-Minimization.html">120 nips-2012-Exact and Stable Recovery of Sequences of Signals with Sparse Increments via Differential  1-Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Demba Ba, Behtash Babadi, Patrick Purdon, Emery Brown</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, (xk )K , for which k=0 the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse (with Sk typically smaller than S1 ), based on linear measurements (yk = Ak xk + ek )K , where Ak and ek denote the meak=1 surement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each Ak obeys the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain order—depending only on Sk —we show that in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum of the ℓ1 -norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement constraints, recovers the sequence (xk )K exactly. This is an interesting result bek=1 cause this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing problem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recovery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an application to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity.</p><p>6 0.097013168 <a title="261-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Adaptive_Stratified_Sampling_for_Monte-Carlo_integration_of_Differentiable_functions.html">36 nips-2012-Adaptive Stratified Sampling for Monte-Carlo integration of Differentiable functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: In the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal of a learner is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of arms, recent results show that it is possible to derive strategies based on ﬁnite-time conﬁdence bounds that are competitive with the best possible strategy. We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a ﬁnite partition P of a continuous sampling space X ⊂ Rd . Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is ﬁxed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper conﬁdence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order on the class of α−H¨ lder functions. o 1 Setting and Previous work Let us consider some space X ⊂ Rd , and Y ⊂ R. We call X the input space or sampling space, Y the output space or value space. We consider the problem of estimating with uniform precision the function f : X ⊂ Rd → Y ⊂ R. We assume that we can query n times the function f , anywhere in the domain, and observe noisy samples of this function. These samples are collected sequentially, and our aim is to design an adaptive procedure that selects wisely where on the domain to query the function, according to the information provided by the previous samples. More formally: Observed process We consider an unknown Y-valued process deﬁned on X , written ν : X → M+ (Y), where M+ (Y) refers to the set of all probability measures on Y, such that for all x ∈ X , 1 1 def the random variable Y (x) ∼ ν(x) has mean f (x) = E[Y (x)|x] ∈ R. We write for convenience the model in the following way Y (x) = f (x) + noise(x) , def where noise(x) = Y (x) − E[Y (x)|x] is the centered random variable corresponding to the noise, o with unknown variance σ 2 (x). We assume throughout this paper that f is α-H¨ lder. Partition We consider we can deﬁne a partition P of the input space X , with ﬁnitely many P regions {Rp }1≤p≤P that are assumed to be convex and not degenerated, i.e. such that the interior of each region Rp has positive Lebesgue volume vp . Moreover, with each region Rp is associated a sampling distribution in that region, written µp ∈ M+ (Rp ). Thus, when we decide to sample in 1 region Rp , a new sample X ∈ Rp is generated according to X ∼ µp . Allocation. We consider that we have a ﬁnite budget of n ∈ N samples that we can use in order to allocate samples as we wish among the regions {Rp }1≤p≤P . For illustration, let us assume that we deterministically allocate Tp,n ∈ N samples in region Rp , with the constraint that the allocation {Tp,n }1≤p≤P must some to n. In region Rp , we thus sample points {Xp,i }1≤p≤P at random 1 according to the sampling distribution µp , and then get the corresponding values {Yp,i }1≤i≤Tp,n , where Yp,i ∼ ν(Xp,i ). In the sequel, the distribution µp is assumed to be the uniform distribution dλ(x)1x∈R over region Rp , i.e. the density of µp is λ(Rp ) p where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Note that this is not restrictive since we are in an active, not passive setting. Piecewise constant mean-approximation. We use the collected samples in order to build a pieceˆ wise constant approximation fn of the mean f , and measure the accuracy of approximation on a region Rp with the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error, namely � � � � � ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = Eµ ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 , ˆ (f (x) − fn E p λ(Rp ) Rp ˆ where mp,n is the constant value that takes fn on the region Rp . A natural choice for the estimator ˆ mp,n is to use the empirical mean that is unbiased and asymptotically optimal for this criterion. ˆ Thus we consider the following estimate (histogram) ˆ fn (x) = P � p=1 mp,n I{x ∈ Rp } where mp,n = ˆ ˆ Tp,n 1 � Tp,n Yp,i . i=1 Pseudo loss Note that, since the Tp,n are deterministic, the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error of this estimator can be written in the following form � � � � � � ˆ Eµp ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 ˆ = Eµp ,ν (f (X) − Eµp [f (X)])2 + Eµp ,ν (Eµp [f (X)] − mp,n )2 � � � � = Vµp f (X) + Vµp ,ν mp,n ˆ � � � � 1 Vµp ,ν Y (X) . = Vµp f (X) + Tp,n Now, using the following immediate decomposition � � � � � Vµp ,ν Y (X) = Vµp f (X) + σ 2 (x)µp (dx) , Rp we deduce that the maximal expected quadratic norm of the approximation error over the regions def {Rp }1≤p≤P , that depends on the choice of the considered allocation strategy A = {Tp,n }1≤p≤P is thus given by the following so-called pseudo-loss � � � � � � Tp,n + 1 1 def 2 (1) Vµp f (X) + Eµ σ (X) . Ln (A) = max 1≤ p ≤P Tp,n Tp,n p Our goal is to minimize this pseudo-loss. Note that this is a local measure of performance, as opposed to a more usual yet less challenging global quadratic error. Eventually, as the number of �� �2 � ˆ cells tends to ∞, this local measure of performance approaches supx∈X Eν f (x) − fn (x) . At this point, let us also introduce, for convenience, the notation Qp (Tp,n ) that denotes the term inside the max, in order to emphasize the dependency on the quadratic error with the allocation. Previous work There is a huge literature on the topic of functional estimation in batch setting. Since it is a rather old and well studied question in statistics, many books have been written on this topic, such as Bosq and Lecoutre [1987], Rosenblatt [1991], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], where piecewise constant meano approximation are also called “partitioning estimate” or “regressogram” (ﬁrst introduced by Tukey [1947]). The minimax-optimal rate of approximation on the class of α-H¨ lder functions is known o 2α to be in O(n− 2α+d ) (see e.g. Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002]). o In such setting, a dataset {(Xi , Yi )}i≤n is given to the learner, and a typical question is thus to try to ﬁnd the best possible histogram in order to minimize a approximation error. Thus the dataset is ﬁxed and we typically resort to techniques such as model selection where each model corresponds to one histogram (see Arlot [2007] for an extensive study of such). However, we here ask a very different question, that is how to optimally sample in an online setting in order to minimize the approximation error of some histogram. Thus we choose the histogram 2 before we see any sample, then it is ﬁxed and we need to decide which cell to sample from at each time step. Motivation for this setting comes naturally from some recent works in the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit problem Antos et al. [2010], Carpentier et al. [2011]. In these works, the objective is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of distributions (arms), which would correspond to the special case when X = {1, . . . , P } is a ﬁnite set in our setting. Intuitively, we reduce the problem to such bandit problem with ﬁnite set of arms (regions), and our setting answers the question whether it is possible to extend those results to the case when the arms do not correspond to a singleton, but rather to a continuous region. We show that the answer is positive, yet non trivial. This is non trivial due to the variance estimation in each region: points x in some region may have different means f(x), so that standard estimators for the variance are biased, contrary to the point-wise case and thus ﬁnite-arm techniques may yield disastrous results. (Estimating the variance of the distribution in a continuous region actually needs to take into account not only the point-wise noise but also the variation of the function f and the noise level σ 2 in that region.) We describe a way, inspired from quasi Monte-Carlo techniques, to correct this bias so that we can handle the additional error. Also, it is worth mentioning that this setting can be informally linked to a notion of curiosity-driven learning (see Schmidhuber [2010], Baranes and Oudeyer [2009]), since we want to decide in which region of the space to sample, without explicit reward but optimizing the goal to understand the unknown environment. Outline Section 2 provides more intuition about the pseudo-loss and a result about the optimal oracle strategy when the domain is partitioned in a minimax-optimal way on the class of α−H¨ lder o functions. Section 3 presents our assumptions, that are basically to have a sub-Gaussian noise and smooth mean and variance functions, then our estimator of the pseudo-loss together with its concentration properties, before introducing our sampling procedure, called OAHPA-pcma. Finally, the performance of this procedure is provided and discussed in Section 4. 2 The pseudo-loss: study and optimal strategies 2.1 More intuition on each term in the pseudo-loss It is natural to look at what happens to each of the two terms that appear in equation 1 when one makes Rp shrink towards a point. More precisely, let xp be the mean of X ∼ µp and let us look at the limit of Vµp (f (X)) when vp goes to 0. Assuming that f is differentiable, we get �2 � �� lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim Eµp f (X) − f (xp ) − E[f (X) − f (xp )] vp →0 vp →0 = = = lim Eµp �� �X − xp , ∇f (xp )� − E[�X − xp , ∇f (xp )�] vp →0 � � lim Eµp �X − xp , ∇f (xp )�2 vp →0 � � lim ∇f (xp )T Eµp (X − xp )(X − xp )T ∇f (xp ) . �2 � vp →0 Therefore, if we introduce Σp to be the covariance matrix of the random variable X ∼ µp , then we simply have lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim ||∇f (xp )||2 p . Σ vp →0 vp →0 Example with hyper-cubic regions An important example is when Rp is a hypercube with side 1/d length vp and µp is the uniform distribution over the region Rp . In that case (see Lemma 1), we dx have µp (dx) = , and 2/d vp vp . ||∇f (xp )||2 p = ||∇f (xp )||2 Σ 12 More generally, when f is α−differentiable, i.e. that ∀a ∈ X , ∃∇α f (a, ·) ∈ Sd (0, 1)R such that ∀x ∈ Sd (0, 1), limh→0 f (a+hx)−f (a) = ∇α f (a, x), then it is not too difﬁcult to show that for such hα hyper-cubic regions, we have � � � 2α � Vµp f (X) = O vpd sup |∇α f (xp , u)|2 . S(0,1) � � On the other hand, by direct computation, the second term is such that limvp →0 Eµp σ 2 (X) = � � � � σ 2 (xp ). Thus, while Vµp f (X) vanishes, Eµp σ 2 (X) stays bounded away from 0 (unless ν is deterministic). 3 2.2 Oracle allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation. We now assume that we are allowed to choose the partition P depending on n, thus P = Pn , amongst all homogeneous partitions of the space, i.e. partitions such that all cells have the same volume, and come from a regular grid of the space. Thus the only free parameter is the number of cells Pn of the partition. An exact yet not explicit oracle algorithm. The minimization of the pseudo-loss (1) does not yield to a closed-form solution in general. However, we can still derive the order of the optimal loss (see [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012, Lemma 2] in the full version of the paper for an example of minimax yet non adaptive oracle � algorithm given in closed-form solution): � � −β � � � −α� � � Lemma 1 In the case when Vµp f (X) = Ω Pn and Rp σ 2 (x)µp (dx) = Ω Pn , then an � optimal allocation and partitioning strategy An satisﬁes that� � � � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � , L − Vµp f (X) � as soon as there exists, for such range of Pn , a constant L such that � � � � � Pn � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � = n. L − Vµp f (X) p=1 1 � Pn = Ω(n max(1+α� −β� ,1) ) and def � Tp,n = The pseudo-loss of such an algorithm A� , optimal amongst the allocations strategies that use the n � partition Pn in Pn regions, is then given by � � � � def max(1 − β , 1 − α ) − 1. where γ = Ln (A� ) = Ω nγ n max(1 + α� − β � , 1) The condition involving the constant L is here to ensure that the partition is not degenerate. It is morally satisﬁed as soon as the variance of f and the noise are bounded and n is large enough. This Lemma applies to the important class W 1,2 (R) of functions that admit a weak derivative that o belongs to L2 (R). Indeed these functions are H¨ lder with coefﬁcient α = 1/2, i.e. we have o W 1,2 (R) ⊂ C 0,1/2 (R). The standard Brownian motion is an example of function that is 1/2-H¨ lder. More generally, for k = d + α with α = 1/2 when d is odd and α = 1 when d is even, we have the 2 inclusion W k,2 (Rd ) ⊂ C 0,α (Rd ) , where W k,2 (Rd ) is the set of functions that admit a k th weak derivative belonging to L2 (Rd ). Thus the previous Lemma applies to sufﬁciently smooth functions with smoothness linearly increasing with the dimension d of the input space X . Important remark Note that this Lemma gives us a choice of the partition that is minimax-optimal, and an allocation strategy on that partition that is not only minimax-optimal but also adaptive to the function f itself. Thus it provides a way to decide in a minimax way what is the good number of regions, and then to provide the best oracle way to allocate the budget. We can deduce the following immediate corollary on the class of α−H¨ lder functions observed in a o non-negligible noise of bounded variance (i.e. in the setting β � = 0 and α� = 2α ). d Corollary 1 Consider that f is α−H¨ lder and the noise is of bounded variance. Then a minimaxo d � d+2α ) and an optimal allocation achieves the rate L (A� ) = optimal partition satisﬁes Pn = Ω(n n n � −2α � Ω n d+2α . Moreover, the strategy of Lemma 1 is optimal amongst the allocations strategies that � use the partition Pn in Pn regions. � −2α � The rate Ω n d+2α is minimax-optimal on the class of α−H¨ lder functions (see Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], o o Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980]), and it is thus interesting to consider an initial numd � � d+2α ). After having built the partition, if the quantities ber �� � 2 �� � � of�regions Pn that is of order Pn = Ω(n Vµp f p≤P and Eµp σ p≤P are known to the learner, it is optimal, in the aim of minimizing � the pseudo-loss, to allocate to each region the number of samples Tp,n provided in Lemma 1. Our objective in this paper is, after having chosen beforehand a minimax-optimal partition, to allocate 4 the samples properly in the regions, without having any access to those quantities. It is then �� � � necessary to balance between exploration, i.e. allocating the samples in order to estimate Vµp f p≤P � � �� and Eµp σ 2 p≤P , and exploitation, i.e. use the estimates to target the optimal allocation. 3 Online algorithms for allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation In this section, we now turn to the design of algorithms that are fully online, with the goal to be competitive against the kind of oracle algorithms considered in Section 2.2. We now assume that the space X = [0, 1]d is divided in Pn hyper-cubic regions of same measure (the Lebesgue measure on 1 [0, 1]d ) vp = v = Pn . The goal of an algorithm is to minimize the quadratic error of approximation of f by a constant over each cell, in expectation, which we write as � � � � � � 2 λ(dx) ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = max E , max E (f (x) − fn (f (x) − mp,n ) ˆ 1≤p≤Pn 1≤p≤Pn λ(Rp ) λ(Rp ) Rp Rp ˆ where fn is the histogram estimate of the function f on the partition P and mp,n is the empirical ˆ mean deﬁned on region Rp with the samples (Xi , Yi ) such that Xi ∈ Rp . To do so, an algorithm is only allowed to specify at each time step t, the next point Xt where to sample, based on all the past samples {(Xs , Ys )}s < ∞ satisﬁes that λ2 σ 2 (x) , ∀λ ∈ R+ log E exp[λ noise(x)] ≤ 2 and we further assume that it satisﬁes the following slightly stronger second property (that is for instance exactly veriﬁed for a Gaussian variable, looking at the moment generating function): � � � � 1 λ2 σ 2 (x) ∀λ, γ ∈ R+ log E exp λnoise(x) + γnoise(x)2 ≤ − log 1 − 2γσ 2 (x) . 2(1 − 2γσ 2 (x)) 2 5 The function f is assumed to be (L, α)-H¨ lder, meaning that it satiﬁes o � ∀x, x ∈ X f (x) − f (x� ) ≤ L||x − x� ||α . Similarly, the function σ 2 is assumed to be (M, β)-H¨ lder i.e. it satisﬁes o � 2 2 � ∀x, x ∈ X σ (x) − σ (x ) ≤ M ||x − x� ||β . We assume that Y is a convex and compact subset of R, thus w.l.g. that it is [0, 1], and that it is known that ||σ 2 ||∞ , which is thus ﬁnite, is bounded by the constant 1. 3.2 Empirical estimation of the quadratic approximation error on each cell We deﬁne the sampling distribution µp in the region Rp for each p ∈ {1, . . . , Pn } as a quasi-uniform ˜ sampling scheme using the uniform distribution over the sub-regions. More precisely at time t ≤ n, if we decide to sample in the region Rp according to µp , we sample uniformly in each sub-region ˜ one sample, resulting in a new batch of samples {(Xt,k , Yt,k )}1≤k≤K , where Xt,k ∼ µp,k . Note that due to this sampling process, the number of points Tp,t sampled in sub-region Rp at time t is always Tp,t a multiple of K and that moreover for all k, k � ∈ {1, . . . , K} we have that Tp,k,t = Tp,k� ,t = K . Now this speciﬁc sampling is used in order to be able to estimate the variances Vµp f and Eµp σ 2 , � so that the best proportions Tp,n can be computed as accurately as possible. Indeed, as explained in � � � � Lemma 1, we have that Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � def � � . Tp,n = L − Vµp f (X) ˆ Variance estimation We now introduce two estimators. The ﬁrst estimator is written Vp,t and is def ˆ built in the following way. First,let us introduce the empirical estimate fp,k,t of the mean fp,k = � � Eµp,k f (X) of f in sub-region Rp,k . Similarly, to avoid some cumbersome notations, we introduce � � � � � � def def def 2 fp = Eµp f (X) and vp,k = Vµp,k f (X) for the function f , and then σp,k = Eµp,k σ 2 (X) for the variance of the noise σ 2 . We now deﬁne the empirical variance estimator to be K 1 � ˆ ˆ (fp,k,t − mp,t )2 , ˆ Vp,t = K −1 k=1 that is a biased estimator. Indeed, for a deterministic Tp,t , it is not difﬁcult to show that we have � K K � � � � � � �� � � � � 2 1 �� 1 � ˆ E Vp,t + Eµp,k f − Eµp f = Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 . K −1 Tp,t k=1 k=1 � � The leading term in this decomposition, that is given by the ﬁrst sum, is closed to Vµp f since, by using the assumption that f is (L, α)−H¨ lder, we have the following inequality o � � K � �� �� � �1 � � � � 2 2L2 dα � Eµp,k f − Eµp f − Vµp f (X) � ≤ , � �K (KPn )2α/d k=1 where we also used that the diameter of a sub-region Rp,k is given by diam(Rp,k ) = d1/2 . (KPn )1/d ˆ Then, the second term also contributes to the bias, essentially due to the fact that V[fp,k,t ] = � � � � 2 def def 1 1 2 2 2 Tp,k,t (vp,k + σp,k ) and not Tp,t (vk + σk ) (with vp = Vµp f (X) and σp = Eµp σ (X) ). ˆ p,k,t In order to correct this term, we now introduce the second estimator σ 2 that estimates the variance � � � � � � of the outputs in a region Rp,k , i.e. Vµp,k ,ν Y (X) = Vµp,k f (X) + Eµp,k σ 2 . It is deﬁned as �2 t t �� 1 1 � def ˆ p,k,t = Yi − Yj I{Xj ∈ Rp,k } I{Xi ∈ Rp,k } . σ2 Tp,k,t − 1 i=1 Tp,k,t j=1 Now, we combine the two previous estimators to form the following estimator K 1 �� 1 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ ˆ σ − . Qp,t = Vp,t − K Tp,k,t Tp,t p,k,t k=1 ˆ The following proposition provides a high-probability bound on the difference between Qp,t and the quantity we want to estimate. We report the detailed proof in [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012]. 6 ˆ Proposition 1 By the assumption that f is (L, α)-H¨ lder, the bias of the estimator Qp,t , and for o deterministic Tp,t , is given by � K � � � � � � � � � 2 1 � 2L2 dα ˆ − Vµp f (X) ≤ . Eµp,k f − Eµp f E Qp,t − Qp (Tp,t ) = K (KPn )2α/d k=1 Moreover, it satisﬁes that for all δ ∈ [0, 1], there exists an event of probability higher than 1 − δ such that on this event, we have � � � � � � K K � � � � 8 log(4/δ) � σ 2 �1 � � � � ˆ p,k,t 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ � Qp,t − E Qp,t � ≤ � √ +o σ p,k . � � (K − 1)2 T2 T K K k=1 p,k,t p,k,t k=1 We also state the following Lemma that we are going to use in the analysis, and that takes into account randomness of the stopping times Tp,k,t . Lemma 2 Let {Xp,k,u }p≤P, k≤K, u≤n be samples potentially sampled in region Rp,k . We introduce qp,u to be the�equivalent of Qp (Tp,t ) with explicitly ﬁxed value of Tp,t = u. Let also qp,u be the ˆ � ˆ p,t but computed with the ﬁrst u samples in estimate of E qp,u , that is to say the equivalent of Q each region Rp,k (i.e. Tp,t = u). Let us deﬁne the event � � � � � � � AK log(4nP/δ)V � � ˆp,t 2L2 dα � � ξn,P,K (δ) = + ω : � qp,u (ω) − E qp,u � ≤ ˆ , u K −1 (KPn )2α/d p≤P u≤n �K 1 ˆ ˆ ˆ p,k,t and where A ≤ 4 is a numerical constant. Then it where Vp,t = Vp (Tp,t ) = K−1 k=1 σ 2 holds that � � P ξn,P,K (δ) ≥ 1 − δ . Note that, with the notations of this Lemma, Proposition 1 above is thus about qp,u . ˆ 3.3 The Online allocation and homogeneous partitioning algorithm for piecewise constant mean-approximation (OAHPA-pcma) We are now ready to state the algorithm that we propose for minimizing the quadratic error of approximation of f . The algorithm is described in Figure 1. Although it looks similar, this algorithm is ˆ quite different from a normal UCB algorithm since Qp,t decreases in expectation with Tp,t . Indeed, � � � � � �� �K � 1 its expectation is close to Vµp f + KTp,t k=1 Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 .

We remind that the objective is to minimize for an algorithm A the pseudo-loss Ln (A). Theorem 1 (Main result) Let γ = � maxp Tp,n � minp Tp,n be the distortion factor of the optimal allocation stratdef d d egy, and let � > 0. Then with the choice of the number of regions Pn = n 2α+d �2+ 2α , and of the 2d d def def 8L2 α number of sub-regions K = C 4α+d �−2− α , where C = Ad1−α then the pseudo-loss of the OAHPApcma algorithm satisﬁes, under the assumptions of Section 3.1 and on an event of probability higher than 1 − δ, � � � � � 2α 1 + �γC � log(1/δ) Ln (A� ) + o n− 2α+d , Ln (A) ≤ n for some numerical constant C � not depending on n, where A� is the oracle of Lemma 1. n 7 Minimax-optimal partitioning and �-adaptive performance Theorem 1 provides a high probability bound on the performance of the OAHPA-pcma allocation strategy. It shows that this performance is competitive with that of an optimal (i.e. adaptive to the function f , see Lemma 1) allocation d A� on a partition with a number of cells Pn chosen to be of minimax order n 2α+d for the class of 2α α-H¨ lder functions. In particular, since Ln (A� ) = O(n d+2α ) on that class, we recover the same o n minimax order as what is obtained in the batch learning setting, when using for instance wavelets, or Kernel estimates (see e.g. Stone [1980], Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981]). But moreover, due to the adaptivity of A� to the function itself, this procedure is also �-adaptive to the function and not n only minimax-optimal on the class, on that partition (see Section 2.2). Naturally, the performance of the method increases, in the same way than for any classical functional estimation method, when the smoothness of the function increases. Similarly, in agreement with the classical curse of dimension, the higher the dimension of the domain, the less efﬁcient the method. Limitations In this work, we assume that the smoothness α of the function is available to the learner, which enables her to calibrate Pn properly. Now it makes sense to combine the OAHPApcma procedure with existing methods that enable to estimate this smoothness online (under a slightly stronger assumption than H¨ lder, such as H¨ lder functions that attain their exponents, o o see Gin´ and Nickl [2010]). It is thus interesting, when no preliminary knowledge on the smoothness e of f is available, to spend some of the initial budget in order to estimate α. We have seen that the OAHPA-pcma procedure, although very simple, manages to get minimax optimal results. Now the downside of the simplicity of the OAHPA-pcma strategy is two-fold. � The ﬁrst limitation is that the factor (1 + �γC � log(1/δ)) = (1 + O(�)) appearing in the bound before Ln (A� ) is not 1, but higher than 1. Of course it is generally difﬁcult to get a constant 1 in the batch setting (see Arlot [2007]), and similarly this is a difﬁcult task in our online setting too: If � is chosen to be small, then the error with respect to the optimal allocation is small. However, since Pn is expressed as an increasing function of �, this implies that the minimax bound on the loss for partition P increases also with �. That said, in the view of the work on active learning multi-armed bandit that we extend, we would still prefer to get the optimal constant 1. The second limitation is more problematic: since K is chosen irrespective of the region Rp , this causes the presence of the factor γ. Thus the algorithm will essentially no longer enjoy near-optimal performance guarantees when the optimal allocation strategy is highly not homogeneous. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we considered online regression with histograms in an active setting (we select in which bean to sample), and when we can choose the histogram in a class of homogeneous histograms. Since the (unknown) noise is heteroscedastic and we compete not only with the minimax allocation oracle on α-H¨ lder functions but with the adaptive oracle o that uses a minimax optimal histogram and allocates samples adaptively to the target function, this is an extremely challenging (and very practical) setting. Our contribution can be seen as a non trivial extension of the setting of active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm corresponds to one continuous region of a sampling space, as opposed to a singleton, which can also be seen as a problem of non parametric function approximation. This new setting offers interesting challenges: We provided a simple procedure, based on the computation of upper conﬁdence bounds of the estimation of the local quadratic error of approximation, and provided a performance analysis that shows that OAHPA-pcma is ﬁrst order �-optimal with respect to the function, for a partition chosen to be minimax-optimal on the class of α-H¨ lder functions. However, this simplicity also o has a drawback if one is interested in building exactly ﬁrst order optimal procedure, and going beyond these limitations is deﬁnitely not trivial: A more optimal but much more complex algorithm would indeed need to tune a different factor Kp in each cell in an online way, i.e. deﬁne some Kp,t that evolves with time, and redeﬁne sub-regions accordingly. Now, the analysis of the OAHPA-pcma already makes use of powerful tools such as empirical-Bernstein bounds for variance estimation (and not only for mean estimation), which make it non trivial; in order to handle possibly evolving subregions and deal with the progressive reﬁnement of the regions, we would need even more intricate analysis, due to the fact that we are online and active. This interesting next step is postponed to future work.

<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to take a step forwards making the term “intrinsic motivation” from reinforcement learning theoretically well founded, focusing on curiositydriven learning. To that end, we consider the setting where, a ﬁxed partition P of a continuous space X being given, and a process ν deﬁned on X being unknown, we are asked to sequentially decide which cell of the partition to select as well as where to sample ν in that cell, in order to minimize a loss function that is inspired from previous work on curiosity-driven learning. The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem. The resulting procedure, called Hierarchical Optimistic Region SElection driven by Curiosity (HORSE.C) is provided together with a ﬁnite-time regret analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.59404677 <a title="261-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Adaptive_Stratified_Sampling_for_Monte-Carlo_integration_of_Differentiable_functions.html">36 nips-2012-Adaptive Stratified Sampling for Monte-Carlo integration of Differentiable functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive stratiﬁed sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a differentiable function given a ﬁnite number of evaluations to the function. We construct a sampling scheme that samples more often in regions where the function oscillates more, while allocating the samples such that they are well spread on the domain (this notion shares similitude with low discrepancy). We prove that the estimate returned by the algorithm is almost similarly accurate as the estimate that an optimal oracle strategy (that would know the variations of the function everywhere) would return, and provide a ﬁnite-sample analysis. 1</p><p>4 0.59262145 <a title="261-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Tight_Bounds_on_Profile_Redundancy_and_Distinguishability.html">343 nips-2012-Tight Bounds on Profile Redundancy and Distinguishability</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayadev Acharya, Hirakendu Das, Alon Orlitsky</p><p>Abstract: The minimax KL-divergence of any distribution from all distributions in a collection P has several practical implications. In compression, it is called redundancy and represents the least additional number of bits over the entropy needed to encode the output of any distribution in P. In online estimation and learning, it is the lowest expected log-loss regret when guessing a sequence of random values generated by a distribution in P. In hypothesis testing, it upper bounds the largest number of distinguishable distributions in P. Motivated by problems ranging from population estimation to text classiﬁcation and speech recognition, several machine-learning and information-theory researchers have recently considered label-invariant observations and properties induced by i.i.d. distributions. A sufﬁcient statistic for all these properties is the data’s proﬁle, the multiset of the number of times each data element appears. Improving on a sequence of previous works, we show that the redundancy of the collection of distributions induced over proﬁles by length-n i.i.d. sequences is between 0.3 · n1/3 and n1/3 log2 n, in particular, establishing its exact growth power. 1</p><p>5 0.54285777 <a title="261-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_for_High_Dimensional_Linear_Quadratic_Systems.html">110 nips-2012-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for High Dimensional Linear Quadratic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Morteza Ibrahimi, Adel Javanmard, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of adaptive control of a high dimensional linear quadratic (LQ) system. Previous work established the asymptotic convergence to an optimal controller for various adaptive control schemes. More recently, for the average √ cost LQ problem, a regret bound of O( T ) was shown, apart form logarithmic factors. However, this bound scales exponentially with p, the dimension of the state space. In this work we consider the case where the matrices describing the dynamic of the LQ system are sparse and their dimensions are large. We present √ an adaptive control scheme that achieves a regret bound of O(p T ), apart from logarithmic factors. In particular, our algorithm has an average cost of (1 + ) times the optimum cost after T = polylog(p)O(1/ 2 ). This is in comparison to previous work on the dense dynamics where the algorithm requires time that scales exponentially with dimension in order to achieve regret of times the optimal cost.

<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Anand Sarwate, Kaushik Sinha</p><p>Abstract: Principal components analysis (PCA) is a standard tool for identifying good lowdimensional approximations to data sets in high dimension. Many current data sets of interest contain private or sensitive information about individuals. Algorithms which operate on such data should be sensitive to the privacy risks in publishing their outputs. Differential privacy is a framework for developing tradeoffs between privacy and the utility of these outputs. In this paper we investigate the theory and empirical performance of differentially private approximations to PCA and propose a new method which explicitly optimizes the utility of the output. We demonstrate that on real data, there is a large performance gap between the existing method and our method. We show that the sample complexity for the two procedures differs in the scaling with the data dimension, and that our method is nearly optimal in terms of this scaling. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82637483 <a title="261-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Online_allocation_and_homogeneous_partitioning_for_piecewise_constant_mean-approximation.html">261 nips-2012-Online allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: In the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal of a learner is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of arms, recent results show that it is possible to derive strategies based on ﬁnite-time conﬁdence bounds that are competitive with the best possible strategy. We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a ﬁnite partition P of a continuous sampling space X ⊂ Rd . Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is ﬁxed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper conﬁdence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order on the class of α−H¨ lder functions. o 1 Setting and Previous work Let us consider some space X ⊂ Rd , and Y ⊂ R. We call X the input space or sampling space, Y the output space or value space. We consider the problem of estimating with uniform precision the function f : X ⊂ Rd → Y ⊂ R. We assume that we can query n times the function f , anywhere in the domain, and observe noisy samples of this function. These samples are collected sequentially, and our aim is to design an adaptive procedure that selects wisely where on the domain to query the function, according to the information provided by the previous samples. More formally: Observed process We consider an unknown Y-valued process deﬁned on X , written ν : X → M+ (Y), where M+ (Y) refers to the set of all probability measures on Y, such that for all x ∈ X , 1 1 def the random variable Y (x) ∼ ν(x) has mean f (x) = E[Y (x)|x] ∈ R. We write for convenience the model in the following way Y (x) = f (x) + noise(x) , def where noise(x) = Y (x) − E[Y (x)|x] is the centered random variable corresponding to the noise, o with unknown variance σ 2 (x). We assume throughout this paper that f is α-H¨ lder. Partition We consider we can deﬁne a partition P of the input space X , with ﬁnitely many P regions {Rp }1≤p≤P that are assumed to be convex and not degenerated, i.e. such that the interior of each region Rp has positive Lebesgue volume vp . Moreover, with each region Rp is associated a sampling distribution in that region, written µp ∈ M+ (Rp ). Thus, when we decide to sample in 1 region Rp , a new sample X ∈ Rp is generated according to X ∼ µp . Allocation. We consider that we have a ﬁnite budget of n ∈ N samples that we can use in order to allocate samples as we wish among the regions {Rp }1≤p≤P . For illustration, let us assume that we deterministically allocate Tp,n ∈ N samples in region Rp , with the constraint that the allocation {Tp,n }1≤p≤P must some to n. In region Rp , we thus sample points {Xp,i }1≤p≤P at random 1 according to the sampling distribution µp , and then get the corresponding values {Yp,i }1≤i≤Tp,n , where Yp,i ∼ ν(Xp,i ). In the sequel, the distribution µp is assumed to be the uniform distribution dλ(x)1x∈R over region Rp , i.e. the density of µp is λ(Rp ) p where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Note that this is not restrictive since we are in an active, not passive setting. Piecewise constant mean-approximation. We use the collected samples in order to build a pieceˆ wise constant approximation fn of the mean f , and measure the accuracy of approximation on a region Rp with the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error, namely � � � � � ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = Eµ ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 , ˆ (f (x) − fn E p λ(Rp ) Rp ˆ where mp,n is the constant value that takes fn on the region Rp . A natural choice for the estimator ˆ mp,n is to use the empirical mean that is unbiased and asymptotically optimal for this criterion. ˆ Thus we consider the following estimate (histogram) ˆ fn (x) = P � p=1 mp,n I{x ∈ Rp } where mp,n = ˆ ˆ Tp,n 1 � Tp,n Yp,i . i=1 Pseudo loss Note that, since the Tp,n are deterministic, the expected quadratic norm of the approximation error of this estimator can be written in the following form � � � � � � ˆ Eµp ,ν (f (X) − mp,n )2 ˆ = Eµp ,ν (f (X) − Eµp [f (X)])2 + Eµp ,ν (Eµp [f (X)] − mp,n )2 � � � � = Vµp f (X) + Vµp ,ν mp,n ˆ � � � � 1 Vµp ,ν Y (X) . = Vµp f (X) + Tp,n Now, using the following immediate decomposition � � � � � Vµp ,ν Y (X) = Vµp f (X) + σ 2 (x)µp (dx) , Rp we deduce that the maximal expected quadratic norm of the approximation error over the regions def {Rp }1≤p≤P , that depends on the choice of the considered allocation strategy A = {Tp,n }1≤p≤P is thus given by the following so-called pseudo-loss � � � � � � Tp,n + 1 1 def 2 (1) Vµp f (X) + Eµ σ (X) . Ln (A) = max 1≤ p ≤P Tp,n Tp,n p Our goal is to minimize this pseudo-loss. Note that this is a local measure of performance, as opposed to a more usual yet less challenging global quadratic error. Eventually, as the number of �� �2 � ˆ cells tends to ∞, this local measure of performance approaches supx∈X Eν f (x) − fn (x) . At this point, let us also introduce, for convenience, the notation Qp (Tp,n ) that denotes the term inside the max, in order to emphasize the dependency on the quadratic error with the allocation. Previous work There is a huge literature on the topic of functional estimation in batch setting. Since it is a rather old and well studied question in statistics, many books have been written on this topic, such as Bosq and Lecoutre [1987], Rosenblatt [1991], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], where piecewise constant meano approximation are also called “partitioning estimate” or “regressogram” (ﬁrst introduced by Tukey [1947]). The minimax-optimal rate of approximation on the class of α-H¨ lder functions is known o 2α to be in O(n− 2α+d ) (see e.g. Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980], Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002]). o In such setting, a dataset {(Xi , Yi )}i≤n is given to the learner, and a typical question is thus to try to ﬁnd the best possible histogram in order to minimize a approximation error. Thus the dataset is ﬁxed and we typically resort to techniques such as model selection where each model corresponds to one histogram (see Arlot [2007] for an extensive study of such). However, we here ask a very different question, that is how to optimally sample in an online setting in order to minimize the approximation error of some histogram. Thus we choose the histogram 2 before we see any sample, then it is ﬁxed and we need to decide which cell to sample from at each time step. Motivation for this setting comes naturally from some recent works in the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit problem Antos et al. [2010], Carpentier et al. [2011]. In these works, the objective is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a ﬁnite number of distributions (arms), which would correspond to the special case when X = {1, . . . , P } is a ﬁnite set in our setting. Intuitively, we reduce the problem to such bandit problem with ﬁnite set of arms (regions), and our setting answers the question whether it is possible to extend those results to the case when the arms do not correspond to a singleton, but rather to a continuous region. We show that the answer is positive, yet non trivial. This is non trivial due to the variance estimation in each region: points x in some region may have different means f(x), so that standard estimators for the variance are biased, contrary to the point-wise case and thus ﬁnite-arm techniques may yield disastrous results. (Estimating the variance of the distribution in a continuous region actually needs to take into account not only the point-wise noise but also the variation of the function f and the noise level σ 2 in that region.) We describe a way, inspired from quasi Monte-Carlo techniques, to correct this bias so that we can handle the additional error. Also, it is worth mentioning that this setting can be informally linked to a notion of curiosity-driven learning (see Schmidhuber [2010], Baranes and Oudeyer [2009]), since we want to decide in which region of the space to sample, without explicit reward but optimizing the goal to understand the unknown environment. Outline Section 2 provides more intuition about the pseudo-loss and a result about the optimal oracle strategy when the domain is partitioned in a minimax-optimal way on the class of α−H¨ lder o functions. Section 3 presents our assumptions, that are basically to have a sub-Gaussian noise and smooth mean and variance functions, then our estimator of the pseudo-loss together with its concentration properties, before introducing our sampling procedure, called OAHPA-pcma. Finally, the performance of this procedure is provided and discussed in Section 4. 2 The pseudo-loss: study and optimal strategies 2.1 More intuition on each term in the pseudo-loss It is natural to look at what happens to each of the two terms that appear in equation 1 when one makes Rp shrink towards a point. More precisely, let xp be the mean of X ∼ µp and let us look at the limit of Vµp (f (X)) when vp goes to 0. Assuming that f is differentiable, we get �2 � �� lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim Eµp f (X) − f (xp ) − E[f (X) − f (xp )] vp →0 vp →0 = = = lim Eµp �� �X − xp , ∇f (xp )� − E[�X − xp , ∇f (xp )�] vp →0 � � lim Eµp �X − xp , ∇f (xp )�2 vp →0 � � lim ∇f (xp )T Eµp (X − xp )(X − xp )T ∇f (xp ) . �2 � vp →0 Therefore, if we introduce Σp to be the covariance matrix of the random variable X ∼ µp , then we simply have lim Vµp (f (X)) = lim ||∇f (xp )||2 p . Σ vp →0 vp →0 Example with hyper-cubic regions An important example is when Rp is a hypercube with side 1/d length vp and µp is the uniform distribution over the region Rp . In that case (see Lemma 1), we dx have µp (dx) = , and 2/d vp vp . ||∇f (xp )||2 p = ||∇f (xp )||2 Σ 12 More generally, when f is α−differentiable, i.e. that ∀a ∈ X , ∃∇α f (a, ·) ∈ Sd (0, 1)R such that ∀x ∈ Sd (0, 1), limh→0 f (a+hx)−f (a) = ∇α f (a, x), then it is not too difﬁcult to show that for such hα hyper-cubic regions, we have � � � 2α � Vµp f (X) = O vpd sup |∇α f (xp , u)|2 . S(0,1) � � On the other hand, by direct computation, the second term is such that limvp →0 Eµp σ 2 (X) = � � � � σ 2 (xp ). Thus, while Vµp f (X) vanishes, Eµp σ 2 (X) stays bounded away from 0 (unless ν is deterministic). 3 2.2 Oracle allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation. We now assume that we are allowed to choose the partition P depending on n, thus P = Pn , amongst all homogeneous partitions of the space, i.e. partitions such that all cells have the same volume, and come from a regular grid of the space. Thus the only free parameter is the number of cells Pn of the partition. An exact yet not explicit oracle algorithm. The minimization of the pseudo-loss (1) does not yield to a closed-form solution in general. However, we can still derive the order of the optimal loss (see [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012, Lemma 2] in the full version of the paper for an example of minimax yet non adaptive oracle � algorithm given in closed-form solution): � � −β � � � −α� � � Lemma 1 In the case when Vµp f (X) = Ω Pn and Rp σ 2 (x)µp (dx) = Ω Pn , then an � optimal allocation and partitioning strategy An satisﬁes that� � � � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � , L − Vµp f (X) � as soon as there exists, for such range of Pn , a constant L such that � � � � � Pn � Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � � = n. L − Vµp f (X) p=1 1 � Pn = Ω(n max(1+α� −β� ,1) ) and def � Tp,n = The pseudo-loss of such an algorithm A� , optimal amongst the allocations strategies that use the n � partition Pn in Pn regions, is then given by � � � � def max(1 − β , 1 − α ) − 1. where γ = Ln (A� ) = Ω nγ n max(1 + α� − β � , 1) The condition involving the constant L is here to ensure that the partition is not degenerate. It is morally satisﬁed as soon as the variance of f and the noise are bounded and n is large enough. This Lemma applies to the important class W 1,2 (R) of functions that admit a weak derivative that o belongs to L2 (R). Indeed these functions are H¨ lder with coefﬁcient α = 1/2, i.e. we have o W 1,2 (R) ⊂ C 0,1/2 (R). The standard Brownian motion is an example of function that is 1/2-H¨ lder. More generally, for k = d + α with α = 1/2 when d is odd and α = 1 when d is even, we have the 2 inclusion W k,2 (Rd ) ⊂ C 0,α (Rd ) , where W k,2 (Rd ) is the set of functions that admit a k th weak derivative belonging to L2 (Rd ). Thus the previous Lemma applies to sufﬁciently smooth functions with smoothness linearly increasing with the dimension d of the input space X . Important remark Note that this Lemma gives us a choice of the partition that is minimax-optimal, and an allocation strategy on that partition that is not only minimax-optimal but also adaptive to the function f itself. Thus it provides a way to decide in a minimax way what is the good number of regions, and then to provide the best oracle way to allocate the budget. We can deduce the following immediate corollary on the class of α−H¨ lder functions observed in a o non-negligible noise of bounded variance (i.e. in the setting β � = 0 and α� = 2α ). d Corollary 1 Consider that f is α−H¨ lder and the noise is of bounded variance. Then a minimaxo d � d+2α ) and an optimal allocation achieves the rate L (A� ) = optimal partition satisﬁes Pn = Ω(n n n � −2α � Ω n d+2α . Moreover, the strategy of Lemma 1 is optimal amongst the allocations strategies that � use the partition Pn in Pn regions. � −2α � The rate Ω n d+2α is minimax-optimal on the class of α−H¨ lder functions (see Gy¨ rﬁ et al. [2002], o o Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981], Stone [1980]), and it is thus interesting to consider an initial numd � � d+2α ). After having built the partition, if the quantities ber �� � 2 �� � � of�regions Pn that is of order Pn = Ω(n Vµp f p≤P and Eµp σ p≤P are known to the learner, it is optimal, in the aim of minimizing � the pseudo-loss, to allocate to each region the number of samples Tp,n provided in Lemma 1. Our objective in this paper is, after having chosen beforehand a minimax-optimal partition, to allocate 4 the samples properly in the regions, without having any access to those quantities. It is then �� � � necessary to balance between exploration, i.e. allocating the samples in order to estimate Vµp f p≤P � � �� and Eµp σ 2 p≤P , and exploitation, i.e. use the estimates to target the optimal allocation. 3 Online algorithms for allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation In this section, we now turn to the design of algorithms that are fully online, with the goal to be competitive against the kind of oracle algorithms considered in Section 2.2. We now assume that the space X = [0, 1]d is divided in Pn hyper-cubic regions of same measure (the Lebesgue measure on 1 [0, 1]d ) vp = v = Pn . The goal of an algorithm is to minimize the quadratic error of approximation of f by a constant over each cell, in expectation, which we write as � � � � � � 2 λ(dx) ˆ (x))2 λ(dx) = max E , max E (f (x) − fn (f (x) − mp,n ) ˆ 1≤p≤Pn 1≤p≤Pn λ(Rp ) λ(Rp ) Rp Rp ˆ where fn is the histogram estimate of the function f on the partition P and mp,n is the empirical ˆ mean deﬁned on region Rp with the samples (Xi , Yi ) such that Xi ∈ Rp . To do so, an algorithm is only allowed to specify at each time step t, the next point Xt where to sample, based on all the past samples {(Xs , Ys )}s < ∞ satisﬁes that λ2 σ 2 (x) , ∀λ ∈ R+ log E exp[λ noise(x)] ≤ 2 and we further assume that it satisﬁes the following slightly stronger second property (that is for instance exactly veriﬁed for a Gaussian variable, looking at the moment generating function): � � � � 1 λ2 σ 2 (x) ∀λ, γ ∈ R+ log E exp λnoise(x) + γnoise(x)2 ≤ − log 1 − 2γσ 2 (x) . 2(1 − 2γσ 2 (x)) 2 5 The function f is assumed to be (L, α)-H¨ lder, meaning that it satiﬁes o � ∀x, x ∈ X f (x) − f (x� ) ≤ L||x − x� ||α . Similarly, the function σ 2 is assumed to be (M, β)-H¨ lder i.e. it satisﬁes o � 2 2 � ∀x, x ∈ X σ (x) − σ (x ) ≤ M ||x − x� ||β . We assume that Y is a convex and compact subset of R, thus w.l.g. that it is [0, 1], and that it is known that ||σ 2 ||∞ , which is thus ﬁnite, is bounded by the constant 1. 3.2 Empirical estimation of the quadratic approximation error on each cell We deﬁne the sampling distribution µp in the region Rp for each p ∈ {1, . . . , Pn } as a quasi-uniform ˜ sampling scheme using the uniform distribution over the sub-regions. More precisely at time t ≤ n, if we decide to sample in the region Rp according to µp , we sample uniformly in each sub-region ˜ one sample, resulting in a new batch of samples {(Xt,k , Yt,k )}1≤k≤K , where Xt,k ∼ µp,k . Note that due to this sampling process, the number of points Tp,t sampled in sub-region Rp at time t is always Tp,t a multiple of K and that moreover for all k, k � ∈ {1, . . . , K} we have that Tp,k,t = Tp,k� ,t = K . Now this speciﬁc sampling is used in order to be able to estimate the variances Vµp f and Eµp σ 2 , � so that the best proportions Tp,n can be computed as accurately as possible. Indeed, as explained in � � � � Lemma 1, we have that Vµp f (X) + Eµp σ 2 (X) � def � � . Tp,n = L − Vµp f (X) ˆ Variance estimation We now introduce two estimators. The ﬁrst estimator is written Vp,t and is def ˆ built in the following way. First,let us introduce the empirical estimate fp,k,t of the mean fp,k = � � Eµp,k f (X) of f in sub-region Rp,k . Similarly, to avoid some cumbersome notations, we introduce � � � � � � def def def 2 fp = Eµp f (X) and vp,k = Vµp,k f (X) for the function f , and then σp,k = Eµp,k σ 2 (X) for the variance of the noise σ 2 . We now deﬁne the empirical variance estimator to be K 1 � ˆ ˆ (fp,k,t − mp,t )2 , ˆ Vp,t = K −1 k=1 that is a biased estimator. Indeed, for a deterministic Tp,t , it is not difﬁcult to show that we have � K K � � � � � � �� � � � � 2 1 �� 1 � ˆ E Vp,t + Eµp,k f − Eµp f = Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 . K −1 Tp,t k=1 k=1 � � The leading term in this decomposition, that is given by the ﬁrst sum, is closed to Vµp f since, by using the assumption that f is (L, α)−H¨ lder, we have the following inequality o � � K � �� �� � �1 � � � � 2 2L2 dα � Eµp,k f − Eµp f − Vµp f (X) � ≤ , � �K (KPn )2α/d k=1 where we also used that the diameter of a sub-region Rp,k is given by diam(Rp,k ) = d1/2 . (KPn )1/d ˆ Then, the second term also contributes to the bias, essentially due to the fact that V[fp,k,t ] = � � � � 2 def def 1 1 2 2 2 Tp,k,t (vp,k + σp,k ) and not Tp,t (vk + σk ) (with vp = Vµp f (X) and σp = Eµp σ (X) ). ˆ p,k,t In order to correct this term, we now introduce the second estimator σ 2 that estimates the variance � � � � � � of the outputs in a region Rp,k , i.e. Vµp,k ,ν Y (X) = Vµp,k f (X) + Eµp,k σ 2 . It is deﬁned as �2 t t �� 1 1 � def ˆ p,k,t = Yi − Yj I{Xj ∈ Rp,k } I{Xi ∈ Rp,k } . σ2 Tp,k,t − 1 i=1 Tp,k,t j=1 Now, we combine the two previous estimators to form the following estimator K 1 �� 1 1 � 2 ˆ ˆ ˆ σ − . Qp,t = Vp,t − K Tp,k,t Tp,t p,k,t k=1 ˆ The following proposition provides a high-probability bound on the difference between Qp,t and the quantity we want to estimate. We report the detailed proof in [Carpentier and Maillard, 2012]. 6 ˆ Proposition 1 By the assumption that f is (L, α)-H¨ lder, the bias of the estimator Qp,t , and for o deterministic Tp,t , is given by � K � � � � � � � � � 2 1 � 2L2 dα ˆ − Vµp f (X) ≤ .

Lemma 2 Let {Xp,k,u }p≤P, k≤K, u≤n be samples potentially sampled in region Rp,k . We introduce qp,u to be the�equivalent of Qp (Tp,t ) with explicitly ﬁxed value of Tp,t = u. Let also qp,u be the ˆ � ˆ p,t but computed with the ﬁrst u samples in estimate of E qp,u , that is to say the equivalent of Q each region Rp,k (i.e. Tp,t = u).

The algorithm is described in Figure 1. Although it looks similar, this algorithm is ˆ quite different from a normal UCB algorithm since Qp,t decreases in expectation with Tp,t . Indeed, � � � � � �� �K � 1 its expectation is close to Vµp f + KTp,t k=1 Vµp,k f + Eµp,k σ 2 .

We remind that the objective is to minimize for an algorithm A the pseudo-loss Ln (A). Theorem 1 (Main result) Let γ = � maxp Tp,n � minp Tp,n be the distortion factor of the optimal allocation stratdef d d egy, and let � > 0. Then with the choice of the number of regions Pn = n 2α+d �2+ 2α , and of the 2d d def def 8L2 α number of sub-regions K = C 4α+d �−2− α , where C = Ad1−α then the pseudo-loss of the OAHPApcma algorithm satisﬁes, under the assumptions of Section 3.1 and on an event of probability higher than 1 − δ, � � � � � 2α 1 + �γC � log(1/δ) Ln (A� ) + o n− 2α+d , Ln (A) ≤ n for some numerical constant C � not depending on n, where A� is the oracle of Lemma 1. n 7 Minimax-optimal partitioning and �-adaptive performance Theorem 1 provides a high probability bound on the performance of the OAHPA-pcma allocation strategy. It shows that this performance is competitive with that of an optimal (i.e. adaptive to the function f , see Lemma 1) allocation d A� on a partition with a number of cells Pn chosen to be of minimax order n 2α+d for the class of 2α α-H¨ lder functions. In particular, since Ln (A� ) = O(n d+2α ) on that class, we recover the same o n minimax order as what is obtained in the batch learning setting, when using for instance wavelets, or Kernel estimates (see e.g. Stone [1980], Ibragimov and Hasminski [1981]). But moreover, due to the adaptivity of A� to the function itself, this procedure is also �-adaptive to the function and not n only minimax-optimal on the class, on that partition (see Section 2.2). Naturally, the performance of the method increases, in the same way than for any classical functional estimation method, when the smoothness of the function increases. Similarly, in agreement with the classical curse of dimension, the higher the dimension of the domain, the less efﬁcient the method. Limitations In this work, we assume that the smoothness α of the function is available to the learner, which enables her to calibrate Pn properly. Now it makes sense to combine the OAHPApcma procedure with existing methods that enable to estimate this smoothness online (under a slightly stronger assumption than H¨ lder, such as H¨ lder functions that attain their exponents, o o see Gin´ and Nickl [2010]). It is thus interesting, when no preliminary knowledge on the smoothness e of f is available, to spend some of the initial budget in order to estimate α. We have seen that the OAHPA-pcma procedure, although very simple, manages to get minimax optimal results. Now the downside of the simplicity of the OAHPA-pcma strategy is two-fold. � The ﬁrst limitation is that the factor (1 + �γC � log(1/δ)) = (1 + O(�)) appearing in the bound before Ln (A� ) is not 1, but higher than 1. Of course it is generally difﬁcult to get a constant 1 in the batch setting (see Arlot [2007]), and similarly this is a difﬁcult task in our online setting too: If � is chosen to be small, then the error with respect to the optimal allocation is small. However, since Pn is expressed as an increasing function of �, this implies that the minimax bound on the loss for partition P increases also with �. That said, in the view of the work on active learning multi-armed bandit that we extend, we would still prefer to get the optimal constant 1. The second limitation is more problematic: since K is chosen irrespective of the region Rp , this causes the presence of the factor γ. Thus the algorithm will essentially no longer enjoy near-optimal performance guarantees when the optimal allocation strategy is highly not homogeneous. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we considered online regression with histograms in an active setting (we select in which bean to sample), and when we can choose the histogram in a class of homogeneous histograms. Since the (unknown) noise is heteroscedastic and we compete not only with the minimax allocation oracle on α-H¨ lder functions but with the adaptive oracle o that uses a minimax optimal histogram and allocates samples adaptively to the target function, this is an extremely challenging (and very practical) setting. Our contribution can be seen as a non trivial extension of the setting of active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm corresponds to one continuous region of a sampling space, as opposed to a singleton, which can also be seen as a problem of non parametric function approximation. This new setting offers interesting challenges: We provided a simple procedure, based on the computation of upper conﬁdence bounds of the estimation of the local quadratic error of approximation, and provided a performance analysis that shows that OAHPA-pcma is ﬁrst order �-optimal with respect to the function, for a partition chosen to be minimax-optimal on the class of α-H¨ lder functions. However, this simplicity also o has a drawback if one is interested in building exactly ﬁrst order optimal procedure, and going beyond these limitations is deﬁnitely not trivial: A more optimal but much more complex algorithm would indeed need to tune a different factor Kp in each cell in an online way, i.e. deﬁne some Kp,t that evolves with time, and redeﬁne sub-regions accordingly. Now, the analysis of the OAHPA-pcma already makes use of powerful tools such as empirical-Bernstein bounds for variance estimation (and not only for mean estimation), which make it non trivial; in order to handle possibly evolving subregions and deal with the progressive reﬁnement of the regions, we would need even more intricate analysis, due to the fact that we are online and active. This interesting next step is postponed to future work.

<p>Author: Weihao Kong, Wu-jun Li</p><p>Abstract: Most existing hashing methods adopt some projection functions to project the original data into several dimensions of real values, and then each of these projected dimensions is quantized into one bit (zero or one) by thresholding. Typically, the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not veriﬁed by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to ﬁnd a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called isotropic hashing (IsoHash), to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions, which veriﬁes the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances. 1</p><p>4 0.76190448 <a title="261-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Simple_and_Practical_Algorithm_for_Differentially_Private_Data_Release.html">18 nips-2012-A Simple and Practical Algorithm for Differentially Private Data Release</a></p>

<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to take a step forwards making the term “intrinsic motivation” from reinforcement learning theoretically well founded, focusing on curiositydriven learning. To that end, we consider the setting where, a ﬁxed partition P of a continuous space X being given, and a process ν deﬁned on X being unknown, we are asked to sequentially decide which cell of the partition to select as well as where to sample ν in that cell, in order to minimize a loss function that is inspired from previous work on curiosity-driven learning. The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem. The resulting procedure, called Hierarchical Optimistic Region SElection driven by Curiosity (HORSE.C) is provided together with a ﬁnite-time regret analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.74120861 <a title="261-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Sparse_Graphs.html">69 nips-2012-Clustering Sparse Graphs</a></p>

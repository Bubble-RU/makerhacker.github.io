<p>Author: Peter Kontschieder, Samuel R. Bulò, Antonio Criminisi, Pushmeet Kohli, Marcello Pelillo, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce Context-Sensitive Decision Forests - A new perspective to exploit contextual information in the popular decision forest framework for the object detection problem. They are tree-structured classiﬁers with the ability to access intermediate prediction (here: classiﬁcation and regression) information during training and inference time. This intermediate prediction is available for each sample and allows us to develop context-based decision criteria, used for reﬁning the prediction process. In addition, we introduce a novel split criterion which in combination with a priority based way of constructing the trees, allows more accurate regression mode selection and hence improves the current context information. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved results for the task of pedestrian detection on the challenging TUD data set when compared to state-ofthe-art methods. 1 Introduction and Related Work In the last years, the random forest framework [1, 6] has become a very popular and powerful tool for classiﬁcation and regression problems by exhibiting many appealing properties like inherent multi-class capability, robustness to label noise and reduced tendencies to overﬁtting [7]. They are considered to be close to an ideal learner [13], making them attractive in many areas of computer vision like image classiﬁcation [5, 17], clustering [19], regression [8] or semantic segmentation [24, 15, 18]. In this work we show how the decision forest algorithm can be extended to include contextual information during learning and inference for classiﬁcation and regression problems. We focus on applying random forests to object detection, i.e. the problem of localizing multiple instances of a given object class in a test image. This task has been previously addressed in random forests [9], where the trees were modiﬁed to learn a mapping between the appearance of an image patch and its relative position to the object category centroid (i.e. center voting information). During inference, the resulting Hough Forest not only performs classiﬁcation on test samples but also casts probabilistic votes in a generalized Hough-voting space [3] that is subsequently used to obtain object center hypotheses. Ever since, a series of applications such as tracking and action recognition [10], body-joint position estimation [12] and multi-class object detection [22] have been presented. However, Hough Forests typically produce non-distinctive object hypotheses in the Hough space and hence there is the need to perform non-maximum suppression (NMS) for obtaining the ﬁnal results. While this has been addressed in [4, 26], another shortcoming is that standard (Hough) forests treat samples in a completely independent way, i.e. there is no mechanism that encourages the classiﬁer to perform consistent predictions. Within this work we are proposing that context information can be used to overcome the aforementioned problems. For example, training data for visual learning is often represented by images in form of a (regular) pixel grid topology, i.e. objects appearing in natural images can often be found in a speciﬁc context. The importance of contextual information was already highlighted in the 80’s with 1 Figure 1: Top row: Training image, label image, visualization of priority-based growing of tree (the lower, the earlier the consideration during training.). Bottom row: Inverted Hough image using [9] and breadth-ﬁrst training after 6 levels (26 = 64 nodes), Inverted Hough image after growing 64 nodes using our priority queue, Inverted Hough image using priority queue shows distinctive peaks at the end of training. a pioneering work on relaxation labelling [14] and a later work with focus on inference tasks [20] that addressed the issue of learning within the same framework. More recently, contextual information has been used in the ﬁeld of object class segmentation [21], however, mostly for high-level reasoning in random ﬁeld models or to resolve contradicting segmentation results. The introduction of contextual information as additional features in low-level classiﬁers was initially proposed in the Auto-context [25] and Semantic Texton Forest [24] models. Auto-context shows a general approach for classiﬁer boosting by iteratively learning from appearance and context information. In this line of research [18] augmented the feature space for an Entanglement Random Forest with a classiﬁcation feature, that is consequently reﬁned by the class posterior distributions according to the progress of the trained subtree. The training procedure is allowed to perform tests for speciﬁc, contextual label conﬁgurations which was demonstrated to signiﬁcantly improve the segmentation results. However, the In this paper we are presenting Context-Sensitve Decision Forests - A novel and uniﬁed interpretation of Hough Forests in light of contextual sensitivity. Our work is inspired by Auto-Context and Entanglement Forests, but instead of providing only posterior classiﬁcation results from an earlier level of the classiﬁer construction during learning and testing, we additionally provide regression (voting) information as it is used in Hough Forests. The second core contribution of our work is related to how we grow the trees: Instead of training them in a depth- or breadth-ﬁrst way, we propose a priority-based construction (which could actually consider depth- or breadth-ﬁrst as particular cases). The priority is determined by the current training error, i.e. we ﬁrst grow the parts of the tree where we experience higher error. To this end, we introduce a uniﬁed splitting criterion that estimates the joint error of classiﬁcation and regression. The consequence of using our priority-based training are illustrated in Figure 1: Given the training image with corresponding label image (top row, images 1 and 2), the tree ﬁrst tries to learn the foreground samples as shown in the color-coded plot (top row, image 3, colors correspond to index number of nodes in the tree). The effects on the intermediate prediction quality are shown in the bottom row for the regression case: The ﬁrst image shows the regression quality after training a tree with 6 levels (26 = 64 nodes) in a breadth-ﬁrst way while the second image shows the progress after growing 64 nodes according to the priority based training. Clearly, the modes for the center hypotheses are more distinctive which in turn yields to more accurate intermediate regression information that can be used for further tree construction. Our third contribution is a new family of split functions that allows to learn from training images containing multiple training instances as shown for the pedestrians in the example. We introduce a test that checks the centroid compatibility for pairs of training samples taken from the context, based on the intermediate classiﬁcation and regression derived as described before. To assess our contributions, we performed several experiments on the challenging TUD pedestrian data set [2], yielding a signiﬁcant improvement of 9% in the recall at 90% precision rate in comparison to standard Hough Forests, when learning from crowded pedestrian images. 2 2 Context-Sensitive Decision Trees This section introduces the general idea behind the context-sensitive decision forest without references to speciﬁc applications. Only in Section 3 we show a particular application to the problem of object detection. After showing some basic notational conventions that are used in the paper, we provide a section that revisits the random forest framework for classiﬁcation and regression tasks from a joint perspective, i.e. a theory allowing to consider e.g. [1, 11] and [9] in a uniﬁed way. Starting from this general view we ﬁnally introduce the context-sensitive forests in 2.2. Notations. In the paper we denote vectors using boldface lowercase (e.g. d, u, v) and sets by using uppercase calligraphic (e.g. X , Y) symbols. The sets of real, natural and integer numbers are denoted with R, N and Z as usually. We denote by 2X the power set of X and by 1 [P ] the indicator function returning 1 or 0 according to whether the proposition P is true or false. Moreover, with P(Y) we denote the set of probability distributions having Y as sample space and we implicitly assume that some σ-algebra is deﬁned on Y. We denote by δ(x) the Dirac delta function. Finally, Ex∼Q [f (x)] denotes the expectation of f (x) with respect to x sampled according to distribution Q. 2.1 Random Decision Forests for joint classiﬁcation and regression A (binary) decision tree is a tree-structured predictor1 where, starting from the root, a sample is routed until it reaches a leaf where the prediction takes place. At each internal node of the tree the decision is taken whether the sample should be forwarded to the left or right child, according to a binary-valued function. In formal terms, let X denote the input space, let Y denote the output space and let T dt be the set of decision trees. In its simplest form a decision tree consists of a single node (a leaf ) and is parametrized by a probability distribution Q ∈ P(Y) which represents the posterior probability of elements in Y given any data sample reaching the leaf. We denote this (admittedly rudimentary) tree as L F (Q) ∈ T td . Otherwise, a decision tree consists of a node with a left and a right sub-tree. This node is parametrized by a split function φ : X → {0, 1}, which determines whether to route a data sample x ∈ X reaching it to the left decision sub-tree tl ∈ T dt (if φ(x) = 0) or to the right one tr ∈ T dt (if φ(x) = 1). We denote such a tree as N D (φ, tl , tr ) ∈ T td . Finally, a decision forest is an ensemble F ⊆ T td of decision trees which makes a prediction about a data sample by averaging over the single predictions gathered from all trees. Inference. Given a decision tree t ∈ T dt , the associated posterior probability of each element in Y given a sample x ∈ X is determined by ﬁnding the probability distribution Q parametrizing the leaf that is reached by x when routed along the tree. This is compactly presented with the following deﬁnition of P (y|x, t), which is inductive in the structure of t:  if t = L F (Q) Q(y) P (y | x, t ) = P (y | x, tl ) if t = N D (φ, tl , tr ) and φ(x) = 0 (1)  P (y | x, tr ) if t = N D (φ, tl , tr ) and φ(x) = 1 . Finally, the combination of the posterior probabilities derived from the trees in a forest F ⊆ T dt can be done by an averaging operation [6], yielding a single posterior probability for the whole forest: P (y|x, F) = 1 |F| P (y|x, t) . (2) t∈F Randomized training. A random forest is created by training a set of random decision trees independently on random subsets of the training data D ⊆ X ×Y. The training procedure for a single decision tree heuristically optimizes a set of parameters like the tree structure, the split functions at the internal nodes and the density estimates at the leaves in order to reduce the prediction error on the training data. In order to prevent overﬁtting problems, the search space of possible split functions is limited to a random set and a minimum number of training samples is required to grow a leaf node. During the training procedure, each new node is fed with a set of training samples Z ⊆ D. If some stopping condition holds, depending on Z, the node becomes a leaf and a density on Y is estimated based on Z. Otherwise, an internal node is grown and a split function is selected from a pool of random ones in a way to minimize some sort of training error on Z. The selected split function induces a partition 1 we use the term predictor because we will jointly consider classiﬁcation and regression. 3 of Z into two sets, which are in turn becoming the left and right childs of the current node where the training procedure is continued, respectively. We will now write this training procedure in more formal terms. To this end we introduce a function π(Z) ∈ P(Y) providing a density on Y estimated from the training data Z ⊆ D and a loss function L(Z | Q) ∈ R penalizing wrong predictions on the training samples in Z, when predictions are given according to a distribution Q ∈ P(Y). The loss function L can be further decomposed in terms of a loss function (·|Q) : Y → R acting on each sample of the training set: L(Z | Q) = (y | Q) . (3) (x,y)∈Z Also, let Φ(Z) be a set of split functions randomly generated for a training set Z and given a split φ function φ ∈ Φ(Z), we denote by Zlφ and Zr the sets identiﬁed by splitting Z according to φ, i.e. Zlφ = {(x, y) ∈ Z : φ(x) = 0} and φ Zr = {(x, y) ∈ Z : φ(x) = 1} . We can now summarize the training procedure in terms of a recursive function g : 2X ×Y → T , which generates a random decision tree from a training set given as argument: g(Z) = L F (π(Z)) ND if some stopping condition holds φ φ, g(Zlφ ), g(Zr ) otherwise . (4) Here, we determine the optimal split function φ in the pool Φ(Z) as the one minimizing the loss we incur as a result of the node split: φ φ ∈ arg min L(Zlφ ) + L(Zr ) : φ ∈ Φ(Z) (5) where we compactly write L(Z) for L(Z|π(Z)), i.e. the loss on Z obtained with predictions driven by π(Z). A typical split function selection criterion commonly adopted for classiﬁcation and regression is information gain. The equivalent counterpart in terms of loss can be obtained by using a log-loss, i.e. (y|Q) = − log(Q(y)). A further widely used criterion is based on Gini impurity, which can be expressed in this setting by using (y|Q) = 1 − Q(y). Finally, the stopping condition that is used in (4) to determine whether to create a leaf or to continue branching the tree typically consists in checking |Z|, i.e. the number of training samples at the node, or the loss L(Z) are below some given thresholds, or if a maximum depth is reached. 2.2 Context-sensitive decision forests A context-sensitive (CS) decision tree is a decision tree in which split functions are enriched with the ability of testing contextual information of a sample, before taking a decision about where to route it. We generate contextual information at each node of a decision tree by exploiting a truncated version of the same tree as a predictor. This idea is shared with [18], however, we introduce some novelties by tackling both, classiﬁcation and regression problems in a joint manner and by leaving a wider ﬂexibility in the tree truncation procedure. We denote the set of CS decision trees as T . The main differences characterizing a CS decision tree t ∈ T compared with a standard decision tree are the following: a) every node (leaves and internal nodes) of t has an associated probability distribution Q ∈ P(Y) representing the posterior probability of an element in Y given any data sample reaching it; b) internal nodes are indexed with distinct natural numbers n ∈ N in a way to preserve the property that children nodes have a larger index compared to their parent node; c) the split function at each internal node, denoted by ϕ(·|t ) : X → {0, 1}, is bound to a CS decision tree t ∈ T , which is a truncated version of t and can be used to compute intermediate, contextual information. Similar to Section 2.1 we denote by L F (Q) ∈ T the simplest CS decision tree consisting of a single leaf node parametrized by the distribution Q, while we denote by N D (n, Q, ϕ, tl , tr ) ∈ T , the rest of the trees consisting of a node having a left and a right sub-tree, denoted by tl , tr ∈ T respectively, and being parametrized by the index n, a probability distribution Q and the split function ϕ as described above. As shown in Figure 2, the truncation of a CS decision tree at each node is obtained by exploiting the indexing imposed on the internal nodes of the tree.

On the right, we see the truncated version t(<5) of t, which is obtained by converting to leaves all nodes having index ≥ 5 (we marked with colors the corresponding node transformations). we denote by t( < τ 2 In the experiments conducted, we never exceeded 10 iterations for ﬁnding a mode. 6 (8) where Pj = P (·|(u + hj , I), t), with j = 1, 2, are the posterior probabilities obtained from tree t given samples at position u+h1 and u+h2 of image I, respectively. Please note that this test should not be confused with the regression split criterion in [9], which tries to partition the training set in a way to group examples with similar voting direction and length. Besides the novel context-sensitive split function we employ also standard split functions performing tests on X as deﬁned in [24]. 4 Experiments To assess our proposed approach, we have conducted several experiments on the task of pedestrian detection. Detecting pedestrians is very challenging for Hough-voting based methods as they typically exhibit strong articulations of feet and arms, yielding to non-distinctive hypotheses in the Hough space. We evaluated our method on the TUD pedestrian data base [2] in two different ways: First, we show our detection results with training according to the standard protocol using 400 training images (where each image contains a single annotation of a pedestrian) and evaluation on the Campus and Crossing scenes, respectively (Section 4.1). With this experiment we show the improvement over state-of-the-art approaches when learning can be performed with simultaneous knowledge about context information. In a second variation (Section 4.2), we use the images of the Crossing scene (201 images) as a training set. Most images of this scene contain more than four persons with strong overlap and mutual occlusions. However, instead of using the original annotation which covers only pedestrians with at least 50% overlap (1008 bounding boxes), we use the more accurate, pixel-wise ground truth annotations of [23] for the entire scene that includes all persons and consists of 1215 bounding boxes. Please note that this annotation is even more detailed than the one presented in [4] with 1018 bounding boxes. The purpose of the second experiment is to show that our context-sensitive forest can exploit the availability of multiple training instances signiﬁcantly better than state-of-the-art. The most related work and therefore also the baseline in our experiments is the Hough Forest [9]. To guarantee a fair comparison, we use the same training parameters for [9] and our context sensitive forest: We trained 20 trees and the training data (including horizontally ﬂipped images) was sampled homogeneously per category per image. The patch size was ﬁxed to 30 × 30 and we performed 1600 node tests for ﬁnding the best split function parameters per node. The trees were stopped growing when < 7 samples were available. As image features, we used the the ﬁrst 16 feature channels provided in the publicly available Hough Forest code of [9]. In order to obtain the object detection hypotheses from the Hough space, we use the same Non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique in all our experiments as suggested in [9]. To evaluate the obtained hypotheses, we use the standard PASAL-VOC criterion which requires the mutual overlap between ground truth and detected bounding boxes to be ≥ 50%. The additional parameter of (7) was ﬁxed to σ = 7. 4.1 Evaluation using standard protocol training set The standard training set contains 400 images where each image comes with a single pedestrian annotation. For our experiments, we rescaled the images by a factor of 0.5 and doubled the training image set by including also the horizontally ﬂipped images. We randomly chose 125 training samples per image for foreground and background, resulting in 2 · 400 · 2 · 125 = 200k training samples per tree. For additional comparisons, we provide the results presented in the recent work on joint object detection and segmentation of [23], from which we also provide evaluation results of the Implicit Shape Model (ISM) [16]. However, please note that the results of [23] are based on a different baseline implementation. Moreover, we show the results of [4] when using the provided code and conﬁguration ﬁles from the ﬁrst authors homepage. Unfortunately, we could not reproduce the results of the original paper. First, we discuss the results obtained on the Campus scene. This data set consists of 71 images showing walking pedestrians at severe scale differences and partial occlusions. The ground truth we use has been released with [4] and contains a total number of 314 pedestrians. Figure 3, ﬁrst row, plot 1 shows the precision-recall curves when using 3 scales (factors 0.3, 0.4, 0.55) for our baseline [9] (blue), results from re-evaluating [4] (cyan, 5 scales), [23] (green) and our ContextSensitive Forest without and with using the priority queue based tree construction (red/magenta). In case of not using the priority queue, we trained the trees according to a breadth-ﬁrst way. We obtain a performance boost of ≈ 6% in recall at a precision of 90% when using both, context information and the priority based construction of our forest. The second plot in the ﬁrst row of Figure 3 shows the results when the same forests are tested on the Crossing scene, using the more detailed ground 7 TUD Campus (3 scales) TUD−Crossing (3 scales) 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 Precision 1 0.9 Precision 1 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.5 0.4 0.3 Baseline Hough Forest Barinova et al.

The data set shows walking pedestrians (Figure 3, right side, last 2 images) with a smaller variation in scale compared to the Campus scene but with strong mutual occlusions and overlaps. The improvement with respect to the baseline is lower (≈ 2% gain at a precision of 90%) and we ﬁnd similar developments of the curves. However, this comes somewhat expectedly as the training data does not properly reﬂect the occlusions we actually want to model. 4.2 Evaluation on Campus scene using Crossing scene as training set In our next experiment we trained the forests (same parameters) on the novel annotations of [23] for the Crossing scene. Please note that this reduces the training set to only 201 images (we did not include the ﬂipped images). Qualitative detection results are shown in Figure 3, right side, images 1 and 2. From the ﬁrst precison-recall curve in the second row of Figure 3 we can see, that the margin between the baseline and our proposed method could be clearly improved (gain of ≈ 9% recall at precision 90%) when evaluating on the same 3 scales. With evaluation on 5 scales (factors 0.34, 0.42, 0.51, 0.65, 0.76) we found a strong increase in the recall, however, at the cost of loosing 2 − 3% of precision below a recall of 60%, as illustrated in the second plot of row 2 in Figure 3. While our method is able to maintain a precision above 90% up to a recall of ≈ 83%, the baseline implementation drops already at a recall of ≈ 20%. 5 Conclusions In this work we have presented Context-Sensitive Decision Forests with application to the object detection problem. Our new forest has the ability to access intermediate prediction (classiﬁcation and regression) information about all samples of the training set and can therefore learn from contextual information throughout the growing process. This is in contrast to existing random forest methods used for object detection which typically treat training samples in an independent manner. Moreover, we have introduced a novel splitting criterion together with a mode isolation technique, which allows us to (a) perform a priority-driven way of tree growing and (b) install novel context-based test functions to check for mutual object centroid agreements. In our experimental results on pedestrian detection we demonstrated superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods and additionally found that our new algorithm can signiﬁcantly better exploit training data containing multiple training objects.

<p>Author: Kumar Sricharan, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: The problem of estimation of entropy functionals of probability densities has received much attention in the information theory, machine learning and statistics communities. Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, for large feature dimension d, kernel plug-in estimators suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality: the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order O(T −γ/d ), where T is the number of samples, and γ > 0 is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for suﬃciently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order O(T −1 ). Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed oﬄine. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates. 1</p><p>4 0.10355467 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_Inference_of_Overlapping_Communities.html">298 nips-2012-Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities</a></p>
<p>Author: Prem Gopalan, Sean Gerrish, Michael Freedman, David M. Blei, David M. Mimno</p><p>Abstract: We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference of overlapping communities in large networks. Our algorithm is based on stochastic variational inference in the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). It naturally interleaves subsampling the network with estimating its community structure. We apply our algorithm on ten large, real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes. It converges several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for MMSB, ﬁnds hundreds of communities in large real-world networks, and detects the true communities in 280 benchmark networks with equal or better accuracy compared to other scalable algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.097716667 <a title="123-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Entropy_Estimations_Using_Correlated_Symmetric_Stable_Random_Projections.html">119 nips-2012-Entropy Estimations Using Correlated Symmetric Stable Random Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Cun-hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Methods for efﬁciently estimating Shannon entropy of data streams have important applications in learning, data mining, and network anomaly detections (e.g., the DDoS attacks). For nonnegative data streams, the method of Compressed Counting (CC) [11, 13] based on maximally-skewed stable random projections can provide accurate estimates of the Shannon entropy using small storage. However, CC is no longer applicable when entries of data streams can be below zero, which is a common scenario when comparing two streams. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for entropy estimation in general data streams which allow negative entries. In our method, the Shannon entropy is approximated by the ﬁnite difference of two correlated frequency moments estimated from correlated samples of symmetric stable random variables. Interestingly, the estimator for the moment we recommend for entropy estimation barely has bounded variance itself, whereas the common geometric mean estimator (which has bounded higher-order moments) is not sufﬁcient for entropy estimation. Our experiments conﬁrm that this method is able to well approximate the Shannon entropy using small storage.</p><p>6 0.076605394 <a title="123-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Multiplicative_Forests_for_Continuous-Time_Processes.html">232 nips-2012-Multiplicative Forests for Continuous-Time Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Masashi Sugiyama, Takafumi Kanamori, Taiji Suzuki, Marthinus D. Plessis, Song Liu, Ichiro Takeuchi</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the difference between two probability densities. A naive approach is a two-step procedure of ﬁrst estimating two densities separately and then computing their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the ﬁrst step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small estimation error incurred in the ﬁrst stage can cause a big error in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a single-shot procedure for directly estimating the density difference without separately estimating two densities. We derive a non-parametric ﬁnite-sample error bound for the proposed single-shot density-difference estimator and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. We then show how the proposed density-difference estimator can be utilized in L2 -distance approximation. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in robust distribution comparison such as class-prior estimation and change-point detection.</p><p>5 0.55105954 <a title="123-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_estimation_of_discrete_entropy_with_mixtures_of_stick-breaking_priors.html">57 nips-2012-Bayesian estimation of discrete entropy with mixtures of stick-breaking priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Shannon’s entropy H in the under-sampled regime, where the number of possible symbols may be unknown or countably inﬁnite. Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes provide tractable prior distributions over the space of countably inﬁnite discrete distributions, and have found major applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that they provide natural priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the analytic tractability of the moments of the induced posterior distribution over entropy H. We derive formulas for the posterior mean and variance of H given data. However, we show that a ﬁxed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior on H, meaning the prior strongly determines the estimate in the under-sampled regime. We therefore deﬁne a family of continuous mixing measures such that the resulting mixture of Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor processes produces an approximately ﬂat prior over H. We explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators and show that they perform well on data sampled from both exponential and power-law tailed distributions. 1</p><p>6 0.52234632 <a title="123-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Approximate_Message_Passing_with_Consistent_Parameter_Estimation_and_Applications_to_Sparse_Learning.html">43 nips-2012-Approximate Message Passing with Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning</a></p>

Teh</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for genetic sequence data in which a set of genetic sequences is modelled using a Markov model of partitions. The partitions at consecutive locations in the genome are related by the splitting and merging of their clusters. Our model can be thought of as a discrete analogue of the continuous fragmentation-coagulation process [Teh et al 2011], preserving the important properties of projectivity, exchangeability and reversibility, while being more scalable. We apply this model to the problem of genotype imputation, showing improved computational efﬁciency while maintaining accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art genotype imputation methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74768651 <a title="123-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Exponential_Concentration_for_Mutual_Information_Estimation_with_Application_to_Forests.html">123 nips-2012-Exponential Concentration for Mutual Information Estimation with Application to Forests</a></p>

We deﬁne such a penalty as the Laplace exponent of a subordinator. Accordingly, we propose a novel approach for the construction of sparsityinducing nonconvex penalties. Particularly, we show that the nonconvex logarithmic (LOG) and exponential (EXP) penalty functions are the Laplace exponents of Gamma and compound Poisson subordinators, respectively. Additionally, we explore the concave conjugate of nonconvex penalties. We ﬁnd that the LOG and EXP penalties are the concave conjugates of negative Kullback-Leiber (KL) distance functions. Furthermore, the relationship between these two penalties is due to asymmetricity of the KL distance. 1</p><p>4 0.66901034 <a title="123-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Rational_inference_of_relative_preferences.html">288 nips-2012-Rational inference of relative preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nisheeth Srivastava, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: Statistical decision theory axiomatically assumes that the relative desirability of different options that humans perceive is well described by assigning them optionspeciﬁc scalar utility functions. However, this assumption is refuted by observed human behavior, including studies wherein preferences have been shown to change systematically simply through variation in the set of choice options presented. In this paper, we show that interpreting desirability as a relative comparison between available options at any particular decision instance results in a rational theory of value-inference that explains heretofore intractable violations of rational choice behavior in human subjects. Complementarily, we also characterize the conditions under which a rational agent selecting optimal options indicated by dynamic value inference in our framework will behave identically to one whose preferences are encoded using a static ordinal utility function. 1</p><p>5 0.66294533 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Approximating_Concavely_Parameterized_Optimization_Problems.html">44 nips-2012-Approximating Concavely Parameterized Optimization Problems</a></p>

A √ lower bound of size Ω(1/ ε) shows that the upper bound is tight up to a constant factor. We also devise an algorithm that calls a step-size oracle and computes an √ approximate path of size O(1/ ε). Finally, we provide an implementation of the oracle for soft-margin support vector machines, and a parameterized semi-deﬁnite program for matrix completion. 1</p><p>6 0.65963811 <a title="123-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-No-Regret_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Online_Convex_Optimization.html">241 nips-2012-No-Regret Algorithms for Unconstrained Online Convex Optimization</a></p>

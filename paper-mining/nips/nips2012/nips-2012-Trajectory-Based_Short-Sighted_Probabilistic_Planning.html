<p>Author: Nicolas L. Roux, Mark Schmidt, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new stochastic gradient method for optimizing the sum of a ﬁnite set of smooth functions, where the sum is strongly convex. While standard stochastic gradient methods converge at sublinear rates for this problem, the proposed method incorporates a memory of previous gradient values in order to achieve a linear convergence rate. In a machine learning context, numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm can dramatically outperform standard algorithms, both in terms of optimizing the training error and reducing the test error quickly. 1</p><p>3 0.12148193 <a title="350-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Use_of_Non-Stationary_Policies_for_Stationary_Infinite-Horizon_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">255 nips-2012-On the Use of Non-Stationary Policies for Stationary Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Bruno Scherrer, Boris Lesner</p><p>Abstract: We consider inﬁnite-horizon stationary γ-discounted Markov Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. Using Value and Policy Iteration with some error at each iteration, it is well-known that one 2γ can compute stationary policies that are (1−γ)2 -optimal. After arguing that this guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy Iteration for com2γ puting non-stationary policies that can be up to 1−γ -optimal, which constitutes a signiﬁcant improvement in the usual situation when γ is close to 1. Surprisingly, this shows that the problem of “computing near-optimal non-stationary policies” is much simpler than that of “computing near-optimal stationary policies”. 1</p><p>4 0.10864251 <a title="350-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>

This new representation can easily incorporate domain knowledge in the form of a state similarity graph that loosely indicates which states are supposed to have similar optimal actions.

<p>Author: Arthur Guez, David Silver, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayesoptimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a signiﬁcant margin on several well-known benchmark problems – because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an inﬁnite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration. 1</p><p>6 0.098519512 <a title="350-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Policy_Learning_from_Trajectory_Preference_Queries.html">3 nips-2012-A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Katherine Chen, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Robust policy optimization acknowledges that risk-aversion plays a vital role in real-world decision-making. When faced with uncertainty about the effects of actions, the policy that maximizes expected utility over the unknown parameters of the system may also carry with it a risk of intolerably poor performance. One might prefer to accept lower utility in expectation in order to avoid, or reduce the likelihood of, unacceptable levels of utility under harmful parameter realizations. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty, but unlike other methods avoid making any distributional assumptions about the form of this uncertainty. Instead we focus on identifying optimization objectives for which solutions can be efﬁciently approximated. We introduce percentile measures: a very general class of objectives for robust policy optimization, which encompasses most existing approaches, including ones known to be intractable. We then introduce a broad subclass of this family for which robust policies can be approximated efﬁciently. Finally, we frame these objectives in the context of a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game and employ a no-regret algorithm to approximate an optimal policy, with computation only polynomial in the number of states and actions of the MDP. 1</p><p>4 0.69439703 <a title="350-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Policy_Learning_from_Trajectory_Preference_Queries.html">3 nips-2012-A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Wilson, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning control policies via trajectory preference queries to an expert. In particular, the agent presents an expert with short runs of a pair of policies originating from the same state and the expert indicates which trajectory is preferred. The agent’s goal is to elicit a latent target policy from the expert with as few queries as possible. To tackle this problem we propose a novel Bayesian model of the querying process and introduce two methods that exploit this model to actively select expert queries. Experimental results on four benchmark problems indicate that our model can effectively learn policies from trajectory preference queries and that active query selection can be substantially more efﬁcient than random selection. 1</p><p>5 0.67288762 <a title="350-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>

<p>Author: Feng Cao, Soumya Ray</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We deﬁne priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to ﬁnd an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually speciﬁed, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies. 1</p><p>3 0.47381461 <a title="350-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Factorial_LDA%3A_Sparse_Multi-Dimensional_Text_Models.html">124 nips-2012-Factorial LDA: Sparse Multi-Dimensional Text Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>4 0.44650981 <a title="350-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Sampling and variational inference techniques are two standard methods for inference in probabilistic models, but for many problems, neither approach scales effectively to large-scale data. An alternative is to relax the probabilistic model into a non-probabilistic formulation which has a scalable associated algorithm. This can often be fulﬁlled by performing small-variance asymptotics, i.e., letting the variance of particular distributions in the model go to zero. For instance, in the context of clustering, such an approach yields connections between the kmeans and EM algorithms. In this paper, we explore small-variance asymptotics for exponential family Dirichlet process (DP) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models. Utilizing connections between exponential family distributions and Bregman divergences, we derive novel clustering algorithms from the asymptotic limit of the DP and HDP mixtures that features the scalability of existing hard clustering methods as well as the ﬂexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We focus on special cases of our analysis for discrete-data problems, including topic modeling, and we demonstrate the utility of our results by applying variants of our algorithms to problems arising in vision and document analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.44060561 <a title="350-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Low-Rank_Subspace_Clustering.html">277 nips-2012-Probabilistic Low-Rank Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: S. D. Babacan, Shinichi Nakajima, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering data points into lowdimensional subspaces in the presence of outliers. We pose the problem using a density estimation formulation with an associated generative model. Based on this probability model, we ﬁrst develop an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and then derive its global solution. In addition, we develop two Bayesian methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) approximation, which are capable of automatic dimensionality selection. While the ﬁrst method is based on an alternating optimization scheme for all unknowns, the second method makes use of recent results in VB matrix factorization leading to fast and effective estimation. Both methods are extended to handle sparse outliers for robustness and can handle missing values. Experimental results suggest that proposed methods are very effective in subspace clustering and identifying outliers. 1</p><p>6 0.41804251 <a title="350-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Convex_Formulation_for_Learning_Scale-Free_Networks_via_Submodular_Relaxation.html">6 nips-2012-A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation</a></p>

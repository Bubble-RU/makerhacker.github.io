<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Musé, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graphical models are a very useful tool to describe and understand natural phenomena, from gene expression to climate change and social interactions. The topological structure of these graphs/networks is a fundamental part of the analysis, and in many cases the main goal of the study. However, little work has been done on incorporating prior topological knowledge onto the estimation of the underlying graphical models from sample data. In this work we propose extensions to the basic joint regression model for network estimation, which explicitly incorporate graph-topological constraints into the corresponding optimization approach. The ﬁrst proposed extension includes an eigenvector centrality constraint, thereby promoting this important prior topological property. The second developed extension promotes the formation of certain motifs, triangle-shaped ones in particular, which are known to exist for example in genetic regulatory networks. The presentation of the underlying formulations, which serve as examples of the introduction of topological constraints in network estimation, is complemented with examples in diverse datasets demonstrating the importance of incorporating such critical prior knowledge. 1</p><p>3 0.13200998 <a title="327-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Convex_Formulation_for_Learning_Scale-Free_Networks_via_Submodular_Relaxation.html">6 nips-2012-A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Defazio, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data. We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lov´ sz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes a such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset.</p><p>4 0.1090466 <a title="327-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Patient_Risk_Stratification_for_Hospital-Associated_C._diff_as_a_Time-Series_Classification_Task.html">266 nips-2012-Patient Risk Stratification for Hospital-Associated C. diff as a Time-Series Classification Task</a></p>
<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, Eric Horvitz, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: A patient’s risk for adverse events is affected by temporal processes including the nature and timing of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, and the overall evolution of the patient’s pathophysiology over time. Yet many investigators ignore this temporal aspect when modeling patient outcomes, considering only the patient’s current or aggregate state. In this paper, we represent patient risk as a time series. In doing so, patient risk stratiﬁcation becomes a time-series classiﬁcation task. The task differs from most applications of time-series analysis, like speech processing, since the time series itself must ﬁrst be extracted. Thus, we begin by deﬁning and extracting approximate risk processes, the evolving approximate daily risk of a patient. Once obtained, we use these signals to explore different approaches to time-series classiﬁcation with the goal of identifying high-risk patterns. We apply the classiﬁcation to the speciﬁc task of identifying patients at risk of testing positive for hospital acquired Clostridium difﬁcile. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 on a held-out set of several hundred patients. Our two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation outperforms classiﬁers that consider only a patient’s current state (p<0.05). 1</p><p>5 0.10460407 <a title="327-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Structure_estimation_for_discrete_graphical_models%3A_Generalized_covariance_matrices_and_their_inverses.html">326 nips-2012-Structure estimation for discrete graphical models: Generalized covariance matrices and their inverses</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a curious relationship between the structure of a discrete graphical model and the support of the inverse of a generalized covariance matrix. We show that for certain graph structures, the support of the inverse covariance matrix of indicator variables on the vertices of a graph reﬂects the conditional independence structure of the graph. Our work extends results that have previously been established only in the context of multivariate Gaussian graphical models, thereby addressing an open question about the signiﬁcance of the inverse covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian distribution. Based on our population-level results, we show how the graphical Lasso may be used to recover the edge structure of certain classes of discrete graphical models, and present simulations to verify our theoretical results. 1</p><p>6 0.09647353 <a title="327-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Antonino Freno, Mikaela Keller, Marc Tommasi</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some speciﬁc graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network properties. Second, we use the deﬁned statistic to develop the Fiedler random ﬁeld model, which allows for efﬁcient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random ﬁelds, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches.</p><p>4 0.64872915 <a title="327-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Convex_Formulation_for_Learning_Scale-Free_Networks_via_Submodular_Relaxation.html">6 nips-2012-A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation</a></p>

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, Junming Yin, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue for representing networks as a bag of triangular motifs, particularly for important network problems that current model-based approaches handle poorly due to computational bottlenecks incurred by using edge representations. Such approaches require both 1-edges and 0-edges (missing edges) to be provided as input, and as a consequence, approximate inference algorithms for these models usually require Ω(N 2 ) time per iteration, precluding their application to larger real-world networks. In contrast, triangular modeling requires less computation, while providing equivalent or better inference quality. A triangular motif is a vertex triple containing 2 or 3 edges, and the number of such motifs is 2 Θ( i Di ) (where Di is the degree of vertex i), which is much smaller than N 2 for low-maximum-degree networks. Using this representation, we develop a novel mixed-membership network model and approximate inference algorithm suitable for large networks with low max-degree. For networks with high maximum degree, the triangular motifs can be naturally subsampled in a node-centric fashion, allowing for much faster inference at a small cost in accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach, when compared to that of an edge-based model, has faster runtime and improved accuracy for mixed-membership community detection. We conclude with a large-scale demonstration on an N ≈ 280, 000-node network, which is infeasible for network models with Ω(N 2 ) inference cost. 1</p><p>6 0.62741208 <a title="327-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_Inference_of_Overlapping_Communities.html">298 nips-2012-Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities</a></p>

<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Maneesh Sahani, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for instance when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons. Here, we show how spectral learning methods (usually called subspace identiﬁcation in this context) for linear systems with linear-Gaussian observations can be extended to estimate the parameters of a generalised-linear dynamical system model despite a non-linear and non-Gaussian observation process. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.</p><p>3 0.64409649 <a title="327-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-CPRL_--_An_Extension_of_Compressive_Sensing_to_the_Phase_Retrieval_Problem.html">63 nips-2012-CPRL -- An Extension of Compressive Sensing to the Phase Retrieval Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Henrik Ohlsson, Allen Yang, Roy Dong, Shankar Sastry</p><p>Abstract: While compressive sensing (CS) has been one of the most vibrant research ﬁelds in the past few years, most development only applies to linear models. This limits its application in many areas where CS could make a difference. This paper presents a novel extension of CS to the phase retrieval problem, where intensity measurements of a linear system are used to recover a complex sparse signal. We propose a novel solution using a lifting technique – CPRL, which relaxes the NP-hard problem to a nonsmooth semideﬁnite program. Our analysis shows that CPRL inherits many desirable properties from CS, such as guarantees for exact recovery. We further provide scalable numerical solvers to accelerate its implementation. 1</p><p>4 0.64348787 <a title="327-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Robust_PCA.html">254 nips-2012-On the Sample Complexity of Robust PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Coudron, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate the rate of convergence and sample complexity of a recent robust estimator for a generalized version of the inverse covariance matrix. This estimator is used in a convex algorithm for robust subspace recovery (i.e., robust PCA). Our model assumes a sub-Gaussian underlying distribution and an i.i.d. sample from it. Our main result shows with high probability that the norm of the difference between the generalized inverse covariance of the underlying distribution and its estimator from an i.i.d. sample of size N is of order O(N −0.5+ ) for arbitrarily small > 0 (affecting the probabilistic estimate); this rate of convergence is close to the one of direct covariance estimation, i.e., O(N −0.5 ). Our precise probabilistic estimate implies for some natural settings that the sample complexity of the generalized inverse covariance estimation when using the Frobenius norm is O(D2+δ ) for arbitrarily small δ > 0 (whereas the sample complexity of direct covariance estimation with Frobenius norm is O(D2 )). These results provide similar rates of convergence and sample complexity for the corresponding robust subspace recovery algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work analyzing the sample complexity of any robust PCA algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.64328521 <a title="327-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Expectation_Propagation_in_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems.html">121 nips-2012-Expectation Propagation in Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc Deisenroth, Shakir Mohamed</p><p>Abstract: Rich and complex time-series data, such as those generated from engineering systems, ﬁnancial markets, videos, or neural recordings are now a common feature of modern data analysis. Explaining the phenomena underlying these diverse data sets requires ﬂexible and accurate models. In this paper, we promote Gaussian process dynamical systems as a rich model class that is appropriate for such an analysis. We present a new approximate message-passing algorithm for Bayesian state estimation and inference in Gaussian process dynamical systems, a nonparametric probabilistic generalization of commonly used state-space models. We derive our message-passing algorithm using Expectation Propagation and provide a unifying perspective on message passing in general state-space models. We show that existing Gaussian ﬁlters and smoothers appear as special cases within our inference framework, and that these existing approaches can be improved upon using iterated message passing. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that iterated message passing can improve inference in a wide range of tasks in Bayesian state estimation, thus leading to improved predictions and more effective decision making. 1</p><p>6 0.6419605 <a title="327-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Ensemble_weighted_kernel_estimators_for_multivariate_entropy_estimation.html">117 nips-2012-Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation</a></p>

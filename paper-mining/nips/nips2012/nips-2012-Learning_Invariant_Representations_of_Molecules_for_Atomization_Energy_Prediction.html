<p>Author: Deepak Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate</p><p>Abstract: First-order probabilistic models combine the power of ﬁrst-order logic, the de facto tool for handling relational structure, with probabilistic graphical models, the de facto tool for handling uncertainty. Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms for them have been the subject of much recent research. The main idea in these algorithms is to improve the accuracy and scalability of existing graphical models’ inference algorithms by exploiting symmetry in the ﬁrst-order representation. In this paper, we consider blocked Gibbs sampling, an advanced MCMC scheme, and lift it to the ﬁrst-order level. We propose to achieve this by partitioning the ﬁrst-order atoms in the model into a set of disjoint clusters such that exact lifted inference is polynomial in each cluster given an assignment to all other atoms not in the cluster. We propose an approach for constructing the clusters and show how it can be used to trade accuracy with computational complexity in a principled manner. Our experimental evaluation shows that lifted Gibbs sampling is superior to the propositional algorithm in terms of accuracy, scalability and convergence.</p><p>3 0.056136355 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Slice_sampling_normalized_kernel-weighted_completely_random_measure_mixture_models.html">315 nips-2012-Slice sampling normalized kernel-weighted completely random measure mixture models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Foti, Sinead Williamson</p><p>Abstract: A number of dependent nonparametric processes have been proposed to model non-stationary data with unknown latent dimensionality.

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, John W. Fisher</p><p>Abstract: Mixture distributions are often used to model complex data. In this paper, we develop a new method that jointly estimates mixture models over multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependencies between them. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a set of latent Dirichlet processes as sources of component models (atoms), and for each data set, we construct a nonparametric mixture model by combining sub-sampled versions of the latent DPs. Each mixture model may acquire atoms from different latent DPs, while each atom may be shared by multiple mixtures. This multi-to-multi association distinguishes the proposed method from previous ones that require the model structure to be a tree or a chain, allowing more ﬂexible designs. We also derive a sampling algorithm that jointly infers the model parameters and present experiments on both document analysis and image modeling. 1</p><p>5 0.039318852 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.html">158 nips-2012-ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of ﬁve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a ﬁnal 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry. 1</p><p>6 0.039133187 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

The model is based on the theory of completely random measures and is able to handle a potentially inﬁnite number of nodes. We show that the model has appealing properties and in particular it may exhibit a power-law behavior. We derive a posterior characterization, a generative process for network growth, and a simple Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. Our model is shown to be well ﬁtted to several real-world social networks. 1</p><p>4 0.5630396 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Coupling_Nonparametric_Mixtures_via_Latent_Dirichlet_Processes.html">89 nips-2012-Coupling Nonparametric Mixtures via Latent Dirichlet Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Amir M. Farahmand, Doina Precup</p><p>Abstract: Value Pursuit Iteration (VPI) is an approximate value iteration algorithm that ﬁnds a close to optimal policy for reinforcement learning problems with large state spaces. VPI has two main features: First, it is a nonparametric algorithm that ﬁnds a good sparse approximation of the optimal value function given a dictionary of features. The algorithm is almost insensitive to the number of irrelevant features. Second, after each iteration of VPI, the algorithm adds a set of functions based on the currently learned value function to the dictionary. This increases the representation power of the dictionary in a way that is directly relevant to the goal of having a good approximation of the optimal value function. We theoretically study VPI and provide a ﬁnite-sample error upper bound for it. 1</p><p>6 0.50407225 <a title="177-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-On_Lifting_the_Gibbs_Sampling_Algorithm.html">251 nips-2012-On Lifting the Gibbs Sampling Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Weixin Li, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the dynamic structure of human activities in the attributes space. A video sequence is Ä?Ĺš rst represented in a semantic feature space, where each feature encodes the probability of occurrence of an activity attribute at a given time. A generative model, denoted the binary dynamic system (BDS), is proposed to learn both the distribution and dynamics of different activities in this space. The BDS is a non-linear dynamic system, which extends both the binary principal component analysis (PCA) and classical linear dynamic systems (LDS), by combining binary observation variables with a hidden Gauss-Markov state process. In this way, it integrates the representation power of semantic modeling with the ability of dynamic systems to capture the temporal structure of time-varying processes. An algorithm for learning BDS parameters, inspired by a popular LDS learning method from dynamic textures, is proposed. A similarity measure between BDSs, which generalizes the BinetCauchy kernel for LDS, is then introduced and used to design activity classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The proposed method is shown to outperform similar classiÄ?Ĺš ers derived from the kernel dynamic system (KDS) and state-of-the-art approaches for dynamics-based or attribute-based action recognition. 1</p><p>3 0.59814012 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Multi-Task_Averaging.html">222 nips-2012-Multi-Task Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Feldman, Maya Gupta, Bela Frigyik</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-task learning approach to jointly estimate the means of multiple independent data sets. The proposed multi-task averaging (MTA) algorithm results in a convex combination of the single-task averages. We derive the optimal amount of regularization, and show that it can be effectively estimated. Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that MTA outperforms both maximum likelihood and James-Stein estimators, and that our approach to estimating the amount of regularization rivals cross-validation in performance but is more computationally efﬁcient. 1</p><p>4 0.50177509 <a title="177-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_n-Choose-k_Models_for_Classification_and_Ranking.html">278 nips-2012-Probabilistic n-Choose-k Models for Classification and Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Swersky, Brendan J. Frey, Daniel Tarlow, Richard S. Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In categorical data there is often structure in the number of variables that take on each label. For example, the total number of objects in an image and the number of highly relevant documents per query in web search both tend to follow a structured distribution. In this paper, we study a probabilistic model that explicitly includes a prior distribution over such counts, along with a count-conditional likelihood that deﬁnes probabilities over all subsets of a given size. When labels are binary and the prior over counts is a Poisson-Binomial distribution, a standard logistic regression model is recovered, but for other count distributions, such priors induce global dependencies and combinatorics that appear to complicate learning and inference. However, we demonstrate that simple, efﬁcient learning procedures can be derived for more general forms of this model. We illustrate the utility of the formulation by exploring applications to multi-object classiﬁcation, learning to rank, and top-K classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.45468915 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Truncation-free_Online_Variational_Inference_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models.html">355 nips-2012-Truncation-free Online Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We present a truncation-free stochastic variational inference algorithm for Bayesian nonparametric models. While traditional variational inference algorithms require truncations for the model or the variational distribution, our method adapts model complexity on the ﬂy. We studied our method with Dirichlet process mixture models and hierarchical Dirichlet process topic models on two large data sets. Our method performs better than previous stochastic variational inference algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.45407265 <a title="177-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Nonconvex_Penalization_Using_Laplace_Exponents_and_Concave_Conjugates.html">244 nips-2012-Nonconvex Penalization Using Laplace Exponents and Concave Conjugates</a></p>

<p>Author: Junyuan Xie, Linli Xu, Enhong Chen</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to low-level vision problems that combines sparse coding and deep networks pre-trained with denoising auto-encoder (DA). We propose an alternative training scheme that successfully adapts DA, originally designed for unsupervised feature learning, to the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. Our method’s performance in the image denoising task is comparable to that of KSVD which is a widely used sparse coding technique. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Speciﬁcally, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning. 1</p><p>4 0.15731087 <a title="281-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Controlled_Recognition_Bounds_for_Visual_Learning_and_Exploration.html">83 nips-2012-Controlled Recognition Bounds for Visual Learning and Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Vasiliy Karasev, Alessandro Chiuso, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe the tradeoff between the performance in a visual recognition problem and the control authority that the agent can exercise on the sensing process. We focus on the problem of “visual search” of an object in an otherwise known and static scene, propose a measure of control authority, and relate it to the expected risk and its proxy (conditional entropy of the posterior density). We show this analytically, as well as empirically by simulation using the simplest known model that captures the phenomenology of image formation, including scaling and occlusions. We show that a “passive” agent given a training set can provide no guarantees on performance beyond what is afforded by the priors, and that an “omnipotent” agent, capable of inﬁnite control authority, can achieve arbitrarily good performance (asymptotically). In between these limiting cases, the tradeoff can be characterized empirically. 1</p><p>5 0.15577705 <a title="281-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Spectral_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">19 nips-2012-A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Yi-kai Liu, Daniel J. Hsu, Dean P. Foster, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling is a generalization of clustering that posits that observations (words in a document) are generated by multiple latent factors (topics), as opposed to just one. This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic-word distributions when only words are observed, and the topics are hidden. This work provides a simple and efﬁcient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of topic models, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic-word distributions and the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over the topic mixtures, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, called Excess Correlation Analysis, is based on a spectral decomposition of low-order moments via two singular value decompositions (SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable, since the SVDs are carried out only on k × k matrices, where k is the number of latent factors (topics) and is typically much smaller than the dimension of the observation (word) space. 1</p><p>6 0.14874057 <a title="281-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Scalable_CUR_Matrix_Decomposition_Algorithm%3A_Lower_Time_Complexity_and_Tighter_Bound.html">17 nips-2012-A Scalable CUR Matrix Decomposition Algorithm: Lower Time Complexity and Tighter Bound</a></p>

<p>Author: Borja Balle, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in text and speech processing and computational biology require estimating functions mapping strings to real numbers. A broad class of such functions can be deﬁned by weighted automata. Spectral methods based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix have been recently proposed for learning a probability distribution represented by a weighted automaton from a training sample drawn according to this same target distribution. In this paper, we show how spectral methods can be extended to the problem of learning a general weighted automaton from a sample generated by an arbitrary distribution. The main obstruction to this approach is that, in general, some entries of the Hankel matrix may be missing. We present a solution to this problem based on solving a constrained matrix completion problem. Combining these two ingredients, matrix completion and spectral method, a whole new family of algorithms for learning general weighted automata is obtained. We present generalization bounds for a particular algorithm in this family. The proofs rely on a joint stability analysis of matrix completion and spectral learning. 1</p><p>3 0.63230771 <a title="281-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Mirror_Descent_Meets_Fixed_Share_%28and_feels_no_regret%29.html">216 nips-2012-Mirror Descent Meets Fixed Share (and feels no regret)</a></p>

<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Maneesh Sahani, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for instance when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons. Here, we show how spectral learning methods (usually called subspace identiﬁcation in this context) for linear systems with linear-Gaussian observations can be extended to estimate the parameters of a generalised-linear dynamical system model despite a non-linear and non-Gaussian observation process. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.</p><p>5 0.56931973 <a title="281-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Scalable_CUR_Matrix_Decomposition_Algorithm%3A_Lower_Time_Complexity_and_Tighter_Bound.html">17 nips-2012-A Scalable CUR Matrix Decomposition Algorithm: Lower Time Complexity and Tighter Bound</a></p>
<p>Author: Shusen Wang, Zhihua Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The CUR matrix decomposition is an important extension of Nystr¨ m approximao tion to a general matrix. It approximates any data matrix in terms of a small number of its columns and rows. In this paper we propose a novel randomized CUR algorithm with an expected relative-error bound. The proposed algorithm has the advantages over the existing relative-error CUR algorithms that it possesses tighter theoretical bound and lower time complexity, and that it can avoid maintaining the whole data matrix in main memory. Finally, experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement over the existing relative-error algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.56931669 <a title="281-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Perfect_Dimensionality_Recovery_by_Variational_Bayesian_PCA.html">268 nips-2012-Perfect Dimensionality Recovery by Variational Bayesian PCA</a></p>

<p>Author: Po-ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a curious relationship between the structure of a discrete graphical model and the support of the inverse of a generalized covariance matrix. We show that for certain graph structures, the support of the inverse covariance matrix of indicator variables on the vertices of a graph reﬂects the conditional independence structure of the graph. Our work extends results that have previously been established only in the context of multivariate Gaussian graphical models, thereby addressing an open question about the signiﬁcance of the inverse covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian distribution. Based on our population-level results, we show how the graphical Lasso may be used to recover the edge structure of certain classes of discrete graphical models, and present simulations to verify our theoretical results. 1</p><p>2 0.98816627 <a title="281-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-MAP_Inference_in_Chains_using_Column_Generation.html">204 nips-2012-MAP Inference in Chains using Column Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Belanger, Alexandre Passos, Sebastian Riedel, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Linear chains and trees are basic building blocks in many applications of graphical models, and they admit simple exact maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms based on message passing. However, in many cases this computation is prohibitively expensive, due to quadratic dependence on variables’ domain sizes. The standard algorithms are inefﬁcient because they compute scores for hypotheses for which there is strong negative local evidence. For this reason there has been signiﬁcant previous interest in beam search and its variants; however, these methods provide only approximate results. This paper presents new exact inference algorithms based on the combination of column generation and pre-computed bounds on terms of the model’s scoring function. While we do not improve worst-case performance, our method substantially speeds real-world, typical-case inference in chains and trees. Experiments show our method to be twice as fast as exact Viterbi for Wall Street Journal part-of-speech tagging and over thirteen times faster for a joint part-of-speed and named-entity-recognition task. Our algorithm is also extendable to new techniques for approximate inference, to faster 0/1 loss oracles, and new opportunities for connections between inference and learning. We encourage further exploration of high-level reasoning about the optimization problem implicit in dynamic programs. 1</p><p>3 0.98701644 <a title="281-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Simultaneously_Leveraging_Output_and_Task_Structures_for_Multiple-Output_Regression.html">312 nips-2012-Simultaneously Leveraging Output and Task Structures for Multiple-Output Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Piyush Rai, Abhishek Kumar, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Multiple-output regression models require estimating multiple parameters, one for each output. Structural regularization is usually employed to improve parameter estimation in such models. In this paper, we present a multiple-output regression model that leverages the covariance structure of the latent model parameters as well as the conditional covariance structure of the observed outputs. This is in contrast with existing methods that usually take into account only one of these structures. More importantly, unlike some of the other existing methods, none of these structures need be known a priori in our model, and are learned from the data. Several previously proposed structural regularization based multiple-output regression models turn out to be special cases of our model. Moreover, in addition to being a rich model for multiple-output regression, our model can also be used in estimating the graphical model structure of a set of variables (multivariate outputs) conditioned on another set of variables (inputs). Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 1</p><p>4 0.97292066 <a title="281-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Recursive_Perceptual_Representations.html">197 nips-2012-Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Oriol Vinyals, Yangqing Jia, Li Deng, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become very popular in vision as part of state-of-the-art object recognition and other classiﬁcation tasks but require high dimensional feature spaces for good performance. Deep learning methods can ﬁnd more compact representations but current methods employ multilayer perceptrons that require solving a difﬁcult, non-convex optimization problem. We propose a deep non-linear classiﬁer whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications. The use of random projections is key to our method, as we show in the experiments section, in which we observe a consistent improvement over previous –often more complicated– methods on several vision and speech benchmarks. 1</p><p>5 0.97143674 <a title="281-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-The_Bethe_Partition_Function_of_Log-supermodular_Graphical_Models.html">335 nips-2012-The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Ruozzi</p><p>Abstract: Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any ﬁxed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the “four functions” theorem that may be of independent interest. 1</p><p>6 0.96886456 <a title="281-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Tianbao Yang, Yu-feng Li, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Rong Jin, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Both random Fourier features and the Nystr¨ m method have been successfully o applied to efﬁcient kernel learning. In this work, we investigate the fundamental difference between these two approaches, and how the difference could affect their generalization performances. Unlike approaches based on random Fourier features where the basis functions (i.e., cosine and sine functions) are sampled from a distribution independent from the training data, basis functions used by the Nystr¨ m method are randomly sampled from the training examples and are o therefore data dependent. By exploring this difference, we show that when there is a large gap in the eigen-spectrum of the kernel matrix, approaches based on the Nystr¨ m method can yield impressively better generalization error bound than o random Fourier features based approach. We empirically verify our theoretical ﬁndings on a wide range of large data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.10111796 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Fast_Resampling_Weighted_v-Statistics.html">128 nips-2012-Fast Resampling Weighted v-Statistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunxiao Zhou, Jiseong Park, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel and computationally fast algorithm for computing weighted v-statistics in resampling both univariate and multivariate data is proposed. To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with ﬁnite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efﬁcient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry orders and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level. 1</p><p>4 0.099253647 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Mixability_in_Statistical_Learning.html">217 nips-2012-Mixability in Statistical Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Peter Grünwald, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Statistical learning and sequential prediction are two different but related formalisms to study the quality of predictions. Mapping out their relations and transferring ideas is an active area of investigation. We provide another piece of the puzzle by showing that an important concept in sequential prediction, the mixability of a loss, has a natural counterpart in the statistical setting, which we call stochastic mixability. Just as ordinary mixability characterizes fast rates for the worst-case regret in sequential prediction, stochastic mixability characterizes fast rates in statistical learning. We show that, in the special case of log-loss, stochastic mixability reduces to a well-known (but usually unnamed) martingale condition, which is used in existing convergence theorems for minimum description length and Bayesian inference. In the case of 0/1-loss, it reduces to the margin condition of Mammen and Tsybakov, and in the case that the model under consideration contains all possible predictors, it is equivalent to ordinary mixability. 1</p><p>5 0.094349295 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Nonconvex_Penalization_Using_Laplace_Exponents_and_Concave_Conjugates.html">244 nips-2012-Nonconvex Penalization Using Laplace Exponents and Concave Conjugates</a></p>

Additionally, we explore the concave conjugate of nonconvex penalties. We ﬁnd that the LOG and EXP penalties are the concave conjugates of negative Kullback-Leiber (KL) distance functions. Furthermore, the relationship between these two penalties is due to asymmetricity of the KL distance. 1</p><p>6 0.094071493 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">127 nips-2012-Fast Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>

This opens new possibles applications of IB to continuous data and provides a solution more robust to outliers. 1</p><p>3 0.66857505 <a title="37-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">127 nips-2012-Fast Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>

Murphy</p><p>Abstract: We present a new variational inference algorithm for Gaussian process regression with non-conjugate likelihood functions, with application to a wide array of problems including binary and multi-class classiﬁcation, and ordinal regression. Our method constructs a concave lower bound that is optimized using an efﬁcient ﬁxed-point updating algorithm. We show that the new algorithm has highly competitive computational complexity, matching that of alternative approximate inference methods. We also prove that the use of concave variational bounds provides stable and guaranteed convergence – a property not available to other approaches. We show empirically for both binary and multi-class classiﬁcation that our new algorithm converges much faster than existing variational methods, and without any degradation in performance. 1</p><p>4 0.66383338 <a title="37-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Nonconvex_Penalization_Using_Laplace_Exponents_and_Concave_Conjugates.html">244 nips-2012-Nonconvex Penalization Using Laplace Exponents and Concave Conjugates</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Jian Peng, Alex Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a popular paradigm for labeling large datasets. However, it has given rise to the computational task of aggregating the crowdsourced labels provided by a collection of unreliable annotators. We approach this problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in graphical models, and applying approximate variational methods, including belief propagation (BP) and mean ﬁeld (MF). We show that our BP algorithm generalizes both majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger et al. [1], while our MF method is closely related to a commonly used EM algorithm. In both cases, we ﬁnd that the performance of the algorithms critically depends on the choice of a prior distribution on the workers’ reliability; by choosing the prior properly, both BP and MF (and EM) perform surprisingly well on both simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms based on more complicated modeling assumptions. 1</p><p>6 0.61612427 <a title="37-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Nonparanormal_Belief_Propagation_%28NPNBP%29.html">248 nips-2012-Nonparanormal Belief Propagation (NPNBP)</a></p>

<p>Author: Gary Huang, Marwan Mattar, Honglak Lee, Erik G. Learned-miller</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised joint alignment of images has been demonstrated to improve performance on recognition tasks such as face veriﬁcation. Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly aligned examples. However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of complex, real-world images has required the careful selection of feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape. In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Speciﬁcally, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the speciﬁc data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned ﬁlters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW). Using the aligned images produced by our proposed unsupervised algorithm, we achieve higher accuracy in face veriﬁcation compared to prior work in both unsupervised and supervised alignment. We also match the accuracy for the best available commercial method. 1</p><p>3 0.60530859 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Nonparametric_Conjugate_Prior_Distribution_for_the_Maximizing_Argument_of_a_Noisy_Function.html">13 nips-2012-A Nonparametric Conjugate Prior Distribution for the Maximizing Argument of a Noisy Function</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro Ortega, Jordi Grau-moya, Tim Genewein, David Balduzzi, Daniel Braun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve ﬁnding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of ﬁrst, doing inference over the function space and second, ﬁnding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior based on a kernel regressor. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function. Given t observations of the function, the posterior can be evaluated efﬁciently in time O(t2 ) up to a multiplicative constant. Finally, we show how to apply our model to optimize a noisy, non-convex, high-dimensional objective function.</p><p>4 0.60464591 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-CPRL_--_An_Extension_of_Compressive_Sensing_to_the_Phase_Retrieval_Problem.html">63 nips-2012-CPRL -- An Extension of Compressive Sensing to the Phase Retrieval Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Henrik Ohlsson, Allen Yang, Roy Dong, Shankar Sastry</p><p>Abstract: While compressive sensing (CS) has been one of the most vibrant research ﬁelds in the past few years, most development only applies to linear models. This limits its application in many areas where CS could make a difference. This paper presents a novel extension of CS to the phase retrieval problem, where intensity measurements of a linear system are used to recover a complex sparse signal. We propose a novel solution using a lifting technique – CPRL, which relaxes the NP-hard problem to a nonsmooth semideﬁnite program. Our analysis shows that CPRL inherits many desirable properties from CS, such as guarantees for exact recovery.

We propose a calibrated spectrum elastic net method with a sum of the nuclear and Frobenius penalties and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the convex minimization problem. The iterative algorithm alternates between imputing the missing entries in the incomplete matrix by the current guess and estimating the matrix by a scaled soft-thresholding singular value decomposition of the imputed matrix until the resulting matrix converges. A calibration step follows to correct the bias caused by the Frobenius penalty. Under proper coherence conditions and for suitable penalties levels, we prove that the proposed estimator achieves an error bound of nearly optimal order and in proportion to the noise level. This provides a uniﬁed analysis of the noisy and noiseless matrix completion problems. Simulation results are presented to compare our proposal with previous ones. 1</p><p>6 0.60217357 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Zohar Karnin</p><p>Abstract: We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classiﬁcation formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classiﬁcation problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known. 1</p><p>3 0.20261043 <a title="227-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Classification_Calibration_Dimension_for_General_Multiclass_Losses.html">67 nips-2012-Classification Calibration Dimension for General Multiclass Losses</a></p>
<p>Author: Harish G. Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: We study consistency properties of surrogate loss functions for general multiclass classiﬁcation problems, deﬁned by a general loss matrix. We extend the notion of classiﬁcation calibration, which has been studied for binary and multiclass 0-1 classiﬁcation problems (and for certain other speciﬁc learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a surrogate loss to be classiﬁcation calibrated with respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of classiﬁcation calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the smallest ‘size’ of a prediction space for which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is classiﬁcation calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, as one application, we provide a different route from the recent result of Duchi et al. (2010) for analyzing the difﬁculty of designing ‘low-dimensional’ convex surrogates that are consistent with respect to pairwise subset ranking losses. We anticipate the classiﬁcation calibration dimension may prove to be a useful tool in the study and design of surrogate losses for general multiclass learning problems. 1</p><p>4 0.16289452 <a title="227-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Recovery_of_Sparse_Probability_Measures_via_Convex_Programming.html">290 nips-2012-Recovery of Sparse Probability Measures via Convex Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Mert Pilanci, Laurent E. Ghaoui, Venkat Chandrasekaran</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of cardinality penalized optimization of a convex function over the probability simplex with additional convex constraints. The classical 1 regularizer fails to promote sparsity on the probability simplex since 1 norm on the probability simplex is trivially constant. We propose a direct relaxation of the minimum cardinality problem and show that it can be efﬁciently solved using convex programming. As a ﬁrst application we consider recovering a sparse probability measure given moment constraints, in which our formulation becomes linear programming, hence can be solved very efﬁciently. A sufﬁcient condition for exact recovery of the minimum cardinality solution is derived for arbitrary afﬁne constraints. We then develop a penalized version for the noisy setting which can be solved using second order cone programs. The proposed method outperforms known rescaling heuristics based on 1 norm. As a second application we consider convex clustering using a sparse Gaussian mixture and compare our results with the well known soft k-means algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.16101861 <a title="227-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Local_Supervised_Learning_through_Space_Partitioning.html">200 nips-2012-Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Wang, Venkatesh Saligrama</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach for supervised learning based on adaptively partitioning the feature space into different regions and learning local region-speciﬁc classiﬁers. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem that incorporates both partitioning and classiﬁcation in to a single global objective. We show that space partitioning can be equivalently reformulated as a supervised learning problem and consequently any discriminative learning method can be utilized in conjunction with our approach. Nevertheless, we consider locally linear schemes by learning linear partitions and linear region classiﬁers. Locally linear schemes can not only approximate complex decision boundaries and ensure low training error but also provide tight control on over-ﬁtting and generalization error. We train locally linear classiﬁers by using LDA, logistic regression and perceptrons, and so our scheme is scalable to large data sizes and high-dimensions. We present experimental results demonstrating improved performance over state of the art classiﬁcation techniques on benchmark datasets. We also show improved robustness to label noise.</p><p>6 0.15869236 <a title="227-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_as_MAP_Inference_in_Discrete_Graphical_Models.html">186 nips-2012-Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Aharon Birnbaum, Shai S. Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: Given α, ϵ, we study the time complexity required to improperly learn a halfspace with misclassiﬁcation error rate of at most (1 + α) L∗ + ϵ, where L∗ is the γ γ optimal γ-margin error rate. For α = 1/γ, polynomial time and sample complexity is achievable using the hinge-loss. For α = 0, Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2011] showed that poly(1/γ) time is impossible, while learning is possible in ˜ time exp(O(1/γ)). An immediate question, which this paper tackles, is what is achievable if α ∈ (0, 1/γ). We derive positive results interpolating between the polynomial time for α = 1/γ and the exponential time for α = 0. In particular, we show that there are cases in which α = o(1/γ) but the problem is still solvable in polynomial time. Our results naturally extend to the adversarial online learning model and to the PAC learning with malicious noise model. 1</p><p>5 0.64589071 <a title="227-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Volume_Regularization_for_Binary_Classification.html">361 nips-2012-Volume Regularization for Binary Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Tal Wagner</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a large-volume box classiﬁcation for binary prediction, which maintains a subset of weight vectors, and speciﬁcally axis-aligned boxes. Our learning algorithm seeks for a box of large volume that contains “simple” weight vectors which most of are accurate on the training set. Two versions of the learning process are cast as convex optimization problems, and it is shown how to solve them efﬁciently. The formulation yields a natural PAC-Bayesian performance bound and it is shown to minimize a quantity directly aligned with it. The algorithm outperforms SVM and the recently proposed AROW algorithm on a majority of 30 NLP datasets and binarized USPS optical character recognition datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.63255078 <a title="227-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Proper_losses_for_learning_from_partial_labels.html">280 nips-2012-Proper losses for learning from partial labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Krafft, Juston Moore, Bruce Desmarais, Hanna M. Wallach</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian admixture model intended for exploratory analysis of communication networks—speciﬁcally, the discovery and visualization of topic-speciﬁc subnetworks in email data sets. Our model produces principled visualizations of email networks, i.e., visualizations that have precise mathematical interpretations in terms of our model and its relationship to the observed data. We validate our modeling assumptions by demonstrating that our model achieves better link prediction performance than three state-of-the-art network models and exhibits topic coherence comparable to that of latent Dirichlet allocation. We showcase our model’s ability to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc communication patterns using a new email data set: the New Hanover County email network. We provide an extensive analysis of these communication patterns, leading us to recommend our model for any exploratory analysis of email networks or other similarly-structured communication data. Finally, we advocate for principled visualization as a primary objective in the development of new network models. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83680815 <a title="227-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Multiclass_Learning_with_Simplex_Coding.html">227 nips-2012-Multiclass Learning with Simplex Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinfeng Yi, Rong Jin, Shaili Jain, Tianbao Yang, Anil K. Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in data clustering is to deﬁne an appropriate similarity measure between two objects. Crowdclustering addresses this challenge by deﬁning the pairwise similarity based on the manual annotations obtained through crowdsourcing. Despite its encouraging results, a key limitation of crowdclustering is that it can only cluster objects when their manual annotations are available. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach for clustering, called semi-crowdsourced clustering that effectively combines the low-level features of objects with the manual annotations of a subset of the objects obtained via crowdsourcing. The key idea is to learn an appropriate similarity measure, based on the low-level features of objects and from the manual annotations of only a small portion of the data to be clustered. One difﬁculty in learning the pairwise similarity measure is that there is a signiﬁcant amount of noise and inter-worker variations in the manual annotations obtained via crowdsourcing. We address this difﬁculty by developing a metric learning algorithm based on the matrix completion method. Our empirical study with two real-world image data sets shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art distance metric learning algorithms in both clustering accuracy and computational efﬁciency. 1</p><p>4 0.82100368 <a title="227-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Non-Parametric_Copulas.html">308 nips-2012-Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Non-Parametric Copulas</a></p>

Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected and corrected to adapt a density model accross different learning domains. Importantly, we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this factorization in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression problems with real-world data illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. 1</p><p>5 0.80024034 <a title="227-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Multiclass_Learning_Approaches%3A_A_Theoretical_Comparison_with_Implications.html">226 nips-2012-Multiclass Learning Approaches: A Theoretical Comparison with Implications</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Daniely, Sivan Sabato, Shai S. Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: We theoretically analyze and compare the following ﬁve popular multiclass classiﬁcation methods: One vs. All, All Pairs, Tree-based classiﬁers, Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) with randomly generated code matrices, and Multiclass SVM. In the ﬁrst four methods, the classiﬁcation is based on a reduction to binary classiﬁcation. We consider the case where the binary classiﬁer comes from a class of VC dimension d, and in particular from the class of halfspaces over Rd . We analyze both the estimation error and the approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interesting conclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the different approaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VC theory to analyze the approximation error of hypothesis classes. This is in contrast to most previous uses of VC theory, which only deal with estimation error. 1</p><p>6 0.79917026 <a title="227-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Image_Descriptors_with_the_Boosting-Trick.html">176 nips-2012-Learning Image Descriptors with the Boosting-Trick</a></p>

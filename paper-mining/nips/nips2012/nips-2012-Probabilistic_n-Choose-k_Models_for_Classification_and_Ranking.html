Nonlinear sparse coding with spike-and-slab prior for neurally plausible image encoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Sterne, Joerg Bornschein, Abdul-saboor Sheikh, Joerg Luecke, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Modelling natural images with sparse coding (SC) has faced two main challenges: ﬂexibly representing varying pixel intensities and realistically representing lowlevel image components. This paper proposes a novel multiple-cause generative model of low-level image statistics that generalizes the standard SC model in two crucial points: (1) it uses a spike-and-slab prior distribution for a more realistic representation of component absence/intensity, and (2) the model uses the highly nonlinear combination rule of maximal causes analysis (MCA) instead of a linear combination. The major challenge is parameter optimization because a model with either (1) or (2) results in strongly multimodal posteriors. We show for the ﬁrst time that a model combining both improvements can be trained efﬁciently while retaining the rich structure of the posteriors. We design an exact piecewise Gibbs sampling method and combine this with a variational method based on preselection of latent dimensions. This combined training scheme tackles both analytical and computational intractability and enables application of the model to a large number of observed and hidden dimensions. Applying the model to image patches we study the optimal encoding of images by simple cells in V1 and compare the model’s predictions with in vivo neural recordings. In contrast to standard SC, we ﬁnd that the optimal prior favors asymmetric and bimodal activity of simple cells. Testing our model for consistency we ﬁnd that the average posterior is approximately equal to the prior. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the model predicts a high percentage of globular receptive ﬁelds alongside Gabor-like ﬁelds. Similarly high percentages are observed in vivo. Our results thus argue in favor of improvements of the standard sparse coding model for simple cells by using ﬂexible priors and nonlinear combinations. 1</p><p>3 0.1657417 <a title="278-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Supervised_Learning_with_Similarity_Functions.html">330 nips-2012-Supervised Learning with Similarity Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of general supervised learning when data can only be accessed through an (indeﬁnite) similarity function between data points. Existing work on learning with indeﬁnite kernels has concentrated solely on binary/multiclass classiﬁcation problems. We propose a model that is generic enough to handle any supervised learning task and also subsumes the model previously proposed for classiﬁcation. We give a “goodness” criterion for similarity functions w.r.t. a given supervised learning task and then adapt a well-known landmarking technique to provide efﬁcient algorithms for supervised learning using “good” similarity functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three important supervised learning problems: a) real-valued regression, b) ordinal regression and c) ranking where we show that our method guarantees bounded generalization error. Furthermore, for the case of real-valued regression, we give a natural goodness deﬁnition that, when used in conjunction with a recent result in sparse vector recovery, guarantees a sparse predictor with bounded generalization error. Finally, we report results of our learning algorithms on regression and ordinal regression tasks using non-PSD similarity functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, especially that of the sparse landmark selection algorithm that achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracies than the baseline methods while offering reduced computational costs. 1</p><p>4 0.14156061 <a title="278-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Collaborative_Ranking_With_17_Parameters.html">75 nips-2012-Collaborative Ranking With 17 Parameters</a></p>
<p>Author: Maksims Volkovs, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: The primary application of collaborate ﬁltering (CF) is to recommend a small set of items to a user, which entails ranking. Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhood- and model-based. Our novel method is highly efﬁcient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on datasets from one item domain yield excellent results on a dataset from very different item domain, without any retraining. 1</p><p>5 0.13713869 <a title="278-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Label_Ranking_with_Partial_Abstention_based_on_Thresholded_Probabilistic_Models.html">169 nips-2012-Label Ranking with Partial Abstention based on Thresholded Probabilistic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Cheng, Willem Waegeman, Volkmar Welker, Eyke Hüllermeier</p><p>Abstract: Several machine learning methods allow for abstaining from uncertain predictions. While being common for settings like conventional classiﬁcation, abstention has been studied much less in learning to rank. We address abstention for the label ranking setting, allowing the learner to declare certain pairs of labels as being incomparable and, thus, to predict partial instead of total orders. In our method, such predictions are produced via thresholding the probabilities of pairwise preferences between labels, as induced by a predicted probability distribution on the set of all rankings. We formally analyze this approach for the Mallows and the Plackett-Luce model, showing that it produces proper partial orders as predictions and characterizing the expressiveness of the induced class of partial orders. These theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the practical usefulness of the approach. 1</p><p>6 0.13329193 <a title="278-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Multilabel_Classification_using_Bayesian_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2012-Multilabel Classification using Bayesian Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Hossein Azari, David Parks, Lirong Xia</p><p>Abstract: Random utility theory models an agent’s preferences on alternatives by drawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from a parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to scores. A special case that has received signiﬁcant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce. 1</p><p>4 0.69832027 <a title="278-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Statistical_Consistency_of_Ranking_Methods_in_A_Rank-Differentiable_Probability_Space.html">323 nips-2012-Statistical Consistency of Ranking Methods in A Rank-Differentiable Probability Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Lan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng, Tie-yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the statistical consistency of ranking methods. Recently, it was proven that many commonly used pairwise ranking methods are inconsistent with the weighted pairwise disagreement loss (WPDL), which can be viewed as the true loss of ranking, even in a low-noise setting. This result is interesting but also surprising, given that the pairwise ranking methods have been shown very effective in practice. In this paper, we argue that the aforementioned result might not be conclusive, depending on what kind of assumptions are used. We give a new assumption that the labels of objects to rank lie in a rank-differentiable probability space (RDPS), and prove that the pairwise ranking methods become consistent with WPDL under this assumption. What is especially inspiring is that RDPS is actually not stronger than but similar to the low-noise setting. Our studies provide theoretical justiﬁcations of some empirical ﬁndings on pairwise ranking methods that are unexplained before, which bridge the gap between theory and applications.</p><p>5 0.65830904 <a title="278-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-GenDeR%3A_A_Generic_Diversified_Ranking_Algorithm.html">141 nips-2012-GenDeR: A Generic Diversified Ranking Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Qiaozhu Mei, Boleslaw Szymanski</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the (1 − 1/e) near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>6 0.64563251 <a title="278-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Variational_Inference_for_Crowdsourcing.html">359 nips-2012-Variational Inference for Crowdsourcing</a></p>

Lilienfeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of molecular energetics in chemical compound space is a crucial ingredient for rational compound design. The inherently graph-like, non-vectorial nature of molecular data gives rise to a unique and difﬁcult machine learning problem. In this paper, we adopt a learning-from-scratch approach where quantum-mechanical molecular energies are predicted directly from the raw molecular geometry. The study suggests a beneﬁt from setting ﬂexible priors and enforcing invariance stochastically rather than structurally. Our results improve the state-of-the-art by a factor of almost three, bringing statistical methods one step closer to chemical accuracy. 1</p><p>2 0.90128922 <a title="278-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Multi-Task_Averaging.html">222 nips-2012-Multi-Task Averaging</a></p>

Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that MTA outperforms both maximum likelihood and James-Stein estimators, and that our approach to estimating the amount of regularization rivals cross-validation in performance but is more computationally efﬁcient. 1</p><p>3 0.89414597 <a title="278-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Recognizing_Activities_by_Attribute_Dynamics.html">289 nips-2012-Recognizing Activities by Attribute Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Weixin Li, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the dynamic structure of human activities in the attributes space. A video sequence is Ä?Ĺš rst represented in a semantic feature space, where each feature encodes the probability of occurrence of an activity attribute at a given time. A generative model, denoted the binary dynamic system (BDS), is proposed to learn both the distribution and dynamics of different activities in this space. The BDS is a non-linear dynamic system, which extends both the binary principal component analysis (PCA) and classical linear dynamic systems (LDS), by combining binary observation variables with a hidden Gauss-Markov state process. In this way, it integrates the representation power of semantic modeling with the ability of dynamic systems to capture the temporal structure of time-varying processes. An algorithm for learning BDS parameters, inspired by a popular LDS learning method from dynamic textures, is proposed. A similarity measure between BDSs, which generalizes the BinetCauchy kernel for LDS, is then introduced and used to design activity classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The proposed method is shown to outperform similar classiÄ?Ĺš ers derived from the kernel dynamic system (KDS) and state-of-the-art approaches for dynamics-based or attribute-based action recognition. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.83033389 <a title="278-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_n-Choose-k_Models_for_Classification_and_Ranking.html">278 nips-2012-Probabilistic n-Choose-k Models for Classification and Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Swersky, Brendan J. Frey, Daniel Tarlow, Richard S. Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In categorical data there is often structure in the number of variables that take on each label. For example, the total number of objects in an image and the number of highly relevant documents per query in web search both tend to follow a structured distribution. In this paper, we study a probabilistic model that explicitly includes a prior distribution over such counts, along with a count-conditional likelihood that deﬁnes probabilities over all subsets of a given size. When labels are binary and the prior over counts is a Poisson-Binomial distribution, a standard logistic regression model is recovered, but for other count distributions, such priors induce global dependencies and combinatorics that appear to complicate learning and inference. However, we demonstrate that simple, efﬁcient learning procedures can be derived for more general forms of this model. We illustrate the utility of the formulation by exploring applications to multi-object classiﬁcation, learning to rank, and top-K classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.80941546 <a title="278-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-conﬁdence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T 1/2 log T ) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-conﬁdence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance. 1</p><p>6 0.80821818 <a title="278-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>

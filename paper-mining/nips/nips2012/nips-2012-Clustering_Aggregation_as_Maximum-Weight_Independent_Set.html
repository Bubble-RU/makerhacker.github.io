<p>Author: Yudong Chen, Sujay Sanghavi, Huan Xu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a new algorithm to cluster sparse unweighted graphs – i.e. partition the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is higher density within clusters, and low across clusters. By sparsity we mean the setting where both the in-cluster and across cluster edge densities are very small, possibly vanishing in the size of the graph. Sparsity makes the problem noisier, and hence more difﬁcult to solve. Any clustering involves a tradeoff between minimizing two kinds of errors: missing edges within clusters and present edges across clusters. Our insight is that in the sparse case, these must be penalized differently. We analyze our algorithm’s performance on the natural, classical and widely studied “planted partition” model (also called the stochastic block model); we show that our algorithm can cluster sparser graphs, and with smaller clusters, than all previous methods. This is seen empirically as well. 1</p><p>3 0.28838915 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Sampling and variational inference techniques are two standard methods for inference in probabilistic models, but for many problems, neither approach scales effectively to large-scale data. An alternative is to relax the probabilistic model into a non-probabilistic formulation which has a scalable associated algorithm. This can often be fulﬁlled by performing small-variance asymptotics, i.e., letting the variance of particular distributions in the model go to zero. For instance, in the context of clustering, such an approach yields connections between the kmeans and EM algorithms. In this paper, we explore small-variance asymptotics for exponential family Dirichlet process (DP) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models. Utilizing connections between exponential family distributions and Bregman divergences, we derive novel clustering algorithms from the asymptotic limit of the DP and HDP mixtures that features the scalability of existing hard clustering methods as well as the ﬂexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We focus on special cases of our analysis for discrete-data problems, including topic modeling, and we demonstrate the utility of our results by applying variants of our algorithms to problems arising in vision and document analysis. 1</p><p>4 0.28180143 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Dip-means%3A_an_incremental_clustering_method_for_estimating_the_number_of_clusters.html">99 nips-2012-Dip-means: an incremental clustering method for estimating the number of clusters</a></p>
<p>Author: Argyris Kalogeratos, Aristidis Likas</p><p>Abstract: Learning the number of clusters is a key problem in data clustering. We present dip-means, a novel robust incremental method to learn the number of data clusters that can be used as a wrapper around any iterative clustering algorithm of k-means family. In contrast to many popular methods which make assumptions about the underlying cluster distributions, dip-means only assumes a fundamental cluster property: each cluster to admit a unimodal distribution. The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as an individual ‘viewer’ and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations. Experimental results on artiﬁcial and real datasets indicate the eﬀectiveness of our method and its superiority over analogous approaches.</p><p>5 0.27378482 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-FastEx%3A_Hash_Clustering_with_Exponential_Families.html">126 nips-2012-FastEx: Hash Clustering with Exponential Families</a></p>

Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters. 1</p><p>6 0.25745359 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Semi-Crowdsourced_Clustering%3A_Generalizing_Crowd_Labeling_by_Robust_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">307 nips-2012-Semi-Crowdsourced Clustering: Generalizing Crowd Labeling by Robust Distance Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhirong Yang, Tele Hao, Onur Dikmen, Xi Chen, Erkki Oja</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising relaxation technique for clustering analysis. However, conventional NMF methods that directly approximate the pairwise similarities using the least square error often yield mediocre performance for data in curved manifolds because they can capture only the immediate similarities between data samples. Here we propose a new NMF clustering method which replaces the approximated matrix with its smoothed version using random walk. Our method can thus accommodate farther relationships between data samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel regularization in the proposed objective function in order to improve over spectral clustering. The new learning objective is optimized by a multiplicative Majorization-Minimization algorithm with a scalable implementation for learning the factorizing matrix. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method has strong performance in terms of cluster purity. 1</p><p>5 0.77279961 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_nonparametric_variable_clustering_model.html">26 nips-2012-A nonparametric variable clustering model</a></p>
<p>Author: Konstantina Palla, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Factor analysis models effectively summarise the covariance structure of high dimensional data, but the solutions are typically hard to interpret. This motivates attempting to ﬁnd a disjoint partition, i.e. a simple clustering, of observed variables into highly correlated subsets. We introduce a Bayesian non-parametric approach to this problem, and demonstrate advantages over heuristic methods proposed to date. Our Dirichlet process variable clustering (DPVC) model can discover blockdiagonal covariance structures in data. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and gene expression analysis problems. 1</p><p>6 0.75190961 <a title="68-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-The_variational_hierarchical_EM_algorithm_for_clustering_hidden_Markov_models.html">342 nips-2012-The variational hierarchical EM algorithm for clustering hidden Markov models</a></p>

<p>Author: Yunchao Gong, Sanjiv Kumar, Vishal Verma, Svetlana Lazebnik</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of learning binary codes for efﬁcient retrieval of high-dimensional non-negative data that arises in vision and text applications where counts or frequencies are used as features. The similarity of such feature vectors is commonly measured using the cosine of the angle between them. In this work, we introduce a novel angular quantization-based binary coding (AQBC) technique for such data and analyze its properties. In its most basic form, AQBC works by mapping each non-negative feature vector onto the vertex of the binary hypercube with which it has the smallest angle. Even though the number of vertices (quantization landmarks) in this scheme grows exponentially with data dimensionality d, we propose a method for mapping feature vectors to their smallest-angle binary vertices that scales as O(d log d). Further, we propose a method for learning a linear transformation of the data to minimize the quantization error, and show that it results in improved binary codes. Experiments on image and text datasets show that the proposed AQBC method outperforms the state of the art. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78929818 <a title="68-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Aggregation_as_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set.html">68 nips-2012-Clustering Aggregation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set</a></p>

The vertices, which represent the distinct clusters, are weighted by an internal index measuring both cohesion and separation. The edges connect the vertices whose corresponding clusters overlap. Intuitively, an optimal aggregated clustering can be obtained by selecting an optimal subset of non-overlapping clusters partitioning the dataset together. We formalize this intuition as the MWIS problem on the attributed graph, i.e., ﬁnding the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices. This MWIS problem exhibits a special structure. Since the clusters of each input clustering form a partition of the dataset, the vertices corresponding to each clustering form a maximal independent set (MIS) in the attributed graph. We propose a variant of simulated annealing method that takes advantage of this special structure. Our algorithm starts from each MIS, which is close to a distinct local optimum of the MWIS problem, and utilizes a local search heuristic to explore its neighborhood in order to ﬁnd the MWIS. Extensive experiments on many challenging datasets show that: 1. our approach to clustering aggregation automatically decides the optimal number of clusters; 2. it does not require any parameter tuning for the underlying clustering algorithms; 3. it can combine the advantages of different underlying clustering algorithms to achieve superior performance; 4. it is robust against moderate or even bad input clusterings. 1</p><p>3 0.74975181 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">127 nips-2012-Fast Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Emtiyaz Khan, Shakir Mohamed, Kevin P. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: We present a new variational inference algorithm for Gaussian process regression with non-conjugate likelihood functions, with application to a wide array of problems including binary and multi-class classiﬁcation, and ordinal regression. Our method constructs a concave lower bound that is optimized using an efﬁcient ﬁxed-point updating algorithm. We show that the new algorithm has highly competitive computational complexity, matching that of alternative approximate inference methods. We also prove that the use of concave variational bounds provides stable and guaranteed convergence – a property not available to other approaches. We show empirically for both binary and multi-class classiﬁcation that our new algorithm converges much faster than existing variational methods, and without any degradation in performance. 1</p><p>4 0.71605533 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Forging_The_Graphs%3A_A_Low_Rank_and_Positive_Semidefinite_Graph_Learning_Approach.html">135 nips-2012-Forging The Graphs: A Low Rank and Positive Semidefinite Graph Learning Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Dijun Luo, Heng Huang, Feiping Nie, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: In many graph-based machine learning and data mining approaches, the quality of the graph is critical. However, in real-world applications, especially in semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning, the evaluation of the quality of a graph is often expensive and sometimes even impossible, due the cost or the unavailability of ground truth. In this paper, we proposed a robust approach with convex optimization to “forge” a graph: with an input of a graph, to learn a graph with higher quality. Our major concern is that an ideal graph shall satisfy all the following constraints: non-negative, symmetric, low rank, and positive semidefinite. We develop a graph learning algorithm by solving a convex optimization problem and further develop an efﬁcient optimization to obtain global optimal solutions with theoretical guarantees. With only one non-sensitive parameter, our method is shown by experimental results to be robust and achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning and clustering under various settings. As a preprocessing of graphs, our method has a wide range of potential applications machine learning and data mining.</p><p>5 0.71240735 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation.html">164 nips-2012-Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Rolfs, Bala Rajaratnam, Dominique Guillot, Ian Wong, Arian Maleki</p><p>Abstract: The 1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem has recently become a topic of great interest within the machine learning, statistics, and optimization communities as a method for producing sparse inverse covariance estimators. In this paper, a proximal gradient method (G-ISTA) for performing 1 -regularized covariance matrix estimation is presented. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, this simple proximal gradient method is found to have attractive theoretical and numerical properties. G-ISTA has a linear rate of convergence, resulting in an O(log ε) iteration complexity to reach a tolerance of ε. This paper gives eigenvalue bounds for the G-ISTA iterates, providing a closed-form linear convergence rate. The rate is shown to be closely related to the condition number of the optimal point. Numerical convergence results and timing comparisons for the proposed method are presented. G-ISTA is shown to perform very well, especially when the optimal point is well-conditioned. 1</p><p>6 0.7092039 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Super-Bit_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing.html">329 nips-2012-Super-Bit Locality-Sensitive Hashing</a></p>

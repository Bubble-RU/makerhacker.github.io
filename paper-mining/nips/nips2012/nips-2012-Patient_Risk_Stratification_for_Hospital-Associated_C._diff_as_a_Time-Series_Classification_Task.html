</p><p>7 Our two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation outperforms classiﬁers that consider only a patient’s current state (p<0. [sent-16, score-0.457]
</p><p>8 We consider a novel application of time-series analysis, patient risk. [sent-24, score-0.522]
</p><p>9 Patient risk has an inherent temporal aspect; it evolves over time as it is inﬂuenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. [sent-25, score-0.464]
</p><p>10 We hypothesize that, if one could measure risk over time, one could learn patterns of risk that are more likely to lead to adverse outcomes. [sent-27, score-0.882]
</p><p>11 In this work, we frame the problem of identifying hospitalized patients for high-risk outcomes as a time-series classiﬁcation task. [sent-28, score-0.438]
</p><p>12 We propose and motivate the study of patient risk processes to model the evolution of risk over the course of a hospital admission. [sent-29, score-1.512]
</p><p>13 Speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of using time-series data to estimate the risk of an inpatient becoming colonized with Clostridium difﬁcile (C. [sent-30, score-0.482]

</p><p>18 In contrast, risk stratiﬁcation models aim to identify patients at high risk of becoming infected. [sent-46, score-1.148]
</p><p>19 The use of these models could lead to a better understanding of the risk factors involved and ultimately provide information about how to reduce the incidence of C. [sent-47, score-0.424]
</p><p>20 Reported results in the medical literature for the problem of risk stratiﬁcation for C. [sent-51, score-0.406]
</p><p>21 We consider patients with at least a 7-day hospital admission who do not test positive for C. [sent-64, score-0.773]
</p><p>22 This group of patients is already at an elevated risk for acquiring C. [sent-66, score-0.78]

</p><p>24 To the best of our knowledge, representing and studying the risk of acquiring C. [sent-69, score-0.439]
</p><p>25 We propose a risk stratiﬁcation method that aims to identify patterns of risk that are more likely to lead to adverse outcomes. [sent-71, score-0.882]
</p><p>26 In [11] we proposed a method for extracting patient risk processes. [sent-72, score-0.956]
</p><p>27 Once patient risk processes are extracted, the problem of risk stratiﬁcation becomes that of time-series classiﬁcation. [sent-73, score-1.377]
</p><p>28 diff risk prediction is difﬁcult because of the differences in the studies mentioned above. [sent-76, score-0.744]
</p><p>29 Thus, to measure the added value of considering the temporal dimension, we implemented the standard approach as represented in the related literature of classifying patients based on their current or average state and applied it to our data set. [sent-77, score-0.43]

</p><p>31 diff in the 60 days preceding or, if negative, following the current admission [3]. [sent-83, score-0.746]
</p><p>32 Positive cases are those patients who test positive on or after 7 days in the hospital. [sent-86, score-0.53]
</p><p>33 We deﬁne the start of the risk period of a patient as the time of admission and deﬁne the end of the risk period, according to the following rule: if the patient tests positive, the ﬁrst positive test marks the end of the risk period, otherwise the patient is considered at risk until discharge. [sent-88, score-3.606]
</p><p>34 3  Methods  Patient risk is not a directly measurable time series. [sent-92, score-0.428]
</p><p>35 Thus, we propose a two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation. [sent-93, score-0.406]
</p><p>36 We ﬁrst extract approximate risk processes and then apply time-series classiﬁcation techniques to those processes. [sent-94, score-0.468]
</p><p>37 1  Extracting Patient Risk Processes  We extract approximate patient risk processes, i. [sent-97, score-0.947]
</p><p>38 , a risk time series for each admission, by independently calculating the daily risk of a patient and then concatenating these predictions. [sent-99, score-1.507]
</p><p>39 The remaining features are collected over the course of the admission and may change on a daily basis e. [sent-106, score-0.422]
</p><p>40 We employ a support vector machine (SVM) to produce daily risk scores. [sent-109, score-0.522]
</p><p>41 Each day of an admission is associated with its own feature vector. [sent-110, score-0.435]
</p><p>42 We only know whether or not a patient eventually tests positive for C. [sent-113, score-0.599]
</p><p>43 Thus we assign each day of an admission in which the patient eventually tests positive as positive, even though the patient may not have actually been at high risk on each of those days. [sent-115, score-1.927]
</p><p>44 Since we do not expect a patient’s risk to remain constant during an entire admission, there is noise in the training labels. [sent-117, score-0.406]
</p><p>45 We take the concatenated continuous outputs of the SVM for a hospital admission as a representation of the approximate risk process. [sent-124, score-0.786]
</p><p>46 We give some examples of these approximate risk processes for both case and non-case patients in Figure 1. [sent-125, score-0.765]

</p><p>48 One could risk stratify patients based solely on their current state, i. [sent-134, score-0.772]
</p><p>49 , use the daily risk value from the risk process to classify patients as either high risk or low risk on that day. [sent-136, score-2.084]
</p><p>50 We tested this intuition by classifying patients based on the average of their risk process. [sent-142, score-0.749]
</p><p>51 2  Classifying Patient Risk Processes  Given the risk processes of each patient, the risk stratiﬁcation task becomes a time-series classiﬁcation task. [sent-149, score-0.855]
</p><p>52 , periods of time where the patient is consistently at high or low risk. [sent-170, score-0.544]
</p><p>53 Finally, Features 14-17 summarize information regarding global maxima and minima in the approximate risk process. [sent-171, score-0.406]
</p><p>54 Given these feature deﬁnitions, we map each patient admission risk process to a ﬁxed-length feature vector. [sent-172, score-1.262]

</p><p>58 3  Classiﬁcation using Hidden Markov Models  We can make observations about a patient on a daily basis, but we cannot directly measure whether or not a patient is at high risk. [sent-216, score-1.16]
</p><p>59 Classiﬁcation via Likelihood We hypothesize that there may exist patterns of risk over time that are more likely to lead to a positive test result. [sent-229, score-0.541]
</p><p>60 Classiﬁcation via Posterior State Probabilities As we saw in Figure 1, the SVM output for a patient may ﬂuctuate greatly from day to day. [sent-235, score-0.658]
</p><p>61 While large ﬂuctuations in risk are not impossible, they are not common. [sent-236, score-0.406]
</p><p>62 Recall that in our initial calculation while the variables from time of admission are included in the prediction, the previous day’s risk is not. [sent-237, score-0.692]
</p><p>63 A key decision was to use a left-to-right model where, once a patient reaches a “high-risk” state they remain there. [sent-243, score-0.548]

</p><p>67 4  Experiments & Results  This section describes a set of experiments used to compare several methods for predicting a patient’s risk of acquiring C. [sent-283, score-0.47]
</p><p>68 1  Experimental Setup  In order to reduce the possibility of confusing the risk of becoming colonized with C. [sent-287, score-0.454]
</p><p>69 diff with the existence of a current infection, for patients from the positive class we consider only data collected up to two days before a positive test result. [sent-288, score-0.923]
</p><p>70 For patients who never test positive, researchers typically use the discharge day as the index event [3]. [sent-290, score-0.5]
</p><p>71 However, this can lead to deceptively good results because patients nearing discharge are typically healthier than patients not nearing discharge. [sent-291, score-0.725]
</p><p>72 We consider a minimum of 5 days for a negative patient since 5 days is the minimum amount of data we have for any positive patient (e. [sent-293, score-1.393]
</p><p>73 Additionally, we remove outliers, those patients with admissions longer than 60 days. [sent-298, score-0.399]
</p><p>74 The second classiﬁer RP+Average is an initial improvement on this approach, and classiﬁes patients based on the average value of their risk process. [sent-308, score-0.722]
</p><p>75 5days classiﬁes patients using a non-linear SVM based on the Euclidean distance between the most recent 6  Table 2: Predicting a positive test result two days in advance using different classiﬁers. [sent-311, score-0.555]
</p><p>76 Current State represents the traditional approach to risk stratiﬁcation, and is the only classiﬁer that is not based on patient Risk Processes (RP). [sent-312, score-0.928]

</p><p>78 uses the entire risk process by interpolating between points. [sent-388, score-0.406]
</p><p>79 This classiﬁer is based on a linear combination of statistics (listed in Table 1) computed from the patient risk processes. [sent-403, score-0.928]
</p><p>80 The most important features are the length of the time series (Feature 1), the fraction of the time for which the patient is at positive risk (Feature 9), and the maximum risk attained (Feature 14). [sent-408, score-1.523]
</p><p>81 The only two features with signiﬁcantly negative weights are Feature 10 and Feature 13, the overall fraction of time a patient has a negative risk, and the longest consecutive period of time that a patient has negative risk. [sent-409, score-1.29]
</p><p>82 To further convey the ability of the classiﬁer to risk stratify patients, we split the test patients into quintiles (as is often done in clinical studies) based on the continuous output of the classiﬁer. [sent-412, score-0.856]
</p><p>83 For each quintile we calculated the probability of a positive test result, based on those patients who eventually test positive for C. [sent-414, score-0.544]
</p><p>84 The difference between the 1st and 5th quintiles is striking; relative to the 1st quintile, patients in the 5th quintile are at more than a 25-fold greater risk. [sent-417, score-0.415]
</p><p>85 5  Figure 7: Test patients with RP+Features predictions in the 5th quintile are more than 25 times more likely to test positive for C. [sent-425, score-0.484]
</p><p>86 Discussion & Conclusion  To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to consider risk of acquiring an infection as a time series. [sent-427, score-0.584]
</p><p>87 We use a two-stage process, ﬁrst extracting approximate risk processes and then using the risk process as an input to a classiﬁer. [sent-428, score-0.883]
</p><p>88 The majority of the methods based on time-series classiﬁcation performed as well if not better than the previous approach of classifying patients simply based on the average of their risk process. [sent-430, score-0.749]
</p><p>89 Still, we are encouraged by these results, which suggest that posing the risk stratiﬁcation problem as a time-series classiﬁcation task can provide more accurate models. [sent-432, score-0.406]
</p><p>90 Still, based on the mean performance, all classiﬁers that incorporate patient risk processes outperform the Current State classiﬁer, and the majority of those classiﬁers perform as well or better than the RP+Average. [sent-434, score-0.971]
</p><p>91 5days classiﬁes patients based on a similarity metric using only the most recent 5 days of the patient risk processes. [sent-438, score-1.401]
</p><p>92 Its relatively poor performance suggests that a patient’s risk may depend on the entire risk process. [sent-439, score-0.812]
</p><p>93 For this reason, the medical literature on risk stratiﬁcation typically focuses on a combination of the AUC and the kind of odds ratios derivable from the data in Figure 7. [sent-448, score-0.425]

We introduce the ALPACA (Alzheimer’s disease Probabilistic Cascades) model, a generative model linking latent Alzheimer’s progression dynamics to observable biomarker data. In contrast with previous works which model disease progression as a ﬁxed event ordering, we explicitly model the variability over such orderings among patients which is more realistic, particularly for highly detailed progression models. We describe efﬁcient learning algorithms for ALPACA and discuss promising experimental results on a real cohort of Alzheimer’s patients from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 1</p><p>3 0.17915261 <a title="266-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Predicting_Action_Content_On-Line_and_in_Real_Time_before_Action_Onset_%E2%80%93_an_Intracranial_Human_Study.html">273 nips-2012-Predicting Action Content On-Line and in Real Time before Action Onset – an Intracranial Human Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Shengxuan Ye, Ian Ross, Adam Mamelak, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real time before the action occurs has been long sought in the neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making, agency and volition. On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise their left or right hand immediately as the “go” signal appeared on a computer screen. They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68±3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously, and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict the correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less conﬁdent. Our system demonstrates— for the ﬁrst time—the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single trials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs. 1 1</p><p>4 0.12365769 <a title="266-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>5 0.098645031 <a title="266-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Risk_Aversion_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_via_Near_Optimal_Chernoff_Bounds.html">296 nips-2012-Risk Aversion in Markov Decision Processes via Near Optimal Chernoff Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Teodor M. Moldovan, Pieter Abbeel</p><p>Abstract: The expected return is a widely used objective in decision making under uncertainty. Many algorithms, such as value iteration, have been proposed to optimize it. In risk-aware settings, however, the expected return is often not an appropriate objective to optimize. We propose a new optimization objective for risk-aware planning and show that it has desirable theoretical properties. We also draw connections to previously proposed objectives for risk-aware planing: minmax, exponential utility, percentile and mean minus variance. Our method applies to an extended class of Markov decision processes: we allow costs to be stochastic as long as they are bounded. Additionally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm for optimizing the proposed objective. Synthetic and real-world experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method, at scale. 1</p><p>6 0.081922412 <a title="266-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Local_Supervised_Learning_through_Space_Partitioning.html">200 nips-2012-Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, Eric Horvitz, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: A patient’s risk for adverse events is affected by temporal processes including the nature and timing of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, and the overall evolution of the patient’s pathophysiology over time. Yet many investigators ignore this temporal aspect when modeling patient outcomes, considering only the patient’s current or aggregate state. In this paper, we represent patient risk as a time series. In doing so, patient risk stratiﬁcation becomes a time-series classiﬁcation task. The task differs from most applications of time-series analysis, like speech processing, since the time series itself must ﬁrst be extracted. Thus, we begin by deﬁning and extracting approximate risk processes, the evolving approximate daily risk of a patient. Once obtained, we use these signals to explore different approaches to time-series classiﬁcation with the goal of identifying high-risk patterns. We apply the classiﬁcation to the speciﬁc task of identifying patients at risk of testing positive for hospital acquired Clostridium difﬁcile. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 on a held-out set of several hundred patients. Our two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation outperforms classiﬁers that consider only a patient’s current state (p<0.05). 1</p><p>2 0.68547845 <a title="266-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Event_Cascades_for_Alzheimer%27s_disease.html">276 nips-2012-Probabilistic Event Cascades for Alzheimer's disease</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Daniel Alexander</p><p>Abstract: Accurate and detailed models of neurodegenerative disease progression are crucially important for reliable early diagnosis and the determination of effective treatments. We introduce the ALPACA (Alzheimer’s disease Probabilistic Cascades) model, a generative model linking latent Alzheimer’s progression dynamics to observable biomarker data. In contrast with previous works which model disease progression as a ﬁxed event ordering, we explicitly model the variability over such orderings among patients which is more realistic, particularly for highly detailed progression models. We describe efﬁcient learning algorithms for ALPACA and discuss promising experimental results on a real cohort of Alzheimer’s patients from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 1</p><p>3 0.54867607 <a title="266-lsi-3" href="./nips-2012-Predicting_Action_Content_On-Line_and_in_Real_Time_before_Action_Onset_%E2%80%93_an_Intracranial_Human_Study.html">273 nips-2012-Predicting Action Content On-Line and in Real Time before Action Onset – an Intracranial Human Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Shengxuan Ye, Ian Ross, Adam Mamelak, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real time before the action occurs has been long sought in the neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making, agency and volition. On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise their left or right hand immediately as the “go” signal appeared on a computer screen. They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68±3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously, and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict the correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less conﬁdent. Our system demonstrates— for the ﬁrst time—the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single trials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs. 1 1</p><p>4 0.45511031 <a title="266-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Risk_Aversion_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_via_Near_Optimal_Chernoff_Bounds.html">296 nips-2012-Risk Aversion in Markov Decision Processes via Near Optimal Chernoff Bounds</a></p>

<p>Author: Bonnie Kirkpatrick, Alexandre Bouchard-côté</p><p>Abstract: Pedigrees, or family trees, are directed graphs used to identify sites of the genome that are correlated with the presence or absence of a disease. With the advent of genotyping and sequencing technologies, there has been an explosion in the amount of data available, both in the number of individuals and in the number of sites. Some pedigrees number in the thousands of individuals. Meanwhile, analysis methods have remained limited to pedigrees of < 100 individuals which limits analyses to many small independent pedigrees. Disease models, such those used for the linkage analysis log-odds (LOD) estimator, have similarly been limited. This is because linkage analysis was originally designed with a different task in mind, that of ordering the sites in the genome, before there were technologies that could reveal the order. LODs are difﬁcult to interpret and nontrivial to extend to consider interactions among sites. These developments and difﬁculties call for the creation of modern methods of pedigree analysis. Drawing from recent advances in graphical model inference and transducer theory, we introduce a simple yet powerful formalism for expressing genetic disease models. We show that these disease models can be turned into accurate and computationally efﬁcient estimators. The technique we use for constructing the variational approximation has potential applications to inference in other large-scale graphical models. This method allows inference on larger pedigrees than previously analyzed in the literature, which improves disease site prediction. 1</p><p>6 0.43536481 <a title="266-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Minimax_Multi-Task_Learning_and_a_Generalized_Loss-Compositional_Paradigm_for_MTL.html">212 nips-2012-Minimax Multi-Task Learning and a Generalized Loss-Compositional Paradigm for MTL</a></p>

<p>Author: Ko-jen Hsiao, Kevin Xu, Jeff Calder, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying patterns in a data set that exhibit anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. In most anomaly detection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a single criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous patterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be deﬁned, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria using a linear combination of them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance, the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth analysis (PDA). PDA uses the concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of weights. The proposed PDA approach scales linearly in the number of criteria and is provably better than linear combinations of the criteria. 1</p><p>3 0.57055217 <a title="266-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Approximate_Message_Passing_with_Consistent_Parameter_Estimation_and_Applications_to_Sparse_Learning.html">43 nips-2012-Approximate Message Passing with Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulugbek Kamilov, Sundeep Rangan, Michael Unser, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation of an i.i.d. vector x ∈ Rn from measurements y ∈ Rm obtained by a general cascade model consisting of a known linear transform followed by a probabilistic componentwise (possibly nonlinear) measurement channel. We present a method, called adaptive generalized approximate message passing (Adaptive GAMP), that enables joint learning of the statistics of the prior and measurement channel along with estimation of the unknown vector x. Our method can be applied to a large class of learning problems including the learning of sparse priors in compressed sensing or identiﬁcation of linear-nonlinear cascade models in dynamical systems and neural spiking processes. We prove that for large i.i.d. Gaussian transform matrices the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the adaptive GAMP algorithm is predicted by a simple set of scalar state evolution equations. This analysis shows that the adaptive GAMP method can yield asymptotically consistent parameter estimates, which implies that the algorithm achieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows the correct parameter values. The adaptive GAMP methodology thus provides a systematic, general and computationally efﬁcient method applicable to a large range of complex linear-nonlinear models with provable guarantees. 1</p><p>4 0.53632849 <a title="266-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_from_Distributions_via_Support_Measure_Machines.html">188 nips-2012-Learning from Distributions via Support Measure Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Krikamol Muandet, Kenji Fukumizu, Francesco Dinuzzo, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a kernel-based discriminative learning framework on probability measures. Rather than relying on large collections of vectorial training examples, our framework learns using a collection of probability distributions that have been constructed to meaningfully represent training data. By representing these probability distributions as mean embeddings in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we are able to apply many standard kernel-based learning techniques in straightforward fashion. To accomplish this, we construct a generalization of the support vector machine (SVM) called a support measure machine (SMM). Our analyses of SMMs provides several insights into their relationship to traditional SVMs. Based on such insights, we propose a ﬂexible SVM (FlexSVM) that places different kernel functions on each training example. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. 1</p><p>5 0.52144253 <a title="266-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Best_Arm_Identification%3A_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence.html">61 nips-2012-Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm(s) in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting. This problem has been studied in the literature from two different perspectives: ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence. We propose a unifying approach that leads to a meta-algorithm called uniﬁed gap-based exploration (UGapE), with a common structure and similar theoretical analysis for these two settings. We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.49257252 <a title="266-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Multi-Index_Function_Models.html">34 nips-2012-Active Learning of Multi-Index Function Models</a></p>

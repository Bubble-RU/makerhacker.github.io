<p>Author: Yair Wiener, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the possibility of a ‘reject option’ in the context of least squares regression. It is shown that using rejection it is theoretically possible to learn ‘selective’ regressors that can ǫ-pointwise track the best regressor in hindsight from the same hypothesis class, while rejecting only a bounded portion of the domain. Moreover, the rejected volume vanishes with the training set size, under certain conditions. We then develop efﬁcient and exact implementation of these selective regressors for the case of linear regression. Empirical evaluation over a suite of real-world datasets corroborates the theoretical analysis and indicates that our selective regressors can provide substantial advantage by reducing estimation error.</p><p>3 0.20365265 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Patient_Risk_Stratification_for_Hospital-Associated_C._diff_as_a_Time-Series_Classification_Task.html">266 nips-2012-Patient Risk Stratification for Hospital-Associated C. diff as a Time-Series Classification Task</a></p>
<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, Eric Horvitz, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: A patient’s risk for adverse events is affected by temporal processes including the nature and timing of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, and the overall evolution of the patient’s pathophysiology over time. Yet many investigators ignore this temporal aspect when modeling patient outcomes, considering only the patient’s current or aggregate state. In this paper, we represent patient risk as a time series. In doing so, patient risk stratiﬁcation becomes a time-series classiﬁcation task. The task differs from most applications of time-series analysis, like speech processing, since the time series itself must ﬁrst be extracted. Thus, we begin by deﬁning and extracting approximate risk processes, the evolving approximate daily risk of a patient. Once obtained, we use these signals to explore different approaches to time-series classiﬁcation with the goal of identifying high-risk patterns. We apply the classiﬁcation to the speciﬁc task of identifying patients at risk of testing positive for hospital acquired Clostridium difﬁcile. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 on a held-out set of several hundred patients. Our two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation outperforms classiﬁers that consider only a patient’s current state (p<0.05). 1</p><p>4 0.1580244 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Local_Supervised_Learning_through_Space_Partitioning.html">200 nips-2012-Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Wang, Venkatesh Saligrama</p><p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach for supervised learning based on adaptively partitioning the feature space into different regions and learning local region-speciﬁc classiﬁers. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem that incorporates both partitioning and classiﬁcation in to a single global objective. We show that space partitioning can be equivalently reformulated as a supervised learning problem and consequently any discriminative learning method can be utilized in conjunction with our approach. Nevertheless, we consider locally linear schemes by learning linear partitions and linear region classiﬁers. Locally linear schemes can not only approximate complex decision boundaries and ensure low training error but also provide tight control on over-ﬁtting and generalization error. We train locally linear classiﬁers by using LDA, logistic regression and perceptrons, and so our scheme is scalable to large data sizes and high-dimensions. We present experimental results demonstrating improved performance over state of the art classiﬁcation techniques on benchmark datasets. We also show improved robustness to label noise.</p><p>5 0.15311264 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_kernel_choice_for_large-scale_two-sample_tests.html">264 nips-2012-Optimal kernel choice for large-scale two-sample tests</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Dino Sejdinovic, Heiko Strathmann, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Massimiliano Pontil, Kenji Fukumizu, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: Given samples from distributions p and q, a two-sample test determines whether to reject the null hypothesis that p = q, based on the value of a test statistic measuring the distance between the samples. One choice of test statistic is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a distance between embeddings of the probability distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The kernel used in obtaining these embeddings is critical in ensuring the test has high power, and correctly distinguishes unlike distributions with high probability. A means of parameter selection for the two-sample test based on the MMD is proposed. For a given test level (an upper bound on the probability of making a Type I error), the kernel is chosen so as to maximize the test power, and minimize the probability of making a Type II error. The test statistic, test threshold, and optimization over the kernel parameters are obtained with cost linear in the sample size. These properties make the kernel selection and test procedures suited to data streams, where the observations cannot all be stored in memory. In experiments, the new kernel selection approach yields a more powerful test than earlier kernel selection heuristics.</p><p>6 0.14847532 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Multilabel_Classification_using_Bayesian_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2012-Multilabel Classification using Bayesian Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Nishant Mehta, Dongryeol Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Since its inception, the modus operandi of multi-task learning (MTL) has been to minimize the task-wise mean of the empirical risks. We introduce a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL that includes a spectrum of formulations as a subfamily. One endpoint of this spectrum is minimax MTL: a new MTL formulation that minimizes the maximum of the tasks’ empirical risks. Via a certain relaxation of minimax MTL, we obtain a continuum of MTL formulations spanning minimax MTL and classical MTL. The full paradigm itself is loss-compositional, operating on the vector of empirical risks. It incorporates minimax MTL, its relaxations, and many new MTL formulations as special cases. We show theoretically that minimax MTL tends to avoid worst case outcomes on newly drawn test tasks in the learning to learn (LTL) test setting. The results of several MTL formulations on synthetic and real problems in the MTL and LTL test settings are encouraging. 1</p><p>4 0.77437234 <a title="32-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Patient_Risk_Stratification_for_Hospital-Associated_C._diff_as_a_Time-Series_Classification_Task.html">266 nips-2012-Patient Risk Stratification for Hospital-Associated C. diff as a Time-Series Classification Task</a></p>

<p>Author: Ozlem Aslan, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Despite the variety of robust regression methods that have been developed, current regression formulations are either NP-hard, or allow unbounded response to even a single leverage point. We present a general formulation for robust regression—Variational M-estimation—that uniﬁes a number of robust regression methods while allowing a tractable approximation strategy. We develop an estimator that requires only polynomial-time, while achieving certain robustness and consistency guarantees. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the new estimation approach compared to standard methods. 1</p><p>6 0.64604187 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Local_Supervised_Learning_through_Space_Partitioning.html">200 nips-2012-Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning</a></p>

For a given dataset, an attributed graph is constructed from the union of the input clusterings generated by different underlying clustering algorithms with different parameters. The vertices, which represent the distinct clusters, are weighted by an internal index measuring both cohesion and separation. The edges connect the vertices whose corresponding clusters overlap. Intuitively, an optimal aggregated clustering can be obtained by selecting an optimal subset of non-overlapping clusters partitioning the dataset together. We formalize this intuition as the MWIS problem on the attributed graph, i.e., ﬁnding the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices. This MWIS problem exhibits a special structure. Since the clusters of each input clustering form a partition of the dataset, the vertices corresponding to each clustering form a maximal independent set (MIS) in the attributed graph. We propose a variant of simulated annealing method that takes advantage of this special structure. Our algorithm starts from each MIS, which is close to a distinct local optimum of the MWIS problem, and utilizes a local search heuristic to explore its neighborhood in order to ﬁnd the MWIS. Extensive experiments on many challenging datasets show that: 1. our approach to clustering aggregation automatically decides the optimal number of clusters; 2. it does not require any parameter tuning for the underlying clustering algorithms; 3. it can combine the advantages of different underlying clustering algorithms to achieve superior performance; 4. it is robust against moderate or even bad input clusterings. 1</p><p>5 0.85668194 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Visual_Recognition_using_Embedded_Feature_Selection_for_Curvature_Self-Similarity.html">360 nips-2012-Visual Recognition using Embedded Feature Selection for Curvature Self-Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela Eigenstetter, Bjorn Ommer</p><p>Abstract: Category-level object detection has a crucial need for informative object representations. This demand has led to feature descriptors of ever increasing dimensionality like co-occurrence statistics and self-similarity. In this paper we propose a new object representation based on curvature self-similarity that goes beyond the currently popular approximation of objects using straight lines. However, like all descriptors using second order statistics, ours also exhibits a high dimensionality. Although improving discriminability, the high dimensionality becomes a critical issue due to lack of generalization ability and curse of dimensionality. Given only a limited amount of training data, even sophisticated learning algorithms such as the popular kernel methods are not able to suppress noisy or superﬂuous dimensions of such high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a natural need for feature selection when using present-day informative features and, particularly, curvature self-similarity. We therefore suggest an embedded feature selection method for SVMs that reduces complexity and improves generalization capability of object models. By successfully integrating the proposed curvature self-similarity representation together with the embedded feature selection in a widely used state-of-the-art object detection framework we show the general pertinence of the approach. 1</p><p>6 0.85659766 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_curves_for_multi-task_Gaussian_process_regression.html">187 nips-2012-Learning curves for multi-task Gaussian process regression</a></p>

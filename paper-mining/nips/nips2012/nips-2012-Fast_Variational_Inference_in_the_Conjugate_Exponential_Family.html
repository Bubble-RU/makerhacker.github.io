<p>Author: Jeff Beck, Alexandre Pouget, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that humans and animals typically reason probabilistically about their environment. This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efﬁcient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be naturally implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identiﬁcation of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classiﬁcation, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb’s rule and describe an extension of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes. 1 Introduction to Probabilistic Inference in Cortex Probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning provides a coherent and, in many ways, optimal framework for dealing with complex problems in an uncertain world. It is, therefore, somewhat reassuring that behavioural experiments reliably demonstrate that humans and animals behave in a manner consistent with optimal probabilistic reasoning when performing a wide variety of perceptual [1, 2, 3], motor [4, 5, 6], and cognitive tasks[7]. This remarkable ability requires a neural code that represents probability distribution functions of task relevant stimuli rather than just single values. While there 1 are many ways to represent functions, Bayes rule tells us that when it comes to probability distribution functions, there is only one statistically optimal way to do it. More precisely, Bayes Rule states that any pattern of activity, r, that efﬁciently represents a probability distribution over some task relevant quantity s, must satisfy the relationship p(s|r) ∝ p(r|s)p(s), where p(r|s) is the stimulus conditioned likelihood function that speciﬁes the form of neural variability, p(s) gives the prior belief regarding the stimulus, and p(s|r) gives the posterior distribution over values of the stimulus, s given the representation r . Of course, it is unlikely that the nervous system consistently achieves this level of optimality. None-the-less, Bayes rule suggests the existence of a link between neural variability as characterized by the likelihood function p(r|s) and the state of belief of a mature statistical learning machine such as the brain. The so called Probabilistic Population Coding (or PPC) framework[8, 9, 10] takes this link seriously by proposing that the function encoded by a pattern of neural activity r is, in fact, the likelihood function p(r|s). When this is the case, the precise form of the neural variability informs the nature of the neural code. For example, the exponential family of statistical models with linear sufﬁcient statistics has been shown to be ﬂexible enough to model the ﬁrst and second order statistics of in vivo recordings in awake behaving monkeys[9, 11, 12] and anesthetized cats[13]. When the likelihood function is modeled in this way, the log posterior probability over the stimulus is linearly encoded by neural activity, i.e. log p(s|r) = h(s) · r − log Z(r) (1) Here, the stimulus dependent kernel, h(s), is a vector of functions of s, the dot represents a standard dot product, and Z(r) is the partition function which serves to normalize the posterior. This log linear form for a posterior distribution is highly computationally convenient and allows for evidence integration to be implemented via linear operations on neural activity[14, 8]. Proponents of this kind of linear PPC have demonstrated how to build biologically plausible neural networks capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference that are needed to optimally perform the behavioural tasks listed above. This includes, linear PPC implementations of cue combination[8], evidence integration over time, maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior estimation[9], coordinate transformation/auditory localization[10], object tracking/Kalman ﬁltering[10], explaining away[10], and visual search[15]. Moreover, each of these neural computations has required only a single recurrently connected layer of neurons that is capable of just two non-linear operations: coincidence detection and divisive normalization, both of which are widely observed in cortex[16, 17]. Unfortunately, this research program has been a piecemeal effort that has largely proceeded by building neural networks designed deal with particular problems. As a result, there have been no proposals for a general principle by which neural network implementations of linear PPCs might be generated and no suggestions regarding how to deal with complex (intractable) problems of probabilistic inference. In this work, we will partially address this short coming by showing that Variation Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm provides a general scheme for approximate inference and learning with linear PPCs. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the VBEM algorithm and show how it naturally leads to a linear PPC representation of the posterior as well as constraints on the neural network dynamics which build that PPC representation. Because this section describes the VB-PPC approach rather abstractly, the remainder of the paper is dedicated to concrete applications. As a motivating example, we consider the problem of inferring the concentrations of odors in an olfactory scene from a complex pattern of spikes in a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In section 3, we argue that this requires solving a spike pattern demixing problem which is indicative of the generic problem faced by many layers of cortex. We then show that this demixing problem is equivalent to the problem addressed by a class of models for text documents know as probabilistic topic models, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA[18]. In section 4, we apply the VB-PPC approach to build a neural network implementation of probabilistic inference and learning for LDA. This derivation shows that causal inference with linear PPC’s also critically relies on divisive normalization. This result suggests that this particular non-linearity may be involved in very general and fundamental probabilistic computation, rather than simply playing a role in gain modulation. In this section, we also show how this formulation allows for a probabilistic treatment of learning and show that a simple variation of Hebb’s rule can implement Bayesian learning in neural circuits. 2 We conclude this work by generalizing this approach to time varying inputs by introducing the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) which can infer short term ﬂuctuations in the concentrations of individual topics/odors and can be used to model foraging and other tracking tasks. 2 Variational Bayesian Inference with linear Probabilistic Population Codes Variational Bayesian (VB) inference refers to a class of deterministic methods for approximating the intractable integrals which arise in the context of probabilistic reasoning. Properly implemented it can result a fast alternative to sampling based methods of inference such as MCMC[19] sampling. Generically, the goal of any Bayesian inference algorithm is to infer a posterior distribution over behaviourally relevant latent variables Z given observations X and a generative model which speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Θ, Z). This task is confounded by the fact that the generative model includes latent parameters Θ which must be marginalized out, i.e. we wish to compute, p(Z|X) ∝ p(X, Θ, Z)dΘ (2) When the number of latent parameters is large this integral can be quite unwieldy. The VB algorithms simplify this marginalization by approximating the complex joint distribution over behaviourally relevant latents and parameters, p(Θ, Z|X), with a distribution q(Θ, Z) for which integrals of this form are easier to deal with in some sense. There is some art to choosing the particular form for the approximating distribution to make the above integral tractable, however, a factorized approximation is common, i.e. q(Θ, Z) = qΘ (Θ)qZ (Z). Regardless, for any given observation X, the approximate posterior is found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Θ, Z) and p(Θ, Z|X). When a factorized posterior is assumed, the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm ﬁnds a local minimum of the KL divergence by iteratively updating, qΘ (Θ) and qZ (Z) according to the scheme n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qZ (Z) and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qΘ (Θ) (3) Here the brackets indicate an expected value taken with respect to the subscripted probability distribution function and the tilde indicates equality up to a constant which is independent of Θ and Z. The key property to note here is that the approximate posterior which results from this procedure is in an exponential family form and is therefore representable by a linear PPC (Eq. 1). This feature allows for the straightforward construction of networks which implement the VBEM algorithm with linear PPC’s in the following way. If rn and rn are patterns of activity that use a linear PPC representation Θ Z of the relevant posteriors, then n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ hΘ (Θ) · rn Θ and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ hZ (Z) · rn+1 . Z (4) Here the stimulus dependent kernels hZ (Z) and hΘ (Θ) are chosen so that their outer product results in a basis that spans the function space on Z × Θ given by log p(X, Θ, Z) for every X. This choice guarantees that there exist functions fΘ (X, rn ) and fZ (X, rn ) such that Z Θ rn = fΘ (X, rn ) Θ Z and rn+1 = fZ (X, rn ) Θ Z (5) satisfy Eq. 3. When this is the case, simply iterating the discrete dynamical system described by Eq. 5 until convergence will ﬁnd the VBEM approximation to the posterior. This is one way to build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm. However, its not the only way. In general, any dynamical system which has stable ﬁxed points in common with Eq. 5 can also be said to implement the VBEM algorithm. In the example below we will take advantage of this ﬂexibility in order to build biologically plausible neural network implementations. 3 Response! to Mixture ! of Odors! Single	  Odor	  Response	  Cause Intensity	  Figure 1: (Left) Each cause (e.g. coffee) in isolation results in a pattern of neural activity (top). When multiple causes contribute to a scene this results in an overall pattern of neural activity which is a mixture of these patterns weighted by the intensities (bottom). (Right) The resulting pattern can be represented by a raster, where each spike is colored by its corresponding latent cause. 3 Probabilistic Topic Models for Spike Train Demixing Consider the problem of odor identiﬁcation depicted in Fig. 1. A typical mammalian olfactory system consists of a few hundred different types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), each of which responds to a wide range of volatile chemicals. This results in a highly distributed code for each odor. Since, a typical olfactory scene consists of many different odors at different concentrations, the pattern of ORN spike trains represents a complex mixture. Described in this way, it is easy to see that the problem faced by early olfactory cortex can be described as the task of demixing spike trains to infer latent causes (odor intensities). In many ways this olfactory problem is a generic problem faced by each cortical layer as it tries to make sense of the activity of the neurons in the layer below. The input patterns of activity consist of spikes (or spike counts) labeled by the axons which deliver them and summarized by a histogram which indicates how many spikes come from each input neuron. Of course, just because a spike came from a particular neuron does not mean that it had a particular cause, just as any particular ORN spike could have been caused by any one of a large number of volatile chemicals. Like olfactory codes, cortical codes are often distributed and multiple latent causes can be present at the same time. Regardless, this spike or histogram demixing problem is formally equivalent to a class of demixing problems which arise in the context of probabilistic topic models used for document modeling. A simple but successful example of this kind of topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [18]. LDA assumes that word order in documents is irrelevant and, therefore, models documents as histograms of word counts. It also assumes that there are K topics and that each of these topics appears in different proportions in each document, e.g. 80% of the words in a document might be concerned with coffee and 20% with strawberries. Words from a given topic are themselves drawn from a distribution over words associated with that topic, e.g. when talking about coffee you have a 5% chance of using the word ’bitter’. The goal of LDA is to infer both the distribution over topics discussed in each document and the distribution of words associated with each topic. We can map the generative model for LDA onto the task of spike demixing in cortex by letting topics become latent causes or odors, words become neurons, word occurrences become spikes, word distributions associated with each topic become patterns of neural activity associated with each cause, and different documents become the observed patterns of neural activity on different trials. This equivalence is made explicit in Fig. 2 which describes the standard generative model for LDA applied to documents on the left and mixtures of spikes on the right. 4 LDA Inference and Network Implementation In this section we will apply the VB-PPC formulation to build a biologically plausible network capable of approximating probabilistic inference for spike pattern demixing. For simplicity, we will use the equivalent Gamma-Poisson formulation of LDA which directly models word and topic counts 4 1. For each topic k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Distribution over words βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For document d = 1, . . . , D, (a) Distribution over topics θd ∼ Dirichlet(α0 ) (b) For word m = 1, . . . , Ωd i.

(Right) The corresponding LDA generative model mapped onto the problem of spike demixing.

Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne, Rd,j to be the number of times neuron j ﬁres during trial d. Similarly, we let Nd,j,k to be the number of times a spike in neuron j comes from cause k in trial d. These new variables play the roles of the cause and neuron assignment variables, zd,m and ωd,m by simply counting them up. If we let cd,k be an un-normalized intensity of cause j such that θd,k = cd,k / k cd,k then the generative model, Rd,j = k Nd,j,k Nd,j,k ∼ Poisson(βj,k cd,k ) 0 cd,k ∼ Gamma(αk , C −1 ). (6) is equivalent to the topic models described above. Here the parameter C is a scale parameter which sets the expected total number of spikes from the population on each trial. Note that, the problem of inferring the wj,k and cd,k is a non-negative matrix factorization problem similar to that considered by Lee and Seung[20]. The primary difference is that, here, we are attempting to infer a probability distribution over these quantities rather than maximum likelihood estimates. See supplement for details. Following the prescription laid out in section 2, we approximate the posterior over latent variables given a set of input patterns, Rd , d = 1, . . . , D, with a factorized distribution of the form, qN (N)qc (c)qβ (β). This results in marginal posterior distributions q (β:,k |η:,k ), q cd,k |αd,k , C −1 + 1 ), and q (Nd,j,: | log pd,j,: , Rd,i ) which are Dirichlet, Gamma, and Multinomial respectively. Here, the parameters η:,k , αd,k , and log pd,j,: are the natural parameters of these distributions. The VBEM update algorithm yields update rules for these parameters which are summarized in Fig. 3 Algorithm1.

Before we move on to the neural network implementation, note that this standard formulation of variational inference for LDA utilizes a batch learning scheme that is not biologically plausible. Fortunately, an online version of this variational algorithm was recently proposed and shown to give 5 superior results when compared to the batch learning algorithm[21]. This algorithm replaces the sum over d in update equation for ηj,k with an incremental update based upon only the most recently observed pattern of spikes. See Fig. 3 Algorithm 2. 4.1 Neural Network Implementation Recall that the goal was to build a neural network that implements the VBEM algorithm for the underlying latent causes of a mixture of spikes using a neural code that represents the posterior distribution via a linear PPC. A linear PPC represents the natural parameters of a posterior distribution via a linear operation on neural activity. Since the primary quantity of interest here is the posterior distribution over odor concentrations, qc (c|α), this means that we need a pattern of activity rα which is linearly related to the αk ’s in the equations above. One way to accomplish this is to simply assume that the ﬁring rates of output neurons are equal to the positive valued αk parameters. Fig. 4 depicts the overall network architecture. Input patterns of activity, R, are transmitted to the synapses of a population of output neurons which represent the αk ’s. The output activity is pooled to ¯ form an un-normalized prediction of the activity of each input neuron, Rj , given the output layer’s current state of belief about the latent causes of the Rj . The activity at each synapse targeted by input neuron j is then inhibited divisively by this prediction. This results in a dendrite that reports to the ¯ soma a quantity, Nj,k , which represents the fraction of unexplained spikes from input neuron j that could be explained by latent cause k. A continuous time dynamical system with this feature and the property that it shares its ﬁxed points with the LDA algorithm is given by d ¯ Nj,k dt d αk dt ¯ ¯ = wj,k Rj − Rj Nj,k = (7) ¯ Nj,k exp (ψ (¯k )) (α0 − αk ) + exp (ψ (αk )) η (8) i ¯ where Rj = k wj,k exp (ψ (αk )), and wj,k = exp (ψ (ηj,k )). Note that, despite its form, it is Eq. 7 which implements the required divisive normalization operation since, in the steady state, ¯ ¯ Nj,k = wj,k Rj /Rj . Regardless, this network has a variety of interesting properties that align well with biology. It predicts that a balance of excitation and inhibition is maintained in the dendrites via divisive normalization and that the role of inhibitory neurons is to predict the input spikes which target individual dendrites. It also predicts superlinear facilitation. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal term on the right of Eq. 8 indicates that more active cells will be more sensitive to their dendritic inputs. Alternatively, this could be implemented via recurrent excitation at the population level. In either case, this is the mechanism by which the network implements a sparse prior on topic concentrations and stands in stark contrast to the winner take all mechanisms which rely on competitive mutual inhibition mechanisms. Additionally, the ηj in Eq. 8 represents a cell wide ’leak’ parameter that indicates that the total leak should be ¯ roughly proportional to the sum total weight of the synapses which drive the neuron. This predicts that cells that are highly sensitive to input should also decay back to baseline more quickly. This implementation also predicts Hebbian learning of synaptic weights. To observe this fact, note that the online update rule for the ηj,k parameters can be implemented by simply correlating the activity at ¯ each synapse, Nj,k with activity at the soma αj via the equation: τL d ¯ wj,k = exp (ψ (¯k )) (η0 − 1/2 − wj,k ) + Nj,k exp ψ (αk ) η dt (9) where τL is a long time constant for learning and we have used the fact that exp (ψ (ηjk )) ≈ ηjk −1/2 for x > 1. For a detailed derivation see the supplementary material. 5 Dynamic Document Model LDA is a rather simple generative model that makes several unrealistic assumptions about mixtures of sensory and cortical spikes.

This makes LDA a rather poor computational model for a task like olfactory foraging which requires the animal to track the rise a fall of odor intensities as it navigates its environment. We can model this more complicated task by replacing the static cause or odor intensity parameters with dynamic odor intensity parameters whose behavior is governed by an exponentiated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with drift and diffusion matrices given by (Λ and ΣD ). We call this variant of LDA the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) as it could be used to model smooth changes in the distribution of topics over the course of a single document. 5.1 DDM Model Thus the generative model for the DDM is as follows: 1. For latent cause k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Cause distribution over spikes βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For scene t = 1, . . . , T , (a) Log intensity of causes c(t) ∼ Normal(Λct−1 , ΣD ) (b) Number of spikes in neuron j resulting from cause k, Nj,k (t) ∼ Poisson(βj,k exp ck (t)) (c) Number of spikes in neuron j, Rj (t) = k Nj,k (t) This model bears many similarities to the Correlated and Dynamic topic models[22], but models dynamics over a short time scale, where the dynamic relationship (Λ, ΣD ) is important. 5.2 Network Implementation Once again the quantity of interest is the current distribution of latent causes, p(c(t)|R(τ ), τ = 0..T ). If no spikes occur then no evidence is presented and posterior inference over c(t) is simply given by an undriven Kalman ﬁlter with parameters (Λ, ΣD ). A recurrent neural network which uses a linear PPC to encode a posterior that evolves according to a Kalman ﬁlter has the property that neural responses are linearly related to the inverse covariance matrix of the posterior as well as that inverse covariance matrix times the posterior mean. In the absence of evidence, it is easy to show that these quantities must evolve according to recurrent dynamics which implement divisive normalization[10]. Thus, the patterns of neural activity which linearly encode them must do so as well. When a new spike arrives, optimal inference is no longer possible and a variational approximation must be utilized. As is shown in the supplement, this variational approximation is similar to the variational approximation used for LDA. As a result, a network which can divisively inhibit its synapses is able to implement approximate Bayesian inference. Curiously, this implies that the addition of spatial and temporal correlations to the latent causes adds very little complexity to the VB-PPC network implementation of probabilistic inference. All that is required is an additional inhibitory population which targets the somata in the output population.

Black shows true concentration, blue and red (indistinguishable) show MAP estimates for the network and VBEM algorithms. 6 Experimental Results We compared the PPC neural network implementations of the variational inference with the standard VBEM algorithm. This comparison is necessary because the two algorithms are not guaranteed to converge to the same solution due to the fact that we only required that the neural network dynamics have the same ﬁxed points as the standard VBEM algorithm. As a result, it is possible for the two algorithms to converge to different local minima of the KL divergence. For the network implementation of LDA we ﬁnd good agreement between the neural network and VBEM estimates of the natural parameters of the posterior. See Fig. 6(left) which shows the two algorithms estimates of the shape parameter of the posterior distribution over topic (odor) concentrations (a quantity which is proportional to the expected concentration). This agreement, however, is not perfect, especially when posterior predicted concentrations are low. In part, this is due to the fact we are presenting the network with difﬁcult inference problems for which the true posterior distribution over topics (odors) is highly correlated and multimodal. As a result, the objective function (KL divergence) is littered with local minima. Additionally, the discrete iterations of the VBEM algorithm can take very large steps in the space of natural parameters while the neural network implementation cannot. In contrast, the network implementation of the DDM is in much better agreement with the VBEM estimation. See Fig. 6(right). This is because the smooth temporal dynamics of the topics eliminate the need for the VBEM algorithm to take large steps. As a result, the smooth network dynamics are better able to accurately track the VBEM algorithms output.

This framework takes advantage of the fact that the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm generates approximate posterior distributions which are in an exponential family form. This is precisely the form needed in order to make probability distributions representable by a linear PPC. We then outlined a general means by which one can build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm using this kind of neural code. We applied this VB-PPC framework to generate a biologically plausible neural network for spike train demixing. We chose this problem because it has many of the features of the canonical problem faced by nearly every layer of cortex, i.e. that of inferring the latent causes of complex mixtures of spike trains in the layer below. Curiously, this very complicated problem of probabilistic inference and learning ended up having a remarkably simple network solution, requiring only that neurons be capable of implementing divisive normalization via dendritically targeted inhibition and superlinear facilitation. Moreover, we showed that extending this approach to the more complex dynamic case in which latent causes change in intensity over time does not substantially increase the complexity of the neural circuit. Finally, we would like to note that, while we utilized a rate coding scheme for our linear PPC, the basic equations would still apply to any spike based log probability codes such as that considered Beorlin and Deneve[23]. 8 References [1] Daniel Kersten, Pascal Mamassian, and Alan Yuille.

<p>Author: Thomas Furmston, David Barber</p><p>Abstract: Parametric policy search algorithms are one of the methods of choice for the optimisation of Markov Decision Processes, with Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent being popular methods in this ﬁeld. In this article we provide a unifying perspective of these two algorithms by showing that their searchdirections in the parameter space are closely related to the search-direction of an approximate Newton method. This analysis leads naturally to the consideration of this approximate Newton method as an alternative optimisation method for Markov Decision Processes. We are able to show that the algorithm has numerous desirable properties, absent in the naive application of Newton’s method, that make it a viable alternative to either Expectation Maximisation or natural gradient ascent. Empirical results suggest that the algorithm has excellent convergence and robustness properties, performing strongly in comparison to both Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent. 1 Markov Decision Processes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most commonly used model for the description of sequential decision making processes in a fully observable environment, see e.g. [5]. A MDP is described by the tuple {S, A, H, p1 , p, π, R}, where S and A are sets known respectively as the state and action space, H ∈ N is the planning horizon, which can be either ﬁnite or inﬁnite, and {p1 , p, π, R} are functions that are referred as the initial state distribution, transition dynamics, policy (or controller) and the reward function. In general the state and action spaces can be arbitrary sets, but we restrict our attention to either discrete sets or subsets of Rn , where n ∈ N. We use boldface notation to represent a vector and also use the notation z = (s, a) to denote a state-action pair. Given a MDP the trajectory of the agent is determined by the following recursive procedure: Given the agent’s state, st , at a given time-point, t ∈ NH , an action is selected according to the policy, at ∼ π(·|st ); The agent will then transition to a new state according to the transition dynamics, st+1 ∼ p(·|at , st ); this process is iterated sequentially through all of the time-points in the planning horizon, where the state of the initial time-point is determined by the initial state distribution s1 ∼ p1 (·). At each time-point the agent receives a (scalar) reward that is determined by the reward function, where this function depends on the current action and state of the environment. Typically the reward function is assumed to be bounded, but as the objective is linear in the reward function we assume w.l.o.g that it is non-negative. The most widely used objective in the MDP framework is to maximise the total expected reward of the agent over the course of the planning horizon. This objective can take various forms, including an inﬁnite planning horizon, with either discounted or average rewards, or a ﬁnite planning horizon. The theoretical contributions of this paper are applicable to all three frameworks, but for notational ease and for reasons of space we concern ourselves with the inﬁnite horizon framework with discounted rewards. In this framework the boundedness of the objective function is ensured by the 1 introduction of a discount factor, γ ∈ [0, 1), which scales the rewards of the various time-points in a geometric manner. Writing the objective function and trajectory distribution directly in terms of the parameter vector then, for any w ∈ W, the objective function takes the form ∞ Ept (a,s;w) γ t−1 R(a, s) , U (w) = (1) t=1 where we have denoted the parameter space by W and have used the notation pt (a, s; w) to represent the marginal p(st = s, at = a; w) of the joint state-action trajectory distribution H−1 p(a1:H , s1:H ; w) = π(aH |sH ; w) p(st+1 |at , st )π(at |st ; w) p1 (s1 ), H ∈ N. (2) t=1 Note that the policy is now written in terms of its parametric representation, π(a|s; w). It is well known that the global optimum of (1) can be obtained through dynamic programming, see e.g. [5]. However, due to various issues, such as prohibitively large state-action spaces or highly non-linear transition dynamics, it is not possible to ﬁnd the global optimum of (1) in most real-world problems of interest. Instead most research in this area focuses on obtaining approximate solutions, for which there exist numerous techniques, such as approximate dynamic programming methods [6], Monte-Carlo tree search methods [19] and policy search methods, both parametric [27, 21, 16, 18] and non-parametric [2, 25]. This work is focused solely on parametric policy search methods, by which we mean gradient-based methods, such as steepest and natural gradient ascent [23, 1], along with Expectation Maximisation [11], which is a bound optimisation technique from the statistics literature. Since their introduction [14, 31, 10, 16] these methods have been the centre of a large amount of research, with much of it focusing on gradient estimation [21, 4], variance reduction techniques [30, 15], function approximation techniques [27, 8, 20] and real-world applications [18, 26]. While steepest gradient ascent has enjoyed some success it is known to suffer from some substantial issues that often make it unattractive in practice, such as slow convergence and susceptibility to poor scaling of the objective function [23]. Various optimisation methods have been introduced as an alternative, most notably natural gradient ascent [16, 24, 3] and Expectation Maximisation [18, 28], which are currently the methods of choice among parametric policy search algorithms. In this paper our primary focus is on the search-direction (in the parameter space) of these two methods. 2 Search Direction Analysis In this section we will perform a novel analysis of the search-direction of both natural gradient ascent and Expectation Maximisation. In gradient-based algorithms of Markov Decision Processes the update of the policy parameters take the form wnew = w + αM(w) w U (w), (3) + where α ∈ R is the step-size parameter and M(w) is some positive-deﬁnite matrix that possibly depends on w. It is well-known that such an update will increase the total expected reward, provided that α is sufﬁciently small, and this process will converge to a local optimum of (1) provided the step-size sequence is appropriately selected. While EM doesn’t have an update of the form given in (3) we shall see that the algorithm is closely related to such an update. It is convenient for later reference to note that the gradient w U (w) can be written in the following form w U (w) = Epγ (z;w)Q(z;w) w log π(a|s; w) , (4) where we use the expectation notation E[·] to denote the integral/summation w.r.t. a non-negative function. The term pγ (z; w) is a geometric weighted average of state-action occupancy marginals given by ∞ γ t−1 pt (z; w), pγ (z; w) = t=1 while the term Q(z; w) is referred to as the state-action value function and is equal to the total expected future reward from the current time-point onwards, given the current state-action pair, z, 2 and parameter vector, w, i.e. ∞ Ept (z ;w) γ t−1 R(z ) z1 = z . Q(z; w) = t=1 This is a standard result and due to reasons of space we have omitted the details, but see e.g. [27] or section(6.1) of the supplementary material for more details. An immediate issue concerning updates of the form (3) is in the selection of the ‘optimal’ choice of the matrix M(w), which clearly depends on the sense in which optimality is deﬁned. There are numerous reasonable properties that are desirable of such an update, including the numerical stability and computational complexity of the parameter update, as well as the rate of convergence of the overall algorithm resulting from these updates. While all reasonable criteria the rate of convergence is of such importance in an optimisation algorithm that it is a logical starting point in our analysis. For this reason we concern ourselves with relating these two parametric policy search algorithms to the Newton method, which has the highly desirable property of having a quadratic rate of convergence in the vicinity of a local optimum. The Newton method is well-known to suffer from problems that make it either infeasible or unattractive in practice, but in terms of forming a basis for theoretical comparisons it is a logical starting point. We shall discuss some of the issues with the Newton method in more detail in section(3). In the Newton method the matrix M(w) is set to the negative inverse Hessian, i.e. M(w) = −H−1 (w), where H(w) = w T w U (w). where we have denoted the Hessian by H(w). Using methods similar to those used to calculate the gradient, it can be shown that the Hessian takes the form H(w) = H1 (w) + H2 (w), (5) where ∞ Ep(z1:t ;w) γ t−1 R(zt ) w Ep(z1:t ;w) γ t−1 R(zt ) H1 (w) = w log p(z1:t ; w) T w log p(z1:t ; w) , (6) t=1 ∞ H2 (w) = T w log p(z1:t ; w) . (7) t=1 We have omitted the details of the derivation, but these can be found in section(6.2) of the supplementary material, with a similar derivation of a sample-based estimate of the Hessian given in [4]. 2.1 Natural Gradient Ascent To overcome some of the issues that can hinder steepest gradient ascent an alternative, natural gradient, was introduced in [16]. Natural gradient ascent techniques originated in the neural network and blind source separation literature, see e.g. [1], and take the perspective that the parameter space has a Riemannian manifold structure, as opposed to a Euclidean structure. Deriving the steepest ascent direction of U (w) w.r.t. a local norm deﬁned on this parameter manifold (as opposed to w.r.t. the Euclidean norm, which is the case in steepest gradient ascent) results in natural gradient ascent. We denote the quadratic form that induces this local norm on the parameter manifold by G(w), i.e. d(w)2 = wT G(w)w. The derivation for natural gradient ascent is well-known, see e.g. [1], and its application to the objective (1) results in a parameter update of the form wk+1 = wk + αk G−1 (wk ) w U (wk ). −1 In terms of (3) this corresponds to M(w) = G (w). In the case of MDPs the most commonly used local norm is given by the Fisher information matrix of the trajectory distribution, see e.g. [3, 24], and due to the Markovian structure of the dynamics it is given by G(w) = −Epγ (z;w) w T w log π(a|s; w) . (8) We note that there is an alternate, but equivalent, form of writing the Fisher information matrix, see e.g. [24], but we do not use it in this work. 3 In order to relate natural gradient ascent to the Newton method we ﬁrst rewrite the matrix (7) into the following form H2 (w) = Epγ (z;w)Q(z;w) w T w log π(a|s; w) . (9) For reasons of space the details of this reformulation of (7) are left to section(6.2) of the supplementary material. Comparing the Fisher information matrix (8) with the form of H2 (w) given in (9) it is clear that natural gradient ascent has a relationship with the approximate Newton method that uses H2 (w) in place of H(w). In terms of (3) this approximate Newton method corresponds to setting −1 M(w) = −H2 (w). In particular it can be seen that the difference between the two methods lies in the non-negative function w.r.t. which the expectation is taken in (8) and (9). (It also appears that there is a difference in sign, but observing the form of M(w) for each algorithm shows that this is not the case.) In the Fisher information matrix the expectation is taken w.r.t. to the geometrically weighted summation of state-action occupancy marginals of the trajectory distribution, while in H2 (w) there is an additional weighting from the state-action value function. Hence, H2 (w) incorporates information about the reward structure of the objective function, whereas the Fisher information matrix does not, and so it will generally contain more information about the curvature of the objective function. 2.2 Expectation Maximisation The Expectation Maximisation algorithm, or EM-algorithm, is a powerful optimisation technique from the statistics literature, see e.g. [11], that has recently been the centre of much research in the planning and reinforcement learning communities, see e.g. [10, 28, 18]. A quantity of central importance in the EM-algorithm for MDPs is the following lower-bound on the log-objective log U (w) ≥ Hentropy (q(z1:t , t)) + Eq(z1:t ,t) log γ t−1 R(zt )p(z1:t ; w) , (10) where Hentropy is the entropy function and q(z1:t , t) is known as the ‘variational distribution’. Further details of the EM-algorithm for MDPs and a derivation of (10) are given in section(6.3) of the supplementary material or can be found in e.g. [18, 28]. The parameter update of the EM-algorithm is given by the maximum (w.r.t. w) of the ‘energy’ term, Q(w, wk ) = Epγ (z;wk )Q(z;wk ) log π(a|s; w) . (11) Note that Q is a two-parameter function, where the ﬁrst parameter occurs inside the expectation and the second parameter deﬁnes the non-negative function w.r.t. the expectation is taken. This decoupling allows the maximisation over w to be performed explicitly in many cases of interest. For example, when the log-policy is quadratic in w the maximisation problems is equivalent to a least-squares problem and the optimum can be found through solving a linear system of equations. It has previously been noted, again see e.g. [18], that the parameter update of steepest gradient ascent and the EM-algorithm can be related through this ‘energy’ term. In particular the gradient (4) evaluated at wk can also be written as follows w|w=wk U (w) = 10 w|w=wk Q(w, wk ), where 10 we use the notation w to denote the ﬁrst derivative w.r.t. the ﬁrst parameter, while the update of the EM-algorithm is given by wk+1 = argmaxw∈W Q(w, wk ). In other words, steepest gradient ascent moves in the direction that most rapidly increases Q(w, wk ) w.r.t. the ﬁrst variable, while the EM-algorithm maximises Q(w, wk ) w.r.t. the ﬁrst variable. While this relationship is true, it is also quite a negative result. It states that in situations where it is not possible to explicitly perform the maximisation over w in (11) then the alternative, in terms of the EM-algorithm, is this generalised EM-algorithm, which is equivalent to steepest gradient ascent. Considering that algorithms such as EM are typically considered because of the negative aspects related to steepest gradient ascent this is an undesirable alternative. It is possible to ﬁnd the optimum of (11) numerically, but this is also undesirable as it results in a double-loop algorithm that could be computationally expensive. Finally, this result provides no insight into the behaviour of the EM-algorithm, in terms of the direction of its parameter update, when the maximisation over w in (11) can be performed explicitly. Instead we provide the following result, which shows that the step-direction of the EM-algorithm has an underlying relationship with the Newton method. In particular we show that, under suitable 4 regularity conditions, the direction of the EM-update, i.e. wk+1 − wk , is the same, up to ﬁrst order, as the direction of an approximate Newton method that uses H2 (w) in place of H(w). Theorem 1. Suppose we are given a Markov Decision Process with objective (1) and Markovian trajectory distribution (2). Consider the update of the parameter through Expectation Maximisation at the k th iteration of the algorithm, i.e. wk+1 = argmaxw∈W Q(w, wk ). Provided that Q(w, wk ) is twice continuously differentiable in the ﬁrst parameter we have that −1 wk+1 − wk = −H2 (wk ) w|w=wk U (w) + O( wk+1 − wk 2 ). (12) Additionally, in the case where the log-policy is quadratic the relation to the approximate Newton method is exact, i.e. the second term on the r.h.s. (12) is zero. Proof. The idea of the proof is simple and only involves performing a Taylor expansion of 10 w Q(w, wk ). As Q is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable in the ﬁrst component this Taylor expansion is possible and gives 10 w Q(wk+1 , wk ) = 10 w Q(wk , wk ) + 20 w Q(wk , wk )(wk+1 − wk ) + O( wk+1 − wk 2 ). (13) As wk+1 = argmaxw∈W Q(w, wk ) it follows that 10 Q(wk+1 , wk ) = 0. This means that, upon w ignoring higher order terms in wk+1 − wk , the Taylor expansion (13) can be rewritten into the form wk+1 − wk = − 20 −1 w Q(wk , wk ) 10 w Q(wk , wk ). (14) 10 = The proof is completed by observing that w|w=wk U (w) and w Q(wk , wk ) 20 Q(wk , wk ) = H2 (wk ). The second statement follows because in the case where the log-policy w is quadratic the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion vanish. 2.3 Summary In this section we have provided a novel analysis of both natural gradient ascent and Expectation Maximisation when applied to the MDP framework. Previously, while both of these algorithms have proved popular methods for MDP optimisation, there has been little understanding of them in terms of their search-direction in the parameter space or their relation to the Newton method. Firstly, our analysis shows that the Fisher information matrix, which is used in natural gradient ascent, is similar to H2 (w) in (5) with the exception that the information about the reward structure of the problem is not contained in the Fisher information matrix, while such information is contained in H2 (w). Additionally we have shown that the step-direction of the EM-algorithm is, up to ﬁrst order, an approximate Newton method that uses H2 (w) in place of H(w) and employs a constant step-size of one. 3 An Approximate Newton Method −1 A natural follow on from the analysis in section(2) is the consideration of using M(w) = −H2 (w) in (3), a method we call the full approximate Newton method from this point onwards. In this section we show that this method has many desirable properties that make it an attractive alternative to other parametric policy search methods. Additionally, denoting the diagonal matrix formed from the diagonal elements of H2 (w) by D2 (w), we shall also consider the method that uses M(w) = −1 −D2 (w) in (3). We call this second method the diagonal approximate Newton method. Recall that in (3) it is necessary that M(w) is positive-deﬁnite (in the Newton method this corresponds to requiring the Hessian to be negative-deﬁnite) to ensure an increase of the objective. In general the objective (1) is not concave, which means that the Hessian will not be negative-deﬁnite over the entire parameter space. In such cases the Newton method can actually lower the objective and this is an undesirable aspect of the Newton method. An attractive property of the approximate Hessian, H2 (w), is that it is always negative-deﬁnite when the policy is log–concave in the policy parameters. This fact follows from the observation that in such cases H2 (w) is a non-negative mixture of negative-deﬁnite matrices, which again is negative-deﬁnite [9]. Additionally, the diagonal 5 terms of a negative-deﬁnite matrix are negative and so D2 (w) is also negative-deﬁnite when the controller is log-concave. To motivate this result we now brieﬂy consider some widely used policies that are either log-concave or blockwise log-concave. Firstly, consider the Gibb’s policy, π(a|s; w) ∝ exp wT φ(a, s), where φ(a, s) ∈ Rnw is a feature vector. This policy is widely used in discrete systems and is logconcave in w, which can be seen from the fact that log π(a|s; w) is the sum of a linear term and a negative log-sum-exp term, both of which are concave [9]. In systems with a continuous stateaction space a common choice of controller is π(a|s; wmean , Σ) = N (a|Kφ(s) + m, Σ(s)), where wmean = {K, m} and φ(s) ∈ Rnw is a feature vector. The notation Σ(s) is used because there are cases where is it beneﬁcial to have state dependent noise in the controller. This controller is not jointly log-concave in wmean and Σ, but it is blockwise log-concave in wmean and Σ−1 . In terms of wmean the log-policy is quadratic and the coefﬁcient matrix of the quadratic term is negative-deﬁnite. In terms of Σ−1 the log-policy consists of a linear term and a log-determinant term, both of which are concave. In terms of evaluating the search direction it is clear from the forms of D2 (w) and H2 (w) that many of the pre-existing gradient evaluation techniques can be extended to the approximate Newton framework with little difﬁculty. In particular, gradient evaluation requires calculating the expectation of the derivative of the log-policy w.r.t. pγ (z; w)Q(z; w). In terms of inference the only additional calculation necessary to implement either the full or diagonal approximate Newton methods is the calculation of the expectation (w.r.t. to the same function) of the Hessian of the log-policy, or its diagonal terms. As an example in section(6.5) of the supplementary material we detail the extension of the recurrent state formulation of gradient evaluation in the average reward framework, see e.g. [31], to the approximate Newton method. We use this extension in the Tetris experiment that we consider in section(4). Given ns samples and nw parameters the complexity of these extensions scale as O(ns nw ) for the diagonal approximate Newton method, while it scales as O(ns n2 ) for the w full approximate Newton method. An issue with the Newton method is the inversion of the Hessian matrix, which scales with O(n3 ) in w the worst case. In the standard application of the Newton method this inversion has to be performed at each iteration and in large parameter systems this becomes prohibitively costly. In general H(w) will be dense and no computational savings will be possible when performing this matrix inversion. The same is not true, however, of the matrices D2 (w) and H2 (w). Firstly, as D2 (w) is a diagonal matrix it is trivial to invert. Secondly, there is an immediate source of sparsity that comes from taking the second derivative of the log-trajectory distribution in (7). This property ensures that any (product) sparsity over the control parameters in the log-trajectory distribution will correspond to sparsity in H2 (w). For example, in a partially observable Markov Decision Processes where the policy is modeled through a ﬁnite state controller, see e.g. [22], there are three functions to be optimised, namely the initial belief distribution, the belief transition dynamics and the policy. When the parameters of these three functions are independent H2 (w) will be block-diagonal (across the parameters of the three functions) and the matrix inversion can be performed more efﬁciently by inverting each of the block matrices individually. The reason that H(w) does not exhibit any such sparsity properties is due to the term H1 (w) in (5), which consists of the non-negative mixture of outer-product matrices. The vector in these outer-products is the derivative of the log-trajectory distribution and this typically produces a dense matrix. A undesirable aspect of steepest gradient ascent is that its performance is affected by the choice of basis used to represent the parameter space. An important and desirable property of the Newton method is that it is invariant to non-singular linear (afﬁne) transformations of the parameter space, see e.g. [9]. This means that given a non-singular linear (afﬁne) mapping T ∈ Rnw ×nw , the Newton ˜ update of the objective U (w) = U (T w) is related to the Newton update of the original objective through the same linear (afﬁne) mapping, i.e. v + ∆vnt = T w + ∆wnt , where v = T w and ∆vnt and ∆wnt denote the respective Newton steps. In other words running the Newton method on U (w) ˜ and U (T −1 w) will give identical results. An important point to note is that this desirable property is maintained when using H2 (w) in an approximate Newton method, while using D2 (w) results in a method that is invariant to rescaling of the parameters, i.e. where T is a diagonal matrix with non-zero elements along the diagonal. This can be seen by using the linearity of the expectation operator and a proof of this statement is provided in section(6.4) of the supplementary material. 6 20 Completed Lines 400 θ2 15 10 5 0 −10 −8 −6 −4 θ1 −2 0 300 200 100 0 0 2 (a) Policy Trace 20 40 60 80 Training Iterations 100 (b) Tetris Problem Figure 1: (a) An empirical illustration of the afﬁne invariance of the approximate Newton method, performed on the two state MDP of [16]. The plot shows the trace of the policy during training for the two different parameter spaces, where the results of the latter have been mapped back into the original parameter space for comparison. The plot shows the two steepest gradient ascent traces (blue cross and blue circle) and the two traces of the full approximate Newton method (red cross and red circle). (b) Results of the tetris problem for steepest gradient ascent (black), natural gradient ascent (green), the diagonal approximate Newton method (blue) and the full approximate Newton method (red). 4 Experiments The ﬁrst experiment we performed was an empirical illustration that the full approximate Newton method is invariant to linear transformations of the parameter space. We considered the simple two state example of [16] as it allows us to plot the trace of the policy during training, since the policy has only two parameters. The policy was trained using both steepest gradient ascent and the full approximate Newton method and in both the original and linearly transformed parameter space. The policy traces of the two algorithms are plotted in ﬁgure(1.a). As expected steepest gradient ascent is affected by such mappings, whilst the full approximate Newton method is invariant to them. The second experiment was aimed at demonstrating the scalability of the full and diagonal approximate Newton methods to problems with a large state space. We considered the tetris domain, which is a popular computer game designed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985. See [12] for more details. Firstly, we compared the performance of the full and diagonal approximate Newton methods to other parametric policy search methods. Tetris is typically played on a 20 × 10 grid, but due to computational costs we considered a 10 × 10 grid in the experiment. This results in a state space with roughly 7 × 2100 states. We modelled the policy through a Gibb’s distribution, where we considered a feature vector with the following features: the heights of each column, the difference in heights between adjacent columns, the maximum height and the number of ‘holes’. Under this policy it is not possible to obtain the explicit maximum over w in (11) and so a straightforward application of EM is not possible in this problem. We therefore compared the diagonal and full approximate Newton methods with steepest and natural gradient ascent. Due to reasons of space the exact implementation of the experiment is detailed in section(6.6) of the supplementary material. We ran 100 repetitions of the experiment, each consisting of 100 training iterations, and the mean and standard error of the results are given in ﬁgure(1.b). It can be seen that the full approximate Newton method outperforms all of the other methods, while the performance of the diagonal approximate Newton method is comparable to natural gradient ascent. We also ran several training runs of the full approximate Newton method on the full-sized 20 × 10 board and were able to obtain a score in the region of 14, 000 completed lines, which was obtained after roughly 40 training iterations. An approximate dynamic programming based method has previously been applied to the Tetris domain in [7]. The same set of features were used and a score of roughly 4, 500 completed lines was obtained after around 6 training iterations, after which the solution then deteriorated. In the third experiment we considered a ﬁnite horizon (controlled) linear dynamical system. This allowed the search-directions of the various algorithms to be computed exactly using [13] and removed any issues of approximate inference from the comparison. In particular we considered a 3-link rigid manipulator, linearized through feedback linearisation, see e.g. [17].

The plot shows the results for steepest gradient ascent (black), EM (blue), natural gradient ascent (green) and the approximate Newton method (red), where the plot shows the mean and standard error of the results. (b) The normalised total expected reward plotted against training iterations for the synthetic non-linear system of [29]. The plot shows the results for EM (blue), steepest gradient ascent (black), natural gradient ascent (green) and the approximate Newton method (red), where the plot shows the mean and standard error of the results. 6-dimensional state space, 3-dimensional action space and a 22-dimensional parameter space. Further details of the system can be found in section(6.7) of the supplementary material. We ran the experiment 100 times and the mean and standard error of the results plotted in ﬁgure(2.a). In this experiment the approximate Newton method found substantially better solutions than either steepest gradient ascent, natural gradient ascent or Expectation Maximisation. The superiority of the results in comparison to either steepest or natural gradient ascent can be explained by the fact that H2 (w) gives a better estimate of the curvature of the objective function. Expectation Maximisation performed poorly in this experiment, exhibiting sub-linear convergence. Steepest gradient ascent performed 3684 ± 314 training iterations in this experiment which, in comparison to the 203 ± 34 and 310 ± 40 iterations of natural gradient ascent and the approximate Newton method respectively, illustrates the susceptibility of this method to poor scaling. In the ﬁnal experiment we considered the synthetic non-linear system considered in [29]. Full details of the system and the experiment can be found in section(6.8) of the supplementary material. We ran the experiment 100 times and the mean and standard error of the results are plotted in ﬁgure(2.b). Again the approximate Newton method outperforms both steepest and natural gradient ascent. In this example only the mean parameters of the Gaussian controller are optimised, while the parameters of the noise are held ﬁxed, which means that the log-policy is quadratic in the policy parameters. Hence, in this example the EM-algorithm is a particular (less general) version of the approximate Newton method, where a ﬁxed step-size of one is used throughout. The marked difference in performance between the EM-algorithm and the approximate Newton method shows the beneﬁt of being able to tune the step-size sequence. In this experiment we considered ﬁve different step-size sequences for the approximate Newton method and all of them obtained superior results than the EM-algorithm. In contrast only one of the seven step-size sequences considered for steepest and natural gradient ascent outperformed the EM-algorithm. 5 Conclusion The contributions of this paper are twofold: Firstly we have given a novel analysis of Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent when applied to the MDP framework, showing that both have close connections to an approximate Newton method; Secondly, prompted by this analysis we have considered the direct application of this approximate Newton method to the optimisation of MDPs, showing that it has numerous desirable properties that are not present in the naive application of the Newton method. In terms of empirical performance we have found the approximate Newton method to perform consistently well in comparison to EM and natural gradient ascent, highlighting its viability as an alternative to either of these methods. At present we have only considered actor type implementations of the approximate Newton method and the extension to actor-critic methods is a point of future research. 8 References [1] S. Amari.

<p>Author: James Hensman, Magnus Rattray, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a general method for deriving collapsed variational inference algorithms for probabilistic models in the conjugate exponential family. Our method uniﬁes many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean ﬁeld update equations have been derived. Empirically we show signiﬁcant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound. 1</p><p>2 0.67275876 <a title="129-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Truncation-free_Online_Variational_Inference_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models.html">355 nips-2012-Truncation-free Online Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Qixia Jiang, Jun Zhu, Maosong Sun, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: An effective strategy to exploit the supervising side information for discovering predictive topic representations is to impose discriminative constraints induced by such information on the posterior distributions under a topic model. This strategy has been adopted by a number of supervised topic models, such as MedLDA, which employs max-margin posterior constraints. However, unlike the likelihoodbased supervised topic models, of which posterior inference can be carried out using the Bayes’ rule, the max-margin posterior constraints have made Monte Carlo methods infeasible or at least not directly applicable, thereby limited the choice of inference algorithms to be based on variational approximation with strict mean ﬁeld assumptions. In this paper, we develop two efﬁcient Monte Carlo methods under much weaker assumptions for max-margin supervised topic models based on an importance sampler and a collapsed Gibbs sampler, respectively, in a convex dual formulation. We report thorough experimental results that compare our approach favorably against existing alternatives in both accuracy and efﬁciency.</p><p>4 0.59878439 <a title="129-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Truly_Nonparametric_Online_Variational_Inference_for_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes.html">354 nips-2012-Truly Nonparametric Online Variational Inference for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Bryant, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: Variational methods provide a computationally scalable alternative to Monte Carlo methods for large-scale, Bayesian nonparametric learning. In practice, however, conventional batch and online variational methods quickly become trapped in local optima. In this paper, we consider a nonparametric topic model based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and develop a novel online variational inference algorithm based on split-merge topic updates. We derive a simpler and faster variational approximation of the HDP, and show that by intelligently splitting and merging components of the variational posterior, we can achieve substantially better predictions of test data than conventional online and batch variational algorithms. For streaming analysis of large datasets where batch analysis is infeasible, we show that our split-merge updates better capture the nonparametric properties of the underlying model, allowing continual learning of new topics.</p><p>5 0.56751424 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Factorial_LDA%3A_Sparse_Multi-Dimensional_Text_Models.html">124 nips-2012-Factorial LDA: Sparse Multi-Dimensional Text Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>6 0.54560572 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Joint_Modeling_of_a_Matrix_with_Associated_Text_via_Latent_Binary_Features.html">166 nips-2012-Joint Modeling of a Matrix with Associated Text via Latent Binary Features</a></p>

Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a general method for deriving collapsed variational inference algorithms for probabilistic models in the conjugate exponential family. Our method uniﬁes many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean ﬁeld update equations have been derived. Empirically we show signiﬁcant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound. 1</p><p>2 0.66885918 <a title="129-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-From_Deformations_to_Parts%3A_Motion-based_Segmentation_of_3D_Objects.html">137 nips-2012-From Deformations to Parts: Motion-based Segmentation of 3D Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Soumya Ghosh, Matthew Loper, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: We develop a method for discovering the parts of an articulated object from aligned meshes of the object in various three-dimensional poses. We adapt the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) to allow nonparametric discovery of a potentially unbounded number of parts, while simultaneously guaranteeing a spatially connected segmentation. To allow analysis of datasets in which object instances have varying 3D shapes, we model part variability across poses via afﬁne transformations. By placing a matrix normal-inverse-Wishart prior on these afﬁne transformations, we develop a ddCRP Gibbs sampler which tractably marginalizes over transformation uncertainty. Analyzing a dataset of humans captured in dozens of poses, we infer parts which provide quantitatively better deformation predictions than conventional clustering methods.</p><p>3 0.58943075 <a title="129-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Convergence_and_Energy_Landscape_for_Cheeger_Cut_Clustering.html">85 nips-2012-Convergence and Energy Landscape for Cheeger Cut Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier Bresson, Thomas Laurent, David Uminsky, James V. Brecht</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides both theoretical and algorithmic results for the 1 -relaxation of the Cheeger cut problem. The 2 -relaxation, known as spectral clustering, only loosely relates to the Cheeger cut; however, it is convex and leads to a simple optimization problem. The 1 -relaxation, in contrast, is non-convex but is provably equivalent to the original problem. The 1 -relaxation therefore trades convexity for exactness, yielding improved clustering results at the cost of a more challenging optimization. The ﬁrst challenge is understanding convergence of algorithms. This paper provides the ﬁrst complete proof of convergence for algorithms that minimize the 1 -relaxation. The second challenge entails comprehending the 1 energy landscape, i.e. the set of possible points to which an algorithm might converge. We show that 1 -algorithms can get trapped in local minima that are not globally optimal and we provide a classiﬁcation theorem to interpret these local minima. This classiﬁcation gives meaning to these suboptimal solutions and helps to explain, in terms of graph structure, when the 1 -relaxation provides the solution of the original Cheeger cut problem. 1</p><p>4 0.57294852 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-FastEx%3A_Hash_Clustering_with_Exponential_Families.html">126 nips-2012-FastEx: Hash Clustering with Exponential Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Amr Ahmed, Sujith Ravi, Alex J. Smola, Shravan M. Narayanamurthy</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a key component in any data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.5659346 <a title="129-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Pointwise_Tracking_the_Optimal_Regression_Function.html">271 nips-2012-Pointwise Tracking the Optimal Regression Function</a></p>
<p>Author: Yair Wiener, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the possibility of a ‘reject option’ in the context of least squares regression. It is shown that using rejection it is theoretically possible to learn ‘selective’ regressors that can ǫ-pointwise track the best regressor in hindsight from the same hypothesis class, while rejecting only a bounded portion of the domain. Moreover, the rejected volume vanishes with the training set size, under certain conditions. We then develop efﬁcient and exact implementation of these selective regressors for the case of linear regression. Empirical evaluation over a suite of real-world datasets corroborates the theoretical analysis and indicates that our selective regressors can provide substantial advantage by reducing estimation error.</p><p>6 0.55751818 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Aggregation_as_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set.html">68 nips-2012-Clustering Aggregation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set</a></p>

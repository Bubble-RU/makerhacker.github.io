</p><p>4 We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. [sent-14, score-0.41]
</p><p>5 Classical variational optimization is achieved through coordinate ascent which can be slow to converge. [sent-18, score-0.326]
</p><p>6 , 2011] is to marginalize analytically a portion of the variational approximating distribution, removing this from the optimization. [sent-23, score-0.239]
</p><p>7 In this paper we provide a unifying framework for collapsed inference in the general class of models composed of conjugate-exponential graphs (CEGs). [sent-24, score-0.357]
</p><p>8 First we review the body of earlier work with a succinct and unifying derivation of the collapsed bounds. [sent-25, score-0.4]
</p><p>9 We describe how the applicability of the collapsed bound to any particular CEG can be determined with a simple d-separation test. [sent-26, score-0.383]
</p><p>10 Standard variational inference via coordinate ascent turns out to be steepest ascent with a unit step length on our unifying bound. [sent-27, score-0.639]
</p><p>11 This motivates us to consider natural gradients and conjugate gradients for fast optimization of these models. [sent-28, score-0.376]
</p><p>12 Our unifying view allows collapsed variational methods to be integrated into general inference tools like infer. [sent-30, score-0.571]
</p><p>13 [2007] proposed a collapsed approach using both truncated stick-breaking and symmetric priors. [sent-35, score-0.267]
</p><p>14 [2008] proposed ‘latent space variational Bayes’ where both the cluster-parameters and mixing weights were marginalised, again with some approximations. [sent-37, score-0.238]
</p><p>15 [2007] proposed a collapsed inference procedure for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). [sent-39, score-0.37]
</p><p>16 This lower bound on the model evidence is also an upper bound on the original variational bound, the difference between the two bounds is given by a Kullback Leibler divergence. [sent-41, score-0.494]
</p><p>17 The approach has also been referred to as the marginalised variational bound by L´ zaro-Gredilla et al. [sent-42, score-0.488]
</p><p>18 The connection between a a the KL corrected bound and the collapsed bounds is not immediately obvious. [sent-44, score-0.505]
</p><p>19 The key difference between the frameworks is the order in which the marginalisation and variational approximation are applied. [sent-45, score-0.242]
</p><p>20 Our framework leads to a more succinct derivation of the collapsed approximations. [sent-47, score-0.349]
</p><p>21 The resulting bound can then be optimised without recourse to approximations in either the bound’s evaluation or its optimization. [sent-48, score-0.167]
</p><p>22 We use Jensen’s inequality to derive a lower bound on the model evidence L, which serves as an objective function in the variational optimisation: p(D, Z, X) p(D) ≥ L = q(Z, X) ln dZ dX. [sent-54, score-0.422]
</p><p>23 It is then possible to implement an optimisation scheme which analytically optimises each factor alternately, with the optimal distribution given by q (X) ∝ exp  q(Z) ln p(D, X|Z) dZ ,  (2)  and similarly for Z: these are often referred to as VBE and VBM steps. [sent-56, score-0.257]
</p><p>24 King and Lawrence [2006] substituted the expression for the optimal distribution (for example q (X)) back into the bound (1), eliminating one set of parameters from the optimisation, an approach that has been reused by L´ zaroa Gredilla et al. [sent-57, score-0.225]
</p><p>25 King and Lawrence [2006] referred to this new bound as ‘the KL corrected bound’. [sent-60, score-0.19]
</p><p>26 We re-derive their bound by ﬁrst using Jensen’s inequality to construct the variational lower bound on the conditional distribution, p(D, Z|X) dZ L1 . [sent-62, score-0.446]
</p><p>27 (3) ln p(D|X) ≥ q(Z) ln q(Z) This object turns out to be of central importance in computing the ﬁnal KL-corrected bound and also in computing gradients, curvatures and the distribution of the collapsed variables q (X). [sent-63, score-0.615]
</p><p>28 We now marginalize the conditioned variable from this expression, ln p(D) ≥ ln  p(X) exp{L1 } dX  LKL ,  (4)  giving us the bound of King and Lawrence [2006] & L´ zaro-Gredilla et al. [sent-65, score-0.359]
</p><p>29 Note that one set a of parameters was marginalised after the variational approximation was made. [sent-67, score-0.313]
</p><p>30 Using (2), this expression also provides the approximate posterior for the marginalised variables X: q (X) = p(X)eL1 −LKL (5) LKL and e appears as the constant of proportionality in the mean-ﬁeld update equation (2). [sent-68, score-0.209]
</p><p>31 It is particularly useful when variational parameters are optimised by gradient methods. [sent-72, score-0.354]
</p><p>32 Since VBEM is equivalent to a steepest descent gradient method with a ﬁxed step size, there appears to be a lot to gain by combining the KLC bound with more sophisticated optimization techniques. [sent-73, score-0.294]
</p><p>33 1  Gradients  Consider the gradient of the KL corrected bound with respect to the parameters of q(Z): ∂LKL ∂ = exp{−LKL } ∂θz ∂θz  exp{L1 }p(X) dX = Eq  (X)  ∂L1 , ∂θz  (8)  where we have used the relation (5). [sent-75, score-0.279]
</p><p>34 Sato [2001] has shown that the variational update equation can be interpreted as a gradient method, where each update is also a step in the steepest direction in the canonical parameters of q(Z). [sent-77, score-0.46]
</p><p>35 We can combine this important insight with the above result to realize that we have a simple method for computing the gradients of the KL corrected bound: we only need to look at the update expressions for the mean-ﬁeld method. [sent-78, score-0.206]
</p><p>36 This result also reveals the weakness of standard variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM): it is a steepest ascent algorithm. [sent-79, score-0.44]
</p><p>37 [2010] looked to rectify this weakness by applying a conjugate gradient algorithm to the mean ﬁeld bound. [sent-81, score-0.312]
</p><p>38 Our suggestion is to apply conjugate gradients to the KLC bound. [sent-83, score-0.273]
</p><p>39 Whilst the value and gradient of the MF bound matches that of the KLC bound after an update of the collapsed variables, the curvature is always greater. [sent-84, score-0.699]
</p><p>40 In practise this means that much larger steps (which we compute using conjugate gradient methods) can be taken when optimizing the KLC bound than for the MF bound leading to more rapid convergence. [sent-85, score-0.519]
</p><p>41 2  Curvature of the Bounds  King and Lawrence [2006] showed empirically that the KLC bound could lead to faster convergence because the bounds differ in their curvature: the curvature of the KLC bound enables larger steps to be taken by an optimizer. [sent-87, score-0.357]
</p><p>42 3  Relationship to Collapsed VB  In collapsed inference some parameters are marginalized before applying the variational bound. [sent-97, score-0.52]
</p><p>43 The KLC bound derivation we have provided also marginalises parameters, but after a variational approximation is made. [sent-102, score-0.366]
</p><p>44 Whilst appropriately conjugate formulation of the model will always ensure that the KLC expression is analytically tractable, the expectation in the collapsed VB expression is not. [sent-104, score-0.59]
</p><p>45 Under this approximation2 the KL corrected approach is equivalent to the collapsed variational approach. [sent-107, score-0.555]
</p><p>46 4  Applicability  To apply the KLC bound we need to specify a subset, X, of variables to marginalize. [sent-109, score-0.142]
</p><p>47 Assuming the appropriate conjugate exponential structure for the model we are left with the requirement to select a sub-set that induces the appropriate factorisation. [sent-111, score-0.246]
</p><p>48 They are factorisations in the approximate posterior which arise from the form of the variational approximation and from the structure of the model. [sent-113, score-0.26]
</p><p>49 The d-separation test involves checking for independence amongst the marginalised variables (X in the above) conditioned on the observed data D and the approximated variables (Z in the above). [sent-115, score-0.151]
</p><p>50 The requirement is to select a sufﬁcient set of variables, Z, such that the effective likelihood for X, given by (3) becomes conjugate to the prior. [sent-116, score-0.22]
</p><p>51 For latent variable models, it is often sufﬁcient to select the latent variables for X whilst collapsing the model variables. [sent-118, score-0.261]
</p><p>52 For example, in the speciﬁc case of mixture models and topic models, approximating the component labels allows for the marginalisation of the cluster parameters (topics 2 Kurihara et al. [sent-119, score-0.143]
</p><p>53 Thus we could make an explicit variational approximation for A,F, whilst marginalising B,D,E. [sent-127, score-0.361]
</p><p>54 Alternatively, we could select B,D,E for a parameterised approximate distribution, whilst marginalising A,F. [sent-128, score-0.204]
</p><p>55 [2008] to derive a general form for latent variable models, though our formulation is general to any conjugate exponential graph. [sent-134, score-0.268]
</p><p>56 [2012] showed that the VBEM procedure performs gradient ascent in the space of the natural parameters. [sent-136, score-0.229]
</p><p>57 Using the KLC bound to collapse the problem, gradient methods seem a natural choice for optimisation, since there are fewer parameters to deal with, and we have shown that computation of the gradients is straightforward (the variational update equations contain the model gradients). [sent-137, score-0.6]
</p><p>58 It turns out that the KLC bound is particularly amenable to Riemannian or natural gradient methods, because the information geometry of the exponential family distrubution(s), over which we are optimising, leads to a simple expression for the natural gradient. [sent-138, score-0.38]
</p><p>59 Previous investigations of natural gradients for variational Bayes [Honkela et al. [sent-139, score-0.376]
</p><p>60 We showed in section 2 that the gradient of the KLC bound is given by the gradient of the standard MF variational bound, after an update of the collapsed variables. [sent-144, score-0.809]
</p><p>61 1  Variable Transformations  We can compute the natural gradient of our collapsed bound by considering the update equations of the non-collapsed problem as described above. [sent-147, score-0.556]
</p><p>62 However, if we wish to make use of more powerful optimisation methods like conjugate gradient ascent, it is helpful to re-parameterize the natural parameters in an unconstrained fashion. [sent-148, score-0.455]
</p><p>63 The natural gradient is given by [Amari and Nagaoka, 2007]: g(θ) = G(θ)−1  ∂LKL ∂θ  (13)  where G(θ) is the Fisher information matrix whose i,j th element is given by G(θ)[i,j] = −Eq(X | θ) 5  ∂ 2 ln q(X | θ) ∂θ [i] ∂θ [j]  . [sent-149, score-0.209]
</p><p>64 ∂θ ∂η ∂η ∂θ  (15)  The gradient in one set of parameters provides the natural gradient in the other. [sent-153, score-0.206]
</p><p>65 Thus when our approximating distribution q is exponential family, we can compute the natural gradient without the expensive matrix inverse. [sent-154, score-0.143]
</p><p>66 From equation (9) and the work of Sato [2001], we see that the gradient of the KLC bound can be obtained by considering the standard mean-ﬁeld update for the non-collapsed parameter Z. [sent-158, score-0.239]
</p><p>67 Having conﬁrmed that the VB-E step is equivalent to steepest-gradient ascent we now explore whether the procedure could be improved by the use of conjugate gradients. [sent-160, score-0.31]
</p><p>68 3  Conjugate Gradient Optimization  One idea for solving some of the problems associated with steepest ascent is to ensure each gradient step is conjugate (geometrically) to the previous. [sent-162, score-0.488]
</p><p>69 [2010] applied conjugate gradients to the standard mean ﬁeld bound, we expect much faster convergence for the KLC bound due to its differing curvature. [sent-164, score-0.389]
</p><p>70 Since VBEM uses a step length of 1 to optimize,3 we also used this step length in conjugate gradients. [sent-165, score-0.198]
</p><p>71 In the natural conjugate gradient method, the search direction at the ith iteration is given by si = −gi + βsi−1 . [sent-166, score-0.315]
</p><p>72 [2009] that this can be simpliﬁed since g Gg = g GG−1 g = g g, and other conjugate methods, deﬁned in the supplementary material, can be applied similarly. [sent-169, score-0.219]
</p><p>73 In each experiment, the algorithm was considered to have converged when the change in the bound or the Riemannian gradient reached below 10−6 . [sent-172, score-0.205]
</p><p>74 A neat feature is that we can make use of the discussion above to derive an expression for the natural gradient without a matrix inverse. [sent-181, score-0.167]
</p><p>75 57  Table 2: Time and iterations taken to run LDA on the NIPS 2011 corpus, ± one standard deviation, for two conjugate methods and VBEM. [sent-203, score-0.226]
</p><p>76 The Fletcher-Reeves conjugate algorithm is almost ten times as fast as VBEM. [sent-204, score-0.198]
</p><p>77 The model is initialised with eight components with an uninformative prior over the mixing proportions: the optimisation procedure is left to select an appropriate number of components. [sent-218, score-0.213]
</p><p>78 [2008] reported that their collapsed method led to improved convergence over VBEM. [sent-220, score-0.267]
</p><p>79 We compared three different conjugate gradient approaches and standard VBEM (which is also steepest ascent on the KLC bound) using 500 restarts. [sent-224, score-0.488]
</p><p>80 Even relaxing the stringency of our selection to 100 nats, the VBEM method was always at least twice as slow as the best conjugate method. [sent-227, score-0.198]
</p><p>81 On average, the HestenesSteifel algorithm was almost ten times as fast as standard VB, as shown in Table 2, whilst the ﬁnal bound varied little between approaches. [sent-237, score-0.217]
</p><p>82 We implemented a variational version of their model and optimised it using VBEM and our collapsed Riemannian method. [sent-245, score-0.532]
</p><p>83 The model was initialised using four random initial conditions, and optimised using standard VBEM and the conjugate gradient versions of the algorithm. [sent-248, score-0.365]
</p><p>84 The Polack-Ribi´ re e conjugate method performed very poorly for this problem, often giving negative conjugation: we omit it here. [sent-249, score-0.198]
</p><p>85 The VBEM method was dramatically outperformed by the Fletcher-Reeves and Hestenes-Steifel methods: it took 4600 ± 20 iterations to converge, whilst the conjugate methods took only 268 ± 4 and 265 ± 1 iterations to converge. [sent-251, score-0.355]
</p><p>86 At about 8 seconds per iteration, our collapsed Riemannian method requires around forty minutes, whilst VBEM takes almost eleven hours. [sent-252, score-0.368]
</p><p>87 All the variational approaches represent an improvement over a Gibbs sampler, which takes approximately one week to run for this data [Glaus et al. [sent-253, score-0.273]
</p><p>88 6  Discussion  Under very general conditions (conjugate exponential family) we have shown the equivalence of collapsed variational bounds and marginalized variational bounds using the KL corrected perspective of King and Lawrence [2006]. [sent-255, score-0.891]
</p><p>89 When the collapsed variables are updated in the standard MF bound the KLC bound is identical to the MF bound in value and gradient. [sent-257, score-0.641]
</p><p>90 Sato [2001] has shown that coordinate ascent of the MF bound (as proscribed by VBEM updates) is equivalent to steepest ascent of the MF bound using natural gradients. [sent-258, score-0.573]
</p><p>91 This implies that standard variational inference is also performing steepest ascent on the KLC bound. [sent-259, score-0.454]
</p><p>92 This equivalence between natural gradients and the VBEM update equations means our method is quickly implementable for any model where the mean ﬁeld update equations have been computed. [sent-260, score-0.215]
</p><p>93 We’d like to emphasise the ease with which the method can be applied: we have provided derivations of equivalencies of the bounds and gradients which should enable collapsed conjugate optimisation of any existing mean ﬁeld algorithm, with minimal changes to the software. [sent-265, score-0.728]
</p><p>94 Indeed our own implementations (see supplementary material) use just a few lines of code to switch between the VBEM and conjugate methods. [sent-266, score-0.219]
</p><p>95 We have shown that it is always less negative than that of the original variational bound allowing much larger steps in the variational parameters as King and Lawrence [2006] suggested. [sent-268, score-0.544]
</p><p>96 In a thorough exploration of the convergence properties of a mixture of Gaussians model, we concluded that a conjugate Riemannian algorithm can ﬁnd solutions that are not found with standard VBEM. [sent-271, score-0.229]

<p>Author: Jeff Beck, Alexandre Pouget, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that humans and animals typically reason probabilistically about their environment. This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efﬁcient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be naturally implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identiﬁcation of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classiﬁcation, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb’s rule and describe an extension of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes. 1 Introduction to Probabilistic Inference in Cortex Probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning provides a coherent and, in many ways, optimal framework for dealing with complex problems in an uncertain world. It is, therefore, somewhat reassuring that behavioural experiments reliably demonstrate that humans and animals behave in a manner consistent with optimal probabilistic reasoning when performing a wide variety of perceptual [1, 2, 3], motor [4, 5, 6], and cognitive tasks[7]. This remarkable ability requires a neural code that represents probability distribution functions of task relevant stimuli rather than just single values. While there 1 are many ways to represent functions, Bayes rule tells us that when it comes to probability distribution functions, there is only one statistically optimal way to do it. More precisely, Bayes Rule states that any pattern of activity, r, that efﬁciently represents a probability distribution over some task relevant quantity s, must satisfy the relationship p(s|r) ∝ p(r|s)p(s), where p(r|s) is the stimulus conditioned likelihood function that speciﬁes the form of neural variability, p(s) gives the prior belief regarding the stimulus, and p(s|r) gives the posterior distribution over values of the stimulus, s given the representation r . Of course, it is unlikely that the nervous system consistently achieves this level of optimality. None-the-less, Bayes rule suggests the existence of a link between neural variability as characterized by the likelihood function p(r|s) and the state of belief of a mature statistical learning machine such as the brain. The so called Probabilistic Population Coding (or PPC) framework[8, 9, 10] takes this link seriously by proposing that the function encoded by a pattern of neural activity r is, in fact, the likelihood function p(r|s). When this is the case, the precise form of the neural variability informs the nature of the neural code. For example, the exponential family of statistical models with linear sufﬁcient statistics has been shown to be ﬂexible enough to model the ﬁrst and second order statistics of in vivo recordings in awake behaving monkeys[9, 11, 12] and anesthetized cats[13]. When the likelihood function is modeled in this way, the log posterior probability over the stimulus is linearly encoded by neural activity, i.e. log p(s|r) = h(s) · r − log Z(r) (1) Here, the stimulus dependent kernel, h(s), is a vector of functions of s, the dot represents a standard dot product, and Z(r) is the partition function which serves to normalize the posterior. This log linear form for a posterior distribution is highly computationally convenient and allows for evidence integration to be implemented via linear operations on neural activity[14, 8]. Proponents of this kind of linear PPC have demonstrated how to build biologically plausible neural networks capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference that are needed to optimally perform the behavioural tasks listed above. This includes, linear PPC implementations of cue combination[8], evidence integration over time, maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior estimation[9], coordinate transformation/auditory localization[10], object tracking/Kalman ﬁltering[10], explaining away[10], and visual search[15]. Moreover, each of these neural computations has required only a single recurrently connected layer of neurons that is capable of just two non-linear operations: coincidence detection and divisive normalization, both of which are widely observed in cortex[16, 17]. Unfortunately, this research program has been a piecemeal effort that has largely proceeded by building neural networks designed deal with particular problems. As a result, there have been no proposals for a general principle by which neural network implementations of linear PPCs might be generated and no suggestions regarding how to deal with complex (intractable) problems of probabilistic inference. In this work, we will partially address this short coming by showing that Variation Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm provides a general scheme for approximate inference and learning with linear PPCs. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the VBEM algorithm and show how it naturally leads to a linear PPC representation of the posterior as well as constraints on the neural network dynamics which build that PPC representation. Because this section describes the VB-PPC approach rather abstractly, the remainder of the paper is dedicated to concrete applications. As a motivating example, we consider the problem of inferring the concentrations of odors in an olfactory scene from a complex pattern of spikes in a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In section 3, we argue that this requires solving a spike pattern demixing problem which is indicative of the generic problem faced by many layers of cortex. We then show that this demixing problem is equivalent to the problem addressed by a class of models for text documents know as probabilistic topic models, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA[18]. In section 4, we apply the VB-PPC approach to build a neural network implementation of probabilistic inference and learning for LDA. This derivation shows that causal inference with linear PPC’s also critically relies on divisive normalization. This result suggests that this particular non-linearity may be involved in very general and fundamental probabilistic computation, rather than simply playing a role in gain modulation. In this section, we also show how this formulation allows for a probabilistic treatment of learning and show that a simple variation of Hebb’s rule can implement Bayesian learning in neural circuits. 2 We conclude this work by generalizing this approach to time varying inputs by introducing the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) which can infer short term ﬂuctuations in the concentrations of individual topics/odors and can be used to model foraging and other tracking tasks. 2 Variational Bayesian Inference with linear Probabilistic Population Codes Variational Bayesian (VB) inference refers to a class of deterministic methods for approximating the intractable integrals which arise in the context of probabilistic reasoning. Properly implemented it can result a fast alternative to sampling based methods of inference such as MCMC[19] sampling. Generically, the goal of any Bayesian inference algorithm is to infer a posterior distribution over behaviourally relevant latent variables Z given observations X and a generative model which speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Θ, Z). This task is confounded by the fact that the generative model includes latent parameters Θ which must be marginalized out, i.e. we wish to compute, p(Z|X) ∝ p(X, Θ, Z)dΘ (2) When the number of latent parameters is large this integral can be quite unwieldy. The VB algorithms simplify this marginalization by approximating the complex joint distribution over behaviourally relevant latents and parameters, p(Θ, Z|X), with a distribution q(Θ, Z) for which integrals of this form are easier to deal with in some sense. There is some art to choosing the particular form for the approximating distribution to make the above integral tractable, however, a factorized approximation is common, i.e. q(Θ, Z) = qΘ (Θ)qZ (Z). Regardless, for any given observation X, the approximate posterior is found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Θ, Z) and p(Θ, Z|X). When a factorized posterior is assumed, the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization (VBEM) algorithm ﬁnds a local minimum of the KL divergence by iteratively updating, qΘ (Θ) and qZ (Z) according to the scheme n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qZ (Z) and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ log p(X, Θ, Z) n qΘ (Θ) (3) Here the brackets indicate an expected value taken with respect to the subscripted probability distribution function and the tilde indicates equality up to a constant which is independent of Θ and Z. The key property to note here is that the approximate posterior which results from this procedure is in an exponential family form and is therefore representable by a linear PPC (Eq. 1). This feature allows for the straightforward construction of networks which implement the VBEM algorithm with linear PPC’s in the following way. If rn and rn are patterns of activity that use a linear PPC representation Θ Z of the relevant posteriors, then n log qΘ (Θ) ∼ hΘ (Θ) · rn Θ and n+1 log qZ (Z) ∼ hZ (Z) · rn+1 . Z (4) Here the stimulus dependent kernels hZ (Z) and hΘ (Θ) are chosen so that their outer product results in a basis that spans the function space on Z × Θ given by log p(X, Θ, Z) for every X. This choice guarantees that there exist functions fΘ (X, rn ) and fZ (X, rn ) such that Z Θ rn = fΘ (X, rn ) Θ Z and rn+1 = fZ (X, rn ) Θ Z (5) satisfy Eq. 3. When this is the case, simply iterating the discrete dynamical system described by Eq. 5 until convergence will ﬁnd the VBEM approximation to the posterior. This is one way to build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm. However, its not the only way. In general, any dynamical system which has stable ﬁxed points in common with Eq. 5 can also be said to implement the VBEM algorithm. In the example below we will take advantage of this ﬂexibility in order to build biologically plausible neural network implementations. 3 Response! to Mixture ! of Odors! Single	  Odor	  Response	  Cause Intensity	  Figure 1: (Left) Each cause (e.g. coffee) in isolation results in a pattern of neural activity (top). When multiple causes contribute to a scene this results in an overall pattern of neural activity which is a mixture of these patterns weighted by the intensities (bottom). (Right) The resulting pattern can be represented by a raster, where each spike is colored by its corresponding latent cause. 3 Probabilistic Topic Models for Spike Train Demixing Consider the problem of odor identiﬁcation depicted in Fig. 1. A typical mammalian olfactory system consists of a few hundred different types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), each of which responds to a wide range of volatile chemicals. This results in a highly distributed code for each odor. Since, a typical olfactory scene consists of many different odors at different concentrations, the pattern of ORN spike trains represents a complex mixture. Described in this way, it is easy to see that the problem faced by early olfactory cortex can be described as the task of demixing spike trains to infer latent causes (odor intensities). In many ways this olfactory problem is a generic problem faced by each cortical layer as it tries to make sense of the activity of the neurons in the layer below. The input patterns of activity consist of spikes (or spike counts) labeled by the axons which deliver them and summarized by a histogram which indicates how many spikes come from each input neuron. Of course, just because a spike came from a particular neuron does not mean that it had a particular cause, just as any particular ORN spike could have been caused by any one of a large number of volatile chemicals. Like olfactory codes, cortical codes are often distributed and multiple latent causes can be present at the same time. Regardless, this spike or histogram demixing problem is formally equivalent to a class of demixing problems which arise in the context of probabilistic topic models used for document modeling. A simple but successful example of this kind of topic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [18]. LDA assumes that word order in documents is irrelevant and, therefore, models documents as histograms of word counts. It also assumes that there are K topics and that each of these topics appears in different proportions in each document, e.g. 80% of the words in a document might be concerned with coffee and 20% with strawberries. Words from a given topic are themselves drawn from a distribution over words associated with that topic, e.g. when talking about coffee you have a 5% chance of using the word ’bitter’. The goal of LDA is to infer both the distribution over topics discussed in each document and the distribution of words associated with each topic. We can map the generative model for LDA onto the task of spike demixing in cortex by letting topics become latent causes or odors, words become neurons, word occurrences become spikes, word distributions associated with each topic become patterns of neural activity associated with each cause, and different documents become the observed patterns of neural activity on different trials. This equivalence is made explicit in Fig. 2 which describes the standard generative model for LDA applied to documents on the left and mixtures of spikes on the right. 4 LDA Inference and Network Implementation In this section we will apply the VB-PPC formulation to build a biologically plausible network capable of approximating probabilistic inference for spike pattern demixing. For simplicity, we will use the equivalent Gamma-Poisson formulation of LDA which directly models word and topic counts 4 1. For each topic k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Distribution over words βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For document d = 1, . . . , D, (a) Distribution over topics θd ∼ Dirichlet(α0 ) (b) For word m = 1, . . . , Ωd i.

Neuron assignment ωd,m ∼ Multinomial(βzm ) Figure 2: (Left) The LDA generative model in the context of document modeling. (Right) The corresponding LDA generative model mapped onto the problem of spike demixing. Text related attributes on the left, in red, have been replaced with neural attributes on the right, in green. rather than topic assignments. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne, Rd,j to be the number of times neuron j ﬁres during trial d. Similarly, we let Nd,j,k to be the number of times a spike in neuron j comes from cause k in trial d. These new variables play the roles of the cause and neuron assignment variables, zd,m and ωd,m by simply counting them up. If we let cd,k be an un-normalized intensity of cause j such that θd,k = cd,k / k cd,k then the generative model, Rd,j = k Nd,j,k Nd,j,k ∼ Poisson(βj,k cd,k ) 0 cd,k ∼ Gamma(αk , C −1 ). (6) is equivalent to the topic models described above. Here the parameter C is a scale parameter which sets the expected total number of spikes from the population on each trial. Note that, the problem of inferring the wj,k and cd,k is a non-negative matrix factorization problem similar to that considered by Lee and Seung[20]. The primary difference is that, here, we are attempting to infer a probability distribution over these quantities rather than maximum likelihood estimates. See supplement for details. Following the prescription laid out in section 2, we approximate the posterior over latent variables given a set of input patterns, Rd , d = 1, . . . , D, with a factorized distribution of the form, qN (N)qc (c)qβ (β). This results in marginal posterior distributions q (β:,k |η:,k ), q cd,k |αd,k , C −1 + 1 ), and q (Nd,j,: | log pd,j,: , Rd,i ) which are Dirichlet, Gamma, and Multinomial respectively. Here, the parameters η:,k , αd,k , and log pd,j,: are the natural parameters of these distributions. The VBEM update algorithm yields update rules for these parameters which are summarized in Fig. 3 Algorithm1. Algorithm 1: Batch VB updates 1: while ηj,k not converged do 2: for d = 1, · · · , D do 3: while pd,j,k , αd,k not converged do 4: αd,k → α0 + j Rd,j pd,j,k 5: pd,j,k → Algorithm 2: Online VB updates 1: for d = 1, · · · , D do 2: reinitialize pj,k , αk ∀j, k 3: while pj,k , αk not converged do 4: αk → α0 + j Rd,j pj,k 5: pj,k → exp (ψ(ηj,k )−ψ(¯k )) exp ψ(αk ) η η i exp (ψ(ηj,i )−ψ(¯i )) exp ψ(αi ) exp (ψ(ηj,k )−ψ(¯k )) exp ψ(αd,k ) η η i exp (ψ(ηj,i )−ψ(¯i )) exp ψ(αd,i ) 6: end while 7: end for 8: ηj,k = η 0 + 9: end while end while ηj,k → (1 − dt)ηj,k + dt(η 0 + Rd,j pj,k ) 8: end for 6: 7: d Rd,j pd,j,k Figure 3: Here ηk = j ηj,k and ψ(x) is the digamma function so that exp ψ(x) is a smoothed ¯ threshold linear function. Before we move on to the neural network implementation, note that this standard formulation of variational inference for LDA utilizes a batch learning scheme that is not biologically plausible. Fortunately, an online version of this variational algorithm was recently proposed and shown to give 5 superior results when compared to the batch learning algorithm[21]. This algorithm replaces the sum over d in update equation for ηj,k with an incremental update based upon only the most recently observed pattern of spikes. See Fig. 3 Algorithm 2. 4.1 Neural Network Implementation Recall that the goal was to build a neural network that implements the VBEM algorithm for the underlying latent causes of a mixture of spikes using a neural code that represents the posterior distribution via a linear PPC. A linear PPC represents the natural parameters of a posterior distribution via a linear operation on neural activity. Since the primary quantity of interest here is the posterior distribution over odor concentrations, qc (c|α), this means that we need a pattern of activity rα which is linearly related to the αk ’s in the equations above. One way to accomplish this is to simply assume that the ﬁring rates of output neurons are equal to the positive valued αk parameters. Fig. 4 depicts the overall network architecture. Input patterns of activity, R, are transmitted to the synapses of a population of output neurons which represent the αk ’s. The output activity is pooled to ¯ form an un-normalized prediction of the activity of each input neuron, Rj , given the output layer’s current state of belief about the latent causes of the Rj . The activity at each synapse targeted by input neuron j is then inhibited divisively by this prediction. This results in a dendrite that reports to the ¯ soma a quantity, Nj,k , which represents the fraction of unexplained spikes from input neuron j that could be explained by latent cause k. A continuous time dynamical system with this feature and the property that it shares its ﬁxed points with the LDA algorithm is given by d ¯ Nj,k dt d αk dt ¯ ¯ = wj,k Rj − Rj Nj,k = (7) ¯ Nj,k exp (ψ (¯k )) (α0 − αk ) + exp (ψ (αk )) η (8) i ¯ where Rj = k wj,k exp (ψ (αk )), and wj,k = exp (ψ (ηj,k )). Note that, despite its form, it is Eq. 7 which implements the required divisive normalization operation since, in the steady state, ¯ ¯ Nj,k = wj,k Rj /Rj . Regardless, this network has a variety of interesting properties that align well with biology. It predicts that a balance of excitation and inhibition is maintained in the dendrites via divisive normalization and that the role of inhibitory neurons is to predict the input spikes which target individual dendrites. It also predicts superlinear facilitation. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal term on the right of Eq. 8 indicates that more active cells will be more sensitive to their dendritic inputs. Alternatively, this could be implemented via recurrent excitation at the population level. In either case, this is the mechanism by which the network implements a sparse prior on topic concentrations and stands in stark contrast to the winner take all mechanisms which rely on competitive mutual inhibition mechanisms. Additionally, the ηj in Eq. 8 represents a cell wide ’leak’ parameter that indicates that the total leak should be ¯ roughly proportional to the sum total weight of the synapses which drive the neuron. This predicts that cells that are highly sensitive to input should also decay back to baseline more quickly. This implementation also predicts Hebbian learning of synaptic weights. To observe this fact, note that the online update rule for the ηj,k parameters can be implemented by simply correlating the activity at ¯ each synapse, Nj,k with activity at the soma αj via the equation: τL d ¯ wj,k = exp (ψ (¯k )) (η0 − 1/2 − wj,k ) + Nj,k exp ψ (αk ) η dt (9) where τL is a long time constant for learning and we have used the fact that exp (ψ (ηjk )) ≈ ηjk −1/2 for x > 1. For a detailed derivation see the supplementary material. 5 Dynamic Document Model LDA is a rather simple generative model that makes several unrealistic assumptions about mixtures of sensory and cortical spikes.

This makes LDA a rather poor computational model for a task like olfactory foraging which requires the animal to track the rise a fall of odor intensities as it navigates its environment. We can model this more complicated task by replacing the static cause or odor intensity parameters with dynamic odor intensity parameters whose behavior is governed by an exponentiated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with drift and diffusion matrices given by (Λ and ΣD ). We call this variant of LDA the Dynamic Document Model (DDM) as it could be used to model smooth changes in the distribution of topics over the course of a single document. 5.1 DDM Model Thus the generative model for the DDM is as follows: 1. For latent cause k = 1, . . . , K, (a) Cause distribution over spikes βk ∼ Dirichlet(η0 ) 2. For scene t = 1, . . . , T , (a) Log intensity of causes c(t) ∼ Normal(Λct−1 , ΣD ) (b) Number of spikes in neuron j resulting from cause k, Nj,k (t) ∼ Poisson(βj,k exp ck (t)) (c) Number of spikes in neuron j, Rj (t) = k Nj,k (t) This model bears many similarities to the Correlated and Dynamic topic models[22], but models dynamics over a short time scale, where the dynamic relationship (Λ, ΣD ) is important. 5.2 Network Implementation Once again the quantity of interest is the current distribution of latent causes, p(c(t)|R(τ ), τ = 0..T ). If no spikes occur then no evidence is presented and posterior inference over c(t) is simply given by an undriven Kalman ﬁlter with parameters (Λ, ΣD ). A recurrent neural network which uses a linear PPC to encode a posterior that evolves according to a Kalman ﬁlter has the property that neural responses are linearly related to the inverse covariance matrix of the posterior as well as that inverse covariance matrix times the posterior mean. In the absence of evidence, it is easy to show that these quantities must evolve according to recurrent dynamics which implement divisive normalization[10]. Thus, the patterns of neural activity which linearly encode them must do so as well. When a new spike arrives, optimal inference is no longer possible and a variational approximation must be utilized. As is shown in the supplement, this variational approximation is similar to the variational approximation used for LDA. As a result, a network which can divisively inhibit its synapses is able to implement approximate Bayesian inference. Curiously, this implies that the addition of spatial and temporal correlations to the latent causes adds very little complexity to the VB-PPC network implementation of probabilistic inference. All that is required is an additional inhibitory population which targets the somata in the output population.

Black shows true concentration, blue and red (indistinguishable) show MAP estimates for the network and VBEM algorithms. 6 Experimental Results We compared the PPC neural network implementations of the variational inference with the standard VBEM algorithm. This comparison is necessary because the two algorithms are not guaranteed to converge to the same solution due to the fact that we only required that the neural network dynamics have the same ﬁxed points as the standard VBEM algorithm. As a result, it is possible for the two algorithms to converge to different local minima of the KL divergence. For the network implementation of LDA we ﬁnd good agreement between the neural network and VBEM estimates of the natural parameters of the posterior. See Fig. 6(left) which shows the two algorithms estimates of the shape parameter of the posterior distribution over topic (odor) concentrations (a quantity which is proportional to the expected concentration). This agreement, however, is not perfect, especially when posterior predicted concentrations are low. In part, this is due to the fact we are presenting the network with difﬁcult inference problems for which the true posterior distribution over topics (odors) is highly correlated and multimodal. As a result, the objective function (KL divergence) is littered with local minima. Additionally, the discrete iterations of the VBEM algorithm can take very large steps in the space of natural parameters while the neural network implementation cannot. In contrast, the network implementation of the DDM is in much better agreement with the VBEM estimation. See Fig. 6(right). This is because the smooth temporal dynamics of the topics eliminate the need for the VBEM algorithm to take large steps. As a result, the smooth network dynamics are better able to accurately track the VBEM algorithms output. For simulation details please see the supplement. 7 Discussion and Conclusion In this work we presented a general framework for inference and learning with linear Probabilistic Population codes. This framework takes advantage of the fact that the Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm generates approximate posterior distributions which are in an exponential family form. This is precisely the form needed in order to make probability distributions representable by a linear PPC. We then outlined a general means by which one can build a neural network implementation of the VB algorithm using this kind of neural code. We applied this VB-PPC framework to generate a biologically plausible neural network for spike train demixing. We chose this problem because it has many of the features of the canonical problem faced by nearly every layer of cortex, i.e. that of inferring the latent causes of complex mixtures of spike trains in the layer below. Curiously, this very complicated problem of probabilistic inference and learning ended up having a remarkably simple network solution, requiring only that neurons be capable of implementing divisive normalization via dendritically targeted inhibition and superlinear facilitation. Moreover, we showed that extending this approach to the more complex dynamic case in which latent causes change in intensity over time does not substantially increase the complexity of the neural circuit. Finally, we would like to note that, while we utilized a rate coding scheme for our linear PPC, the basic equations would still apply to any spike based log probability codes such as that considered Beorlin and Deneve[23]. 8 References [1] Daniel Kersten, Pascal Mamassian, and Alan Yuille.

Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a general method for deriving collapsed variational inference algorithms for probabilistic models in the conjugate exponential family. Our method uniﬁes many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean ﬁeld update equations have been derived. Empirically we show signiﬁcant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound. 1</p><p>2 0.80117673 <a title="129-lsi-2" href="./nips-2012-Truly_Nonparametric_Online_Variational_Inference_for_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes.html">354 nips-2012-Truly Nonparametric Online Variational Inference for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes</a></p>

Our method constructs a concave lower bound that is optimized using an efﬁcient ﬁxed-point updating algorithm. We show that the new algorithm has highly competitive computational complexity, matching that of alternative approximate inference methods. We also prove that the use of concave variational bounds provides stable and guaranteed convergence – a property not available to other approaches. We show empirically for both binary and multi-class classiﬁcation that our new algorithm converges much faster than existing variational methods, and without any degradation in performance. 1</p><p>5 0.59230042 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Affine_Independent_Variational_Inference.html">37 nips-2012-Affine Independent Variational Inference</a></p>

In particular, for generalised linear models we describe approximating densities formed from an afﬁne transformation of independently distributed latent variables, this class including many well known densities as special cases. We show how all relevant quantities can be efﬁciently computed using the fast Fourier transform. This extends the known class of tractable variational approximations and enables the ﬁtting for example of skew variational densities to the target density. 1</p><p>6 0.56675136 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Scalable_Inference_of_Overlapping_Communities.html">298 nips-2012-Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities</a></p>

<p>Author: Karol Gregor, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: Early stages of visual processing are thought to decorrelate, or whiten, the incoming temporally varying signals. Motivated by the cascade structure of the visual pathway (retina → lateral geniculate nucelus (LGN) → primary visual cortex, V1) we propose to model its function using lattice ﬁlters - signal processing devices for stage-wise decorrelation of temporal signals. Lattice ﬁlter models predict neuronal responses consistent with physiological recordings in cats and primates. In particular, they predict temporal receptive ﬁelds of two different types resembling so-called lagged and non-lagged cells in the LGN. Moreover, connection weights in the lattice ﬁlter can be learned using Hebbian rules in a stage-wise sequential manner reminiscent of the neuro-developmental sequence in mammals. In addition, lattice ﬁlters can model visual processing in insects. Therefore, lattice ﬁlter is a useful abstraction that captures temporal aspects of visual processing. Our sensory organs face an ongoing barrage of stimuli from the world and must transmit as much information about them as possible to the rest of the brain [1]. This is a formidable task because, in sensory modalities such as vision, the dynamic range of natural stimuli (more than three orders of magnitude) greatly exceeds the dynamic range of relay neurons (less than two orders of magnitude) [2]. The reason why high ﬁdelity transmission is possible at all is that the continuity of objects in the physical world leads to correlations in natural stimuli, which imply redundancy. In turn, such redundancy can be eliminated by compression performed by the front end of the visual system leading to the reduction of the dynamic range [3, 4]. A compression strategy appropriate for redundant natural stimuli is called predictive coding [5, 6, 7]. In predictive coding, a prediction of the incoming signal value is computed from past values delayed in the circuit. This prediction is subtracted from the actual signal value and only the prediction error is transmitted. In the absence of transmission noise such compression is lossless as the original signal could be decoded on the receiving end by inverting the encoder. If predictions are accurate, the dynamic range of the error is much smaller than that of the natural stimuli. Therefore, minimizing dynamic range using predictive coding reduces to optimizing prediction. Experimental support for viewing the front end of the visual system as a predictive encoder comes from the measurements of receptive ﬁelds [6, 7]. In particular, predictive coding suggests that, for natural stimuli, the temporal receptive ﬁelds should be biphasic and the spatial receptive ﬁelds center-surround. These predictions are born out by experimental measurements in retinal ganglion cells, [8], lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons [9] and ﬂy second order visual neurons called large monopolar cells (LMCs) [2]. In addition, the experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds vary with signal-to-noise ratio as would be expected from optimal prediction theory [6]. Furthermore, experimentally observed whitening of the transmitted signal [10] is consistent with removing correlated components from the incoming signals [11]. As natural stimuli contain correlations on time scales greater than hundred milliseconds, experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds of LGN neurons are equally long [12]. Decorrelation over such long time scales requires equally long delays. How can such extended receptive ﬁeld be produced by 1 biological neurons and synapses whose time constants are typically less than hundred milliseconds [13]? The ﬁeld of signal processing offers a solution to this problem in the form of a device called a lattice ﬁlter, which decorrelates signals in stages, sequentially adding longer and longer delays [14, 15, 16, 17]. Motivated by the cascade structure of visual systems [18], we propose to model decorrelation in them by lattice ﬁlters. Naturally, visual systems are more complex than lattice ﬁlters and perform many other operations. However, we show that the lattice ﬁlter model explains several existing observations in vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems and makes testable predictions. Therefore, we believe that lattice ﬁlters provide a convenient abstraction for modeling temporal aspects of visual processing. This paper is organized as follows. First, we brieﬂy summarize relevant results from linear prediction theory. Second, we explain the operation of the lattice ﬁlter in discrete and continuous time. Third, we compare lattice ﬁlter predictions with physiological measurements. 1 Linear prediction theory Despite the non-linear nature of neurons and synapses, the operation of some neural circuits in vertebrates [19] and invertebrates [20] can be described by a linear systems theory. The advantage of linear systems is that optimal circuit parameters may be obtained analytically and the results are often intuitively clear. Perhaps not surprisingly, the ﬁeld of signal processing relies heavily on the linear prediction theory, offering a convenient framework [15, 16, 17]. Below, we summarize the results from linear prediction that will be used to explain the operation of the lattice ﬁlter. Consider a scalar sequence y = {yt } where time t = 1, . . . , n. Suppose that yt at each time point depends on side information provided by vector zt . Our goal is to generate a series of linear predictions, yt from the vector zt , yt = w · zt . We deﬁne a prediction error as: ˆ ˆ et = yt − yt = yt − w · zt ˆ (1) and look for values of w that minimize mean squared error: e2 = 1 nt e2 = t t 1 nt (yt − w · zt )2 . (2) t The weight vector, w is optimal for prediction of sequence y from sequence z if and only if the prediction error sequence e = y − w · z is orthogonal to each component of vector z: ez = 0. (3) When the whole series y is given in advance, i.e. in the ofﬂine setting, these so-called normal equations can be solved for w, for example, by Gaussian elimination [21]. However, in signal processing and neuroscience applications, another setting called online is more relevant: At every time step t, prediction yt must be made using only current values of zt and w. Furthermore, after a ˆ prediction is made, w is updated based on the prediction yt and observed yt , zt . ˆ In the online setting, an algorithm called stochastic gradient descent is often used, where, at each time step, w is updated in the direction of negative gradient of e2 : t w →w−η w (yt − w · zt ) 2 . (4) This leads to the following weight update, known as least mean square (LMS) [15], for predicting sequence y from sequence z: w → w + ηet zt , (5) where η is the learning rate. The value of η represents the relative inﬂuence of more recent observations compared to more distant ones. The larger the learning rate the faster the system adapts to recent observations and less past it remembers. In this paper, we are interested in predicting a current value xt of sequence x from its past values xt−1 , . . . , xt−k restricted by the prediction order k > 0: xt = wk · (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . ˆ 2 (6) This problem is a special case of the online linear prediction framework above, where yt = xt , zt = (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . Then the gradient update is given by: w → wk + ηet (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T . (7) While the LMS algorithm can ﬁnd the weights that optimize linear prediction (6), the ﬁlter wk has a long temporal extent making it difﬁcult to implement with neurons and synapses. 2 Lattice ﬁlters One way to generate long receptive ﬁelds in circuits of biological neurons is to use a cascade architecture, known as the lattice ﬁlter, which calculates optimal linear predictions for temporal sequences and transmits prediction errors [14, 15, 16, 17]. In this section, we explain the operation of a discrete-time lattice ﬁlter, then adapt it to continuous-time operation. 2.1 Discrete-time implementation The ﬁrst stage of the lattice ﬁlter, Figure 1, calculates the error of the ﬁrst order optimal prediction (i.e. only using the preceding element of the sequence), the second stage uses the output of the ﬁrst stage and calculates the error of the second order optimal prediction (i.e. using only two previous values) etc. To make such stage-wise error computations possible the lattice ﬁlter calculates at every stage not only the error of optimal prediction of xt from past values xt−1 , . . . , xt−k , called forward error, ftk = xt − wk · (xt−1 , . . . , xt−k )T , (8) but, perhaps non-intuitively, also the error of optimal prediction of a past value xt−k from the more recent values xt−k+1 , . . . , xt , called backward error: bk = xt−k − w k · (xt−k+1 , . . . , xt )T , t k where w and w k (9) are the weights of the optimal prediction. For example, the ﬁrst stage of the ﬁlter calculates the forward error ft1 of optimal prediction of xt from xt−1 : ft1 = xt − u1 xt−1 as well as the backward error b1 of optimal prediction of xt−1 from t xt : b1 = xt−1 − v 1 xt , Figure 1. Here, we assume that coefﬁcients u1 and v 1 that give optimal linear t prediction are known and return to learning them below. Each following stage of the lattice ﬁlter performs a stereotypic operation on its inputs, Figure 1. The k-th stage (k > 1) receives forward, ftk−1 , and backward, bk−1 , errors from the previous stage, t delays backward error by one time step and computes a forward error: ftk = ftk−1 − uk bk−1 t−1 (10) of the optimal linear prediction of ftk−1 from bk−1 . In addition, each stage computes a backward t−1 error k−1 k bt = bt−1 − v k ftk−1 (11) of the optimal linear prediction of bk−1 from ftk−1 . t−1 As can be seen in Figure 1, the lattice ﬁlter contains forward prediction error (top) and backward prediction error (bottom) branches, which interact at every stage via cross-links. Operation of the lattice ﬁlter can be characterized by the linear ﬁlters acting on the input, x, to compute forward or backward errors of consecutive order, so called prediction-error ﬁlters (blue bars in Figure 1). Because of delays in the backward error branch the temporal extent of the ﬁlters grows from stage to stage. In the next section, we will argue that prediction-error ﬁlters correspond to the measurements of temporal receptive ﬁelds in neurons. For detailed comparison with physiological measurements we will use the result that, for bi-phasic prediction-error ﬁlters, such as the ones in Figure 1, the ﬁrst bar of the forward prediction-error ﬁlter has larger weight, by absolute value, than the combined weights of the remaining coefﬁcients of the corresponding ﬁlter. Similarly, in backward predictionerror ﬁlters, the last bar has greater weight than the rest of them combined. This fact arises from the observation that forward prediction-error ﬁlters are minimum phase, while backward predictionerror ﬁlters are maximum phase [16, 17]. 3 Figure 1: Discrete-time lattice ﬁlter performs stage-wise computation of forward and backward prediction errors. In the ﬁrst stage, the optimal prediction of xt from xt−1 is computed by delaying the input by one time step and multiplying it by u1 . The upper summation unit subtracts the predicted xt from the actual value and outputs prediction error ft1 . Similarly, the optimal prediction of xt−1 from xt is computed by multiplying the input by v 1 . The lower summation unit subtracts the optimal prediction from the actual value and outputs backward error b1 . In each following stage t k, the optimal prediction of ftk−1 from bk−1 is computed by delaying bk−1 by one time step and t t multiplying it by uk . The upper summation unit subtracts the prediction from the actual ftk−1 and outputs prediction error ftk . Similarly, the optimal prediction of bk−1 from ftk−1 is computed by t−1 multiplying it by uk . The lower summation unit subtracts the optimal prediction from the actual value and outputs backward error bk . Black connections have unitary weights and red connections t have learnable negative weights. One can view forward and backward error calculations as applications of so-called prediction-error ﬁlters (blue) to the input sequence. Note that the temporal extent of the ﬁlters gets longer from stage to stage. Next, we derive a learning rule for ﬁnding optimal coefﬁcients u and v in the online setting. The uk is used for predicting ftk−1 from bk−1 to obtain error ftk . By substituting yt = ftk−1 , zt = bk−1 and t−1 t−1 et = ftk into (5) the update of uk becomes uk → uk + ηftk bk−1 . t−1 (12) Similarly, v k is updated by v k → v k + ηbk ftk−1 . (13) t Interestingly, the updates of the weights are given by the product of the activities of outgoing and incoming nodes of the corresponding cross-links. Such updates are known as Hebbian learning rules thought to be used by biological neurons [22, 23]. Finally, we give a simple proof that, in the ofﬂine setting when the entire sequence x is known, f k and bk , given by equations (10, 11), are indeed errors of optimal k-th order linear prediction. Let D be one step time delay operator (Dx)t = xt−1 . The induction statement at k is that f k and bk are k-th order forward and backward errors of optimal linear prediction which is equivalent to f k and bk k k being of the form f k = x−w1 Dx−. . .−wk Dk x and bk = Dk x−w1k Dk−1 x−. . .−wkk x and, from k i normal equations (3), satisfying f D x = 0 and Dbk Di x = bk Di−1 x = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k. That this is true for k = 1 directly follows from the deﬁnition of f 1 and b1 . Now we assume that this is true for k − 1 ≥ 1 and show it is true for k. It is easy to see from the forms of f k−1 and bk−1 k k and from f k = f k−1 − uk Dbk−1 that f k has the correct form f k = x − w1 Dx − . . . − wk Dk x. k i k−1 k k−1 Regarding orthogonality for i = 1, . . . , k − 1 we have f D x = (f − u Db )Di x = f k−1 Di x − uk (Dbk−1 )Di x = 0 using the induction assumptions of orhogonality at k − 1. For the remaining i = k we note that f k is the error of the optimal linear prediction of f k−1 from Dbk−1 k−1 and therefore 0 = f k Dbk−1 = f k (Dk x − w1k−1 Dk−1 x − . . . + wk−1 Dx) = f k Dk x as desired. The bk case can be proven similarly. 2.2 Continuous-time implementation The last hurdle remaining for modeling neuronal circuits which operate in continuous time with a lattice ﬁlter is its discrete-time operation. To obtain a continuous-time implementation of the lattice 4 ﬁlter we cannot simply take the time step size to zero as prediction-error ﬁlters would become inﬁnitesimally short. Here, we adapt the discrete-time lattice ﬁlter to continous-time operation in two steps. First, we introduce a discrete-time Laguerre lattice ﬁlter [24, 17] which uses Laguerre polynomials rather than the shift operator to generate its basis functions, Figure 2. The input signal passes through a leaky integrator whose leakage constant α deﬁnes a time-scale distinct from the time step (14). A delay, D, at every stage is replaced by an all-pass ﬁlter, L, (15) with the same constant α, which preserves the magnitude of every Fourier component of the input but shifts its phase in a frequency dependent manner. Such all-pass ﬁlter reduces to a single time-step delay when α = 0. The optimality of a general discrete-time Laguerre lattice ﬁlter can be proven similarly to that for the discrete-time ﬁlter, simply by replacing operator D with L in the proof of section 2.1. Figure 2: Continuous-time lattice ﬁlter using Laguerre polynomials. Compared to the discretetime version, it contains a leaky integrator, L0 ,(16) and replaces delays with all-pass ﬁlters, L, (17). Second, we obtain a continuous-time formulation of the lattice ﬁlter by replacing t − 1 → t − δt, deﬁning the inverse time scale γ = (1 − α)/δt and taking the limit δt → 0 while keeping γ ﬁxed. As a result L0 and L are given by: Discrete time L0 (x)t L(x)t Continuous time = αL0 (x)t−1 + xt (14) = α(L(x)t−1 − xt ) + xt−1 (15) dL0 (x)/dt = −γL0 (x) + x L(x) = x − 2γL0 (x) (16) (17) Representative impulse responses of the continuous Laguerre ﬁlter are shown in Figure 2. Note that, similarly to the discrete-time case, the area under the ﬁrst (peak) phase is greater than the area under the second (rebound) phase in the forward branch and the opposite is true in the backward branch. Moreover, the temporal extent of the rebound is greater than that of the peak not just in the forward branch like in the basic discrete-time implementation but also in the backward branch. As will be seen in the next section, these predictions are conﬁrmed by physiological recordings. 3 Experimental evidence for the lattice ﬁlter in visual pathways In this section we demonstrate that physiological measurements from visual pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates are consistent with the predictions of the lattice ﬁlter model. For the purpose of modeling visual pathways, we identify summation units of the lattice ﬁlter with neurons and propose that neural activity represents forward and backward errors. In the ﬂy visual pathway neuronal activity is represented by continuously varying graded potentials. In the vertebrate visual system, all neurons starting with ganglion cells are spiking and we identify their ﬁring rate with the activity in the lattice ﬁlter. 3.1 Mammalian visual pathway In mammals, visual processing is performed in stages. In the retina, photoreceptors synapse onto bipolar cells, which in turn synapse onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs send axons to the LGN, where they synapse onto LGN relay neurons projecting to the primary visual cortex, V1. In addition to this feedforward pathway, at each stage there are local circuits involving (usually inhibitory) inter-neurons such as horizontal and amacrine cells in the retina. Neurons of each class 5 come in many types, which differ in their connectivity, morphology and physiological response. The bewildering complexity of these circuits has posed a major challenge to visual neuroscience. Alonso et al. • Connections between LGN and Cortex J. Neurosci., June 1, 2001, 21(11):4002–4015 4009 Temporal Filter 1 0.5 0 -0.5 -1 RGC LGN 0 100 Time (ms) 200 Figure 7. Distribution of geniculate cells and simple cells with respect to the timing of their responses. The distribution of three parameters derived from impulse responses of geniculate and cortical neurons is shown. A, Peak time. B, Zero-crossing time. C, Rebound index. Peak time is the time with the strongest response in the ﬁrst phase of the impulse response. Zero-crossing time is the time between the ﬁrst and second phases. Rebound index is the area of the impulse response after the zero crossing divided by the area before the zero crossing. Only impulse responses with good signal to noise were included (Ͼ5 SD above baseline; n ϭ 169). Figure 3: Electrophysiologically measured temporal receptive ﬁelds get progressively longer along the cat visual pathway. Left: A cat LGN cell (red) has a longer receptive ﬁeld than a corresponding RGC cell (blue) (adapted from [12] which also reports population data). Right (A,B): Extent of the temporal receptive ﬁelds of simple cells in cat V1 is greater than that of corresponding LGN cells as quantiﬁed by the peak (A) and zero-crossing (B) times. Right (C): In the temporal receptive ﬁelds of cat LGN and V1 cells the peak can be stronger or weaker than the rebound (adapted from [25]). simple cells and geniculate cells differed for all temporal parameters measured, there was considerable overlap between the distributions (Fig. 7). This overlap raises the following question: does connectivity depend on how well geniculate and cortical responses are matched with respect to time? For instance, do simple cells with fast subregions (early times to peak and early zero crossings) receive input mostly from geniculate cells with fast centers? Figure 8 illustrates the visual responses from a geniculate cell and a simple cell that were monosynaptically connected. A strong positive peak was observed in the correlogram (shown with a 10 msec time window to emphasize its short latency and fast rise time). In this case, an ON central subregion was well overlapped with an ON geniculate center (precisely at the peak of the subregion). Moreover, the timings of the visual responses from the overlapped subregion and the geniculate center were very similar (same onset, ϳ0 –25 msec; same peak, ϳ25–50 msec). It is worth noting that the two central subregions of the simple cell were faster and stronger than the two lateral subregions. The responses of the central subregions matched the timing of the geniculate center. In contrast, the timing of the lateral subregions resembled more closely the timing of the geniculate surround (both peaked at 25–50 msec). Unlike the example shown in Figure 8, a considerable number of geniculocortical pairs produced responses with different timing. For example, Figure 9 illustrates a case in which a geniculate center fully overlapped a strong simple-cell subregion of the same sign, but with slower timing (LGN onset, ϳ0 –25 msec; peak, ϳ25–50 msec; simple-cell onset, ϳ25–50 msec; peak, ϳ50 –75 msec). The cross-correlogram between this pair of neurons was ﬂat, which indicates the absence of a monosynaptic connection (Fig. 9, top right). To examine the role of timing in geniculocortical connectivity, we measured the response time course from all cell pairs that met two criteria. First, the geniculate center overlapped a simple-cell subregion of the same sign (n ϭ 104). Second, the geniculate center overlapped the cortical subregion in a near-optimal position (relative overlap Ͼ 50%, n ϭ 47; see Materials and Methods; Fig. 5A). All these cell pairs had a high probability of being monosynaptically connected because of the precise match in receptive-ﬁeld position and sign (31 of 47 were connected). The distributions of peak time, zero-crossing time, and rebound index from these cell pairs were very similar to the distributions from the entire sample (Fig. 7; see also Fig. 10 legend). The selected cell pairs included both presumed directional (predicted DI Ͼ 0.3, see Materials and Methods; 12/20 connected) and nondirectional (19/27 connected) simple cells. Most geniculate cells had small receptive ﬁelds (less than two simple-cell subregion widths; see Receptive-ﬁeld sign), although ﬁve cells with larger receptive ﬁelds were also included (three connected). From the 47 cell pairs used in this analysis, those with similar response time courses had a higher probability of being connected (Fig. 10). In particular, cell pairs that had both similar peak time and zero-crossing time were all connected (n ϭ 12; Fig. 10 A). Directionally selective simple cells were included in all timing groups. For example, in Figure 10 A there were four, ﬁve, two, and one directionally selective cells in the time groups Ͻ20, 40, 60, and Ͼ60 msec, respectively. Similar results were obtained if we restricted our sample to geniculate centers overlapped with the dominant subregion of the simple cell (n ϭ 31). Interestingly, the efﬁcacy and contributions of the connections seemed to depend little on the relative timing of the visual responses (Fig. 10, right). Although our sample of them was quite small, lagged cells are of considerable interest and therefore deserve comment. We recorded from 13 potentially lagged LGN cells whose centers were superimposed with a simple-cell subregion (eight with rebound indices between 1.2 and 1.5; ﬁve with rebound indices Ͼ1.9). Only seven of these pairs could be used for timing comparisons (in one pair the baseline of the correlogram had insufﬁcient spikes; in three pairs the geniculate receptive ﬁelds were Here, we point out several experimental observations related to temporal processing in the visual system consistent with the lattice ﬁlter model. First, measurements of temporal receptive ﬁelds demonstrate that they get progressively longer at each consecutive stage: i) LGN neurons have longer receptive ﬁelds than corresponding pre-synaptic ganglion cells [12], Figure 3left; ii) simple cells in V1 have longer receptive ﬁelds than corresponding pre-synaptic LGN neurons [25], Figure 3rightA,B. These observation are consistent with the progressively greater temporal extent of the prediction-error ﬁlters (blue plots in Figure 2). Second, the weight of the peak (integrated area under the curve) may be either greater or less than that of the rebound both in LGN relay cells [26] and simple cells of V1 [25], Figure 3right(C). Neurons with peak weight exceeding that of rebound are often referred to as non-lagged while the others are known as lagged found both in cat [27, 28, 29] and monkey [30]. The reason for this becomes clear from the response to a step stimulus, Figure 4(top). By comparing experimentally measured receptive ﬁelds with those of the continuous lattice ﬁlter, Figure 4, we identify non-lagged neurons with the forward branch and lagged neurons with the backward branch. Another way to characterize step-stimulus response is whether the sign of the transient is the same (non-lagged) or different (lagged) relative to sustained response. Third, measurements of cross-correlation between RGCs and LGN cell spikes in lagged and nonlagged neurons reveals a difference of the transfer function indicative of the difference in underlying circuitry [30]. This is consistent with backward pathway circuit of the Laguerre lattice ﬁlter, Figure 2, being more complex then that of the forward path (which results in different transfer function). ” (or replacing ”more complex” with ”different”) Third, measurements of cross-correlation between RGCs and LGN cell spikes in lagged and nonlagged neurons reveals a difference of the transfer function indicative of the difference in underlying circuitry [31]. This is consistent with the backward branch circuit of the Laguerre lattice ﬁlter, Figure 2, being different then that of the forward branch (which results in different transfer function). In particular, a combination of different glutamate receptors such as AMPA and NMDA, as well as GABA receptors are thought to be responsible for observed responses in lagged cells [32]. However, further investigation of the corresponding circuitry, perhaps using connectomics technology, is desirable. Fourth, the cross-link weights of the lattice ﬁlter can be learned using Hebbian rules, (12,13) which are biologically plausible [22, 23]. Interestingly, if these weights are learned sequentially, starting from the ﬁrst stage, they do not need to be re-learned when additional stages are added or learned. This property maps naturally on the fact that in the course of mammalian development the visual pathway matures in a stage-wise fashion - starting with the retina, then LGN, then V1 - and implying that the more peripheral structures do not need to adapt to the maturation of the downstream ones. 6 Figure 4: Comparison of electrophysiologically measured responses of cat LGN cells with the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model. Top: Experimentally measured temporal receptive ﬁelds and step-stimulus responses of LGN cells (adapted from [26]). Bottom: Typical examples of responses in the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model. Lattice ﬁlter coefﬁcients were u1 = v 1 = 0.4, u2 = v 2 = 0.2 and 1/γ = 50ms to model the non-lagged cell and u1 = v 1 = u2 = v 2 = 0.2 and 1/γ = 60ms to model the lagged cell. To model photoreceptor contribution to the responses, an additional leaky integrator L0 was added to the circuit of Figure 2. While Hebbian rules are biologically plausible, one may get an impression from Figure 2 that they must apply to inhibitory cross-links. We point out that this circuit is meant to represent only the computation performed rather than the speciﬁc implementation in terms of neurons. As the same linear computation can be performed by circuits with a different arrangement of the same components, there are multiple implementations of the lattice ﬁlter. For example, activity of non-lagged OFF cells may be seen as representing minus forward error. Then the cross-links between the non-lagged OFF pathway and the lagged ON pathway would be excitatory. In general, classiﬁcation of cells into lagged and non-lagged seems independent of their ON/OFF and X/Y classiﬁcation [31, 28, 29], but see[33]. 3.2 Insect visual pathway In insects, two cell types, L1 and L2, both post-synaptic to photoreceptors play an important role in visual processing. Physiological responses of L1 and L2 indicate that they decorrelate visual signals by subtracting their predictable parts. In fact, receptive ﬁelds of these neurons were used as the ﬁrst examples of predictive coding in neuroscience [6]. Yet, as the numbers of synapses from photoreceptors to L1 and L2 are the same [34] and their physiological properties are similar, it has been a mystery why insects, have not just one but a pair of such seemingly redundant neurons per facet. Previously, it was suggested that L1 and L2 provide inputs to the two pathways that map onto ON and OFF pathways in the vertebrate retina [35, 36]. Here, we put forward a hypothesis that the role of L1 and L2 in visual processing is similar to that of the two branches of the lattice ﬁlter. We do not incorporate the ON/OFF distinction in the effectively linear lattice ﬁlter model but anticipate that such combined description will materialize in the future. As was argued in Section 2, in forward prediction-error ﬁlters, the peak has greater weight than the rebound, while in backward prediction-error ﬁlters the opposite is true. Such difference implies that in response to a step-stimulus the signs of sustained responses compared to initial transients are different between the branches. Indeed, Ca2+ imaging shows that responses of L1 and L2 to step-stimulus are different as predicted by the lattice ﬁlter model [35], Figure 5b. Interestingly, the activity of L1 seems to represent minus forward error and L2 - plus backward error, suggesting that the lattice ﬁlter cross-links are excitatory. To summarize, the predictions of the lattice ﬁlter model seem to be consistent with the physiological measurements in the ﬂy visual system and may help understand its operation. 7 Stimulus 1 0.5 0 0 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 5 10 time 15 20 − Forward Error 1 0 −1 0 Backward Error 1 0 −1 0 Figure 5: Response of the lattice ﬁlter and fruit ﬂy LMCs to a step-stimulus. Left: Responses of the ﬁrst order discrete-time lattice ﬁlter to a step stimulus. Right: Responses of ﬂy L1 and L2 cells to a moving step stimulus (adapted from [35]). Predicted and the experimentally measured responses have qualitatively the same shape: a transient followed by sustained response, which has the same sign for the forward error and L1 and the opposite sign for the backward error and L2. 4 Discussion Motivated by the cascade structure of the visual pathway, we propose to model its operation with the lattice ﬁlter. We demonstrate that the predictions of the continuous-time lattice ﬁlter model are consistent with the course of neural development and the physiological measurement in the LGN, V1 of cat and monkey, as well as ﬂy LMC neurons. Therefore, lattice ﬁlters may offer a useful abstraction for understanding aspects of temporal processing in visual systems of vertebrates and invertebrates. Previously, [11] proposed that lagged and non-lagged cells could be a result of rectiﬁcation by spiking neurons. Although we agree with [11] that LGN performs temporal decorrelation, our explanation does not rely on non-linear processing but rather on the cascade architecture and, hence, is fundamentally different. Our model generates the following predictions that are not obvious in [11]: i) Not only are LGN receptive ﬁelds longer than RGC but also V1 receptive ﬁelds are longer than LGN; ii) Even a linear model can generate a difference in the peak/rebound ratio; iii) The circuit from RGC to LGN should be different for lagged and non-lagged cells consistent with [31]; iv) The lattice ﬁlter circuit can self-organize using Hebbian rules, which gives a mechanistic explanation of receptive ﬁelds beyond the normative framework of [11]. In light of the redundancy reduction arguments given in the introduction, we note that, if the only goal of the system were to compress incoming signals using a given number of lattice ﬁlter stages, then after the compression is peformed only one kind of prediction errors, forward or backward needs to be transmitted. Therefore, having two channels, in the absence of noise, may seem redundant. However, transmitting both forward and backward errors gives one the ﬂexibility to continue decorrelation further by adding stages performing relatively simple operations. We are grateful to D.A.

<p>Author: Toke Hansen, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, one has side information, e.g., labels that are provided in a semi-supervised manner, about a speciﬁc target region of a large data set, and one wants to perform machine learning and data analysis tasks “nearby” that pre-speciﬁed target region. Locally-biased problems of this sort are particularly challenging for popular eigenvector-based machine learning and data analysis tools. At root, the reason is that eigenvectors are inherently global quantities. In this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to construct semi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian, and we illustrate how these locally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased machine learning. These semi-supervised eigenvectors capture successively-orthogonalized directions of maximum variance, conditioned on being well-correlated with an input seed set of nodes that is assumed to be provided in a semi-supervised manner. We also provide several empirical examples demonstrating how these semi-supervised eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased learning. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71599507 <a title="129-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Fast_Variational_Inference_in_the_Conjugate_Exponential_Family.html">129 nips-2012-Fast Variational Inference in the Conjugate Exponential Family</a></p>
<p>Author: James Hensman, Magnus Rattray, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a general method for deriving collapsed variational inference algorithms for probabilistic models in the conjugate exponential family. Our method uniﬁes many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean ﬁeld update equations have been derived. Empirically we show signiﬁcant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound. 1</p><p>4 0.66557831 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Gradient-based_kernel_method_for_feature_extraction_and_variable_selection.html">144 nips-2012-Gradient-based kernel method for feature extraction and variable selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Chenlei Leng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel kernel approach to dimension reduction for supervised learning: feature extraction and variable selection; the former constructs a small number of features from predictors, and the latter ﬁnds a subset of predictors. First, a method of linear feature extraction is proposed using the gradient of regression function, based on the recent development of the kernel method. In comparison with other existing methods, the proposed one has wide applicability without strong assumptions on the regressor or type of variables, and uses computationally simple eigendecomposition, thus applicable to large data sets. Second, in combination of a sparse penalty, the method is extended to variable selection, following the approach by Chen et al. [2]. Experimental results show that the proposed methods successfully ﬁnd effective features and variables without parametric models. 1</p><p>5 0.62846935 <a title="129-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Minimax_Multi-Task_Learning_and_a_Generalized_Loss-Compositional_Paradigm_for_MTL.html">212 nips-2012-Minimax Multi-Task Learning and a Generalized Loss-Compositional Paradigm for MTL</a></p>
<p>Author: Nishant Mehta, Dongryeol Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Since its inception, the modus operandi of multi-task learning (MTL) has been to minimize the task-wise mean of the empirical risks. We introduce a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL that includes a spectrum of formulations as a subfamily. One endpoint of this spectrum is minimax MTL: a new MTL formulation that minimizes the maximum of the tasks’ empirical risks. Via a certain relaxation of minimax MTL, we obtain a continuum of MTL formulations spanning minimax MTL and classical MTL. The full paradigm itself is loss-compositional, operating on the vector of empirical risks. It incorporates minimax MTL, its relaxations, and many new MTL formulations as special cases. We show theoretically that minimax MTL tends to avoid worst case outcomes on newly drawn test tasks in the learning to learn (LTL) test setting. The results of several MTL formulations on synthetic and real problems in the MTL and LTL test settings are encouraging. 1</p><p>6 0.6081171 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_Regularized_Dual_Averaging_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization.html">263 nips-2012-Optimal Regularized Dual Averaging Methods for Stochastic Optimization</a></p>

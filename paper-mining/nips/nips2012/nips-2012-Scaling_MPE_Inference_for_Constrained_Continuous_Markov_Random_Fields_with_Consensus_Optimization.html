<p>Author: Robert Gens, Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Sum-product networks are a new deep architecture that can perform fast, exact inference on high-treewidth models. Only generative methods for training SPNs have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst discriminative training algorithms for SPNs, combining the high accuracy of the former with the representational power and tractability of the latter. We show that the class of tractable discriminative SPNs is broader than the class of tractable generative ones, and propose an efﬁcient backpropagation-style algorithm for computing the gradient of the conditional log likelihood. Standard gradient descent suffers from the diffusion problem, but networks with many layers can be learned reliably using “hard” gradient descent, where marginal inference is replaced by MPE inference (i.e., inferring the most probable state of the non-evidence variables). The resulting updates have a simple and intuitive form. We test discriminative SPNs on standard image classiﬁcation tasks. We obtain the best results to date on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using fewer features than prior methods with an SPN architecture that learns local image structure discriminatively. We also report the highest published test accuracy on STL-10 even though we only use the labeled portion of the dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.13802588 <a title="302-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-A_P300_BCI_for_the_Masses%3A_Prior_Information_Enables_Instant_Unsupervised_Spelling.html">14 nips-2012-A P300 BCI for the Masses: Prior Information Enables Instant Unsupervised Spelling</a></p>

In this contribution we introduce a set of unsupervised hierarchical probabilistic models that tackle both problems simultaneously by incorporating prior knowledge from two sources: information from other training subjects (through transfer learning) and information about the words being spelled (through language models). We show, that due to this prior knowledge, the performance of the unsupervised models parallels and in some cases even surpasses that of supervised models, while eliminating the tedious training session. 1</p><p>4 0.091614969 <a title="302-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

We derive a generalization of Newton-type methods to handle such convex but nonsmooth objective functions. We prove such methods are globally convergent and achieve superlinear rates of convergence in the vicinity of an optimal solution. We also demonstrate the performance of these methods using problems of relevance in machine learning and statistics. 1</p><p>6 0.069924802 <a title="302-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Topology_Constraints_in_Graphical_Models.html">346 nips-2012-Topology Constraints in Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Flint, Matthew Blaschko</p><p>Abstract: Boolean satisﬁability (SAT) as a canonical NP-complete decision problem is one of the most important problems in computer science. In practice, real-world SAT sentences are drawn from a distribution that may result in efﬁcient algorithms for their solution. Such SAT instances are likely to have shared characteristics and substructures. This work approaches the exploration of a family of SAT solvers as a learning problem. In particular, we relate polynomial time solvability of a SAT subset to a notion of margin between sentences mapped by a feature function into a Hilbert space. Provided this mapping is based on polynomial time computable statistics of a sentence, we show that the existance of a margin between these data points implies the existance of a polynomial time solver for that SAT subset based on the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm. Furthermore, we show that a simple perceptron-style learning rule will ﬁnd an optimal SAT solver with a bounded number of training updates. We derive a linear time computable set of features and show analytically that margins exist for important polynomial special cases of SAT. Empirical results show an order of magnitude improvement over a state-of-the-art SAT solver on a hardware veriﬁcation task. 1</p><p>5 0.447052 <a title="302-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_the_Architecture_of_Sum-Product_Networks_Using_Clustering_on_Variables.html">191 nips-2012-Learning the Architecture of Sum-Product Networks Using Clustering on Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron Dennis, Dan Ventura</p><p>Abstract: The sum-product network (SPN) is a recently-proposed deep model consisting of a network of sum and product nodes, and has been shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep models on certain difﬁcult tasks such as image completion. Designing an SPN network architecture that is suitable for the task at hand is an open question. We propose an algorithm for learning the SPN architecture from data. The idea is to cluster variables (as opposed to data instances) in order to identify variable subsets that strongly interact with one another. Nodes in the SPN network are then allocated towards explaining these interactions. Experimental evidence shows that learning the SPN architecture signiﬁcantly improves its performance compared to using a previously-proposed static architecture. 1</p><p>6 0.44573325 <a title="302-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Factoring_nonnegative_matrices_with_linear_programs.html">125 nips-2012-Factoring nonnegative matrices with linear programs</a></p>

<p>Author: Romain Cazé, Mark Humphries, Boris S. Gutkin</p><p>Abstract: The integration of excitatory inputs in dendrites is non-linear: multiple excitatory inputs can produce a local depolarization departing from the arithmetic sum of each input’s response taken separately. If this depolarization is bigger than the arithmetic sum, the dendrite is spiking; if the depolarization is smaller, the dendrite is saturating. Decomposing a dendritic tree into independent dendritic spiking units greatly extends its computational capacity, as the neuron then maps onto a two layer neural network, enabling it to compute linearly non-separable Boolean functions (lnBFs). How can these lnBFs be implemented by dendritic architectures in practise? And can saturating dendrites equally expand computational capacity? To address these questions we use a binary neuron model and Boolean algebra. First, we conﬁrm that spiking dendrites enable a neuron to compute lnBFs using an architecture based on the disjunctive normal form (DNF). Second, we prove that saturating dendrites as well as spiking dendrites enable a neuron to compute lnBFs using an architecture based on the conjunctive normal form (CNF). Contrary to a DNF-based architecture, in a CNF-based architecture, dendritic unit tunings do not imply the neuron tuning, as has been observed experimentally. Third, we show that one cannot use a DNF-based architecture with saturating dendrites. Consequently, we show that an important family of lnBFs implemented with a CNF-architecture can require an exponential number of saturating dendritic units, whereas the same family implemented with either a DNF-architecture or a CNF-architecture always require a linear number of spiking dendritic units. This minimization could explain why a neuron spends energetic resources to make its dendrites spike. 1</p><p>2 0.82532513 <a title="302-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Action-Model_Based_Multi-agent_Plan_Recognition.html">31 nips-2012-Action-Model Based Multi-agent Plan Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hankz H. Zhuo, Qiang Yang, Subbarao Kambhampati</p><p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) aims to recognize dynamic team structures and team behaviors from the observed team traces (activity sequences) of a set of intelligent agents. Previous MAPR approaches required a library of team activity sequences (team plans) be given as input. However, collecting a library of team plans to ensure adequate coverage is often difﬁcult and costly. In this paper, we relax this constraint, so that team plans are not required to be provided beforehand. We assume instead that a set of action models are available. Such models are often already created to describe domain physics; i.e., the preconditions and effects of effects actions. We propose a novel approach for recognizing multi-agent team plans based on such action models rather than libraries of team plans. We encode the resulting MAPR problem as a satisﬁability problem and solve the problem using a state-of-the-art weighted MAX-SAT solver. Our approach also allows for incompleteness in the observed plan traces.

However, ﬁnding most-probable explanations (MPEs) in these models can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we improve the scalability of MPE inference in a class of graphical models with piecewise-linear and piecewise-quadratic dependencies and linear constraints over continuous domains. We derive algorithms based on a consensus-optimization framework and demonstrate their superior performance over state of the art. We show empirically that in a large-scale voter-preference modeling problem our algorithms scale linearly in the number of dependencies and constraints. 1</p><p>4 0.69520897 <a title="302-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdeslam Boularias, Jan R. Peters, Oliver B. Kroemer</p><p>Abstract: We use a graphical model for representing policies in Markov Decision Processes. This new representation can easily incorporate domain knowledge in the form of a state similarity graph that loosely indicates which states are supposed to have similar optimal actions. A bias is then introduced into the policy search process by sampling policies from a distribution that assigns high probabilities to policies that agree with the provided state similarity graph, i.e. smoother policies. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We also present forward and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms for learning such policy distributions. We illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach on two problems: cart-balancing with swing-up, and teaching a robot to grasp unknown objects. 1</p><p>5 0.68791789 <a title="302-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Imitation_Learning_by_Coaching.html">160 nips-2012-Imitation Learning by Coaching</a></p>
<p>Author: He He, Jason Eisner, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Imitation Learning has been shown to be successful in solving many challenging real-world problems. Some recent approaches give strong performance guarantees by training the policy iteratively. However, it is important to note that these guarantees depend on how well the policy we found can imitate the oracle on the training data. When there is a substantial difference between the oracle’s ability and the learner’s policy space, we may fail to ﬁnd a policy that has low error on the training set. In such cases, we propose to use a coach that demonstrates easy-to-learn actions for the learner and gradually approaches the oracle. By a reduction of learning by demonstration to online learning, we prove that coaching can yield a lower regret bound than using the oracle. We apply our algorithm to cost-sensitive dynamic feature selection, a hard decision problem that considers a user-speciﬁed accuracy-cost trade-off. Experimental results on UCI datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning methods in dynamic feature selection and two static feature selection methods. 1</p><p>6 0.65691674 <a title="302-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_n-Choose-k_Models_for_Classification_and_Ranking.html">278 nips-2012-Probabilistic n-Choose-k Models for Classification and Ranking</a></p>

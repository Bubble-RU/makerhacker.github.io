<p>Author: Simon Lyons, Amos J. Storkey, Simo Särkkä</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDE) are a natural tool for modelling systems that are inherently noisy or contain uncertainties that can be modelled as stochastic processes. Crucial to the process of using SDE to build mathematical models is the ability to estimate parameters of those models from observed data. Over the past few decades, signiﬁcant progress has been made on this problem, but we are still far from having a deﬁnitive solution. We describe a novel method of approximating a diffusion process that we show to be useful in Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithms. We take the ‘white’ noise that drives a diffusion process and decompose it into two terms. The ﬁrst is a ‘coloured noise’ term that can be deterministically controlled by a set of auxilliary variables. The second term is small and enables us to form a linear Gaussian ‘small noise’ approximation. The decomposition allows us to take a diffusion process of interest and cast it in a form that is amenable to sampling by MCMC methods. We explain why many state-of-the-art inference methods fail on highly nonlinear inference problems, and we demonstrate experimentally that our method performs well in such situations. Our results show that this method is a promising new tool for use in inference and parameter estimation problems. 1</p><p>3 0.14609751 <a title="97-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Dynamic_Pruning_of_Factor_Graphs_for_Maximum_Marginal_Prediction.html">105 nips-2012-Dynamic Pruning of Factor Graphs for Maximum Marginal Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of maximum marginal prediction (MMP) in probabilistic graphical models, a task that occurs, for example, as the Bayes optimal decision rule under a Hamming loss. MMP is typically performed as a two-stage procedure: one estimates each variable’s marginal probability and then forms a prediction from the states of maximal probability. In this work we propose a simple yet effective technique for accelerating MMP when inference is sampling-based: instead of the above two-stage procedure we directly estimate the posterior probability of each decision variable. This allows us to identify the point of time when we are sufﬁciently certain about any individual decision. Whenever this is the case, we dynamically prune the variables we are conﬁdent about from the underlying factor graph. Consequently, at any time only samples of variables whose decision is still uncertain need to be created. Experiments in two prototypical scenarios, multi-label classiﬁcation and image inpainting, show that adaptive sampling can drastically accelerate MMP without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.14209683 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Networks_of_Heterogeneous_Influence.html">182 nips-2012-Learning Networks of Heterogeneous Influence</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Ming Yuan, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Information, disease, and inﬂuence diffuse over networks of entities in both natural systems and human society. Analyzing these transmission networks plays an important role in understanding the diffusion processes and predicting future events. However, the underlying transmission networks are often hidden and incomplete, and we observe only the time stamps when cascades of events happen. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of uncovering the hidden network only from the cascades. The structure discovery problem is complicated by the fact that the inﬂuence between networked entities is heterogeneous, which can not be described by a simple parametric model. Therefore, we propose a kernelbased method which can capture a diverse range of different types of inﬂuence without any prior assumption. In both synthetic and real cascade data, we show that our model can better recover the underlying diffusion network and drastically improve the estimation of the transmission functions among networked entities. 1</p><p>5 0.12661631 <a title="97-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-The_Perturbed_Variation.html">338 nips-2012-The Perturbed Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Maayan Harel, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new discrepancy score between two distributions that gives an indication on their similarity. While much research has been done to determine if two samples come from exactly the same distribution, much less research considered the problem of determining if two ﬁnite samples come from similar distributions. The new score gives an intuitive interpretation of similarity; it optimally perturbs the distributions so that they best ﬁt each other. The score is deﬁned between distributions, and can be efﬁciently estimated from samples. We provide convergence bounds of the estimated score, and develop hypothesis testing procedures that test if two data sets come from similar distributions. The statistical power of this procedures is presented in simulations. We also compare the score’s capacity to detect similarity with that of other known measures on real data. 1</p><p>6 0.10677657 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Non-linear_Metric_Learning.html">242 nips-2012-Non-linear Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Zhou, Xiang Bai, Wenyu Liu, Longin J. Latecki</p><p>Abstract: A weighted graph is used as an underlying structure of many algorithms like semisupervised learning and spectral clustering. If the edge weights are determined by a single similarity measure, then it hard if not impossible to capture all relevant aspects of similarity when using a single similarity measure. In particular, in the case of visual object matching it is beneﬁcial to integrate different similarity measures that focus on different visual representations. In this paper, a novel approach to integrate multiple similarity measures is proposed. First pairs of similarity measures are combined with a diffusion process on their tensor product graph (TPG). Hence the diffused similarity of each pair of objects becomes a function of joint diffusion of the two original similarities, which in turn depends on the neighborhood structure of the TPG. We call this process Fusion with Diffusion (FD). However, a higher order graph like the TPG usually means signiﬁcant increase in time complexity. This is not the case in the proposed approach. A key feature of our approach is that the time complexity of the diffusion on the TPG is the same as the diffusion process on each of the original graphs. Moreover, it is not necessary to explicitly construct the TPG in our framework. Finally all diffused pairs of similarity measures are combined as a weighted sum. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on the task of visual tracking, where different aspects of the appearance similarity between the target object in frame t − 1 and target object candidates in frame t are integrated. The obtained method is tested on several challenge video sequences and the experimental results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art tracking methods. 1</p><p>4 0.55804002 <a title="97-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-The_Perturbed_Variation.html">338 nips-2012-The Perturbed Variation</a></p>

Our method performs better than previous stochastic variational inference algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.68666464 <a title="97-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.68641436 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Synchronization_can_Control_Regularization_in_Neural_Systems_via_Correlated_Noise_Processes.html">333 nips-2012-Synchronization can Control Regularization in Neural Systems via Correlated Noise Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jake Bouvrie, Jean-jeacques Slotine</p><p>Abstract: To learn reliable rules that can generalize to novel situations, the brain must be capable of imposing some form of regularization. Here we suggest, through theoretical and computational arguments, that the combination of noise with synchronization provides a plausible mechanism for regularization in the nervous system. The functional role of regularization is considered in a general context in which coupled computational systems receive inputs corrupted by correlated noise. Noise on the inputs is shown to impose regularization, and when synchronization upstream induces time-varying correlations across noise variables, the degree of regularization can be calibrated over time. The resulting qualitative behavior matches experimental data from visual cortex. 1</p><p>6 0.68457448 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-On_the_connections_between_saliency_and_tracking.html">256 nips-2012-On the connections between saliency and tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin, Shenghuo Zhu, Jinfeng Yi</p><p>Abstract: Although many variants of stochastic gradient descent have been proposed for large-scale convex optimization, most of them require projecting the solution at each iteration to ensure that the obtained solution stays within the feasible domain. For complex domains (e.g., positive semideﬁnite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing novel stochastic optimization algorithms that do not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, √ the proposed algorithms achieve an O(1/ T ) convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an O(ln T /T ) rate for strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function. 1</p><p>3 0.15911013 <a title="305-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Multi-task_Vector_Field_Learning.html">225 nips-2012-Multi-task Vector Field Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Sen Yang, Chiyuan Zhang, Jieping Ye, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve generalization performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously and identifying the shared information among tasks. Most of existing MTL methods focus on learning linear models under the supervised setting. We propose a novel semi-supervised and nonlinear approach for MTL using vector ﬁelds. A vector ﬁeld is a smooth mapping from the manifold to the tangent spaces which can be viewed as a directional derivative of functions on the manifold. We argue that vector ﬁelds provide a natural way to exploit the geometric structure of data as well as the shared differential structure of tasks, both of which are crucial for semi-supervised multi-task learning. In this paper, we develop multi-task vector ﬁeld learning (MTVFL) which learns the predictor functions and the vector ﬁelds simultaneously. MTVFL has the following key properties. (1) The vector ﬁelds MTVFL learns are close to the gradient ﬁelds of the predictor functions. (2) Within each task, the vector ﬁeld is required to be as parallel as possible which is expected to span a low dimensional subspace. (3) The vector ﬁelds from all tasks share a low dimensional subspace. We formalize our idea in a regularization framework and also provide a convex relaxation method to solve the original non-convex problem. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.15614268 <a title="305-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Expectation_Propagation_in_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems.html">121 nips-2012-Expectation Propagation in Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc Deisenroth, Shakir Mohamed</p><p>Abstract: Rich and complex time-series data, such as those generated from engineering systems, ﬁnancial markets, videos, or neural recordings are now a common feature of modern data analysis. Explaining the phenomena underlying these diverse data sets requires ﬂexible and accurate models. In this paper, we promote Gaussian process dynamical systems as a rich model class that is appropriate for such an analysis. We present a new approximate message-passing algorithm for Bayesian state estimation and inference in Gaussian process dynamical systems, a nonparametric probabilistic generalization of commonly used state-space models. We derive our message-passing algorithm using Expectation Propagation and provide a unifying perspective on message passing in general state-space models. We show that existing Gaussian ﬁlters and smoothers appear as special cases within our inference framework, and that these existing approaches can be improved upon using iterated message passing. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that iterated message passing can improve inference in a wide range of tasks in Bayesian state estimation, thus leading to improved predictions and more effective decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.11085957 <a title="305-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Relax_and_Randomize_%3A_From_Value_to_Algorithms.html">293 nips-2012-Relax and Randomize : From Value to Algorithms</a></p>

Various upper bounds on the minimax value, previously thought to be non-constructive, are shown to yield algorithms. This allows us to seamlessly recover known methods and to derive new ones, also capturing such “unorthodox” methods as Follow the Perturbed Leader and the R2 forecaster. Understanding the inherent complexity of the learning problem thus leads to the development of algorithms. To illustrate our approach, we present several new algorithms, including a family of randomized methods that use the idea of a “random playout”.

<p>Author: Hiroki Terashima, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: The computational modelling of the primary auditory cortex (A1) has been less fruitful than that of the primary visual cortex (V1) due to the less organized properties of A1. Greater disorder has recently been demonstrated for the tonotopy of A1 that has traditionally been considered to be as ordered as the retinotopy of V1. This disorder appears to be incongruous, given the uniformity of the neocortex; however, we hypothesized that both A1 and V1 would adopt an efﬁcient coding strategy and that the disorder in A1 reﬂects natural sound statistics. To provide a computational model of the tonotopic disorder in A1, we used a model that was originally proposed for the smooth V1 map. In contrast to natural images, natural sounds exhibit distant correlations, which were learned and reﬂected in the disordered map. The auditory model predicted harmonic relationships among neighbouring A1 cells; furthermore, the same mechanism used to model V1 complex cells reproduced nonlinear responses similar to the pitch selectivity. These results contribute to the understanding of the sensory cortices of different modalities in a novel and integrated manner.</p><p>2 0.84556079 <a title="305-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-A_Better_Way_to_Pretrain_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">4 nips-2012-A Better Way to Pretrain Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent-variable PCFGs, which have been shown to be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known in the multilinear algebra literature. We also describe an error bound for this approximation, which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are well approximated, then the probability distribution over trees will also be well approximated. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data demonstrates a signiﬁcant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.78592283 <a title="305-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Selective_Labeling_via_Error_Bound_Minimization.html">305 nips-2012-Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang, Jiawei Han, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.77764201 <a title="305-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Multiple_Operator-valued_Kernel_Learning.html">231 nips-2012-Multiple Operator-valued Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hachem Kadri, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Philippe Preux, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Positive deﬁnite operator-valued kernels generalize the well-known notion of reproducing kernels, and are naturally adapted to multi-output learning situations. This paper addresses the problem of learning a ﬁnite linear combination of inﬁnite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitable for extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with an r -norm constraint on the combination coefﬁcients (r ≥ 1). The resulting optimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valued kernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical and theoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinate-descent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of ﬁnger movement prediction in brain-computer interfaces. 1</p><p>6 0.77396303 <a title="305-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Analyzing_3D_Objects_in_Cluttered_Images.html">40 nips-2012-Analyzing 3D Objects in Cluttered Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for multiple reward functions. Most previous IRL algorithms assume that the behaviour data is obtained from an agent who is optimizing a single reward function, but this assumption is hard to guarantee in practice. Our approach is based on integrating the Dirichlet process mixture model into Bayesian IRL. We provide an efﬁcient Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm utilizing the gradient of the posterior to estimate the underlying reward functions, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous ones via experiments on a number of problem domains. 1</p><p>3 0.18236099 <a title="353-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_through_Structured_Classification.html">162 nips-2012-Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Structured Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Edouard Klein, Matthieu Geist, Bilal Piot, Olivier Pietquin</p><p>Abstract: This paper adresses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward for which a demonstrated expert behavior is optimal. We introduce a new algorithm, SCIRL, whose principle is to use the so-called feature expectation of the expert as the parameterization of the score function of a multiclass classiﬁer. This approach produces a reward function for which the expert policy is provably near-optimal. Contrary to most of existing IRL algorithms, SCIRL does not require solving the direct RL problem. Moreover, with an appropriate heuristic, it can succeed with only trajectories sampled according to the expert behavior. This is illustrated on a car driving simulator. 1</p><p>4 0.17863496 <a title="353-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Continuous_Reinforcement_Learning.html">259 nips-2012-Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronald Ortner, Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: We derive sublinear regret bounds for undiscounted reinforcement learning in continuous state space. The proposed algorithm combines state aggregation with the use of upper conﬁdence bounds for implementing optimism in the face of uncertainty. Beside the existence of an optimal policy which satisﬁes the Poisson equation, the only assumptions made are H¨ lder continuity of rewards and transition o probabilities. 1</p><p>5 0.17795134 <a title="353-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Exploration_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Empirically_Estimating_Learning_Progress.html">122 nips-2012-Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress</a></p>
<p>Author: Manuel Lopes, Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Pierre-yves Oudeyer</p><p>Abstract: Formal exploration approaches in model-based reinforcement learning estimate the accuracy of the currently learned model without consideration of the empirical prediction error. For example, PAC-MDP approaches such as R- MAX base their model certainty on the amount of collected data, while Bayesian approaches assume a prior over the transition dynamics. We propose extensions to such approaches which drive exploration solely based on empirical estimates of the learner’s accuracy and learning progress. We provide a “sanity check” theoretical analysis, discussing the behavior of our extensions in the standard stationary ﬁnite state-action case. We then provide experimental studies demonstrating the robustness of these exploration measures in cases of non-stationary environments or where original approaches are misled by wrong domain assumptions. 1</p><p>6 0.1647952 <a title="353-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learned_Prioritization_for_Trading_Off_Accuracy_and_Speed.html">173 nips-2012-Learned Prioritization for Trading Off Accuracy and Speed</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongho Kim, Kee-eung Kim, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected longterm total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems. 1</p><p>4 0.76014316 <a title="353-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Bayes-Adaptive_Reinforcement_Learning_using_Sample-Based_Search.html">108 nips-2012-Efficient Bayes-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning using Sample-Based Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Guez, David Silver, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayesoptimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a signiﬁcant margin on several well-known benchmark problems – because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an inﬁnite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration. 1</p><p>5 0.75127339 <a title="353-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Exploration_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Empirically_Estimating_Learning_Progress.html">122 nips-2012-Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress</a></p>

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides the ﬁrst —to the best of our knowledge— analysis of online learning algorithms for multiclass problems when the confusion matrix is taken as a performance measure. The work builds upon recent and elegant results on noncommutative concentration inequalities, i.e. concentration inequalities that apply to matrices, and, more precisely, to matrix martingales. We do establish generalization bounds for online learning algorithms and show how the theoretical study motivates the proposition of a new confusion-friendly learning procedure. This learning algorithm, called COPA (for COnfusion Passive-Aggressive) is a passive-aggressive learning algorithm; it is shown that the update equations for COPA can be computed analytically and, henceforth, there is no need to recourse to any optimization package to implement it. 1</p><p>3 0.73772365 <a title="353-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Slice_Normalized_Dynamic_Markov_Logic_Networks.html">314 nips-2012-Slice Normalized Dynamic Markov Logic Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Tivadar Papai, Henry Kautz, Daniel Stefankovic</p><p>Abstract: Markov logic is a widely used tool in statistical relational learning, which uses a weighted ﬁrst-order logic knowledge base to specify a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). In many applications, a Markov logic network (MLN) is trained in one domain, but used in a different one. This paper focuses on dynamic Markov logic networks, where the size of the discretized time-domain typically varies between training and testing. It has been previously pointed out that the marginal probabilities of truth assignments to ground atoms can change if one extends or reduces the domains of predicates in an MLN. We show that in addition to this problem, the standard way of unrolling a Markov logic theory into a MRF may result in time-inhomogeneity of the underlying Markov chain. Furthermore, even if these representational problems are not signiﬁcant for a given domain, we show that the more practical problem of generating samples in a sequential conditional random ﬁeld for the next slice relying on the samples from the previous slice has high computational cost in the general case, due to the need to estimate a normalization factor for each sample. We propose a new discriminative model, slice normalized dynamic Markov logic networks (SN-DMLN), that suffers from none of these issues. It supports efﬁcient online inference, and can directly model inﬂuences between variables within a time slice that do not have a causal direction, in contrast with fully directed models (e.g., DBNs). Experimental results show an improvement in accuracy over previous approaches to online inference in dynamic Markov logic networks. 1</p><p>4 0.67681855 <a title="353-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Expectation_Propagation_in_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems.html">121 nips-2012-Expectation Propagation in Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc Deisenroth, Shakir Mohamed</p><p>Abstract: Rich and complex time-series data, such as those generated from engineering systems, ﬁnancial markets, videos, or neural recordings are now a common feature of modern data analysis. Explaining the phenomena underlying these diverse data sets requires ﬂexible and accurate models. In this paper, we promote Gaussian process dynamical systems as a rich model class that is appropriate for such an analysis. We present a new approximate message-passing algorithm for Bayesian state estimation and inference in Gaussian process dynamical systems, a nonparametric probabilistic generalization of commonly used state-space models. We derive our message-passing algorithm using Expectation Propagation and provide a unifying perspective on message passing in general state-space models. We show that existing Gaussian ﬁlters and smoothers appear as special cases within our inference framework, and that these existing approaches can be improved upon using iterated message passing. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that iterated message passing can improve inference in a wide range of tasks in Bayesian state estimation, thus leading to improved predictions and more effective decision making. 1</p><p>5 0.66939491 <a title="353-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>6 0.66457164 <a title="353-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Bandit_Algorithms_boost_Brain_Computer_Interfaces_for_motor-task_selection_of_a_brain-controlled_button.html">50 nips-2012-Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button</a></p>

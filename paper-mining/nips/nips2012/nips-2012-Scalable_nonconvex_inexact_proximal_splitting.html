<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Michael Saunders</p><p>Abstract: We seek to solve convex optimization problems in composite form: minimize f (x) := g(x) + h(x), n x∈R where g is convex and continuously differentiable and h : Rn → R is a convex but not necessarily differentiable function whose proximal mapping can be evaluated efﬁciently. We derive a generalization of Newton-type methods to handle such convex but nonsmooth objective functions. We prove such methods are globally convergent and achieve superlinear rates of convergence in the vicinity of an optimal solution. We also demonstrate the performance of these methods using problems of relevance in machine learning and statistics. 1</p><p>3 0.42615399 <a title="300-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Sequences_of_Signals_with_Sparse_Increments_via_Differential__1-Minimization.html">120 nips-2012-Exact and Stable Recovery of Sequences of Signals with Sparse Increments via Differential  1-Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Demba Ba, Behtash Babadi, Patrick Purdon, Emery Brown</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, (xk )K , for which k=0 the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse (with Sk typically smaller than S1 ), based on linear measurements (yk = Ak xk + ek )K , where Ak and ek denote the meak=1 surement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each Ak obeys the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain order—depending only on Sk —we show that in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum of the ℓ1 -norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement constraints, recovers the sequence (xk )K exactly. This is an interesting result bek=1 cause this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing problem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recovery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an application to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity.</p><p>4 0.28564391 <a title="300-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_quasi-Newton_proximal_splitting_method.html">27 nips-2012-A quasi-Newton proximal splitting method</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Becker, Jalal Fadili</p><p>Abstract: A new result in convex analysis on the calculation of proximity operators in certain scaled norms is derived. We describe efﬁcient implementations of the proximity calculation for a useful class of functions; the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem. The second part of the paper applies the previous result to acceleration of convex minimization problems, and leads to an elegant quasi-Newton method. The optimization method compares favorably against state-of-the-art alternatives. The algorithm has extensive applications including signal processing, sparse recovery and machine learning and classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.28154233 <a title="300-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-The_Bethe_Partition_Function_of_Log-supermodular_Graphical_Models.html">335 nips-2012-The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Ruozzi</p><p>Abstract: Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any ﬁxed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the “four functions” theorem that may be of independent interest. 1</p><p>6 0.24904475 <a title="300-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-The_representer_theorem_for_Hilbert_spaces%3A_a_necessary_and_sufficient_condition.html">340 nips-2012-The representer theorem for Hilbert spaces: a necessary and sufficient condition</a></p>

<p>Author: Francesco Dinuzzo, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The representer theorem is a property that lies at the foundation of regularization theory and kernel methods. A class of regularization functionals is said to admit a linear representer theorem if every member of the class admits minimizers that lie in the ﬁnite dimensional subspace spanned by the representers of the data. A recent characterization states that certain classes of regularization functionals with differentiable regularization term admit a linear representer theorem for any choice of the data if and only if the regularization term is a radial nondecreasing function. In this paper, we extend such result by weakening the assumptions on the regularization term. In particular, the main result of this paper implies that, for a sufﬁciently large family of regularization functionals, radial nondecreasing functions are the only lower semicontinuous regularization terms that guarantee existence of a representer theorem for any choice of the data. 1</p><p>6 0.5456363 <a title="300-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-The_Bethe_Partition_Function_of_Log-supermodular_Graphical_Models.html">335 nips-2012-The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Xi Chen, Qihang Lin, Javier Pena</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic optimization problems where both the loss function and regularizer can be non-smooth. We develop a novel algorithm based on the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates for both convex and strongly convex loss. In particular, for strongly convex loss, it achieves the opti1 1 mal rate of O( N + N 2 ) for N iterations, which improves the rate O( log N ) for preN vious regularized dual averaging algorithms. In addition, our method constructs the ﬁnal solution directly from the proximal mapping instead of averaging of all previous iterates. For widely used sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., 1 -norm), it has the advantage of encouraging sparser solutions. We further develop a multistage extension using the proposed algorithm as a subroutine, which achieves the 1 uniformly-optimal rate O( N + exp{−N }) for strongly convex loss. 1</p><p>3 0.90112668 <a title="300-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Query_Complexity_of_Derivative-Free_Optimization.html">285 nips-2012-Query Complexity of Derivative-Free Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Recht, Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides lower bounds on the convergence rate of Derivative Free Optimization (DFO) with noisy function evaluations, exposing a fundamental and unavoidable gap between the performance of algorithms with access to gradients and those with access to only function evaluations. However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same. 1</p><p>4 0.90025628 <a title="300-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Maximum_Margin_Supervised_Topic_Models.html">220 nips-2012-Monte Carlo Methods for Maximum Margin Supervised Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Qixia Jiang, Jun Zhu, Maosong Sun, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: An effective strategy to exploit the supervising side information for discovering predictive topic representations is to impose discriminative constraints induced by such information on the posterior distributions under a topic model. This strategy has been adopted by a number of supervised topic models, such as MedLDA, which employs max-margin posterior constraints. However, unlike the likelihoodbased supervised topic models, of which posterior inference can be carried out using the Bayes’ rule, the max-margin posterior constraints have made Monte Carlo methods infeasible or at least not directly applicable, thereby limited the choice of inference algorithms to be based on variational approximation with strict mean ﬁeld assumptions. In this paper, we develop two efﬁcient Monte Carlo methods under much weaker assumptions for max-margin supervised topic models based on an importance sampler and a collapsed Gibbs sampler, respectively, in a convex dual formulation. We report thorough experimental results that compare our approach favorably against existing alternatives in both accuracy and efﬁciency.</p><p>5 0.89797682 <a title="300-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Proximal_Newton-type_methods_for_convex_optimization.html">282 nips-2012-Proximal Newton-type methods for convex optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Michael Saunders</p><p>Abstract: We seek to solve convex optimization problems in composite form: minimize f (x) := g(x) + h(x), n x∈R where g is convex and continuously differentiable and h : Rn → R is a convex but not necessarily differentiable function whose proximal mapping can be evaluated efﬁciently. We derive a generalization of Newton-type methods to handle such convex but nonsmooth objective functions. We prove such methods are globally convergent and achieve superlinear rates of convergence in the vicinity of an optimal solution. We also demonstrate the performance of these methods using problems of relevance in machine learning and statistics. 1</p><p>6 0.89489967 <a title="300-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Finite_Sample_Convergence_Rates_of_Zero-Order_Stochastic_Optimization_Methods.html">134 nips-2012-Finite Sample Convergence Rates of Zero-Order Stochastic Optimization Methods</a></p>

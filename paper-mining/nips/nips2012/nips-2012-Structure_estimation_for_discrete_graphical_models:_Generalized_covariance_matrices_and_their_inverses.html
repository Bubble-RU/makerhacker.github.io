<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Genevera Allen, Zhandong Liu, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphical models, also known as Markov networks, enjoy popularity in a variety of applications. The popular instances of these models such as Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs), Ising models, and multinomial discrete models, however do not capture the characteristics of data in many settings. We introduce a new class of graphical models based on generalized linear models (GLMs) by assuming that node-wise conditional distributions arise from exponential families. Our models allow one to estimate multivariate Markov networks given any univariate exponential distribution, such as Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential, by ﬁtting penalized GLMs to select the neighborhood for each node. A major contribution of this paper is the rigorous statistical analysis showing that with high probability, the neighborhood of our graphical models can be recovered exactly. We also provide examples of non-Gaussian high-throughput genomic networks learned via our GLM graphical models. 1</p><p>3 0.22369535 <a title="326-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Learning_as_MAP_Inference_in_Discrete_Graphical_Models.html">186 nips-2012-Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianghang Liu, James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We present a new formulation for binary classiﬁcation. Instead of relying on convex losses and regularizers such as in SVMs, logistic regression and boosting, or instead non-convex but continuous formulations such as those encountered in neural networks and deep belief networks, our framework entails a non-convex but discrete formulation, where estimation amounts to ﬁnding a MAP conﬁguration in a graphical model whose potential functions are low-dimensional discrete surrogates for the misclassiﬁcation loss. We argue that such a discrete formulation can naturally account for a number of issues that are typically encountered in either the convex or the continuous non-convex approaches, or both. By reducing the learning problem to a MAP inference problem, we can immediately translate the guarantees available for many inference settings to the learning problem itself. We empirically demonstrate in a number of experiments that this approach is promising in dealing with issues such as severe label noise, while still having global optimality guarantees. Due to the discrete nature of the formulation, it also allows for direct regularization through cardinality-based penalties, such as the 0 pseudo-norm, thus providing the ability to perform feature selection and trade-oﬀ interpretability and predictability in a principled manner. We also outline a number of open problems arising from the formulation. 1</p><p>4 0.20143057 <a title="326-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Ragupathyraj Valluvan</p><p>Abstract: Graphical model selection refers to the problem of estimating the unknown graph structure given observations at the nodes in the model. We consider a challenging instance of this problem when some of the nodes are latent or hidden. We characterize conditions for tractable graph estimation and develop efﬁcient methods with provable guarantees. We consider the class of Ising models Markov on locally tree-like graphs, which are in the regime of correlation decay. We propose an efﬁcient method for graph estimation, and establish its structural consistency −δη(η+1)−2 when the number of samples n scales as n = Ω(θmin log p), where θmin is the minimum edge potential, δ is the depth (i.e., distance from a hidden node to the nearest observed nodes), and η is a parameter which depends on the minimum and maximum node and edge potentials in the Ising model. The proposed method is practical to implement and provides ﬂexibility to control the number of latent variables and the cycle lengths in the output graph. We also present necessary conditions for graph estimation by any method and show that our method nearly matches the lower bound on sample requirements. Keywords: Graphical model selection, latent variables, quartet methods, locally tree-like graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.1975164 <a title="326-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Minimization_of_Continuous_Bethe_Approximations%3A_A_Positive_Variation.html">213 nips-2012-Minimization of Continuous Bethe Approximations: A Positive Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Pacheco, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: We develop convergent minimization algorithms for Bethe variational approximations which explicitly constrain marginal estimates to families of valid distributions. While existing message passing algorithms deﬁne ﬁxed point iterations corresponding to stationary points of the Bethe free energy, their greedy dynamics do not distinguish between local minima and maxima, and can fail to converge. For continuous estimation problems, this instability is linked to the creation of invalid marginal estimates, such as Gaussians with negative variance. Conversely, our approach leverages multiplier methods with well-understood convergence properties, and uses bound projection methods to ensure that marginal approximations are valid at all iterations. We derive general algorithms for discrete and Gaussian pairwise Markov random ﬁelds, showing improvements over standard loopy belief propagation. We also apply our method to a hybrid model with both discrete and continuous variables, showing improvements over expectation propagation. 1</p><p>6 0.19116411 <a title="326-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Topology_Constraints_in_Graphical_Models.html">346 nips-2012-Topology Constraints in Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Vinay Jethava, Anders Martinsson, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Devdatt Dubhashi</p><p>Abstract: The Lov´ sz ϑ function of a graph, a fundamental tool in combinatorial optimizaa tion and approximation algorithms, is computed by solving a SDP. In this paper we establish that the Lov´ sz ϑ function is equivalent to a kernel learning problem a related to one class SVM. This interesting connection opens up many opportunities bridging graph theoretic algorithms and machine learning. We show that there exist graphs, which we call SVM − ϑ graphs, on which the Lov´ sz ϑ function a can be approximated well by a one-class SVM. This leads to novel use of SVM techniques for solving algorithmic problems in large graphs e.g. identifying a √ 1 planted clique of size Θ( n) in a random graph G(n, 2 ). A classic approach for this problem involves computing the ϑ function, however it is not scalable due to SDP computation. We show that the random graph with a planted clique is an example of SVM − ϑ graph. As a consequence a SVM based approach easily identiﬁes the clique in large graphs and is competitive with the state-of-the-art. We introduce the notion of common orthogonal labelling and show that it can be computed by solving a Multiple Kernel learning problem. It is further shown that such a labelling is extremely useful in identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs, which is known to be a computationally difﬁcult problem. The proposed algorithm achieves an order of magnitude scalability compared to state of the art methods. 1</p><p>4 0.71548969 <a title="326-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Minimization_of_Continuous_Bethe_Approximations%3A_A_Positive_Variation.html">213 nips-2012-Minimization of Continuous Bethe Approximations: A Positive Variation</a></p>

<p>Author: Antonino Freno, Mikaela Keller, Marc Tommasi</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some speciﬁc graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network properties. Second, we use the deﬁned statistic to develop the Fiedler random ﬁeld model, which allows for efﬁcient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random ﬁelds, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches.</p><p>6 0.69400847 <a title="326-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Symbolic_Dynamic_Programming_for_Continuous_State_and_Observation_POMDPs.html">331 nips-2012-Symbolic Dynamic Programming for Continuous State and Observation POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: David Belanger, Alexandre Passos, Sebastian Riedel, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Linear chains and trees are basic building blocks in many applications of graphical models, and they admit simple exact maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms based on message passing. However, in many cases this computation is prohibitively expensive, due to quadratic dependence on variables’ domain sizes. The standard algorithms are inefﬁcient because they compute scores for hypotheses for which there is strong negative local evidence. For this reason there has been signiﬁcant previous interest in beam search and its variants; however, these methods provide only approximate results. This paper presents new exact inference algorithms based on the combination of column generation and pre-computed bounds on terms of the model’s scoring function. While we do not improve worst-case performance, our method substantially speeds real-world, typical-case inference in chains and trees. Experiments show our method to be twice as fast as exact Viterbi for Wall Street Journal part-of-speech tagging and over thirteen times faster for a joint part-of-speed and named-entity-recognition task. Our algorithm is also extendable to new techniques for approximate inference, to faster 0/1 loss oracles, and new opportunities for connections between inference and learning. We encourage further exploration of high-level reasoning about the optimization problem implicit in dynamic programs. 1</p><p>3 0.96084714 <a title="326-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Simultaneously_Leveraging_Output_and_Task_Structures_for_Multiple-Output_Regression.html">312 nips-2012-Simultaneously Leveraging Output and Task Structures for Multiple-Output Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Piyush Rai, Abhishek Kumar, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Multiple-output regression models require estimating multiple parameters, one for each output. Structural regularization is usually employed to improve parameter estimation in such models. In this paper, we present a multiple-output regression model that leverages the covariance structure of the latent model parameters as well as the conditional covariance structure of the observed outputs. This is in contrast with existing methods that usually take into account only one of these structures. More importantly, unlike some of the other existing methods, none of these structures need be known a priori in our model, and are learned from the data. Several previously proposed structural regularization based multiple-output regression models turn out to be special cases of our model. Moreover, in addition to being a rich model for multiple-output regression, our model can also be used in estimating the graphical model structure of a set of variables (multivariate outputs) conditioned on another set of variables (inputs). Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 1</p><p>4 0.95473468 <a title="326-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-The_Bethe_Partition_Function_of_Log-supermodular_Graphical_Models.html">335 nips-2012-The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Ruozzi</p><p>Abstract: Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any ﬁxed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the “four functions” theorem that may be of independent interest. 1</p><p>5 0.94471532 <a title="326-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Recursive_Perceptual_Representations.html">197 nips-2012-Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Oriol Vinyals, Yangqing Jia, Li Deng, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become very popular in vision as part of state-of-the-art object recognition and other classiﬁcation tasks but require high dimensional feature spaces for good performance. Deep learning methods can ﬁnd more compact representations but current methods employ multilayer perceptrons that require solving a difﬁcult, non-convex optimization problem. We propose a deep non-linear classiﬁer whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications. The use of random projections is key to our method, as we show in the experiments section, in which we observe a consistent improvement over previous –often more complicated– methods on several vision and speech benchmarks. 1</p><p>6 0.93046033 <a title="326-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>

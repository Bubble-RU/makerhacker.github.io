<p>Author: Yair Wiener, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the possibility of a ‘reject option’ in the context of least squares regression. It is shown that using rejection it is theoretically possible to learn ‘selective’ regressors that can ǫ-pointwise track the best regressor in hindsight from the same hypothesis class, while rejecting only a bounded portion of the domain. Moreover, the rejected volume vanishes with the training set size, under certain conditions. We then develop efﬁcient and exact implementation of these selective regressors for the case of linear regression. Empirical evaluation over a suite of real-world datasets corroborates the theoretical analysis and indicates that our selective regressors can provide substantial advantage by reducing estimation error.</p><p>3 0.15086727 <a title="16-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Fused_sparsity_and_robust_estimation_for_linear_models_with_unknown_variance.html">139 nips-2012-Fused sparsity and robust estimation for linear models with unknown variance</a></p>
<p>Author: Arnak Dalalyan, Yin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of learning sparse representations in the context of fused sparsity and unknown noise level. We propose an algorithm, termed Scaled Fused Dantzig Selector (SFDS), that accomplishes the aforementioned learning task by means of a second-order cone program. A special emphasize is put on the particular instance of fused sparsity corresponding to the learning in presence of outliers. We establish ﬁnite sample risk bounds and carry out an experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.15005924 <a title="16-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_as_MAP_Inference_in_Discrete_Graphical_Models.html">186 nips-2012-Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianghang Liu, James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We present a new formulation for binary classiﬁcation. Instead of relying on convex losses and regularizers such as in SVMs, logistic regression and boosting, or instead non-convex but continuous formulations such as those encountered in neural networks and deep belief networks, our framework entails a non-convex but discrete formulation, where estimation amounts to ﬁnding a MAP conﬁguration in a graphical model whose potential functions are low-dimensional discrete surrogates for the misclassiﬁcation loss. We argue that such a discrete formulation can naturally account for a number of issues that are typically encountered in either the convex or the continuous non-convex approaches, or both. By reducing the learning problem to a MAP inference problem, we can immediately translate the guarantees available for many inference settings to the learning problem itself. We empirically demonstrate in a number of experiments that this approach is promising in dealing with issues such as severe label noise, while still having global optimality guarantees. Due to the discrete nature of the formulation, it also allows for direct regularization through cardinality-based penalties, such as the 0 pseudo-norm, thus providing the ability to perform feature selection and trade-oﬀ interpretability and predictability in a principled manner. We also outline a number of open problems arising from the formulation. 1</p><p>5 0.13931248 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-On_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Robust_PCA.html">254 nips-2012-On the Sample Complexity of Robust PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Coudron, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate the rate of convergence and sample complexity of a recent robust estimator for a generalized version of the inverse covariance matrix. This estimator is used in a convex algorithm for robust subspace recovery (i.e., robust PCA). Our model assumes a sub-Gaussian underlying distribution and an i.i.d. sample from it. Our main result shows with high probability that the norm of the difference between the generalized inverse covariance of the underlying distribution and its estimator from an i.i.d. sample of size N is of order O(N −0.5+ ) for arbitrarily small > 0 (affecting the probabilistic estimate); this rate of convergence is close to the one of direct covariance estimation, i.e., O(N −0.5 ). Our precise probabilistic estimate implies for some natural settings that the sample complexity of the generalized inverse covariance estimation when using the Frobenius norm is O(D2+δ ) for arbitrarily small δ > 0 (whereas the sample complexity of direct covariance estimation with Frobenius norm is O(D2 )). These results provide similar rates of convergence and sample complexity for the corresponding robust subspace recovery algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work analyzing the sample complexity of any robust PCA algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.13873993 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Multiclass_Learning_with_Simplex_Coding.html">227 nips-2012-Multiclass Learning with Simplex Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Harish G. Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: We study consistency properties of surrogate loss functions for general multiclass classiﬁcation problems, deﬁned by a general loss matrix. We extend the notion of classiﬁcation calibration, which has been studied for binary and multiclass 0-1 classiﬁcation problems (and for certain other speciﬁc learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a surrogate loss to be classiﬁcation calibrated with respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of classiﬁcation calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the smallest ‘size’ of a prediction space for which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is classiﬁcation calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, as one application, we provide a different route from the recent result of Duchi et al. (2010) for analyzing the difﬁculty of designing ‘low-dimensional’ convex surrogates that are consistent with respect to pairwise subset ranking losses. We anticipate the classiﬁcation calibration dimension may prove to be a useful tool in the study and design of surrogate losses for general multiclass learning problems. 1</p><p>4 0.75219929 <a title="16-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Halfspaces_with_the_Zero-One_Loss%3A_Time-Accuracy_Tradeoffs.html">174 nips-2012-Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aharon Birnbaum, Shai S. Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: Given α, ϵ, we study the time complexity required to improperly learn a halfspace with misclassiﬁcation error rate of at most (1 + α) L∗ + ϵ, where L∗ is the γ γ optimal γ-margin error rate. For α = 1/γ, polynomial time and sample complexity is achievable using the hinge-loss. For α = 0, Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2011] showed that poly(1/γ) time is impossible, while learning is possible in ˜ time exp(O(1/γ)). An immediate question, which this paper tackles, is what is achievable if α ∈ (0, 1/γ). We derive positive results interpolating between the polynomial time for α = 1/γ and the exponential time for α = 0. In particular, we show that there are cases in which α = o(1/γ) but the problem is still solvable in polynomial time. Our results naturally extend to the adversarial online learning model and to the PAC learning with malicious noise model. 1</p><p>5 0.73517054 <a title="16-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Accelerated_Training_for_Matrix-norm_Regularization%3A_A_Boosting_Approach.html">29 nips-2012-Accelerated Training for Matrix-norm Regularization: A Boosting Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans, Yao-liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparse learning models typically combine a smooth loss with a nonsmooth penalty, such as trace norm. Although recent developments in sparse approximation have offered promising solution methods, current approaches either apply only to matrix-norm constrained problems or provide suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we propose a boosting method for regularized learning that guarantees accuracy within O(1/ ) iterations. Performance is further accelerated by interlacing boosting with ﬁxed-rank local optimization—exploiting a simpler local objective than previous work. The proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance on large-scale problems. We also demonstrate an application to latent multiview learning for which we provide the ﬁrst efﬁcient weak-oracle. 1</p><p>6 0.73119867 <a title="16-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Matrix_reconstruction_with_the_local_max_norm.html">208 nips-2012-Matrix reconstruction with the local max norm</a></p>

<p>Author: Pedro Ortega, Jordi Grau-moya, Tim Genewein, David Balduzzi, Daniel Braun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve ﬁnding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of ﬁrst, doing inference over the function space and second, ﬁnding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior based on a kernel regressor. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function. Given t observations of the function, the posterior can be evaluated efﬁciently in time O(t2 ) up to a multiplicative constant. Finally, we show how to apply our model to optimize a noisy, non-convex, high-dimensional objective function.</p><p>5 0.87402689 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Diffusion_Decision_Making_for_Adaptive_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">97 nips-2012-Diffusion Decision Making for Adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

By applying the optimal strategy associated with the diffusion decision model, an adaptive rule is developed for determining appropriate values of k in knearest neighbor classiﬁcation. Making use of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and Bayesian analysis, we propose ﬁve different criteria for adaptively acquiring nearest neighbors. Experiments with both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our classiﬁcation criteria. 1</p><p>6 0.872989 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-On_Multilabel_Classification_and_Ranking_with_Partial_Feedback.html">252 nips-2012-On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback</a></p>

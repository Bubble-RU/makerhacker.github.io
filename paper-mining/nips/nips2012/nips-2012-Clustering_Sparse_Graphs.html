<p>Author: Nan Li, Longin J. Latecki</p><p>Abstract: We formulate clustering aggregation as a special instance of Maximum-Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem. For a given dataset, an attributed graph is constructed from the union of the input clusterings generated by different underlying clustering algorithms with different parameters. The vertices, which represent the distinct clusters, are weighted by an internal index measuring both cohesion and separation. The edges connect the vertices whose corresponding clusters overlap. Intuitively, an optimal aggregated clustering can be obtained by selecting an optimal subset of non-overlapping clusters partitioning the dataset together. We formalize this intuition as the MWIS problem on the attributed graph, i.e., ﬁnding the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices. This MWIS problem exhibits a special structure. Since the clusters of each input clustering form a partition of the dataset, the vertices corresponding to each clustering form a maximal independent set (MIS) in the attributed graph. We propose a variant of simulated annealing method that takes advantage of this special structure. Our algorithm starts from each MIS, which is close to a distinct local optimum of the MWIS problem, and utilizes a local search heuristic to explore its neighborhood in order to ﬁnd the MWIS. Extensive experiments on many challenging datasets show that: 1. our approach to clustering aggregation automatically decides the optimal number of clusters; 2. it does not require any parameter tuning for the underlying clustering algorithms; 3. it can combine the advantages of different underlying clustering algorithms to achieve superior performance; 4. it is robust against moderate or even bad input clusterings. 1</p><p>3 0.27177283 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-FastEx%3A_Hash_Clustering_with_Exponential_Families.html">126 nips-2012-FastEx: Hash Clustering with Exponential Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Amr Ahmed, Sujith Ravi, Alex J. Smola, Shravan M. Narayanamurthy</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a key component in any data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters. 1</p><p>4 0.26914194 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Sampling and variational inference techniques are two standard methods for inference in probabilistic models, but for many problems, neither approach scales effectively to large-scale data. An alternative is to relax the probabilistic model into a non-probabilistic formulation which has a scalable associated algorithm. This can often be fulﬁlled by performing small-variance asymptotics, i.e., letting the variance of particular distributions in the model go to zero. For instance, in the context of clustering, such an approach yields connections between the kmeans and EM algorithms. In this paper, we explore small-variance asymptotics for exponential family Dirichlet process (DP) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models. Utilizing connections between exponential family distributions and Bregman divergences, we derive novel clustering algorithms from the asymptotic limit of the DP and HDP mixtures that features the scalability of existing hard clustering methods as well as the ﬂexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We focus on special cases of our analysis for discrete-data problems, including topic modeling, and we demonstrate the utility of our results by applying variants of our algorithms to problems arising in vision and document analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.26465109 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_by_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_Using_Graph_Random_Walk.html">70 nips-2012-Clustering by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Using Graph Random Walk</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhirong Yang, Tele Hao, Onur Dikmen, Xi Chen, Erkki Oja</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising relaxation technique for clustering analysis. However, conventional NMF methods that directly approximate the pairwise similarities using the least square error often yield mediocre performance for data in curved manifolds because they can capture only the immediate similarities between data samples. Here we propose a new NMF clustering method which replaces the approximated matrix with its smoothed version using random walk. Our method can thus accommodate farther relationships between data samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel regularization in the proposed objective function in order to improve over spectral clustering. The new learning objective is optimized by a multiplicative Majorization-Minimization algorithm with a scalable implementation for learning the factorizing matrix. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method has strong performance in terms of cluster purity. 1</p><p>6 0.26215991 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Dip-means%3A_an_incremental_clustering_method_for_estimating_the_number_of_clusters.html">99 nips-2012-Dip-means: an incremental clustering method for estimating the number of clusters</a></p>

<p>Author: Argyris Kalogeratos, Aristidis Likas</p><p>Abstract: Learning the number of clusters is a key problem in data clustering. We present dip-means, a novel robust incremental method to learn the number of data clusters that can be used as a wrapper around any iterative clustering algorithm of k-means family. In contrast to many popular methods which make assumptions about the underlying cluster distributions, dip-means only assumes a fundamental cluster property: each cluster to admit a unimodal distribution. The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as an individual ‘viewer’ and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations. Experimental results on artiﬁcial and real datasets indicate the eﬀectiveness of our method and its superiority over analogous approaches.</p><p>5 0.80682224 <a title="69-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_nonparametric_variable_clustering_model.html">26 nips-2012-A nonparametric variable clustering model</a></p>
<p>Author: Konstantina Palla, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Factor analysis models effectively summarise the covariance structure of high dimensional data, but the solutions are typically hard to interpret. This motivates attempting to ﬁnd a disjoint partition, i.e. a simple clustering, of observed variables into highly correlated subsets. We introduce a Bayesian non-parametric approach to this problem, and demonstrate advantages over heuristic methods proposed to date. Our Dirichlet process variable clustering (DPVC) model can discover blockdiagonal covariance structures in data. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and gene expression analysis problems. 1</p><p>6 0.78522974 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Divide-and-Conquer_Method_for_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation.html">7 nips-2012-A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaldert Rombouts, Pieter Roelfsema, Sander M. Bohte</p><p>Abstract: A key function of brains is undoubtedly the abstraction and maintenance of information from the environment for later use. Neurons in association cortex play an important role in this process: by learning these neurons become tuned to relevant features and represent the information that is required later as a persistent elevation of their activity [1]. It is however not well known how such neurons acquire these task-relevant working memories. Here we introduce a biologically plausible learning scheme grounded in Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory [2] that explains how neurons become selective for relevant information by trial and error learning. The model has memory units which learn useful internal state representations to solve working memory tasks by transforming partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDP) into MDPs. We propose that synaptic plasticity is guided by a combination of attentional feedback signals from the action selection stage to earlier processing levels and a globally released neuromodulatory signal. Feedback signals interact with feedforward signals to form synaptic tags at those connections that are responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. The neuromodulatory signal interacts with tagged synapses to determine the sign and strength of plasticity. The learning scheme is generic because it can train networks in different tasks, simply by varying inputs and rewards. It explains how neurons in association cortex learn to 1) temporarily store task-relevant information in non-linear stimulus-response mapping tasks [1, 3, 4] and 2) learn to optimally integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decision making [5, 6]. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81035709 <a title="69-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Clustering_Sparse_Graphs.html">69 nips-2012-Clustering Sparse Graphs</a></p>

We analyze our algorithm’s performance on the natural, classical and widely studied “planted partition” model (also called the stochastic block model); we show that our algorithm can cluster sparser graphs, and with smaller clusters, than all previous methods. This is seen empirically as well. 1</p><p>3 0.80548787 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Multiple_Choice_Learning%3A_Learning_to_Produce_Multiple_Structured_Outputs.html">230 nips-2012-Multiple Choice Learning: Learning to Produce Multiple Structured Outputs</a></p>
<p>Author: Abner Guzmán-rivera, Dhruv Batra, Pushmeet Kohli</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of generating multiple hypotheses for structured prediction tasks that involve interaction with users or successive components in a cascaded architecture. Given a set of multiple hypotheses, such components/users typically have the ability to retrieve the best (or approximately the best) solution in this set. The standard approach for handling such a scenario is to ﬁrst learn a single-output model and then produce M -Best Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) hypotheses from this model. In contrast, we learn to produce multiple outputs by formulating this task as a multiple-output structured-output prediction problem with a loss-function that effectively captures the setup of the problem. We present a max-margin formulation that minimizes an upper-bound on this lossfunction. Experimental results on image segmentation and protein side-chain prediction show that our method outperforms conventional approaches used for this type of scenario and leads to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.79609925 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Finding_Exemplars_from_Pairwise_Dissimilarities_via_Simultaneous_Sparse_Recovery.html">133 nips-2012-Finding Exemplars from Pairwise Dissimilarities via Simultaneous Sparse Recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, Guillermo Sapiro, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: Given pairwise dissimilarities between data points, we consider the problem of ﬁnding a subset of data points, called representatives or exemplars, that can efﬁciently describe the data collection. We formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem that can be solved efﬁciently using convex programming. The solution of the proposed optimization program ﬁnds the representatives and the probability that each data point is associated with each one of the representatives. We obtain the range of the regularization parameter for which the solution of the proposed optimization program changes from selecting one representative for all data points to selecting all data points as representatives. When data points are distributed around multiple clusters according to the dissimilarities, we show that the data points in each cluster select representatives only from that cluster. Unlike metric-based methods, our algorithm can be applied to dissimilarities that are asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality, i.e., it does not require that the pairwise dissimilarities come from a metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on synthetic data as well as real-world image and text data. 1</p><p>5 0.75068402 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Augmented-SVM%3A_Automatic_space_partitioning_for_combining_multiple_non-linear_dynamics.html">48 nips-2012-Augmented-SVM: Automatic space partitioning for combining multiple non-linear dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashwini Shukla, Aude Billard</p><p>Abstract: Non-linear dynamical systems (DS) have been used extensively for building generative models of human behavior. Their applications range from modeling brain dynamics to encoding motor commands. Many schemes have been proposed for encoding robot motions using dynamical systems with a single attractor placed at a predeﬁned target in state space. Although these enable the robots to react against sudden perturbations without any re-planning, the motions are always directed towards a single target. In this work, we focus on combining several such DS with distinct attractors, resulting in a multi-stable DS. We show its applicability in reach-to-grasp tasks where the attractors represent several grasping points on the target object. While exploiting multiple attractors provides more ﬂexibility in recovering from unseen perturbations, it also increases the complexity of the underlying learning problem. Here we present the Augmented-SVM (A-SVM) model which inherits region partitioning ability of the well known SVM classiﬁer and is augmented with novel constraints derived from the individual DS. The new constraints modify the original SVM dual whose optimal solution then results in a new class of support vectors (SV). These new SV ensure that the resulting multistable DS incurs minimum deviation from the original dynamics and is stable at each of the attractors within a ﬁnite region of attraction. We show, via implementations on a simulated 10 degrees of freedom mobile robotic platform, that the model is capable of real-time motion generation and is able to adapt on-the-ﬂy to perturbations.</p><p>6 0.75053573 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>

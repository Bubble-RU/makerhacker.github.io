<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Shengxuan Ye, Ian Ross, Adam Mamelak, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real time before the action occurs has been long sought in the neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making, agency and volition. On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise their left or right hand immediately as the “go” signal appeared on a computer screen. They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68±3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously, and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict the correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less conﬁdent. Our system demonstrates— for the ﬁrst time—the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single trials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs. 1 1</p><p>3 0.13902645 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Target_Prior.html">198 nips-2012-Learning with Target Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Zuoguan Wang, Siwei Lyu, Gerwin Schalk, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In the conventional approaches for supervised parametric learning, relations between data and target variables are provided through training sets consisting of pairs of corresponded data and target variables. In this work, we describe a new learning scheme for parametric learning, in which the target variables y can be modeled with a prior model p(y) and the relations between data and target variables are estimated with p(y) and a set of uncorresponded data X in training. We term this method as learning with target priors (LTP). Speciﬁcally, LTP learning seeks parameter θ that maximizes the log likelihood of fθ (X) on a uncorresponded training set with regards to p(y). Compared to the conventional (semi)supervised learning approach, LTP can make efﬁcient use of prior knowledge of the target variables in the form of probabilistic distributions, and thus removes/reduces the reliance on training data in learning. Compared to the Bayesian approach, the learned parametric regressor in LTP can be more efﬁciently implemented and deployed in tasks where running efﬁciency is critical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on parametric regression tasks for BCI signal decoding and pose estimation from video. 1</p><p>4 0.12428275 <a title="50-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_P300_BCI_for_the_Masses%3A_Prior_Information_Enables_Instant_Unsupervised_Spelling.html">14 nips-2012-A P300 BCI for the Masses: Prior Information Enables Instant Unsupervised Spelling</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter-jan Kindermans, Hannes Verschore, David Verstraeten, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: The usability of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on the P300 speller is severely hindered by the need for long training times and many repetitions of the same stimulus. In this contribution we introduce a set of unsupervised hierarchical probabilistic models that tackle both problems simultaneously by incorporating prior knowledge from two sources: information from other training subjects (through transfer learning) and information about the words being spelled (through language models). We show, that due to this prior knowledge, the performance of the unsupervised models parallels and in some cases even surpasses that of supervised models, while eliminating the tedious training session. 1</p><p>5 0.11746194 <a title="50-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>6 0.095150977 <a title="50-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Best_Arm_Identification%3A_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence.html">61 nips-2012-Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider a setting where we have a very large number of related tasks with few examples from each individual task. Rather than either learning each task individually (and having a large generalization error) or learning all the tasks together using a single hypothesis (and suffering a potentially large inherent error), we consider learning a small pool of shared hypotheses. Each task is then mapped to a single hypothesis in the pool (hard association). We derive VC dimension generalization bounds for our model, based on the number of tasks, shared hypothesis and the VC dimension of the hypotheses class. We conducted experiments with both synthetic problems and sentiment of reviews, which strongly support our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.51624793 <a title="50-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Best_Arm_Identification%3A_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence.html">61 nips-2012-Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Blundell, Jeff Beck, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian nonparametric model that discovers implicit social structure from interaction time-series data. Social groups are often formed implicitly, through actions among members of groups. Yet many models of social networks use explicitly declared relationships to infer social structure. We consider a particular class of Hawkes processes, a doubly stochastic point process, that is able to model reciprocity between groups of individuals. We then extend the Inﬁnite Relational Model by using these reciprocating Hawkes processes to parameterise its edges, making events associated with edges co-dependent through time. Our model outperforms general, unstructured Hawkes processes as well as structured Poisson process-based models at predicting verbal and email turn-taking, and military conﬂicts among nations. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68598187 <a title="50-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Bandit_Algorithms_boost_Brain_Computer_Interfaces_for_motor-task_selection_of_a_brain-controlled_button.html">50 nips-2012-Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button</a></p>
<p>Author: Joan Fruitet, Alexandra Carpentier, Maureen Clerc, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allow users to “communicate” with a computer without using their muscles. BCI based on sensori-motor rhythms use imaginary motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand, to send control signals. The performances of a BCI can vary greatly across users but also depend on the tasks used, making the problem of appropriate task selection an important issue. This study presents a new procedure to automatically select as fast as possible a discriminant motor task for a brain-controlled button. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm, UCB-classif , based on the stochastic bandit theory. This shortens the training stage, thereby allowing the exploration of a greater variety of tasks. By not wasting time on inefﬁcient tasks, and focusing on the most promising ones, this algorithm results in a faster task selection and a more efﬁcient use of the BCI training session. Comparing the proposed method to the standard practice in task selection, for a ﬁxed time budget, UCB-classif leads to an improved classiﬁcation rate, and for a ﬁxed classiﬁcation rate, to a reduction of the time spent in training by 50%. 1</p><p>3 0.52694029 <a title="50-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_P300_BCI_for_the_Masses%3A_Prior_Information_Enables_Instant_Unsupervised_Spelling.html">14 nips-2012-A P300 BCI for the Masses: Prior Information Enables Instant Unsupervised Spelling</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter-jan Kindermans, Hannes Verschore, David Verstraeten, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: The usability of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on the P300 speller is severely hindered by the need for long training times and many repetitions of the same stimulus. In this contribution we introduce a set of unsupervised hierarchical probabilistic models that tackle both problems simultaneously by incorporating prior knowledge from two sources: information from other training subjects (through transfer learning) and information about the words being spelled (through language models). We show, that due to this prior knowledge, the performance of the unsupervised models parallels and in some cases even surpasses that of supervised models, while eliminating the tedious training session. 1</p><p>4 0.52006704 <a title="50-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Risk-Aversion_in_Multi-armed_Bandits.html">295 nips-2012-Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sani, Alessandro Lazaric, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic multi–armed bandits solve the Exploration–Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk–aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk–return trade–off. This setting proves to be more difﬁcult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we deﬁne two algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results. 1</p><p>5 0.51517737 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Transferring_Expectations_in_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">353 nips-2012-Transferring Expectations in Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Trung Nguyen, Tomi Silander, Tze Y. Leong</p><p>Abstract: We study how to automatically select and adapt multiple abstractions or representations of the world to support model-based reinforcement learning. We address the challenges of transfer learning in heterogeneous environments with varying tasks. We present an efﬁcient, online framework that, through a sequence of tasks, learns a set of relevant representations to be used in future tasks. Without predeﬁned mapping strategies, we introduce a general approach to support transfer learning across different state spaces. We demonstrate the potential impact of our system through improved jumpstart and faster convergence to near optimum policy in two benchmark domains. 1</p><p>6 0.51383191 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Persistent_Homology_for_Learning_Densities_with_Bounded_Support.html">269 nips-2012-Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support</a></p>

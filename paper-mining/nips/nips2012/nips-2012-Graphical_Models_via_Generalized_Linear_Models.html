<p>Author: Jason Pacheco, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: We develop convergent minimization algorithms for Bethe variational approximations which explicitly constrain marginal estimates to families of valid distributions. While existing message passing algorithms deﬁne ﬁxed point iterations corresponding to stationary points of the Bethe free energy, their greedy dynamics do not distinguish between local minima and maxima, and can fail to converge. For continuous estimation problems, this instability is linked to the creation of invalid marginal estimates, such as Gaussians with negative variance. Conversely, our approach leverages multiplier methods with well-understood convergence properties, and uses bound projection methods to ensure that marginal approximations are valid at all iterations. We derive general algorithms for discrete and Gaussian pairwise Markov random ﬁelds, showing improvements over standard loopy belief propagation. We also apply our method to a hybrid model with both discrete and continuous variables, showing improvements over expectation propagation. 1</p><p>4 0.32412401 <a title="147-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Symbolic_Dynamic_Programming_for_Continuous_State_and_Observation_POMDPs.html">331 nips-2012-Symbolic Dynamic Programming for Continuous State and Observation POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Zahra Zamani, Scott Sanner, Pascal Poupart, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: Point-based value iteration (PBVI) methods have proven extremely effective for ﬁnding (approximately) optimal dynamic programming solutions to partiallyobservable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) when a set of initial belief states is known. However, no PBVI work has provided exact point-based backups for both continuous state and observation spaces, which we tackle in this paper. Our key insight is that while there may be an inﬁnite number of observations, there are only a ﬁnite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a ﬁnite, ﬁxed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces. 1</p><p>5 0.15172282 <a title="147-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Latent_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Efficient_Methods_for_Locally_Tree-like_Graphs.html">172 nips-2012-Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Ragupathyraj Valluvan</p><p>Abstract: Graphical model selection refers to the problem of estimating the unknown graph structure given observations at the nodes in the model. We consider a challenging instance of this problem when some of the nodes are latent or hidden. We characterize conditions for tractable graph estimation and develop efﬁcient methods with provable guarantees. We consider the class of Ising models Markov on locally tree-like graphs, which are in the regime of correlation decay. We propose an efﬁcient method for graph estimation, and establish its structural consistency −δη(η+1)−2 when the number of samples n scales as n = Ω(θmin log p), where θmin is the minimum edge potential, δ is the depth (i.e., distance from a hidden node to the nearest observed nodes), and η is a parameter which depends on the minimum and maximum node and edge potentials in the Ising model. The proposed method is practical to implement and provides ﬂexibility to control the number of latent variables and the cycle lengths in the output graph. We also present necessary conditions for graph estimation by any method and show that our method nearly matches the lower bound on sample requirements. Keywords: Graphical model selection, latent variables, quartet methods, locally tree-like graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.14610067 <a title="147-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-A_Spectral_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">19 nips-2012-A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicholas Ruozzi</p><p>Abstract: Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any ﬁxed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the “four functions” theorem that may be of independent interest. 1</p><p>6 0.51376152 <a title="147-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-The_Lov%C3%A1sz_%CF%91_function%2C_SVMs_and_finding_large_dense_subgraphs.html">337 nips-2012-The Lovász ϑ function, SVMs and finding large dense subgraphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Zohar Karnin</p><p>Abstract: We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classiﬁcation formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classiﬁcation problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known. 1</p><p>3 0.7861557 <a title="147-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Priors_for_Diversity_in_Generative_Latent_Variable_Models.html">274 nips-2012-Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>4 0.77718866 <a title="147-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Dual-Space_Analysis_of_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">104 nips-2012-Dual-Space Analysis of the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: Sparse linear (or generalized linear) models combine a standard likelihood function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefﬁcients. These priors can conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with different variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefﬁcients, while an empirical Bayesian alternative (Type II) ﬁrst marginalizes the coefﬁcients and then maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior approximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space framework from [22], which allows both the Type I or Type II objectives to be expressed in either coefﬁcient or hyperparmeter space. This perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to development in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data ﬁt. As this parameter is effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to solve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefﬁcient-space techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful recovering sparse coefﬁcients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties (RIP) lead to failure of popular ℓ1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable integrations. 1</p><p>5 0.77713478 <a title="147-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Active_Learning_of_Model_Evidence_Using_Bayesian_Quadrature.html">33 nips-2012-Active Learning of Model Evidence Using Bayesian Quadrature</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Osborne, Roman Garnett, Zoubin Ghahramani, David K. Duvenaud, Stephen J. Roberts, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Numerical integration is a key component of many problems in scientiﬁc computing, statistical modelling, and machine learning. Bayesian Quadrature is a modelbased method for numerical integration which, relative to standard Monte Carlo methods, offers increased sample efﬁciency and a more robust estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature approach for numerical integration when the integrand is non-negative, such as the case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive distribution, or normalising constant of a probabilistic model. Our approach approximately marginalises the quadrature model’s hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an active learning scheme to optimally select function evaluations, as opposed to using Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic benchmarks and a real scientiﬁc problem from astronomy. 1</p><p>6 0.77639478 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Simultaneously_Leveraging_Output_and_Task_Structures_for_Multiple-Output_Regression.html">312 nips-2012-Simultaneously Leveraging Output and Task Structures for Multiple-Output Regression</a></p>

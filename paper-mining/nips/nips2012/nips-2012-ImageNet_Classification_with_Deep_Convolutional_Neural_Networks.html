<p>Author: Dan Ciresan, Alessandro Giusti, Luca M. Gambardella, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: We address a central problem of neuroanatomy, namely, the automatic segmentation of neuronal structures depicted in stacks of electron microscopy (EM) images. This is necessary to efﬁciently map 3D brain structure and connectivity. To segment biological neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep artiﬁcial neural network as a pixel classiﬁer. The label of each pixel (membrane or nonmembrane) is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability for each class. The classiﬁer is trained by plain gradient descent on a 512 × 512 × 30 stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same size (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation Challenge. Even without problem-speciﬁc postprocessing, our approach outperforms competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. rand error, warping error and pixel error. For pixel error, our approach is the only one outperforming a second human observer. 1</p><p>3 0.32230169 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive_Deep_Learning_for_3D_Object_Classification.html">87 nips-2012-Convolutional-Recursive Deep Learning for 3D Object Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Brody Huval, Bharath Bath, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D sensing technologies make it possible to easily record color and depth images which together can improve object recognition. Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, ﬁxed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efﬁcient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs. 1</p><p>4 0.30984366 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Will Zou, Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We apply salient feature detection and tracking in videos to simulate ﬁxations and smooth pursuit in human vision. With tracked sequences as input, a hierarchical network of modules learns invariant features using a temporal slowness constraint. The network encodes invariance which are increasingly complex with hierarchy. Although learned from videos, our features are spatial instead of spatial-temporal, and well suited for extracting features from still images. We applied our features to four datasets (COIL-100, Caltech 101, STL-10, PubFig), and observe a consistent improvement of 4% to 5% in classiﬁcation accuracy. With this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy 61% on STL-10 dataset. 1</p><p>5 0.23933385 <a title="158-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Representations_and_Codes_for_Image_Auto-Annotation.html">92 nips-2012-Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Kiros, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and ﬁx an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efﬁcient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones. 1</p><p>6 0.21220101 <a title="158-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Recursive_Perceptual_Representations.html">197 nips-2012-Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: Pietro D. Lena, Ken Nagata, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Residue-residue contact prediction is a fundamental problem in protein structure prediction. Hower, despite considerable research efforts, contact prediction methods are still largely unreliable. Here we introduce a novel deep machine-learning architecture which consists of a multidimensional stack of learning modules. For contact prediction, the idea is implemented as a three-dimensional stack of Neural Networks NNk , where i and j index the spatial coordinates of the contact ij map and k indexes “time”. The temporal dimension is introduced to capture the fact that protein folding is not an instantaneous process, but rather a progressive reﬁnement. Networks at level k in the stack can be trained in supervised fashion to reﬁne the predictions produced by the previous level, hence addressing the problem of vanishing gradients, typical of deep architectures. Increased accuracy and generalization capabilities of this approach are established by rigorous comparison with other classical machine learning approaches for contact prediction. The deep approach leads to an accuracy for difﬁcult long-range contacts of about 30%, roughly 10% above the state-of-the-art. Many variations in the architectures and the training algorithms are possible, leaving room for further improvements. Furthermore, the approach is applicable to other problems with strong underlying spatial and temporal components. 1</p><p>5 0.77593702 <a title="158-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Learning_to_Align_from_Scratch.html">193 nips-2012-Learning to Align from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Author: Gary Huang, Marwan Mattar, Honglak Lee, Erik G. Learned-miller</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised joint alignment of images has been demonstrated to improve performance on recognition tasks such as face veriﬁcation. Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly aligned examples. However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of complex, real-world images has required the careful selection of feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape. In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Speciﬁcally, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the speciﬁc data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned ﬁlters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW). Using the aligned images produced by our proposed unsupervised algorithm, we achieve higher accuracy in face veriﬁcation compared to prior work in both unsupervised and supervised alignment. We also match the accuracy for the best available commercial method. 1</p><p>6 0.74486357 <a title="158-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Large_Scale_Distributed_Deep_Networks.html">170 nips-2012-Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks</a></p>

In this paper, we describe a large class of dependent nonparametric processes, including several existing models, and present a slice sampler that allows efﬁcient inference across this class of models. 1</p><p>2 0.86629105 <a title="158-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Max-Margin_Structured_Output_Regression_for_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization.html">209 nips-2012-Max-Margin Structured Output Regression for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Du Tran, Junsong Yuan</p><p>Abstract: Structured output learning has been successfully applied to object localization, where the mapping between an image and an object bounding box can be well captured. Its extension to action localization in videos, however, is much more challenging, because we need to predict the locations of the action patterns both spatially and temporally, i.e., identifying a sequence of bounding boxes that track the action in video. The problem becomes intractable due to the exponentially large size of the structured video space where actions could occur. We propose a novel structured learning approach for spatio-temporal action localization. The mapping between a video and a spatio-temporal action trajectory is learned. The intractable inference and learning problems are addressed by leveraging an efﬁcient Max-Path search method, thus making it feasible to optimize the model over the whole structured space. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85962206 <a title="158-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.html">158 nips-2012-ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of ﬁve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a ﬁnal 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry. 1</p><p>4 0.80807436 <a title="158-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Shared_Hypotheses.html">181 nips-2012-Learning Multiple Tasks using Shared Hypotheses</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider a setting where we have a very large number of related tasks with few examples from each individual task. Rather than either learning each task individually (and having a large generalization error) or learning all the tasks together using a single hypothesis (and suffering a potentially large inherent error), we consider learning a small pool of shared hypotheses. Each task is then mapped to a single hypothesis in the pool (hard association). We derive VC dimension generalization bounds for our model, based on the number of tasks, shared hypothesis and the VC dimension of the hypotheses class. We conducted experiments with both synthetic problems and sentiment of reviews, which strongly support our approach. 1</p><p>5 0.80704212 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Representations_and_Codes_for_Image_Auto-Annotation.html">92 nips-2012-Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Kiros, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and ﬁx an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efﬁcient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones. 1</p><p>6 0.80253261 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Timely_Object_Recognition.html">344 nips-2012-Timely Object Recognition</a></p>

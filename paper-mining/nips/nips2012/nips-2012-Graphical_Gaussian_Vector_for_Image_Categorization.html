<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: While long term human visual memory can store a remarkable amount of visual information, it tends to degrade over time. Recent works have shown that image memorability is an intrinsic property of an image that can be reliably estimated using state-of-the-art image features and machine learning algorithms. However, the class of features and image information that is forgotten has not been explored yet. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework that models how and which local regions from an image may be forgotten using a data-driven approach that combines local and global images features. The model automatically discovers memorability maps of individual images without any human annotation. We incorporate multiple image region attributes in our algorithm, leading to improved memorability prediction of images as compared to previous works. 1</p><p>3 0.074247286 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Representations_and_Codes_for_Image_Auto-Annotation.html">92 nips-2012-Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Kiros, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: The task of image auto-annotation, namely assigning a set of relevant tags to an image, is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and ﬁx an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of standard sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection for annotation. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we compete with or outperform existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct handcrafted image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efﬁcient storage and fast comparisons. Self-taught learning is used in all of our experiments and deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones. 1</p><p>4 0.05852006 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Learning_Image_Descriptors_with_the_Boosting-Trick.html">176 nips-2012-Learning Image Descriptors with the Boosting-Trick</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomasz Trzcinski, Mario Christoudias, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we apply boosting to learn complex non-linear local visual feature representations, drawing inspiration from its successful application to visual object detection. The main goal of local feature descriptors is to distinctively represent a salient image region while remaining invariant to viewpoint and illumination changes. This representation can be improved using machine learning, however, past approaches have been mostly limited to learning linear feature mappings in either the original input or a kernelized input feature space. While kernelized methods have proven somewhat effective for learning non-linear local feature descriptors, they rely heavily on the choice of an appropriate kernel function whose selection is often difﬁcult and non-intuitive. We propose to use the boosting-trick to obtain a non-linear mapping of the input to a high-dimensional feature space. The non-linear feature mapping obtained with the boosting-trick is highly intuitive. We employ gradient-based weak learners resulting in a learned descriptor that closely resembles the well-known SIFT. As demonstrated in our experiments, the resulting descriptor can be learned directly from intensity patches achieving state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>5 0.054451223 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Will Zou, Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We apply salient feature detection and tracking in videos to simulate ﬁxations and smooth pursuit in human vision. With tracked sequences as input, a hierarchical network of modules learns invariant features using a temporal slowness constraint. The network encodes invariance which are increasingly complex with hierarchy. Although learned from videos, our features are spatial instead of spatial-temporal, and well suited for extracting features from still images. We applied our features to four datasets (COIL-100, Caltech 101, STL-10, PubFig), and observe a consistent improvement of 4% to 5% in classiﬁcation accuracy. With this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy 61% on STL-10 dataset. 1</p><p>6 0.048641697 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_about_Canonical_Views_from_Internet_Image_Collections.html">185 nips-2012-Learning about Canonical Views from Internet Image Collections</a></p>

<p>Author: Shulin Yang, Liefeng Bo, Jue Wang, Linda G. Shapiro</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition refers to a subordinate level of recognition, such as recognizing different species of animals and plants. It differs from recognition of basic categories, such as humans, tables, and computers, in that there are global similarities in shape and structure shared cross different categories, and the differences are in the details of object parts. We suggest that the key to identifying the ﬁne-grained differences lies in ﬁnding the right alignment of image regions that contain the same object parts. We propose a template model for the purpose, which captures common shape patterns of object parts, as well as the cooccurrence relation of the shape patterns. Once the image regions are aligned, extracted features are used for classiﬁcation. Learning of the template model is efﬁcient, and the recognition results we achieve signiﬁcantly outperform the stateof-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.66135889 <a title="146-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Locally_Uniform_Comparison_Image_Descriptor.html">202 nips-2012-Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Ziegler, Eric Christiansen, David Kriegman, Serge J. Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Keypoint matching between pairs of images using popular descriptors like SIFT or a faster variant called SURF is at the heart of many computer vision algorithms including recognition, mosaicing, and structure from motion. However, SIFT and SURF do not perform well for real-time or mobile applications. As an alternative very fast binary descriptors like BRIEF and related methods use pairwise comparisons of pixel intensities in an image patch. We present an analysis of BRIEF and related approaches revealing that they are hashing schemes on the ordinal correlation metric Kendall’s tau. Here, we introduce Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor (LUCID), a simple description method based on linear time permutation distances between the ordering of RGB values of two image patches. LUCID is computable in linear time with respect to the number of pixels and does not require ﬂoating point computation. 1</p><p>5 0.6528067 <a title="146-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Discriminatively_Trained_Sparse_Code_Gradients_for_Contour_Detection.html">101 nips-2012-Discriminatively Trained Sparse Code Gradients for Contour Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Ren Xiaofeng, Liefeng Bo</p><p>Abstract: Finding contours in natural images is a fundamental problem that serves as the basis of many tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator. In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding. We use K-SVD for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for computing sparse codes on oriented local neighborhoods, and apply multi-scale pooling and power transforms before classifying them with linear SVMs. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and ﬁnd contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours). Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth maps and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as veriﬁed on the NYU Depth Dataset. 1</p><p>6 0.64955318 <a title="146-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Memorability_of_Image_Regions.html">210 nips-2012-Memorability of Image Regions</a></p>

<p>Author: Konstantina Palla, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Factor analysis models effectively summarise the covariance structure of high dimensional data, but the solutions are typically hard to interpret. This motivates attempting to ﬁnd a disjoint partition, i.e. a simple clustering, of observed variables into highly correlated subsets. We introduce a Bayesian non-parametric approach to this problem, and demonstrate advantages over heuristic methods proposed to date. Our Dirichlet process variable clustering (DPVC) model can discover blockdiagonal covariance structures in data. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and gene expression analysis problems. 1</p><p>3 0.44517469 <a title="146-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_Neural_Tuning_Curves_for_Arbitrary_Stimulus_Distributions%3A_Discrimax%2C_Infomax_and_Minimum_%24L_p%24_Loss.html">262 nips-2012-Optimal Neural Tuning Curves for Arbitrary Stimulus Distributions: Discrimax, Infomax and Minimum $L p$ Loss</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuo Wang, Alan Stocker, Daniel Lee</p><p>Abstract: In this work we study how the stimulus distribution inﬂuences the optimal coding of an individual neuron. Closed-form solutions to the optimal sigmoidal tuning curve are provided for a neuron obeying Poisson statistics under a given stimulus distribution. We consider a variety of optimality criteria, including maximizing discriminability, maximizing mutual information and minimizing estimation error under a general Lp norm. We generalize the Cramer-Rao lower bound and show how the Lp loss can be written as a functional of the Fisher Information in the asymptotic limit, by proving the moment convergence of certain functions of Poisson random variables. In this manner, we show how the optimal tuning curve depends upon the loss function, and the equivalence of maximizing mutual information with minimizing Lp loss in the limit as p goes to zero. 1</p><p>4 0.43220749 <a title="146-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Synchronization_can_Control_Regularization_in_Neural_Systems_via_Correlated_Noise_Processes.html">333 nips-2012-Synchronization can Control Regularization in Neural Systems via Correlated Noise Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jake Bouvrie, Jean-jeacques Slotine</p><p>Abstract: To learn reliable rules that can generalize to novel situations, the brain must be capable of imposing some form of regularization. Here we suggest, through theoretical and computational arguments, that the combination of noise with synchronization provides a plausible mechanism for regularization in the nervous system. The functional role of regularization is considered in a general context in which coupled computational systems receive inputs corrupted by correlated noise. Noise on the inputs is shown to impose regularization, and when synchronization upstream induces time-varying correlations across noise variables, the degree of regularization can be calibrated over time. The resulting qualitative behavior matches experimental data from visual cortex. 1</p><p>5 0.41939455 <a title="146-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Online_L1-Dictionary_Learning_with_Application_to_Novel_Document_Detection.html">258 nips-2012-Online L1-Dictionary Learning with Application to Novel Document Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiva P. Kasiviswanathan, Huahua Wang, Arindam Banerjee, Prem Melville</p><p>Abstract: Given their pervasive use, social media, such as Twitter, have become a leading source of breaking news. A key task in the automated identiﬁcation of such news is the detection of novel documents from a voluminous stream of text documents in a scalable manner. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce the problem of online 1 -dictionary learning where unlike traditional dictionary learning, which uses squared loss, the 1 -penalty is used for measuring the reconstruction error. We present an efﬁcient online algorithm for this problem based on alternating directions method of multipliers, and establish a sublinear regret bound for this algorithm. Empirical results on news-stream and Twitter data, shows that this online 1 -dictionary learning algorithm for novel document detection gives more than an order of magnitude speedup over the previously known batch algorithm, without any signiﬁcant loss in quality of results. 1</p><p>6 0.38007632 <a title="146-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Features_via_Simulated_Fixations_in_Video.html">90 nips-2012-Deep Learning of Invariant Features via Simulated Fixations in Video</a></p>

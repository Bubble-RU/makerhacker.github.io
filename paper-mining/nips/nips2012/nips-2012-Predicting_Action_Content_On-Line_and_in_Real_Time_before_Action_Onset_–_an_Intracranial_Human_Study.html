On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent.

They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal.

<p>Author: Jenna Wiens, Eric Horvitz, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: A patient’s risk for adverse events is affected by temporal processes including the nature and timing of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, and the overall evolution of the patient’s pathophysiology over time. Yet many investigators ignore this temporal aspect when modeling patient outcomes, considering only the patient’s current or aggregate state. In this paper, we represent patient risk as a time series. In doing so, patient risk stratiﬁcation becomes a time-series classiﬁcation task. The task differs from most applications of time-series analysis, like speech processing, since the time series itself must ﬁrst be extracted. Thus, we begin by deﬁning and extracting approximate risk processes, the evolving approximate daily risk of a patient. Once obtained, we use these signals to explore different approaches to time-series classiﬁcation with the goal of identifying high-risk patterns. We apply the classiﬁcation to the speciﬁc task of identifying patients at risk of testing positive for hospital acquired Clostridium difﬁcile. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 on a held-out set of several hundred patients. Our two-stage approach to risk stratiﬁcation outperforms classiﬁers that consider only a patient’s current state (p<0.05). 1</p><p>3 0.15294196 <a title="273-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Searching_for_objects_driven_by_context.html">303 nips-2012-Searching for objects driven by context</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Nicolas Heess, Yee W. Teh, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: The dominant visual search paradigm for object class detection is sliding windows. Although simple and effective, it is also wasteful, unnatural and rigidly hardwired. We propose strategies to search for objects which intelligently explore the space of windows by making sequential observations at locations decided based on previous observations. Our strategies adapt to the class being searched and to the content of a particular test image, exploiting context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. In addition to being more elegant than sliding windows, we demonstrate experimentally on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset that our strategies evaluate two orders of magnitude fewer windows while achieving higher object detection performance. 1</p><p>4 0.15215154 <a title="273-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Probabilistic_Event_Cascades_for_Alzheimer%27s_disease.html">276 nips-2012-Probabilistic Event Cascades for Alzheimer's disease</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Daniel Alexander</p><p>Abstract: Accurate and detailed models of neurodegenerative disease progression are crucially important for reliable early diagnosis and the determination of effective treatments. We introduce the ALPACA (Alzheimer’s disease Probabilistic Cascades) model, a generative model linking latent Alzheimer’s progression dynamics to observable biomarker data. In contrast with previous works which model disease progression as a ﬁxed event ordering, we explicitly model the variability over such orderings among patients which is more realistic, particularly for highly detailed progression models. We describe efﬁcient learning algorithms for ALPACA and discuss promising experimental results on a real cohort of Alzheimer’s patients from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 1</p><p>5 0.15039711 <a title="273-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Many_Player_Actions.html">109 nips-2012-Efficient Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization in Games with Many Player Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil Burch, Marc Lanctot, Duane Szafron, Richard G. Gibson</p><p>Abstract: Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, iterative algorithm for computing strategies in extensive-form games. The Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) variants reduce the per iteration time cost of CFR by traversing a smaller, sampled portion of the tree. The previous most effective instances of MCCFR can still be very slow in games with many player actions since they sample every action for a given player. In this paper, we present a new MCCFR algorithm, Average Strategy Sampling (AS), that samples a subset of the player’s actions according to the player’s average strategy. Our new algorithm is inspired by a new, tighter bound on the number of iterations required by CFR to converge to a given solution quality. In addition, we prove a similar, tighter bound for AS and other popular MCCFR variants. Finally, we validate our work by demonstrating that AS converges faster than previous MCCFR algorithms in both no-limit poker and Bluff. 1</p><p>6 0.139337 <a title="273-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Bandit_Algorithms_boost_Brain_Computer_Interfaces_for_motor-task_selection_of_a_brain-controlled_button.html">50 nips-2012-Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button</a></p>

<p>Author: Joan Fruitet, Alexandra Carpentier, Maureen Clerc, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allow users to “communicate” with a computer without using their muscles. BCI based on sensori-motor rhythms use imaginary motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand, to send control signals. The performances of a BCI can vary greatly across users but also depend on the tasks used, making the problem of appropriate task selection an important issue. This study presents a new procedure to automatically select as fast as possible a discriminant motor task for a brain-controlled button. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm, UCB-classif , based on the stochastic bandit theory. This shortens the training stage, thereby allowing the exploration of a greater variety of tasks. By not wasting time on inefﬁcient tasks, and focusing on the most promising ones, this algorithm results in a faster task selection and a more efﬁcient use of the BCI training session. Comparing the proposed method to the standard practice in task selection, for a ﬁxed time budget, UCB-classif leads to an improved classiﬁcation rate, and for a ﬁxed classiﬁcation rate, to a reduction of the time spent in training by 50%. 1</p><p>5 0.48733923 <a title="273-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Many_Player_Actions.html">109 nips-2012-Efficient Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization in Games with Many Player Actions</a></p>

<p>Author: Uri Maoz, Shengxuan Ye, Ian Ross, Adam Mamelak, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real time before the action occurs has been long sought in the neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making, agency and volition. On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical purposes, participated in a “matching-pennies” game against an opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise their left or right hand immediately as the “go” signal appeared on a computer screen. They won a ﬁxed amount of money if they raised a different hand than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the subjects’ decisions can be detected in intracranial local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that combined low-frequency (0.1–5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68±3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously, and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict the correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less conﬁdent. Our system demonstrates— for the ﬁrst time—the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single trials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs. 1 1</p><p>2 0.45721111 <a title="273-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Multi-Stage_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning.html">221 nips-2012-Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Pinghua Gong, Jieping Ye, Chang-shui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task sparse feature learning aims to improve the generalization performance by exploiting the shared features among tasks. It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an ℓ0 -type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a MultiStage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.41485751 <a title="273-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-How_Prior_Probability_Influences_Decision_Making%3A_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Model.html">153 nips-2012-How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanping Huang, Timothy Hanks, Mike Shadlen, Abram L. Friesen, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data. The ﬁrst posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying inﬂuence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way. We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more recent data on the time-varying inﬂuence of prior knowledge on decision making. 1</p><p>4 0.41232556 <a title="273-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Human_memory_search_as_a_random_walk_in_a_semantic_network.html">155 nips-2012-Human memory search as a random walk in a semantic network</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph L. Austerweil, Joshua T. Abbott, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The human mind has a remarkable ability to store a vast amount of information in memory, and an even more remarkable ability to retrieve these experiences when needed. Understanding the representations and algorithms that underlie human memory search could potentially be useful in other information retrieval settings, including internet search. Psychological studies have revealed clear regularities in how people search their memory, with clusters of semantically related items tending to be retrieved together. These ﬁndings have recently been taken as evidence that human memory search is similar to animals foraging for food in patchy environments, with people making a rational decision to switch away from a cluster of related information as it becomes depleted. We demonstrate that the results that were taken as evidence for this account also emerge from a random walk on a semantic network, much like the random web surfer model used in internet search engines. This offers a simpler and more uniﬁed account of how people search their memory, postulating a single process rather than one process for exploring a cluster and one process for switching between clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.40633282 <a title="273-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Caron, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an inﬁnite number of choice items. Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior speciﬁed by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books. 1</p><p>6 0.40174562 <a title="273-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Locating_Changes_in_Highly_Dependent_Data_with_Unknown_Number_of_Change_Points.html">203 nips-2012-Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points</a></p>

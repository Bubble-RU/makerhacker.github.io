<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: User preferences for items can be inferred from either explicit feedback, such as item ratings, or implicit feedback, such as rental histories. Research in collaborative ﬁltering has concentrated on explicit feedback, resulting in the development of accurate and scalable models. However, since explicit feedback is often difﬁcult to collect it is important to develop effective models that take advantage of the more widely available implicit feedback. We introduce a probabilistic approach to collaborative ﬁltering with implicit feedback based on modelling the user’s item selection process. In the interests of scalability, we restrict our attention to treestructured distributions over items and develop a principled and efﬁcient algorithm for learning item trees from data. We also identify a problem with a widely used protocol for evaluating implicit feedback models and propose a way of addressing it using a small quantity of explicit feedback data. 1</p><p>3 0.21986409 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_ranking_from_pair-wise_comparisons.html">165 nips-2012-Iterative ranking from pair-wise comparisons</a></p>
<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Sewoong Oh, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: The question of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR’s TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, ﬁnding ‘scores’ for each object (e.g. player’s rating) is of interest to understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with edges present between two objects if they are compared; the scores turn out to be the stationary probability of this random walk. The algorithm is model independent. To establish the efﬁcacy of our method, however, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. We bound the ﬁnite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. This, in essence, leads to order-optimal dependence on the number of samples required to learn the scores well by our algorithm. Indeed, the experimental evaluation shows that our (model independent) algorithm performs as well as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the BTL model and outperforms a recently proposed algorithm by Ammar and Shah [1]. 1</p><p>4 0.18827078 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_Sampling_for_Bipartite_Matching_Problems.html">111 nips-2012-Efficient Sampling for Bipartite Matching Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Maksims Volkovs, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Bipartite matching problems characterize many situations, ranging from ranking in information retrieval to correspondence in vision. Exact inference in realworld applications of these problems is intractable, making efﬁcient approximation methods essential for learning and inference. In this paper we propose a novel sequential matching sampler based on a generalization of the PlackettLuce model, which can effectively make large moves in the space of matchings. This allows the sampler to match the difﬁcult target distributions common in these problems: highly multimodal distributions with well separated modes. We present experimental results with bipartite matching problems—ranking and image correspondence—which show that the sequential matching sampler efﬁciently approximates the target distribution, signiﬁcantly outperforming other sampling approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.18385562 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Collaborative_Ranking_With_17_Parameters.html">75 nips-2012-Collaborative Ranking With 17 Parameters</a></p>
<p>Author: Maksims Volkovs, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: The primary application of collaborate ﬁltering (CF) is to recommend a small set of items to a user, which entails ranking. Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhood- and model-based. Our novel method is highly efﬁcient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on datasets from one item domain yield excellent results on a dataset from very different item domain, without any retraining. 1</p><p>6 0.13831508 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_ranked_data.html">60 nips-2012-Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiarong Jiang, Adam Teichert, Jason Eisner, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Users want inference to be both fast and accurate, but quality often comes at the cost of speed. The ﬁeld has experimented with approximate inference algorithms that make different speed-accuracy tradeoffs (for particular problems and datasets). We aim to explore this space automatically, focusing here on the case of agenda-based syntactic parsing [12]. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf reinforcement learning techniques fail to learn good policies: the state space is simply too large to explore naively. An attempt to counteract this by applying imitation learning algorithms also fails: the “teacher” follows a far better policy than anything in our learner’s policy space, free of the speed-accuracy tradeoff that arises when oracle information is unavailable, and thus largely insensitive to the known reward functﬁon. We propose a hybrid reinforcement/apprenticeship learning algorithm that learns to speed up an initial policy, trading off accuracy for speed according to various settings of a speed term in the loss function. 1</p><p>3 0.64288515 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Continuous_Relaxations_for_Discrete_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo.html">82 nips-2012-Continuous Relaxations for Discrete Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Amos J. Storkey, Charles A. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization, but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difﬁcult discrete systems.

Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in data clustering is to deﬁne an appropriate similarity measure between two objects. Crowdclustering addresses this challenge by deﬁning the pairwise similarity based on the manual annotations obtained through crowdsourcing. Despite its encouraging results, a key limitation of crowdclustering is that it can only cluster objects when their manual annotations are available. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach for clustering, called semi-crowdsourced clustering that effectively combines the low-level features of objects with the manual annotations of a subset of the objects obtained via crowdsourcing. The key idea is to learn an appropriate similarity measure, based on the low-level features of objects and from the manual annotations of only a small portion of the data to be clustered. One difﬁculty in learning the pairwise similarity measure is that there is a signiﬁcant amount of noise and inter-worker variations in the manual annotations obtained via crowdsourcing. We address this difﬁculty by developing a metric learning algorithm based on the matrix completion method. Our empirical study with two real-world image data sets shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art distance metric learning algorithms in both clustering accuracy and computational efﬁciency. 1</p><p>5 0.6350472 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Hamming_Distance_Metric_Learning.html">148 nips-2012-Hamming Distance Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Norouzi, David M. Blei, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by large-scale multimedia applications we propose to learn mappings from high-dimensional data to binary codes that preserve semantic similarity. Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efﬁcient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a ﬂexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classiﬁcation results using no more than kNN on the binary codes. 1</p><p>6 0.63490713 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Online_L1-Dictionary_Learning_with_Application_to_Novel_Document_Detection.html">258 nips-2012-Online L1-Dictionary Learning with Application to Novel Document Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Bruno Scherrer, Boris Lesner</p><p>Abstract: We consider inﬁnite-horizon stationary γ-discounted Markov Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. Using Value and Policy Iteration with some error at each iteration, it is well-known that one 2γ can compute stationary policies that are (1−γ)2 -optimal. After arguing that this guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy Iteration for com2γ puting non-stationary policies that can be up to 1−γ -optimal, which constitutes a signiﬁcant improvement in the usual situation when γ is close to 1. Surprisingly, this shows that the problem of “computing near-optimal non-stationary policies” is much simpler than that of “computing near-optimal stationary policies”. 1</p><p>3 0.37816751 <a title="3-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Algorithms_for_Learning_Markov_Field_Policies.html">38 nips-2012-Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies</a></p>

This new representation can easily incorporate domain knowledge in the form of a state similarity graph that loosely indicates which states are supposed to have similar optimal actions. A bias is then introduced into the policy search process by sampling policies from a distribution that assigns high probabilities to policies that agree with the provided state similarity graph, i.e. smoother policies. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We also present forward and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms for learning such policy distributions.

<p>Author: Edouard Klein, Matthieu Geist, Bilal Piot, Olivier Pietquin</p><p>Abstract: This paper adresses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward for which a demonstrated expert behavior is optimal. We introduce a new algorithm, SCIRL, whose principle is to use the so-called feature expectation of the expert as the parameterization of the score function of a multiclass classiﬁer. This approach produces a reward function for which the expert policy is provably near-optimal. Contrary to most of existing IRL algorithms, SCIRL does not require solving the direct RL problem. Moreover, with an appropriate heuristic, it can succeed with only trajectories sampled according to the expert behavior. This is illustrated on a car driving simulator. 1</p><p>5 0.28172591 <a title="3-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Learned_Prioritization_for_Trading_Off_Accuracy_and_Speed.html">173 nips-2012-Learned Prioritization for Trading Off Accuracy and Speed</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiarong Jiang, Adam Teichert, Jason Eisner, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Users want inference to be both fast and accurate, but quality often comes at the cost of speed. The ﬁeld has experimented with approximate inference algorithms that make different speed-accuracy tradeoffs (for particular problems and datasets). We aim to explore this space automatically, focusing here on the case of agenda-based syntactic parsing [12]. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf reinforcement learning techniques fail to learn good policies: the state space is simply too large to explore naively. An attempt to counteract this by applying imitation learning algorithms also fails: the “teacher” follows a far better policy than anything in our learner’s policy space, free of the speed-accuracy tradeoff that arises when oracle information is unavailable, and thus largely insensitive to the known reward functﬁon. We propose a hybrid reinforcement/apprenticeship learning algorithm that learns to speed up an initial policy, trading off accuracy for speed according to various settings of a speed term in the loss function. 1</p><p>6 0.2788485 <a title="3-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Tractable_Objectives_for_Robust_Policy_Optimization.html">348 nips-2012-Tractable Objectives for Robust Policy Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Katherine Chen, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Robust policy optimization acknowledges that risk-aversion plays a vital role in real-world decision-making. When faced with uncertainty about the effects of actions, the policy that maximizes expected utility over the unknown parameters of the system may also carry with it a risk of intolerably poor performance. One might prefer to accept lower utility in expectation in order to avoid, or reduce the likelihood of, unacceptable levels of utility under harmful parameter realizations. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty, but unlike other methods avoid making any distributional assumptions about the form of this uncertainty. Instead we focus on identifying optimization objectives for which solutions can be efﬁciently approximated. We introduce percentile measures: a very general class of objectives for robust policy optimization, which encompasses most existing approaches, including ones known to be intractable. We then introduce a broad subclass of this family for which robust policies can be approximated efﬁciently. Finally, we frame these objectives in the context of a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game and employ a no-regret algorithm to approximate an optimal policy, with computation only polynomial in the number of states and actions of the MDP. 1</p><p>6 0.77025759 <a title="3-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-Learned_Prioritization_for_Trading_Off_Accuracy_and_Speed.html">173 nips-2012-Learned Prioritization for Trading Off Accuracy and Speed</a></p>

<p>Author: Amadou Ba, Mathieu Sinn, Yannig Goude, Pascal Pompey</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes an efﬁcient online learning algorithm to track the smoothing functions of Additive Models. The key idea is to combine the linear representation of Additive Models with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlter. In order to quickly track changes in the model and put more weight on recent data, the RLS ﬁlter uses a forgetting factor which exponentially weights down observations by the order of their arrival. The tracking behaviour is further enhanced by using an adaptive forgetting factor which is updated based on the gradient of the a priori errors. Using results from Lyapunov stability theory, upper bounds for the learning rate are analyzed. The proposed algorithm is applied to 5 years of electricity load data provided by the French utility company Electricit´ de France (EDF). e Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it achieves a superior performance in terms of model tracking and prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>2 0.84654409 <a title="3-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Multi-criteria_Anomaly_Detection_using_Pareto_Depth_Analysis.html">223 nips-2012-Multi-criteria Anomaly Detection using Pareto Depth Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Ko-jen Hsiao, Kevin Xu, Jeff Calder, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying patterns in a data set that exhibit anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. In most anomaly detection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a single criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous patterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be deﬁned, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria using a linear combination of them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance, the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth analysis (PDA). PDA uses the concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of weights. The proposed PDA approach scales linearly in the number of criteria and is provably better than linear combinations of the criteria. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83241451 <a title="3-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Policy_Learning_from_Trajectory_Preference_Queries.html">3 nips-2012-A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Yao-nan Chen, Hsuan-tien Lin</p><p>Abstract: Label space dimension reduction (LSDR) is an efﬁcient and effective paradigm for multi-label classiﬁcation with many classes. Existing approaches to LSDR, such as compressive sensing and principal label space transformation, exploit only the label part of the dataset, but not the feature part. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to LSDR that considers both the label and the feature parts. The approach, called conditional principal label space transformation, is based on minimizing an upper bound of the popular Hamming loss. The minimization step of the approach can be carried out efﬁciently by a simple use of singular value decomposition. In addition, the approach can be extended to a kernelized version that allows the use of sophisticated feature combinations to assist LSDR. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach is more effective than existing ones to LSDR across many real-world datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.79979867 <a title="3-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Relax_and_Randomize_%3A_From_Value_to_Algorithms.html">293 nips-2012-Relax and Randomize : From Value to Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Ohad Shamir, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We show a principled way of deriving online learning algorithms from a minimax analysis. Various upper bounds on the minimax value, previously thought to be non-constructive, are shown to yield algorithms. This allows us to seamlessly recover known methods and to derive new ones, also capturing such “unorthodox” methods as Follow the Perturbed Leader and the R2 forecaster. Understanding the inherent complexity of the learning problem thus leads to the development of algorithms. To illustrate our approach, we present several new algorithms, including a family of randomized methods that use the idea of a “random playout”. New versions of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithms are presented, as well as methods based on the Littlestone’s dimension, efﬁcient methods for matrix completion with trace norm, and algorithms for the problems of transductive learning and prediction with static experts. 1</p><p>6 0.78756166 <a title="3-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Bayesian_active_learning_with_localized_priors_for_fast_receptive_field_characterization.html">56 nips-2012-Bayesian active learning with localized priors for fast receptive field characterization</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Schwing, Tamir Hazan, Marc Pollefeys, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: While ﬁnding the exact solution for the MAP inference problem is intractable for many real-world tasks, MAP LP relaxations have been shown to be very effective in practice. However, the most efﬁcient methods that perform block coordinate descent can get stuck in sub-optimal points as they are not globally convergent. In this work we propose to augment these algorithms with an -descent approach and present a method to efﬁciently optimize for a descent direction in the subdifferential using a margin-based formulation of the Fenchel-Young duality theorem. Furthermore, the presented approach provides a methodology to construct a primal optimal solution from its dual optimal counterpart. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of the presented approach on spin glass models and protein interaction problems and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art solvers. 1</p><p>3 0.26523945 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-MAP_Inference_in_Chains_using_Column_Generation.html">204 nips-2012-MAP Inference in Chains using Column Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Belanger, Alexandre Passos, Sebastian Riedel, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Linear chains and trees are basic building blocks in many applications of graphical models, and they admit simple exact maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms based on message passing. However, in many cases this computation is prohibitively expensive, due to quadratic dependence on variables’ domain sizes. The standard algorithms are inefﬁcient because they compute scores for hypotheses for which there is strong negative local evidence. For this reason there has been signiﬁcant previous interest in beam search and its variants; however, these methods provide only approximate results. This paper presents new exact inference algorithms based on the combination of column generation and pre-computed bounds on terms of the model’s scoring function. While we do not improve worst-case performance, our method substantially speeds real-world, typical-case inference in chains and trees. Experiments show our method to be twice as fast as exact Viterbi for Wall Street Journal part-of-speech tagging and over thirteen times faster for a joint part-of-speed and named-entity-recognition task. Our algorithm is also extendable to new techniques for approximate inference, to faster 0/1 loss oracles, and new opportunities for connections between inference and learning. We encourage further exploration of high-level reasoning about the optimization problem implicit in dynamic programs. 1</p><p>4 0.2014828 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-Feature_Clustering_for_Accelerating_Parallel_Coordinate_Descent.html">131 nips-2012-Feature Clustering for Accelerating Parallel Coordinate Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Chad Scherrer, Ambuj Tewari, Mahantesh Halappanavar, David Haglin</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale `1 -regularized loss minimization problems arise in high-dimensional applications such as compressed sensing and high-dimensional supervised learning, including classiﬁcation and regression problems. High-performance algorithms and implementations are critical to efﬁciently solving these problems. Building upon previous work on coordinate descent algorithms for `1 -regularized problems, we introduce a novel family of algorithms called block-greedy coordinate descent that includes, as special cases, several existing algorithms such as SCD, Greedy CD, Shotgun, and Thread-Greedy. We give a uniﬁed convergence analysis for the family of block-greedy algorithms. The analysis suggests that block-greedy coordinate descent can better exploit parallelism if features are clustered so that the maximum inner product between features in different blocks is small. Our theoretical convergence analysis is supported with experimental results using data from diverse real-world applications. We hope that algorithmic approaches and convergence analysis we provide will not only advance the ﬁeld, but will also encourage researchers to systematically explore the design space of algorithms for solving large-scale `1 -regularization problems. 1</p><p>5 0.15459678 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Iterative_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation.html">164 nips-2012-Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Rolfs, Bala Rajaratnam, Dominique Guillot, Ian Wong, Arian Maleki</p><p>Abstract: The 1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem has recently become a topic of great interest within the machine learning, statistics, and optimization communities as a method for producing sparse inverse covariance estimators. In this paper, a proximal gradient method (G-ISTA) for performing 1 -regularized covariance matrix estimation is presented. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, this simple proximal gradient method is found to have attractive theoretical and numerical properties. G-ISTA has a linear rate of convergence, resulting in an O(log ε) iteration complexity to reach a tolerance of ε. This paper gives eigenvalue bounds for the G-ISTA iterates, providing a closed-form linear convergence rate. The rate is shown to be closely related to the condition number of the optimal point. Numerical convergence results and timing comparisons for the proposed method are presented. G-ISTA is shown to perform very well, especially when the optimal point is well-conditioned. 1</p><p>6 0.1466465 <a title="84-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Learning_as_MAP_Inference_in_Discrete_Graphical_Models.html">186 nips-2012-Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning. They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference. Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A signiﬁcant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions on internal parameters. For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-occurring words only appear in a small number of topics. In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the underlying i.i.d. prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive deﬁnite kernel function. Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to deﬁne a DPP on probability measures. We show how to perform MAP inference with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model. 1</p><p>2 0.97237837 <a title="84-lda-2" href="./nips-2012-Learning_with_Recursive_Perceptual_Representations.html">197 nips-2012-Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Oriol Vinyals, Yangqing Jia, Li Deng, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become very popular in vision as part of state-of-the-art object recognition and other classiﬁcation tasks but require high dimensional feature spaces for good performance. Deep learning methods can ﬁnd more compact representations but current methods employ multilayer perceptrons that require solving a difﬁcult, non-convex optimization problem. We propose a deep non-linear classiﬁer whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications. The use of random projections is key to our method, as we show in the experiments section, in which we observe a consistent improvement over previous –often more complicated– methods on several vision and speech benchmarks. 1</p><p>3 0.96984828 <a title="84-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Globally_Convergent_Dual_MAP_LP_Relaxation_Solvers_using_Fenchel-Young_Margins.html">143 nips-2012-Globally Convergent Dual MAP LP Relaxation Solvers using Fenchel-Young Margins</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Schwing, Tamir Hazan, Marc Pollefeys, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: While ﬁnding the exact solution for the MAP inference problem is intractable for many real-world tasks, MAP LP relaxations have been shown to be very effective in practice. However, the most efﬁcient methods that perform block coordinate descent can get stuck in sub-optimal points as they are not globally convergent. In this work we propose to augment these algorithms with an -descent approach and present a method to efﬁciently optimize for a descent direction in the subdifferential using a margin-based formulation of the Fenchel-Young duality theorem. Furthermore, the presented approach provides a methodology to construct a primal optimal solution from its dual optimal counterpart. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of the presented approach on spin glass models and protein interaction problems and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art solvers. 1</p><p>4 0.96769732 <a title="84-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">229 nips-2012-Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitish Srivastava, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: A Deep Boltzmann Machine is described for learning a generative model of data that consists of multiple and diverse input modalities. The model can be used to extract a uniﬁed representation that fuses modalities together. We ﬁnd that this representation is useful for classiﬁcation and information retrieval tasks. The model works by learning a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs. It uses states of latent variables as representations of the input. The model can extract this representation even when some modalities are absent by sampling from the conditional distribution over them and ﬁlling them in. Our experimental results on bi-modal data consisting of images and text show that the Multimodal DBM can learn a good generative model of the joint space of image and text inputs that is useful for information retrieval from both unimodal and multimodal queries. We further demonstrate that this model signiﬁcantly outperforms SVMs and LDA on discriminative tasks. Finally, we compare our model to other deep learning methods, including autoencoders and deep belief networks, and show that it achieves noticeable gains. 1</p><p>5 0.96496242 <a title="84-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Dual-Space_Analysis_of_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">104 nips-2012-Dual-Space Analysis of the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: Sparse linear (or generalized linear) models combine a standard likelihood function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefﬁcients. These priors can conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with different variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefﬁcients, while an empirical Bayesian alternative (Type II) ﬁrst marginalizes the coefﬁcients and then maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior approximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space framework from [22], which allows both the Type I or Type II objectives to be expressed in either coefﬁcient or hyperparmeter space. This perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to development in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data ﬁt. As this parameter is effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to solve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefﬁcient-space techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful recovering sparse coefﬁcients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties (RIP) lead to failure of popular ℓ1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable integrations. 1</p><p>6 0.96181732 <a title="84-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Provable_ICA_with_Unknown_Gaussian_Noise%2C_with_Implications_for_Gaussian_Mixtures_and_Autoencoders.html">281 nips-2012-Provable ICA with Unknown Gaussian Noise, with Implications for Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders</a></p>

<p>Author: Mathieu Sinn, Bei Chen</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Markov Chains (also known as Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields in the literature) are a versatile class of discriminative models for the distribution of a sequence of hidden states conditional on a sequence of observable variables. Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been ﬁrst studied in [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: ﬁrst, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identiﬁability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given. 1</p><p>4 0.28479746 <a title="324-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Nonparametric_Conjugate_Prior_Distribution_for_the_Maximizing_Argument_of_a_Noisy_Function.html">13 nips-2012-A Nonparametric Conjugate Prior Distribution for the Maximizing Argument of a Noisy Function</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro Ortega, Jordi Grau-moya, Tim Genewein, David Balduzzi, Daniel Braun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve ﬁnding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of ﬁrst, doing inference over the function space and second, ﬁnding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior based on a kernel regressor. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function. Given t observations of the function, the posterior can be evaluated efﬁciently in time O(t2 ) up to a multiplicative constant. Finally, we show how to apply our model to optimize a noisy, non-convex, high-dimensional objective function.</p><p>5 0.2838532 <a title="324-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-Optimal_Regularized_Dual_Averaging_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization.html">263 nips-2012-Optimal Regularized Dual Averaging Methods for Stochastic Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Chen, Qihang Lin, Javier Pena</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic optimization problems where both the loss function and regularizer can be non-smooth. We develop a novel algorithm based on the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates for both convex and strongly convex loss. In particular, for strongly convex loss, it achieves the opti1 1 mal rate of O( N + N 2 ) for N iterations, which improves the rate O( log N ) for preN vious regularized dual averaging algorithms. In addition, our method constructs the ﬁnal solution directly from the proximal mapping instead of averaging of all previous iterates. For widely used sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., 1 -norm), it has the advantage of encouraging sparser solutions. We further develop a multistage extension using the proposed algorithm as a subroutine, which achieves the 1 uniformly-optimal rate O( N + exp{−N }) for strongly convex loss. 1</p><p>6 0.26736119 <a title="324-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Relax_and_Randomize_%3A_From_Value_to_Algorithms.html">293 nips-2012-Relax and Randomize : From Value to Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Ohad Shamir, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We show a principled way of deriving online learning algorithms from a minimax analysis. Various upper bounds on the minimax value, previously thought to be non-constructive, are shown to yield algorithms. This allows us to seamlessly recover known methods and to derive new ones, also capturing such “unorthodox” methods as Follow the Perturbed Leader and the R2 forecaster. Understanding the inherent complexity of the learning problem thus leads to the development of algorithms. To illustrate our approach, we present several new algorithms, including a family of randomized methods that use the idea of a “random playout”. New versions of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithms are presented, as well as methods based on the Littlestone’s dimension, efﬁcient methods for matrix completion with trace norm, and algorithms for the problems of transductive learning and prediction with static experts. 1</p><p>4 0.70498079 <a title="324-lsi-4" href="./nips-2012-Regularized_Off-Policy_TD-Learning.html">292 nips-2012-Regularized Off-Policy TD-Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Liu, Sridhar Mahadevan, Ji Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel l1 regularized off-policy convergent TD-learning method (termed RO-TD), which is able to learn sparse representations of value functions with low computational complexity. The algorithmic framework underlying ROTD integrates two key ideas: off-policy convergent gradient TD methods, such as TDC, and a convex-concave saddle-point formulation of non-smooth convex optimization, which enables ﬁrst-order solvers and feature selection using online convex regularization. A detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of RO-TD is presented. A variety of experiments are presented to illustrate the off-policy convergence, sparse feature selection capability and low computational cost of the RO-TD algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.68833745 <a title="324-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-Selective_Labeling_via_Error_Bound_Minimization.html">305 nips-2012-Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang, Jiawei Han, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.63394171 <a title="324-lsi-6" href="./nips-2012-No-Regret_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Online_Convex_Optimization.html">241 nips-2012-No-Regret Algorithms for Unconstrained Online Convex Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Tivadar Papai, Henry Kautz, Daniel Stefankovic</p><p>Abstract: Markov logic is a widely used tool in statistical relational learning, which uses a weighted ﬁrst-order logic knowledge base to specify a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). In many applications, a Markov logic network (MLN) is trained in one domain, but used in a different one. This paper focuses on dynamic Markov logic networks, where the size of the discretized time-domain typically varies between training and testing. It has been previously pointed out that the marginal probabilities of truth assignments to ground atoms can change if one extends or reduces the domains of predicates in an MLN. We show that in addition to this problem, the standard way of unrolling a Markov logic theory into a MRF may result in time-inhomogeneity of the underlying Markov chain. Furthermore, even if these representational problems are not signiﬁcant for a given domain, we show that the more practical problem of generating samples in a sequential conditional random ﬁeld for the next slice relying on the samples from the previous slice has high computational cost in the general case, due to the need to estimate a normalization factor for each sample. We propose a new discriminative model, slice normalized dynamic Markov logic networks (SN-DMLN), that suffers from none of these issues. It supports efﬁcient online inference, and can directly model inﬂuences between variables within a time slice that do not have a causal direction, in contrast with fully directed models (e.g., DBNs). Experimental results show an improvement in accuracy over previous approaches to online inference in dynamic Markov logic networks. 1</p><p>3 0.94051605 <a title="324-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Confusion-Based_Online_Learning_and_a_Passive-Aggressive_Scheme.html">80 nips-2012-Confusion-Based Online Learning and a Passive-Aggressive Scheme</a></p>
<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides the ﬁrst —to the best of our knowledge— analysis of online learning algorithms for multiclass problems when the confusion matrix is taken as a performance measure. The work builds upon recent and elegant results on noncommutative concentration inequalities, i.e. concentration inequalities that apply to matrices, and, more precisely, to matrix martingales. We do establish generalization bounds for online learning algorithms and show how the theoretical study motivates the proposition of a new confusion-friendly learning procedure. This learning algorithm, called COPA (for COnfusion Passive-Aggressive) is a passive-aggressive learning algorithm; it is shown that the update equations for COPA can be computed analytically and, henceforth, there is no need to recourse to any optimization package to implement it. 1</p><p>4 0.93123454 <a title="324-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Ensemble_weighted_kernel_estimators_for_multivariate_entropy_estimation.html">117 nips-2012-Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kumar Sricharan, Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: The problem of estimation of entropy functionals of probability densities has received much attention in the information theory, machine learning and statistics communities. Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, for large feature dimension d, kernel plug-in estimators suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality: the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order O(T −γ/d ), where T is the number of samples, and γ > 0 is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for suﬃciently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order O(T −1 ). Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed oﬄine. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates. 1</p><p>5 0.93017513 <a title="324-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-Spectral_learning_of_linear_dynamics_from_generalised-linear_observations_with_application_to_neural_population_data.html">321 nips-2012-Spectral learning of linear dynamics from generalised-linear observations with application to neural population data</a></p>
<p>Author: Lars Buesing, Maneesh Sahani, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for instance when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons. Here, we show how spectral learning methods (usually called subspace identiﬁcation in this context) for linear systems with linear-Gaussian observations can be extended to estimate the parameters of a generalised-linear dynamical system model despite a non-linear and non-Gaussian observation process. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended subspace identiﬁcation algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with a single calculation, avoiding the costly iterative computation of approximate expectation-maximisation (EM). Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialisation for EM, avoiding local optima and speeding convergence. These beneﬁts are shown to extend to real neural data.</p><p>6 0.9269734 <a title="324-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Calibrated_Elastic_Regularization_in_Matrix_Completion.html">64 nips-2012-Calibrated Elastic Regularization in Matrix Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Zohar Karnin</p><p>Abstract: We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classiﬁcation formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classiﬁcation problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known. 1</p><p>3 0.13566548 <a title="332-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2012-Factorial_LDA%3A_Sparse_Multi-Dimensional_Text_Models.html">124 nips-2012-Factorial LDA: Sparse Multi-Dimensional Text Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Paul, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models can be enriched with a multi-dimensional structure to consider the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional model in which a document is inﬂuenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientiﬁc discipline, and focus (methods vs. applications). Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors. 1</p><p>4 0.1054127 <a title="332-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2012-A_Neural_Autoregressive_Topic_Model.html">12 nips-2012-A Neural Autoregressive Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hugo Larochelle, Stanislas Lauly</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new model for learning meaningful representations of text documents from an unlabeled collection of documents. This model is inspired by the recently proposed Replicated Softmax, an undirected graphical model of word counts that was shown to learn a better generative model and more meaningful document representations. Speciﬁcally, we take inspiration from the conditional mean-ﬁeld recursive equations of the Replicated Softmax in order to deﬁne a neural network architecture that estimates the probability of observing a new word in a given document given the previously observed words. This paradigm also allows us to replace the expensive softmax distribution over words with a hierarchical distribution over paths in a binary tree of words. The end result is a model whose training complexity scales logarithmically with the vocabulary size instead of linearly as in the Replicated Softmax. Our experiments show that our model is competitive both as a generative model of documents and as a document representation learning algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.09348876 <a title="332-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Spectral_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">19 nips-2012-A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Yi-kai Liu, Daniel J. Hsu, Dean P. Foster, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: Topic modeling is a generalization of clustering that posits that observations (words in a document) are generated by multiple latent factors (topics), as opposed to just one. This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic-word distributions when only words are observed, and the topics are hidden. This work provides a simple and efﬁcient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of topic models, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic-word distributions and the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over the topic mixtures, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, called Excess Correlation Analysis, is based on a spectral decomposition of low-order moments via two singular value decompositions (SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable, since the SVDs are carried out only on k × k matrices, where k is the number of latent factors (topics) and is typically much smaller than the dimension of the observation (word) space. 1</p><p>6 0.074755803 <a title="332-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2012-Online_L1-Dictionary_Learning_with_Application_to_Novel_Document_Detection.html">258 nips-2012-Online L1-Dictionary Learning with Application to Novel Document Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Bryant, Erik B. Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: Variational methods provide a computationally scalable alternative to Monte Carlo methods for large-scale, Bayesian nonparametric learning. In practice, however, conventional batch and online variational methods quickly become trapped in local optima. In this paper, we consider a nonparametric topic model based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and develop a novel online variational inference algorithm based on split-merge topic updates. We derive a simpler and faster variational approximation of the HDP, and show that by intelligently splitting and merging components of the variational posterior, we can achieve substantially better predictions of test data than conventional online and batch variational algorithms. For streaming analysis of large datasets where batch analysis is infeasible, we show that our split-merge updates better capture the nonparametric properties of the underlying model, allowing continual learning of new topics.</p><p>5 0.6416446 <a title="332-lsi-5" href="./nips-2012-A_Spectral_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">19 nips-2012-A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Bryan Russell, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we seek to detect rectangular cuboids and localize their corners in uncalibrated single-view images depicting everyday scenes. In contrast to recent approaches that rely on detecting vanishing points of the scene and grouping line segments to form cuboids, we build a discriminative parts-based detector that models the appearance of the cuboid corners and internal edges while enforcing consistency to a 3D cuboid model. Our model copes with different 3D viewpoints and aspect ratios and is able to detect cuboids across many different object categories. We introduce a database of images with cuboid annotations that spans a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and show qualitative and quantitative results on our collected database. Our model out-performs baseline detectors that use 2D constraints alone on the task of localizing cuboid corners. 1</p><p>3 0.40638471 <a title="332-lda-3" href="./nips-2012-Learning_visual_motion_in_recurrent_neural_networks.html">195 nips-2012-Learning visual motion in recurrent neural networks</a></p>

Trained on sequences of images, the model learns to represent different movement directions in different variables. We use an online approximate inference scheme that can be mapped to the dynamics of networks of neurons. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars of light, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. Most model neurons also show speed tuning and respond equally well to a range of motion directions and speeds aligned to the constraint line of their respective preferred speed. We show how these computations are enabled by a speciﬁc pattern of recurrent connections learned by the model. 1</p><p>4 0.39036286 <a title="332-lda-4" href="./nips-2012-Efficient_high_dimensional_maximum_entropy_modeling_via_symmetric_partition_functions.html">115 nips-2012-Efficient high dimensional maximum entropy modeling via symmetric partition functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Vernaza, Drew Bagnell</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling is a popular choice for sequence analysis in applications such as natural language processing, where the sequences are embedded in discrete, tractably-sized spaces. We consider the problem of applying MaxEnt to distributions over paths in continuous spaces of high dimensionality— a problem for which inference is generally intractable. Our main contribution is to show that this intractability can be avoided as long as the constrained features possess a certain kind of low dimensional structure. In this case, we show that the associated partition function is symmetric and that this symmetry can be exploited to compute the partition function efﬁciently in a compressed form. Empirical results are given showing an application of our method to learning models of high-dimensional human motion capture data. 1</p><p>5 0.36269909 <a title="332-lda-5" href="./nips-2012-FastEx%3A_Hash_Clustering_with_Exponential_Families.html">126 nips-2012-FastEx: Hash Clustering with Exponential Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Amr Ahmed, Sujith Ravi, Alex J. Smola, Shravan M. Narayanamurthy</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is a key component in any data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters. 1</p><p>6 0.36149845 <a title="332-lda-6" href="./nips-2012-Small-Variance_Asymptotics_for_Exponential_Family_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models.html">316 nips-2012-Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></p>

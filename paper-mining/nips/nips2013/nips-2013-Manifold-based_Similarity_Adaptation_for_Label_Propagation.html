<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>3 0.054148093 <a title="182-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Latent_Structured_Active_Learning.html">149 nips-2013-Latent Structured Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenjie Luo, Alex Schwing, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present active learning algorithms in the context of structured prediction problems. To reduce the amount of labeling necessary to learn good models, our algorithms operate with weakly labeled data and we query additional examples based on entropies of local marginals, which are a good surrogate for uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of 3D layout prediction from single images, and show that good models are learned when labeling only a handful of random variables. In particular, the same performance as using the full training set can be obtained while only labeling ∼10% of the random variables. 1</p><p>4 0.047209132 <a title="182-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_the_Harmonic_Structure_in_Graph-Based_Learning.html">35 nips-2013-Analyzing the Harmonic Structure in Graph-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Ming Wu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: We ﬁnd that various well-known graph-based models exhibit a common important harmonic structure in its target function – the value of a vertex is approximately the weighted average of the values of its adjacent neighbors. Understanding of such structure and analysis of the loss deﬁned over such structure help reveal important properties of the target function over a graph. In this paper, we show that the variation of the target function across a cut can be upper and lower bounded by the ratio of its harmonic loss and the cut cost. We use this to develop an analytical tool and analyze ﬁve popular graph-based models: absorbing random walks, partially absorbing random walks, hitting times, pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian, and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. Our analysis sheds new insights into several open questions related to these models, and provides theoretical justiﬁcations and guidelines for their practical use. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets conﬁrm the potential of the proposed theory and tool.</p><p>5 0.046974339 <a title="182-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_for_low_rank_spatiotemporal_neural_receptive_fields.html">53 nips-2013-Bayesian inference for low rank spatiotemporal neural receptive fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Mijung Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: The receptive ﬁeld (RF) of a sensory neuron describes how the neuron integrates sensory stimuli over time and space. In typical experiments with naturalistic or ﬂickering spatiotemporal stimuli, RFs are very high-dimensional, due to the large number of coefﬁcients needed to specify an integration proﬁle across time and space. Estimating these coefﬁcients from small amounts of data poses a variety of challenging statistical and computational problems. Here we address these challenges by developing Bayesian reduced rank regression methods for RF estimation. This corresponds to modeling the RF as a sum of space-time separable (i.e., rank-1) ﬁlters. This approach substantially reduces the number of parameters needed to specify the RF, from 1K-10K down to mere 100s in the examples we consider, and confers substantial beneﬁts in statistical power and computational efﬁciency. We introduce a novel prior over low-rank RFs using the restriction of a matrix normal prior to the manifold of low-rank matrices, and use “localized” row and column covariances to obtain sparse, smooth, localized estimates of the spatial and temporal RF components. We develop two methods for inference in the resulting hierarchical model: (1) a fully Bayesian method using blocked-Gibbs sampling; and (2) a fast, approximate method that employs alternating ascent of conditional marginal likelihoods. We develop these methods for Gaussian and Poisson noise models, and show that low-rank estimates substantially outperform full rank estimates using neural data from retina and V1. 1</p><p>6 0.046789948 <a title="182-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Third-Order_Edge_Statistics%3A_Contour_Continuation%2C_Curvature%2C_and_Cortical_Connections.html">329 nips-2013-Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Hein, Simon Setzer, Leonardo Jost, Syama Sundar Rangapuram</p><p>Abstract: Hypergraphs allow one to encode higher-order relationships in data and are thus a very ﬂexible modeling tool. Current learning methods are either based on approximations of the hypergraphs via graphs or on tensor methods which are only applicable under special conditions. In this paper, we present a new learning framework on hypergraphs which fully uses the hypergraph structure. The key element is a family of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs. 1</p><p>4 0.57561868 <a title="182-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>
<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>5 0.554896 <a title="182-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-%CE%A3-Optimality_for_Active_Learning_on_Gaussian_Random_Fields.html">359 nips-2013-Σ-Optimality for Active Learning on Gaussian Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifei Ma, Roman Garnett, Jeff Schneider</p><p>Abstract: A common classiﬁer for unlabeled nodes on undirected graphs uses label propagation from the labeled nodes, equivalent to the harmonic predictor on Gaussian random ﬁelds (GRFs). For active learning on GRFs, the commonly used V-optimality criterion queries nodes that reduce the L2 (regression) loss. V-optimality satisﬁes a submodularity property showing that greedy reduction produces a (1 − 1/e) globally optimal solution. However, L2 loss may not characterise the true nature of 0/1 loss in classiﬁcation problems and thus may not be the best choice for active learning. We consider a new criterion we call Σ-optimality, which queries the node that minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance. Σ-optimality directly optimizes the risk of the surveying problem, which is to determine the proportion of nodes belonging to one class. In this paper we extend submodularity guarantees from V-optimality to Σ-optimality using properties speciﬁc to GRFs. We further show that GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition in addition to the conditional independence inherited from Markov random ﬁelds. We test Σoptimality on real-world graphs with both synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.549986 <a title="182-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Density_estimation_from_unweighted_k-nearest_neighbor_graphs%3A_a_roadmap.html">87 nips-2013-Density estimation from unweighted k-nearest neighbor graphs: a roadmap</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative ﬁltering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks signiﬁcantly outperforming the traditional approach. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66977346 <a title="182-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Manifold-based_Similarity_Adaptation_for_Label_Propagation.html">182 nips-2013-Manifold-based Similarity Adaptation for Label Propagation</a></p>

Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach both in synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.65829968 <a title="182-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Gradient_Riemannian_Langevin_Dynamics_on_the_Probability_Simplex.html">312 nips-2013-Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics on the Probability Simplex</a></p>
<p>Author: Sam Patterson, Yee Whye Teh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of Langevin Monte Carlo methods on the probability simplex and propose a new method, Stochastic gradient Riemannian Langevin dynamics, which is simple to implement and can be applied to large scale data. We apply this method to latent Dirichlet allocation in an online minibatch setting, and demonstrate that it achieves substantial performance improvements over the state of the art online variational Bayesian methods. 1</p><p>4 0.63917214 <a title="182-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Reservoir_Boosting_%3A_Between_Online_and_Offline_Ensemble_Learning.html">275 nips-2013-Reservoir Boosting : Between Online and Offline Ensemble Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, François Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: We propose to train an ensemble with the help of a reservoir in which the learning algorithm can store a limited number of samples. This novel approach lies in the area between ofﬂine and online ensemble approaches and can be seen either as a restriction of the former or an enhancement of the latter. We identify some basic strategies that can be used to populate this reservoir and present our main contribution, dubbed Greedy Edge Expectation Maximization (GEEM), that maintains the reservoir content in the case of Boosting by viewing the samples through their projections into the weak classiﬁer response space. We propose an efﬁcient algorithmic implementation which makes it tractable in practice, and demonstrate its efﬁciency experimentally on several compute-vision data-sets, on which it outperforms both online and ofﬂine methods in a memory constrained setting. 1</p><p>5 0.63116288 <a title="182-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Mixture_Modelling_and_Inference_based_Thompson_Sampling_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search.html">50 nips-2013-Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Aijun Bai, Feng Wu, Xiaoping Chen</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been drawing great interest in recent years for planning and learning under uncertainty. One of the key challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this, we present a novel approach for MCTS using Bayesian mixture modeling and inference based Thompson sampling and apply it to the problem of online planning in MDPs. Our algorithm, named Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS), models the uncertainty of the accumulated reward for actions in the search tree as a mixture of Normal distributions. We perform inferences on the mixture in Bayesian settings by choosing conjugate priors in the form of combinations of Dirichlet and NormalGamma distributions and select the best action at each decision node using Thompson sampling. Experimental results conﬁrm that our algorithm advances the state-of-the-art UCT approach with better values on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>6 0.57487363 <a title="182-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Robust_PCA_via_Stochastic_Optimization.html">233 nips-2013-Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></p>

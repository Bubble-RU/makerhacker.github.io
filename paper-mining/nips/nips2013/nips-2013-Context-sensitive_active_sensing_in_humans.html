Yu</p><p>Abstract: Humans and animals readily utilize active sensing, or the use of self-motion, to focus sensory and cognitive resources on the behaviorally most relevant stimuli and events in the environment. Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artiﬁcial systems. Recently, we proposed a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, C-DAC (ContextDependent Active Controller) (Ahmad & Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We ﬁnd that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better ﬁt to human data than Infomax (Butko & Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving signiﬁcant computational savings. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2013-69-reference" href="../nips2013_reference/nips-2013-Context-sensitive_active_sensing_in_humans_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Stefan Mathe, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human eye movements provide a rich source of information into the human visual information processing. The complex interplay between the task and the visual stimulus is believed to determine human eye movements, yet it is not fully understood, making it difﬁcult to develop reliable eye movement prediction systems. Our work makes three contributions towards addressing this problem. First, we complement one of the largest and most challenging static computer vision datasets, VOC 2012 Actions, with human eye movement recordings collected under the primary task constraint of action recognition, as well as, separately, for context recognition, in order to analyze the impact of different tasks. Our dataset is unique among the eyetracking datasets of still images in terms of large scale (over 1 million ﬁxations recorded in 9157 images) and different task controls. Second, we propose Markov models to automatically discover areas of interest (AOI) and introduce novel sequential consistency metrics based on them. Our methods can automatically determine the number, the spatial support and the transitions between AOIs, in addition to their locations. Based on such encodings, we quantitatively show that given unconstrained read-world stimuli, task instructions have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the human visual search patterns and are stable across subjects. Finally, we leverage powerful machine learning techniques and computer vision features in order to learn task-sensitive reward functions from eye movement data within models that allow to effectively predict the human visual search patterns based on inverse optimal control. The methodology achieves state of the art scanpath modeling results. 1</p><p>3 0.19413894 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Optimal_Neural_Population_Codes_for_High-dimensional_Stimulus_Variables.html">236 nips-2013-Optimal Neural Population Codes for High-dimensional Stimulus Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuo Wang, Alan Stocker, Daniel Lee</p><p>Abstract: In many neural systems, information about stimulus variables is often represented in a distributed manner by means of a population code. It is generally assumed that the responses of the neural population are tuned to the stimulus statistics, and most prior work has investigated the optimal tuning characteristics of one or a small number of stimulus variables. In this work, we investigate the optimal tuning for diffeomorphic representations of high-dimensional stimuli. We analytically derive the solution that minimizes the L2 reconstruction loss. We compared our solution with other well-known criteria such as maximal mutual information. Our solution suggests that the optimal weights do not necessarily decorrelate the inputs, and the optimal nonlinearity differs from the conventional equalization solution. Results illustrating these optimal representations are shown for some input distributions that may be relevant for understanding the coding of perceptual pathways. 1</p><p>4 0.17150934 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimizing_Instructional_Policies.html">241 nips-2013-Optimizing Instructional Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Lindsey, Michael Mozer, William J. Huggins, Harold Pashler</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists are interested in developing instructional policies that boost student learning. An instructional policy speciﬁes the manner and content of instruction. For example, in the domain of concept learning, a policy might specify the nature of exemplars chosen over a training sequence. Traditional psychological studies compare several hand-selected policies, e.g., contrasting a policy that selects only diﬃcult-to-classify exemplars with a policy that gradually progresses over the training sequence from easy exemplars to more diﬃcult (known as fading). We propose an alternative to the traditional methodology in which we deﬁne a parameterized space of policies and search this space to identify the optimal policy. For example, in concept learning, policies might be described by a fading function that speciﬁes exemplar diﬃculty over time. We propose an experimental technique for searching policy spaces using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization and a generative model of student performance. Instead of evaluating a few experimental conditions each with many human subjects, as the traditional methodology does, our technique evaluates many experimental conditions each with a few subjects. Even though individual subjects provide only a noisy estimate of the population mean, the optimization method allows us to determine the shape of the policy space and to identify the global optimum, and is as eﬃcient in its subject budget as a traditional A-B comparison. We evaluate the method via two behavioral studies, and suggest that the method has broad applicability to optimization problems involving humans outside the educational arena. 1</p><p>5 0.15686868 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_policy_iteration_and_natural_actor-critic%3A_A_unifying_view_and_a_non-optimality_result.html">239 nips-2013-Optimistic policy iteration and natural actor-critic: A unifying view and a non-optimality result</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem are often categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. As our ﬁrst main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD(λ)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of softgreedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward an optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations (either in state estimation or in value function representation), the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality. 1</p><p>6 0.1509652 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Forgetful_Bayes_and_myopic_planning%3A_Human_learning_and_decision-making_in_a_bandit_setting.html">124 nips-2013-Forgetful Bayes and myopic planning: Human learning and decision-making in a bandit setting</a></p>

<p>Author: Matjaz Jogan, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: How do humans perceive the speed of a coherent motion stimulus that contains motion energy in multiple spatiotemporal frequency bands? Here we tested the idea that perceived speed is the result of an integration process that optimally combines speed information across independent spatiotemporal frequency channels. We formalized this hypothesis with a Bayesian observer model that combines the likelihood functions provided by the individual channel responses (cues). We experimentally validated the model with a 2AFC speed discrimination experiment that measured subjects’ perceived speed of drifting sinusoidal gratings with different contrasts and spatial frequencies, and of various combinations of these single gratings. We found that the perceived speeds of the combined stimuli are independent of the relative phase of the underlying grating components. The results also show that the discrimination thresholds are smaller for the combined stimuli than for the individual grating components, supporting the cue combination hypothesis. The proposed Bayesian model ﬁts the data well, accounting for the full psychometric functions of both simple and combined stimuli. Fits are improved if we assume that the channel responses are subject to divisive normalization. Our results provide an important step toward a more complete model of visual motion perception that can predict perceived speeds for coherent motion stimuli of arbitrary spatial structure. 1</p><p>4 0.58077353 <a title="69-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimizing_Instructional_Policies.html">241 nips-2013-Optimizing Instructional Policies</a></p>

<p>Author: Nataliya Shapovalova, Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a weakly-supervised structured learning approach for recognition and spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. As part of the proposed approach, we develop a generalization of the Max-Path search algorithm which allows us to efﬁciently search over a structured space of multiple spatio-temporal paths while also incorporating context information into the model. Instead of using spatial annotations in the form of bounding boxes to guide the latent model during training, we utilize human gaze data in the form of a weak supervisory signal. This is achieved by incorporating eye gaze, along with the classiﬁcation, into the structured loss within the latent SVM learning framework. Experiments on a challenging benchmark dataset, UCF-Sports, show that our model is more accurate, in terms of classiﬁcation, and achieves state-of-the-art results in localization. In addition, our model can produce top-down saliency maps conditioned on the classiﬁcation label and localized latent paths. 1</p><p>6 0.56308752 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Mapping_paradigm_ontologies_to_and_from_the_brain.html">183 nips-2013-Mapping paradigm ontologies to and from the brain</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinwoo Shin, Andrew E. Gelfand, Misha Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: Max-product ‘belief propagation’ (BP) is a popular distributed heuristic for ﬁnding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint probability distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It was recently shown that BP converges to the correct MAP assignment for a class of loopy GMs with the following common feature: the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation to the MAP problem is tight (has no integrality gap). Unfortunately, tightness of the LP relaxation does not, in general, guarantee convergence and correctness of the BP algorithm. The failure of BP in such cases motivates reverse engineering a solution – namely, given a tight LP, can we design a ‘good’ BP algorithm. In this paper, we design a BP algorithm for the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem over general graphs. We prove that the algorithm converges to the correct optimum if the respective LP relaxation, which may include inequalities associated with non-intersecting odd-sized cycles, is tight. The most signiﬁcant part of our approach is the introduction of a novel graph transformation designed to force convergence of BP. Our theoretical result suggests an efﬁcient BP-based heuristic for the MWM problem, which consists of making sequential, “cutting plane”, modiﬁcations to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this heuristic performs as well as traditional cutting-plane algorithms using LP solvers on MWM problems. 1</p><p>2 0.81612825 <a title="69-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Latent_Maximum_Margin_Clustering.html">148 nips-2013-Latent Maximum Margin Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang-Tong Zhou, Tian Lan, Arash Vahdat, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We present a maximum margin framework that clusters data using latent variables. Using latent representations enables our framework to model unobserved information embedded in the data. We implement our idea by large margin learning, and develop an alternating descent algorithm to effectively solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. We instantiate our latent maximum margin clustering framework with tag-based video clustering tasks, where each video is represented by a latent tag model describing the presence or absence of video tags. Experimental results obtained on three standard datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-latent maximum margin clustering as well as conventional clustering approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.79496193 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Context-sensitive_active_sensing_in_humans.html">69 nips-2013-Context-sensitive active sensing in humans</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheeraz Ahmad, He Huang, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Humans and animals readily utilize active sensing, or the use of self-motion, to focus sensory and cognitive resources on the behaviorally most relevant stimuli and events in the environment. Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artiﬁcial systems. Recently, we proposed a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, C-DAC (ContextDependent Active Controller) (Ahmad & Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We ﬁnd that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better ﬁt to human data than Infomax (Butko & Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving signiﬁcant computational savings. 1</p><p>4 0.76407057 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Submodular_Optimization_with_Submodular_Cover_and_Submodular_Knapsack_Constraints.html">319 nips-2013-Submodular Optimization with Submodular Cover and Submodular Knapsack Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate two new optimization problems — minimizing a submodular function subject to a submodular lower bound constraint (submodular cover) and maximizing a submodular function subject to a submodular upper bound constraint (submodular knapsack). We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 25] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.76223379 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Third-Order_Edge_Statistics%3A_Contour_Continuation%2C_Curvature%2C_and_Cortical_Connections.html">329 nips-2013-Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Lawlor, Steven W. Zucker</p><p>Abstract: Association ﬁeld models have attempted to explain human contour grouping performance, and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections across cortical columns in V1. However, association ﬁelds only depend on the pairwise statistics of edges in natural scenes. We develop a spectral test of the sufﬁciency of pairwise statistics and show there is signiﬁcant higher order structure. An analysis using a probabilistic spectral embedding reveals curvature-dependent components. 1</p><p>6 0.67656606 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_policy_iteration_and_natural_actor-critic%3A_A_unifying_view_and_a_non-optimality_result.html">239 nips-2013-Optimistic policy iteration and natural actor-critic: A unifying view and a non-optimality result</a></p>

<p>Author: Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a tensor from a set of linear measurements. A prominent methodology for this problem is based on a generalization of trace norm regularization, which has been used extensively for learning low rank matrices, to the tensor setting. In this paper, we highlight some limitations of this approach and propose an alternative convex relaxation on the Euclidean ball. We then describe a technique to solve the associated regularization problem, which builds upon the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on one synthetic dataset and two real datasets indicate that the proposed method improves signiﬁcantly over tensor trace norm regularization in terms of estimation error, while remaining computationally tractable. 1</p><p>3 0.35937601 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Simultaneous_Rectification_and_Alignment_via_Robust_Recovery_of_Low-rank_Tensors.html">295 nips-2013-Simultaneous Rectification and Alignment via Robust Recovery of Low-rank Tensors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoqin Zhang, Di Wang, Zhengyuan Zhou, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a general method for recovering low-rank three-order tensors, in which the data can be deformed by some unknown transformation and corrupted by arbitrary sparse errors. Since the unfolding matrices of a tensor are interdependent, we introduce auxiliary variables and relax the hard equality constraints by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. To improve the computational efﬁciency, we introduce a proximal gradient step to the alternating direction minimization method. We have provided proof for the convergence of the linearized version of the problem which is the inner loop of the overall algorithm. Both simulations and experiments show that our methods are more efﬁcient and effective than previous work. The proposed method can be easily applied to simultaneously rectify and align multiple images or videos frames. In this context, the state-of-the-art algorithms “RASL” and “TILT” can be viewed as two special cases of our work, and yet each only performs part of the function of our method.</p><p>4 0.35917851 <a title="203-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Tensor_Decomposition_via_Structured_Schatten_Norm_Regularization.html">74 nips-2013-Convex Tensor Decomposition via Structured Schatten Norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: We study a new class of structured Schatten norms for tensors that includes two recently proposed norms (“overlapped” and “latent”) for convex-optimizationbased tensor decomposition. We analyze the performance of “latent” approach for tensor decomposition, which was empirically found to perform better than the “overlapped” approach in some settings. We show theoretically that this is indeed the case. In particular, when the unknown true tensor is low-rank in a speciﬁc unknown mode, this approach performs as well as knowing the mode with the smallest rank. Along the way, we show a novel duality result for structured Schatten norms, which is also interesting in the general context of structured sparsity. We conﬁrm through numerical simulations that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour of the mean squared error. 1</p><p>5 0.34460002 <a title="203-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Pairwise_Interaction_Tensors.html">113 nips-2013-Exact and Stable Recovery of Pairwise Interaction Tensors</a></p>
<p>Author: Shouyuan Chen, Michael R. Lyu, Irwin King, Zenglin Xu</p><p>Abstract: Tensor completion from incomplete observations is a problem of signiﬁcant practical interest. However, it is unlikely that there exists an efﬁcient algorithm with provable guarantee to recover a general tensor from a limited number of observations. In this paper, we study the recovery algorithm for pairwise interaction tensors, which has recently gained considerable attention for modeling multiple attribute data due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Speciﬁcally, in the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a pairwise interaction tensor by solving a constrained convex program which minimizes the weighted sum of nuclear norms of matrices from O(nr log2 (n)) observations. For the noisy cases, we also prove error bounds for a constrained convex program for recovering the tensors. Our experiments on the synthetic dataset demonstrate that the recovery performance of our algorithm agrees well with the theory. In addition, we apply our algorithm on a temporal collaborative ﬁltering task and obtain state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>6 0.33681241 <a title="203-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Hidden_Markov_Models_from_Non-sequence_Data_via_Tensor_Decomposition.html">155 nips-2013-Learning Hidden Markov Models from Non-sequence Data via Tensor Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Miaomiao Zhang, P.T. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: Principal geodesic analysis (PGA) is a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of data on a Riemannian manifold. Currently PGA is deﬁned as a geometric ﬁt to the data, rather than as a probabilistic model. Inspired by probabilistic PCA, we present a latent variable model for PGA that provides a probabilistic framework for factor analysis on manifolds. To compute maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in our model, we develop a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm, where the expectation is approximated by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the latent variables. We demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the ground truth parameters in simulated sphere data, as well as its effectiveness in analyzing shape variability of a corpus callosum data set from human brain images. 1</p><p>3 0.61106437 <a title="203-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>

It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>4 0.56065297 <a title="203-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Contrastive_Learning_Using_Spectral_Methods.html">70 nips-2013-Contrastive Learning Using Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: James Y. Zou, Daniel Hsu, David C. Parkes, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In many natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes speciﬁc to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components speciﬁc to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.54666847 <a title="203-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Predictive_PAC_Learning_and_Process_Decompositions.html">252 nips-2013-Predictive PAC Learning and Process Decompositions</a></p>
<p>Author: Cosma Shalizi, Aryeh Kontorovitch</p><p>Abstract: We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with ﬁnite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This deﬁnition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular (β-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest. 1</p><p>6 0.5014652 <a title="203-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Speeding_up_Permutation_Testing_in_Neuroimaging.html">306 nips-2013-Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging</a></p>

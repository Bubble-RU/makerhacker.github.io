<p>Author: Daniel L. Yamins, Ha Hong, Charles Cadieu, James J. DiCarlo</p><p>Abstract: Humans recognize visually-presented objects rapidly and accurately. To understand this ability, we seek to construct models of the ventral stream, the series of cortical areas thought to subserve object recognition. One tool to assess the quality of a model of the ventral stream is the Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM), which uses a set of visual stimuli and measures the distances produced in either the brain (i.e. fMRI voxel responses, neural ﬁring rates) or in models (features). Previous work has shown that all known models of the ventral stream fail to capture the RDM pattern observed in either IT cortex, the highest ventral area, or in the human ventral stream. In this work, we construct models of the ventral stream using a novel optimization procedure for category-level object recognition problems, and produce RDMs resembling both macaque IT and human ventral stream. The model, while novel in the optimization procedure, further develops a long-standing functional hypothesis that the ventral visual stream is a hierarchically arranged series of processing stages optimized for visual object recognition. 1</p><p>3 0.13361588 <a title="183-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Visual_Concept_Learning%3A_Combining_Machine_Vision_and_Bayesian_Generalization_on_Concept_Hierarchies.html">349 nips-2013-Visual Concept Learning: Combining Machine Vision and Bayesian Generalization on Concept Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Joshua T. Abbott, Joseph Austerweil, Thomas Griffiths, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Learning a visual concept from a small number of positive examples is a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Current methods typically fail to ﬁnd the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classiﬁers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a signiﬁcant advantage results from combining visual classiﬁers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization. 1</p><p>4 0.13160934 <a title="183-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Auditing%3A_Active_Learning_with_Outcome-Dependent_Query_Costs.html">42 nips-2013-Auditing: Active Learning with Outcome-Dependent Query Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivan Sabato, Anand D. Sarwate, Nati Srebro</p><p>Abstract: We propose a learning setting in which unlabeled data is free, and the cost of a label depends on its value, which is not known in advance. We study binary classiﬁcation in an extreme case, where the algorithm only pays for negative labels. Our motivation are applications such as fraud detection, in which investigating an honest transaction should be avoided if possible. We term the setting auditing, and consider the auditing complexity of an algorithm: the number of negative labels the algorithm requires in order to learn a hypothesis with low relative error. We design auditing algorithms for simple hypothesis classes (thresholds and rectangles), and show that with these algorithms, the auditing complexity can be signiﬁcantly lower than the active label complexity. We also show a general competitive approach for learning with outcome-dependent costs. 1</p><p>5 0.12773623 <a title="183-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Speeding_up_Permutation_Testing_in_Neuroimaging.html">306 nips-2013-Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Hinrichs, Vamsi Ithapu, Qinyuan Sun, Sterling C. Johnson, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing is a signiﬁcant problem in nearly all neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known Bonferroni correction method, while simple to implement, is quite conservative, and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact, non-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given α-threshold, but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive. In this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating the columns of a very large matrix P. By analyzing the spectrum of this matrix, under certain conditions, we see that P has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly sub–sampled — on the order of 0.5% — matrix completion methods. Based on this observation, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which offers a large speedup, without sacriﬁcing the ﬁdelity of the estimated FWER. Our evaluations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a computational speedup factor of roughly 50× can be achieved while recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show that the estimated α-threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is stable. 1</p><p>6 0.12551557 <a title="183-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Optimal_integration_of_visual_speed_across_different_spatiotemporal_frequency_channels.html">237 nips-2013-Optimal integration of visual speed across different spatiotemporal frequency channels</a></p>

<p>Author: Matjaz Jogan, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: How do humans perceive the speed of a coherent motion stimulus that contains motion energy in multiple spatiotemporal frequency bands? Here we tested the idea that perceived speed is the result of an integration process that optimally combines speed information across independent spatiotemporal frequency channels. We formalized this hypothesis with a Bayesian observer model that combines the likelihood functions provided by the individual channel responses (cues). We experimentally validated the model with a 2AFC speed discrimination experiment that measured subjects’ perceived speed of drifting sinusoidal gratings with different contrasts and spatial frequencies, and of various combinations of these single gratings. We found that the perceived speeds of the combined stimuli are independent of the relative phase of the underlying grating components. The results also show that the discrimination thresholds are smaller for the combined stimuli than for the individual grating components, supporting the cue combination hypothesis. The proposed Bayesian model ﬁts the data well, accounting for the full psychometric functions of both simple and combined stimuli. Fits are improved if we assume that the channel responses are subject to divisive normalization. Our results provide an important step toward a more complete model of visual motion perception that can predict perceived speeds for coherent motion stimuli of arbitrary spatial structure. 1</p><p>3 0.77104205 <a title="183-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Hierarchical_Modular_Optimization_of_Convolutional_Networks_Achieves_Representations_Similar_to_Macaque_IT_and_Human_Ventral_Stream.html">136 nips-2013-Hierarchical Modular Optimization of Convolutional Networks Achieves Representations Similar to Macaque IT and Human Ventral Stream</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Mathe, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human eye movements provide a rich source of information into the human visual information processing. The complex interplay between the task and the visual stimulus is believed to determine human eye movements, yet it is not fully understood, making it difﬁcult to develop reliable eye movement prediction systems. Our work makes three contributions towards addressing this problem. First, we complement one of the largest and most challenging static computer vision datasets, VOC 2012 Actions, with human eye movement recordings collected under the primary task constraint of action recognition, as well as, separately, for context recognition, in order to analyze the impact of different tasks. Our dataset is unique among the eyetracking datasets of still images in terms of large scale (over 1 million ﬁxations recorded in 9157 images) and different task controls. Second, we propose Markov models to automatically discover areas of interest (AOI) and introduce novel sequential consistency metrics based on them. Our methods can automatically determine the number, the spatial support and the transitions between AOIs, in addition to their locations. Based on such encodings, we quantitatively show that given unconstrained read-world stimuli, task instructions have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the human visual search patterns and are stable across subjects. Finally, we leverage powerful machine learning techniques and computer vision features in order to learn task-sensitive reward functions from eye movement data within models that allow to effectively predict the human visual search patterns based on inverse optimal control. The methodology achieves state of the art scanpath modeling results. 1</p><p>5 0.67575866 <a title="183-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Visual_Concept_Learning%3A_Combining_Machine_Vision_and_Bayesian_Generalization_on_Concept_Hierarchies.html">349 nips-2013-Visual Concept Learning: Combining Machine Vision and Bayesian Generalization on Concept Hierarchies</a></p>

<p>Author: Yannick Schwartz, Bertrand Thirion, Gael Varoquaux</p><p>Abstract: Imaging neuroscience links brain activation maps to behavior and cognition via correlational studies. Due to the nature of the individual experiments, based on eliciting neural response from a small number of stimuli, this link is incomplete, and unidirectional from the causal point of view. To come to conclusions on the function implied by the activation of brain regions, it is necessary to combine a wide exploration of the various brain functions and some inversion of the statistical inference. Here we introduce a methodology for accumulating knowledge towards a bidirectional link between observed brain activity and the corresponding function. We rely on a large corpus of imaging studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to ﬁnd commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus. The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus. To our knowledge, our approach is the ﬁrst demonstration of predicting the cognitive content of completely new brain images. To that end, we propose a method that predicts the experimental paradigms across different studies. 1</p><p>2 0.98059529 <a title="183-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Solving_the_multi-way_matching_problem_by_permutation_synchronization.html">300 nips-2013-Solving the multi-way matching problem by permutation synchronization</a></p>
<p>Author: Deepti Pachauri, Risi Kondor, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The problem of matching not just two, but m different sets of objects to each other arises in many contexts, including ﬁnding the correspondence between feature points across multiple images in computer vision. At present it is usually solved by matching the sets pairwise, in series. In contrast, we propose a new method, Permutation Synchronization, which ﬁnds all the matchings jointly, in one shot, via a relaxation to eigenvector decomposition. The resulting algorithm is both computationally efﬁcient, and, as we demonstrate with theoretical arguments as well as experimental results, much more stable to noise than previous methods. 1</p><p>3 0.97737896 <a title="183-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Summary_Statistics_for_Partitionings_and_Feature_Allocations.html">320 nips-2013-Summary Statistics for Partitionings and Feature Allocations</a></p>
<p>Author: Isik B. Fidaner, Taylan Cemgil</p><p>Abstract: Inﬁnite mixture models are commonly used for clustering. One can sample from the posterior of mixture assignments by Monte Carlo methods or ﬁnd its maximum a posteriori solution by optimization. However, in some problems the posterior is diffuse and it is hard to interpret the sampled partitionings. In this paper, we introduce novel statistics based on block sizes for representing sample sets of partitionings and feature allocations. We develop an element-based deﬁnition of entropy to quantify segmentation among their elements. Then we propose a simple algorithm called entropy agglomeration (EA) to summarize and visualize this information. Experiments on various inﬁnite mixture posteriors as well as a feature allocation dataset demonstrate that the proposed statistics are useful in practice.</p><p>4 0.97548652 <a title="183-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_factorization_with_binary_components.html">186 nips-2013-Matrix factorization with binary components</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein, Pavlo Lutsik</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application in computational biology, we consider low-rank matrix factorization with {0, 1}-constraints on one of the factors and optionally convex constraints on the second one. In addition to the non-convexity shared with other matrix factorization schemes, our problem is further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size 2m·r , where m is the dimension of the data points and r the rank of the factorization. Despite apparent intractability, we provide − in the line of recent work on non-negative matrix factorization by Arora et al. (2012)− an algorithm that provably recovers the underlying factorization in the exact case with O(mr2r + mnr + r2 n) operations for n datapoints. To obtain this result, we use theory around the Littlewood-Offord lemma from combinatorics.</p><p>5 0.97309595 <a title="183-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multisensory_Encoding%2C_Decoding%2C_and_Identification.html">205 nips-2013-Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurel A. Lazar, Yevgeniy Slutskiy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive ﬁelds in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identiﬁcation of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identiﬁed. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identiﬁcation algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.96017104 <a title="183-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Accelerated_Mini-Batch_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">19 nips-2013-Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>

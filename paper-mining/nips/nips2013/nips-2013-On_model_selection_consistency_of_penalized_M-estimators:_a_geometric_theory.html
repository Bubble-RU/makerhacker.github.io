<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: In the high-dimensional regression model a response variable is linearly related to p covariates, but the sample size n is smaller than p. We assume that only a small subset of covariates is ‘active’ (i.e., the corresponding coefﬁcients are non-zero), and consider the model-selection problem of identifying the active covariates. A popular approach is to estimate the regression coefﬁcients through the Lasso ( 1 -regularized least squares). This is known to correctly identify the active set only if the irrelevant covariates are roughly orthogonal to the relevant ones, as quantiﬁed through the so called ‘irrepresentability’ condition. In this paper we study the ‘Gauss-Lasso’ selector, a simple two-stage method that ﬁrst solves the Lasso, and then performs ordinary least squares restricted to the Lasso active set. We formulate ‘generalized irrepresentability condition’ (GIC), an assumption that is substantially weaker than irrepresentability. We prove that, under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso correctly recovers the active set. 1</p><p>3 0.29254064 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Murat A. Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector θ0 ∈ Rp from noisy linear observations y = Xθ0 + w ∈ Rn (p > n) and the popular estimation procedure of solving the 1 -penalized least squares objective known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). In this context, we develop new estimators for the 2 estimation risk θ − θ0 2 and the variance of the noise when distributions of θ0 and w are unknown. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein’s unbiased risk estimate [Ste81] and the recent results of [BM12a][BM12b] on the analysis of approximate message passing and the risk of LASSO. We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices X of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on a certain conjecture from statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the ﬁrst that provides an asymptotically consistent risk estimator for the LASSO solely based on data. In addition, we demonstrate through simulations that our variance estimation outperforms several existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>4 0.28276929 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-A_Comparative_Framework_for_Preconditioned_Lasso_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2013-A Comparative Framework for Preconditioned Lasso Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Nebojsa Jojic, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The Lasso is a cornerstone of modern multivariate data analysis, yet its performance suffers in the common situation in which covariates are correlated. This limitation has led to a growing number of Preconditioned Lasso algorithms that pre-multiply X and y by matrices PX , Py prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difﬁcult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter λ. In this paper we propose an agnostic framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose λ. We apply our framework to three Preconditioned Lasso instances and highlight cases when they will outperform the Lasso. Additionally, our theory reveals fragilities of these algorithms to which we provide partial solutions. 1</p><p>5 0.23283283 <a title="219-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Dirty_Statistical_Models.html">91 nips-2013-Dirty Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We provide a uniﬁed framework for the high-dimensional analysis of “superposition-structured” or “dirty” statistical models: where the model parameters are a superposition of structurally constrained parameters. We allow for any number and types of structures, and any statistical model. We consider the general class of M -estimators that minimize the sum of any loss function, and an instance of what we call a “hybrid” regularization, that is the inﬁmal convolution of weighted regularization functions, one for each structural component. We provide corollaries showcasing our uniﬁed framework for varied statistical models such as linear regression, multiple regression and principal component analysis, over varied superposition structures. 1</p><p>6 0.21307343 <a title="219-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Overlapping_Sets_Lasso_for_Multitask_Learning_and_its_Application_to_fMRI_Analysis.html">303 nips-2013-Sparse Overlapping Sets Lasso for Multitask Learning and its Application to fMRI Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikhil Rao, Christopher Cox, Rob Nowak, Timothy T. Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Multitask learning can be effective when features useful in one task are also useful for other tasks, and the group lasso is a standard method for selecting a common subset of features. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of multitask learning, wherein (1) the available features can be organized into subsets according to a notion of similarity and (2) features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the features best suited for other tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks. Error bounds are derived for SOSlasso and its consistency is established for squared error loss. In particular, SOSlasso is motivated by multisubject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classiﬁed using brain voxels as features. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOSlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso. 1</p><p>3 0.82247585 <a title="219-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition.html">194 nips-2013-Model Selection for High-Dimensional Regression under the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition</a></p>

<p>Author: Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Amin Karbasi, Rik Sarkar, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many large-scale machine learning problems (such as clustering, non-parametric learning, kernel machines, etc.) require selecting, out of a massive data set, a manageable yet representative subset. Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set function subject to cardinality constraints. Classical approaches require centralized access to the full data set; but for truly large-scale problems, rendering the data centrally is often impractical. In this paper, we consider the problem of submodular function maximization in a distributed fashion. We develop a simple, two-stage protocol G REE D I, that is easily implemented using MapReduce style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and show, that under certain natural conditions, performance close to the (impractical) centralized approach can be achieved. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, including sparse Gaussian process inference and exemplar-based clustering, on tens of millions of data points using Hadoop. 1</p><p>4 0.85904813 <a title="219-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-A_Novel_Two-Step_Method_for_Cross_Language_Representation_Learning.html">12 nips-2013-A Novel Two-Step Method for Cross Language Representation Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xiao, Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross language text classiﬁcation is an important learning task in natural language processing. A critical challenge of cross language learning arises from the fact that words of different languages are in disjoint feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a two-step representation learning method to bridge the feature spaces of different languages by exploiting a set of parallel bilingual documents. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst formulate a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix for all documents in two languages, and then induce a low dimensional cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing on the obtained matrix. We use a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the formulated matrix completion problem with convergence guarantees. The proposed method is evaluated by conducting a set of experiments with cross language sentiment classiﬁcation tasks on Amazon product reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning method outperforms a number of other cross language representation learning methods, especially when the number of parallel bilingual documents is small. 1</p><p>5 0.85278773 <a title="219-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-When_in_Doubt%2C_SWAP%3A_High-Dimensional_Sparse_Recovery_from_Correlated_Measurements.html">354 nips-2013-When in Doubt, SWAP: High-Dimensional Sparse Recovery from Correlated Measurements</a></p>
<p>Author: Divyanshu Vats, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately estimating a high-dimensional sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that standard computationally tractable sparse recovery algorithms, such as the Lasso, OMP, and their various extensions, perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. We develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until a desired loss function cannot be decreased any further. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. We prove that SWAP can easily be used as a wrapper around standard sparse recovery algorithms for improved performance. We theoretically quantify the statistical guarantees of SWAP and complement our analysis with numerical results on synthetic and real data.</p><p>6 0.84538913 <a title="219-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Reflection_methods_for_user-friendly_submodular_optimization.html">268 nips-2013-Reflection methods for user-friendly submodular optimization</a></p>

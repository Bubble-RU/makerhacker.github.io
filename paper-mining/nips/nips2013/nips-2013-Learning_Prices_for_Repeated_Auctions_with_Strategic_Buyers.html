<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the design of strategies for market making in an exchange. A market maker generally seeks to proﬁt from the difference between the buy and sell price of an asset, yet the market maker also takes exposure risk in the event of large price movements. Proﬁt guarantees for market making strategies have typically required certain stochastic assumptions on the price ﬂuctuations of the asset in question; for example, assuming a model in which the price process is mean reverting. We propose a class of “spread-based” market making strategies whose performance can be controlled even under worst-case (adversarial) settings. We prove structural properties of these strategies which allows us to design a master algorithm which obtains low regret relative to the best such strategy in hindsight. We run a set of experiments showing favorable performance on recent real-world stock price data. 1</p><p>3 0.21266347 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-How_to_Hedge_an_Option_Against_an_Adversary%3A_Black-Scholes_Pricing_is_Minimax_Optimal.html">139 nips-2013-How to Hedge an Option Against an Adversary: Black-Scholes Pricing is Minimax Optimal</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Peter Bartlett, Rafael Frongillo, Andre Wibisono</p><p>Abstract: We consider a popular problem in ﬁnance, option pricing, through the lens of an online learning game between Nature and an Investor. In the Black-Scholes option pricing model from 1973, the Investor can continuously hedge the risk of an option by trading the underlying asset, assuming that the asset’s price ﬂuctuates according to Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). We consider a worst-case model, in which Nature chooses a sequence of price ﬂuctuations under a cumulative quadratic volatility constraint, and the Investor can make a sequence of hedging decisions. Our main result is to show that the value of our proposed game, which is the “regret” of hedging strategy, converges to the Black-Scholes option price. We use signiﬁcantly weaker assumptions than previous work—for instance, we allow large jumps in the asset price—and show that the Black-Scholes hedging strategy is near-optimal for the Investor even in this non-stochastic framework. 1</p><p>4 0.20330623 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Estimation_Bias_in_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Algorithms_for_Search_Advertising.html">112 nips-2013-Estimation Bias in Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms for Search Advertising</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xu, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: In search advertising, the search engine needs to select the most proﬁtable advertisements to display, which can be formulated as an instance of online learning with partial feedback, also known as the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. In this paper, we show that the naive application of MAB algorithms to search advertising for advertisement selection will produce sample selection bias that harms the search engine by decreasing expected revenue and “estimation of the largest mean” (ELM) bias that harms the advertisers by increasing game-theoretic player-regret. We then propose simple bias-correction methods with beneﬁts to both the search engine and the advertisers. 1</p><p>5 0.14295372 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>
<p>Author: Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir [14]. Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph (which must be accessible before selecting an action). In the undirected case, we show that the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>6 0.11574022 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen</p><p>Abstract: Performance guarantees for online learning algorithms typically take the form of regret bounds, which express that the cumulative loss overhead compared to the best expert in hindsight is small. In the common case of large but structured expert sets we typically wish to keep the regret especially small compared to simple experts, at the cost of modest additional overhead compared to more complex others. We study which such regret trade-offs can be achieved, and how. We analyse regret w.r.t. each individual expert as a multi-objective criterion in the simple but fundamental case of absolute loss. We characterise the achievable and Pareto optimal trade-offs, and the corresponding optimal strategies for each sample size both exactly for each ﬁnite horizon and asymptotically. 1</p><p>6 0.30921176 <a title="159-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Data-Driven_Dynamic_Programming.html">280 nips-2013-Robust Data-Driven Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanshuai Cao, Marcus A. Brubaker, David Fleet, Aaron Hertzmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-ofart performance in discrete cases and competitive results in the continuous case. 1</p><p>3 0.56605405 <a title="159-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimation_Bias_in_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Algorithms_for_Search_Advertising.html">112 nips-2013-Estimation Bias in Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms for Search Advertising</a></p>

<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi, Peter Bartlett, Varun Kanade, Yevgeny Seldin, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a mixing assumption, achieves p O( T log |⇧| + log |⇧|) regret with respect to a comparison set of policies ⇧. The regret is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When expectations over sample paths can be computed efﬁciently and the comparison set ⇧ has polynomial size, this algorithm is efﬁcient. We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path problem. Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identiﬁed start and ﬁnish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to ﬁnish node. At the end of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges) is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to a ﬁxed policy for selecting paths. This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, the problem can be efﬁciently solved. We show that it also can be efﬁciently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses. When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efﬁcient algorithms for the adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a notoriously difﬁcult problem that has been used to design efﬁcient cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.54277116 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Ofer Dekel, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We study the power of different types of adaptive (nonoblivious) adversaries in the setting of prediction with expert advice, under both full-information and bandit feedback. We measure the player’s performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary’s adaptiveness to the player’s behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize —in a nearly complete manner— the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switch� ing costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is Θ(T 2/3 ). Interestingly, this √ rate is signiﬁcantly worse than the Θ( T ) rate attainable with switching costs in the full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also � show that a bounded memory adversary can force Θ(T 2/3 ) regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a new stochastic adversary strategy that generates loss processes with strong dependencies. 1</p><p>6 0.54003084 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_learning_in_episodic_Markovian_decision_processes_by_relative_entropy_policy_search.html">235 nips-2013-Online learning in episodic Markovian decision processes by relative entropy policy search</a></p>

<p>Author: Yichao Lu, Paramveer Dhillon, Dean P. Foster, Lyle Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast algorithm for ridge regression when the number of features is much larger than the number of observations (p n). The standard way to solve ridge regression in this setting works in the dual space and gives a running time of O(n2 p). Our algorithm Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform- Dual Ridge Regression (SRHT-DRR) runs in time O(np log(n)) and works by preconditioning the design matrix by a Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform with a subsequent subsampling of features. We provide risk bounds for our SRHT-DRR algorithm in the ﬁxed design setting and show experimental results on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.10341864 <a title="209-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-A_Comparative_Framework_for_Preconditioned_Lasso_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2013-A Comparative Framework for Preconditioned Lasso Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Nebojsa Jojic, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The Lasso is a cornerstone of modern multivariate data analysis, yet its performance suffers in the common situation in which covariates are correlated. This limitation has led to a growing number of Preconditioned Lasso algorithms that pre-multiply X and y by matrices PX , Py prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difﬁcult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter λ. In this paper we propose an agnostic framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose λ. We apply our framework to three Preconditioned Lasso instances and highlight cases when they will outperform the Lasso. Additionally, our theory reveals fragilities of these algorithms to which we provide partial solutions. 1</p><p>4 0.090488955 <a title="209-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Synthesizing_Robust_Plans_under_Incomplete_Domain_Models.html">323 nips-2013-Synthesizing Robust Plans under Incomplete Domain Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tuan A. Nguyen, Subbarao Kambhampati, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: Most current planners assume complete domain models and focus on generating correct plans. Unfortunately, domain modeling is a laborious and error-prone task, thus real world agents have to plan with incomplete domain models. While domain experts cannot guarantee completeness, often they are able to circumscribe the incompleteness of the model by providing annotations as to which parts of the domain model may be incomplete. In such cases, the goal should be to synthesize plans that are robust with respect to any known incompleteness of the domain. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce annotations expressing the knowledge of the domain incompleteness and formalize the notion of plan robustness with respect to an incomplete domain model. We then show an approach to compiling the problem of ﬁnding robust plans to the conformant probabilistic planning problem, and present experimental results with Probabilistic-FF planner. 1</p><p>5 0.079224482 <a title="209-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality.html">96 nips-2013-Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, Jeff Dean</p><p>Abstract: The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efﬁcient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain signiﬁcant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of “Canada” and “Air” cannot be easily combined to obtain “Air Canada”. Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for ﬁnding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.</p><p>6 0.072426066 <a title="209-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Speeding_up_Permutation_Testing_in_Neuroimaging.html">306 nips-2013-Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging</a></p>

<p>Author: Lee H. Dicker, Dean P. Foster</p><p>Abstract: We model a “one-shot learning” situation, where very few observations y1 , ..., yn ∈ R are available. Associated with each observation yi is a very highdimensional vector xi ∈ Rd , which provides context for yi and enables us to predict subsequent observations, given their own context. One of the salient features of our analysis is that the problems studied here are easier when the dimension of xi is large; in other words, prediction becomes easier when more context is provided. The proposed methodology is a variant of principal component regression (PCR). Our rigorous analysis sheds new light on PCR. For instance, we show that classical PCR estimators may be inconsistent in the speciﬁed setting, unless they are multiplied by a scalar c > 1; that is, unless the classical estimator is expanded. This expansion phenomenon appears to be somewhat novel and contrasts with shrinkage methods (c < 1), which are far more common in big data analyses. 1</p><p>4 0.5791198 <a title="209-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Murat A. Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector θ0 ∈ Rp from noisy linear observations y = Xθ0 + w ∈ Rn (p > n) and the popular estimation procedure of solving the 1 -penalized least squares objective known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). In this context, we develop new estimators for the 2 estimation risk θ − θ0 2 and the variance of the noise when distributions of θ0 and w are unknown. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein’s unbiased risk estimate [Ste81] and the recent results of [BM12a][BM12b] on the analysis of approximate message passing and the risk of LASSO. We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices X of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on a certain conjecture from statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the ﬁrst that provides an asymptotically consistent risk estimator for the LASSO solely based on data. In addition, we demonstrate through simulations that our variance estimation outperforms several existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>5 0.53632504 <a title="209-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation_with_Calibration.html">302 nips-2013-Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation with Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method for estimating sparse precision matrix of high dimensional elliptical distribution. The proposed method calibrates regularizations when estimating each column of the precision matrix. Thus it not only is asymptotically tuning free, but also achieves an improved ﬁnite sample performance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method achieves the parametric rates of convergence in both parameter estimation and model selection. We present numerical results on both simulated and real datasets to support our theory and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator. 1</p><p>6 0.52741498 <a title="209-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition.html">194 nips-2013-Model Selection for High-Dimensional Regression under the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Albers, Maren Westkott, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: Recent extensions of the Perceptron as the Tempotron and the Chronotron suggest that this theoretical concept is highly relevant for understanding networks of spiking neurons in the brain. It is not known, however, how the computational power of the Perceptron might be accomplished by the plasticity mechanisms of real synapses. Here we prove that spike-timing-dependent plasticity having an anti-Hebbian form for excitatory synapses as well as a spike-timing-dependent plasticity of Hebbian shape for inhibitory synapses are sufﬁcient for realizing the original Perceptron Learning Rule if these respective plasticity mechanisms act in concert with the hyperpolarisation of the post-synaptic neurons. We also show that with these simple yet biologically realistic dynamics Tempotrons and Chronotrons are learned. The proposed mechanism enables incremental associative learning from a continuous stream of patterns and might therefore underly the acquisition of long term memories in cortex. Our results underline that learning processes in realistic networks of spiking neurons depend crucially on the interactions of synaptic plasticity mechanisms with the dynamics of participating neurons.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.56958055 <a title="209-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-New_Subsampling_Algorithms_for_Fast_Least_Squares_Regression.html">209 nips-2013-New Subsampling Algorithms for Fast Least Squares Regression</a></p>

Choromanski, Tony Jebara, Kui Tang</p><p>Abstract: The adaptive anonymity problem is formalized where each individual shares their data along with an integer value to indicate their personal level of desired privacy. This problem leads to a generalization of k-anonymity to the b-matching setting. Novel algorithms and theory are provided to implement this type of anonymity. The relaxation achieves better utility, admits theoretical privacy guarantees that are as strong, and, most importantly, accommodates a variable level of anonymity for each individual. Empirical results conﬁrm improved utility on benchmark and social data-sets.</p><p>4 0.50576144 <a title="209-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Direct_0-1_Loss_Minimization_and_Margin_Maximization_with_Boosting.html">90 nips-2013-Direct 0-1 Loss Minimization and Margin Maximization with Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaodan Zhai, Tian Xia, Ming Tan, Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a boosting method, DirectBoost, a greedy coordinate descent algorithm that builds an ensemble classiﬁer of weak classiﬁers through directly minimizing empirical classiﬁcation error over labeled training examples; once the training classiﬁcation error is reduced to a local coordinatewise minimum, DirectBoost runs a greedy coordinate ascent algorithm that continuously adds weak classiﬁers to maximize any targeted arbitrarily deﬁned margins until reaching a local coordinatewise maximum of the margins in a certain sense. Experimental results on a collection of machine-learning benchmark datasets show that DirectBoost gives better results than AdaBoost, LogitBoost, LPBoost with column generation and BrownBoost, and is noise tolerant when it maximizes an n′ th order bottom sample margin. 1</p><p>5 0.39085492 <a title="209-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Least_Informative_Dimensions.html">173 nips-2013-Least Informative Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>6 0.38944954 <a title="209-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Documents_as_multiple_overlapping_windows_into_grids_of_counts.html">98 nips-2013-Documents as multiple overlapping windows into grids of counts</a></p>

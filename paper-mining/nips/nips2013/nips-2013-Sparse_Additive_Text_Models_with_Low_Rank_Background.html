<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by a two-level theory from political science that uniﬁes agenda setting and ideological framing, we propose supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (S H L DA), which jointly captures documents’ multi-level topic structure and their polar response variables. Our model extends the nested Chinese restaurant processes to discover tree-structured topic hierarchies and uses both per-topic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters to model response variables. S H L DA improves prediction on political afﬁliation and sentiment tasks in addition to providing insight into how topics under discussion are framed. 1 Introduction: Agenda Setting and Framing in Hierarchical Models How do liberal-leaning bloggers talk about immigration in the US? What do conservative politicians have to say about education? How do Fox News and MSNBC differ in their language about the gun debate? Such questions concern not only what, but how things are talked about. In political communication, the question of “what” falls under the heading of agenda setting theory, which concerns the issues introduced into political discourse (e.g., by the mass media) and their inﬂuence over public priorities [1]. The question of “how” concerns framing: the way the presentation of an issue reﬂects or encourages a particular perspective or interpretation [2]. For example, the rise of the “innocence frame” in the death penalty debate, emphasizing the irreversible consequence of mistaken convictions, has led to a sharp decline in the use of capital punishment in the US [3]. In its concern with the subjects or issues under discussion in political discourse, agenda setting maps neatly to topic modeling [4] as a means of discovering and characterizing those issues [5]. Interestingly, one line of communication theory seeks to unify agenda setting and framing by viewing frames as a second-level kind of agenda [1]: just as agenda setting is about which objects of discussion are salient, framing is about the salience of attributes of those objects. The key is that what communications theorists consider an attribute in a discussion can itself be an object, as well. For example, “mistaken convictions” is one attribute of the death penalty discussion, but it can also be viewed as an object of discussion in its own right. This two-level view leads naturally to the idea of using a hierarchical topic model to formalize both agendas and frames within a uniform setting. In this paper, we introduce a new model to do exactly that. The model is predictive: it represents the idea of alternative or competing perspectives via a continuous-valued response variable. Although inspired by the study of political discourse, associating texts with “perspectives” is more general and has been studied in sentiment analysis, discovery of regional variation, and value-sensitive design. We show experimentally that the model’s hierarchical structure improves prediction of perspective in both a political domain and on sentiment analysis tasks, and we argue that the topic hierarchies exposed by the model are indeed capturing structure in line with the theory that motivated the work. 1 ߨ ݉ ߠௗ ߙ ߰ௗ ߛ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫ݖ‬ௗ௦௡ ‫ݓ‬ௗ௦௡ ܿௗ௧ ܰௗ௦ ∞ ߩ ܵௗ ‫ݕ‬ௗ ‫ܦ‬ ߱ ߟ௞ ߬௩ ܸ 1.

Words w are explained by topic hierarchy φ, and response variables y are explained by per-topic regression coefﬁcients η and global lexical coefﬁcients τ . 2 S H L DA: Combining Supervision and Hierarchical Topic Structure Jointly capturing supervision and hierarchical topic structure falls under a class of models called supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation. These models take as input a set of D documents, each of which is associated with a response variable yd , and output a hierarchy of topics which is informed by yd . Zhang et al. [6] introduce the S H L DA family, focusing on a categorical response. In contrast, our novel model (which we call S H L DA for brevity), uses continuous responses. At its core, S H L DA’s document generative process resembles a combination of hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation [7, HLDA] and the hierarchical Dirichlet process [8, HDP]. HLDA uses the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP(γ)), combined with an appropriate base distribution, to induce an unbounded tree-structured hierarchy of topics: general topics at the top, speciﬁc at the bottom. A document is generated by traversing this tree, at each level creating a new child (hence a new path) with probability proportional to γ or otherwise respecting the “rich-get-richer” property of a CRP. A drawback of HLDA, however, is that each document is restricted to only a single path in the tree. Recent work relaxes this restriction through different priors: nested HDP [9], nested Chinese franchises [10] or recursive CRPs [11]. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing documents to have multiple paths through the tree by leveraging information at the sentence level using the twolevel structure used in HDP. More speciﬁcally, in the HDP’s Chinese restaurant franchise metaphor, customers (i.e., tokens) are grouped by sitting at tables and each table takes a dish (i.e., topic) from a ﬂat global menu. In our S H L DA, dishes are organized in a tree-structured global menu by using the nCRP as prior. Each path in the tree is a collection of L dishes (one for each level) and is called a combo. S H L DA groups sentences of a document by assigning them to tables and associates each table with a combo, and thus, models each document as a distribution over combos.1 In S H L DA’s metaphor, customers come in a restaurant and sit at a table in groups, where each group is a sentence. A sentence wd,s enters restaurant d and selects a table t (and its associated combo) with probability proportional to the number of sentences Sd,t at that table; or, it sits at a new table with probability proportional to α. After choosing the table (indexed by td,s ), if the table is new, the group will select a combo of dishes (i.e., a path, indexed by cd,t ) from the tree menu. Once a combo is in place, each token in the sentence chooses a “level” (indexed by zd,s,n ) in the combo, which speciﬁes the topic (φkd,s,n ≡ φcd,td,s ,zd,s,n ) producing the associated observation (Figure 2). S H L DA also draws on supervised LDA [12, SLDA] associating each document d with an observable continuous response variable yd that represents the author’s perspective toward a topic, e.g., positive vs. negative sentiment, conservative vs. liberal ideology, etc. This lets us infer a multi-level topic structure informed by how topics are “framed” with respect to positions along the yd continuum. 1 We emphasize that, unlike in HDP where each table is assigned to a single dish, each table in our metaphor is associated with a combo–a collection of L dishes. We also use combo and path interchangeably. 2 Sd Sd,t ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ dish ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ߶ଵଶ 			ߟଵଶ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ ߶ଵଵଶ 		ߟଵଵଶ ߶ଵଶଵ 		ߟଵଶଵ ߶ଵଶଶ 		ߟଵଶଶ table ܿௗ௧ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫3=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଵ ‫3=ݏ 2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ݀=1 ݇ௗ௦௡ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଶ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬஽ ݀=2 ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ ݀=‫ܦ‬ customer group (token) (sentence) restaurant (document) ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ݀=1 ‫1=ݏ‬ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ combo (path) Nd,s Nd,·,l Nd,·,>l Nd,·,≥l Mc,l Cc,l,v Cd,x,l,v φk ηk τv cd,t td,s zd,s,n kd,s,n L C+ Figure 2: S H L DA’s restaurant franchise metaphor. # sentences in document d # groups (i.e. sentences) sitting at table t in restaurant d # tokens wd,s # tokens in wd assigned to level l # tokens in wd assigned to level > l ≡ Nd,·,l + Nd,·,>l # tables at level l on path c # word type v assigned to level l on path c # word type v in vd,x assigned to level l Topic at node k Regression parameter at node k Regression parameter of word type v Path assignment for table t in restaurant d Table assignment for group wd,s Level assignment for wd,s,n Node assignment for wd,s,n (i.e., node at level zd,s,n on path cd,td,s ) Height of the tree Set of all possible paths (including new ones) of the tree Table 1: Notation used in this paper Unlike SLDA, we model the response variables using a normal linear regression that contains both pertopic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters. The hierarchical regression parameters are just like topics’ regression parameters in SLDA: each topic k (here, a tree node) has a parameter ηk , and the model uses the empirical distribution over the nodes that generated a document as the regressors. However, the hierarchy in S H L DA makes it possible to discover relationships between topics and the response variable that SLDA’s simple latent space obscures. Consider, for example, a topic model trained on Congressional debates. Vanilla LDA would likely discover a healthcare category. SLDA [12] could discover a pro-Obamacare topic and an anti-Obamacare topic. S H L DA could do that and capture the fact that there are alternative perspectives, i.e., that the healthcare issue is being discussed from two ideological perspectives, along with characterizing how the higher level topic is discussed by those on both sides of that ideological debate. Sometimes, of course, words are strongly associated with extremes on the response variable continuum regardless of underlying topic structure. Therefore, in addition to hierarchical regression parameters, we include global lexical regression parameters to model the interaction between speciﬁc words and response variables. We denote the regression parameter associated with a word type v in the vocabulary as τv , and use the normalized frequency of v in the documents to be its regressor. Including both hierarchical and lexical parameters is important. For detecting ideology in the US, “liberty” is an effective indicator of conservative speakers regardless of context; however, “cost” is a conservative-leaning indicator in discussions about environmental policy but liberal-leaning in debates about foreign policy. For sentiment, “wonderful” is globally a positive word; however, “unexpected” is a positive descriptor of books but a negative one of a car’s steering. S H L DA captures these properties in a single model. 3 Posterior Inference and Optimization Given documents with observed words w = {wd,s,n } and response variables y = {yd }, the inference task is to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over: the tree structure including topic φk and regression parameter ηk for each node k, combo assignment cd,t for each table t in document d, table assignment td,s for each sentence s in a document d, and level assignment zd,s,n for each token wd,s,n . We approximate S H L DA’s posterior using stochastic EM, which alternates between a Gibbs sampling E-step and an optimization M-step. More speciﬁcally, in the E-step, we integrate out ψ, θ and φ to construct a Markov chain over (t, c, z) and alternate sampling each of them from their conditional distributions. In the M-step, we optimize the regression parameters η and τ using L-BFGS [13]. Before describing each step in detail, let us deﬁne the following probabilities. For more thorough derivations, please see the supplement. 3 • First, deﬁne vd,x as a set of tokens (e.g., a token, a sentence or a set of sentences) in document d. The conditional density of vd,x being assigned to path c given all other assignments is −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + V βl ) L −d,x fc (vd,x ) = l=1 −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + Cd,x,l,v + βl ) V −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + Cd,x,l,· + V βl ) (1) −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + βl ) v=1 where superscript −d,x denotes the same count excluding assignments of vd,x ; marginal counts −d,x are represented by ·’s. For a new path cnew , if the node does not exist, Ccnew ,l,v = 0 for all word types v. • Second, deﬁne the conditional density of the response variable yd of document d given vd,x being −d,x assigned to path c and all other assignments as gc (yd ) =  1 N Nd,· ηc,l · Cd,x,l,· + ηcd,td,s ,zd,s,n + wd,s,n ∈{wd \vd,x }  Sd Nd,s L τwd,s,n , ρ (2) s=1 n=1 l=1 where Nd,· is the total number of tokens in document d. For a new node at level l on a new path cnew , we integrate over all possible values of ηcnew ,l . Sampling t: For each group wd,s we need to sample a table td,s . The conditional distribution of a table t given wd,s and other assignments is proportional to the number of sentences sitting at t times the probability of wd,s and yd being observed under this assignment. This is P (td,s = t | rest) ∝ P (td,s = t | t−s ) · P (wd,s , yd | td,s = t, w−d,s , t−d,s , z, c, η) d ∝ −d,s −d,s −d,s Sd,t · fcd,t (wd,s ) · gcd,t (yd ), for existing table t; (3) −d,s −d,s α · c∈C + P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) · fc (wd,s ) · gc (yd ), for new table tnew . For a new table tnew , we need to sum over all possible paths C + of the tree, including new ones. For example, the set C + for the tree shown in Figure 2 consists of four existing paths (ending at one of the four leaf nodes) and three possible new paths (a new leaf off of one of the three internal nodes). The prior probability of path c is: P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) ∝       L l=2 −d,s Mc,l −d,s Mc,l−1 + γl−1  γl∗    −d,s M ∗ cnew ,l∗ + γl , l∗ l=2 for an existing path c; (4) −d,s Mcnew ,l , for a new path cnew which consists of an existing path −d,s Mcnew ,l−1 + γl−1 from the root to a node at level l∗ and a new node. Sampling z: After assigning a sentence wd,s to a table, we assign each token wd,s,n to a level to choose a dish from the combo. The probability of assigning wd,s,n to level l is −s,n P (zd,s,n = l | rest) ∝ P (zd,s,n = l | zd )P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) (5) The ﬁrst factor captures the probability that a customer in restaurant d is assigned to level l, conditioned on the level assignments of all other customers in restaurant d, and is equal to P (zd,s,n = −s,n l | zd ) = −d,s,n mπ + Nd,·,l −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥l l−1 −d,s,n (1 − m)π + Nd,·,>j −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥j j=1 , The second factor is the probability of observing wd,s,n and yd , given that wd,s,n is assigned to level −d,s,n −d,s,n l: P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) = fcd,t (wd,s,n ) · gcd,t (yd ). d,s d,s Sampling c: After assigning customers to tables and levels, we also sample path assignments for all tables. This is important since it can change the assignments of all customers sitting at a table, which leads to a well-mixed Markov chain and faster convergence. The probability of assigning table t in restaurant d to a path c is P (cd,t = c | rest) ∝ P (cd,t = c | c−d,t ) · P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) (6) where we slightly abuse the notation by using wd,t ≡ ∪{s|td,s =t} wd,s to denote the set of customers in all the groups sitting at table t in restaurant d. The ﬁrst factor is the prior probability of a path given all tables’ path assignments c−d,t , excluding table t in restaurant d and is given in Equation 4. The second factor in Equation 6 is the probability of observing wd,t and yd given the new path −d,t −d,t assignments, P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) = fc (wd,t ) · gc (yd ). 4 Optimizing η and τ : We optimize the regression parameters η and τ via the likelihood, 1 L(η, τ ) = − 2ρ D 1 ¯ ¯ (yd − η zd − τ wd ) − 2σ T d=1 T K+ 2 (ηk − µ)2 − k=1 1 ω V |τv |, (7) v=1 where K + is the number of nodes in the tree.2 This maximization is performed using L-BFGS [13]. 4 Data: Congress, Products, Films We conduct our experiments using three datasets: Congressional ﬂoor debates, Amazon product reviews, and movie reviews. For all datasets, we remove stopwords, add bigrams to the vocabulary, and ﬁlter the vocabulary using tf-idf.3 • U.S Congressional ﬂoor debates: We downloaded debates of the 109th US Congress from GovTrack4 and preprocessed them as in Thomas et al. [14]. To remove uninterestingly non-polarized debates, we ignore bills with less than 20% “Yea” votes or less than 20% “Nay” votes. Each document d is a turn (a continuous utterance by a single speaker, i.e. speech segment [14]), and its response variable yd is the ﬁrst dimension of the speaker’s DW- NOMINATE score [15], which captures the traditional left-right political distinction.5 After processing, our corpus contains 5,201 turns in the House, 3,060 turns in the Senate, and 5,000 words in the vocabulary.6 • Amazon product reviews: From a set of Amazon reviews of manufactured products such as computers, MP 3 players, GPS devices, etc. [16], we focused on the 50 most frequently reviewed products. After ﬁltering, this corpus contains 37,191 reviews with a vocabulary of 5,000 words. We use the rating associated with each review as the response variable yd .7 • Movie reviews: Our third corpus is a set of 5,006 reviews of movies [17], again using review ratings as the response variable yd , although in this corpus the ratings are normalized to the range from 0 to 1. After preprocessing, the vocabulary contains 5,000 words. 5 Evaluating Prediction S H L DA’s response variable predictions provide a formally rigorous way to assess whether it is an improvement over prior methods. We evaluate effectiveness in predicting values of the response variables for unseen documents in the three datasets. For comparison we consider these baselines: • Multiple linear regression (MLR) models the response variable as a linear function of multiple features (or regressors). Here, we consider two types of features: topic-based features and lexicallybased features. Topic-based MLR, denoted by MLR - LDA, uses the topic distributions learned by vanilla LDA as features [12], while lexically-based MLR, denoted by MLR - VOC, uses the frequencies of words in the vocabulary as features. MLR - LDA - VOC uses both features. • Support vector regression (SVM) is a discriminative method [18] that uses LDA topic distributions (SVM - LDA), word frequencies (SVM - VOC), and both (SVM - LDA - VOC) as features.8 • Supervised topic model (SLDA): we implemented SLDA using Gibbs sampling. The version of SLDA we use is slightly different from the original SLDA described in [12], in that we place a Gaussian prior N (0, 1) over the regression parameters to perform L2-norm regularization.9 For parametric models (LDA and SLDA), which require the number of topics K to be speciﬁed beforehand, we use K ∈ {10, 30, 50}. We use symmetric Dirichlet priors in both LDA and SLDA, initialize The superscript + is to denote that this number is unbounded and varies during the sampling process. To ﬁnd bigrams, we begin with bigram candidates that occur at least 10 times in the corpus and use Pearson’s χ2 -test to ﬁlter out those that have χ2 -value less than 5, which corresponds to a signiﬁcance level of 0.025. We then treat selected bigrams as single word types and add them to the vocabulary. 2 3 4 http://www.govtrack.us/data/us/109/ 5 Scores were downloaded from http://voteview.com/dwnomin_joint_house_and_senate.htm 6 Data will be available after blind review. 7 The ratings can range from 1 to 5, but skew positive. 8 9 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ This performs better than unregularized SLDA in our experiments. 5 Floor Debates House-Senate Senate-House PCC ↑ MSE ↓ PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Amazon Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Movie Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ SVM - LDA 10 SVM - LDA 30 SVM - LDA 50 SVM - VOC SVM - LDA - VOC 0.173 0.172 0.169 0.336 0.256 0.861 0.840 0.832 1.549 0.784 0.08 0.155 0.215 0.131 0.246 1.247 1.183 1.135 1.467 1.101 0.157 0.277 0.245 0.373 0.371 1.241 1.091 1.130 0.972 0.965 0.327 0.365 0.395 0.584 0.585 0.970 0.938 0.906 0.681 0.678 MLR - LDA 10 MLR - LDA 30 MLR - LDA 50 MLR - VOC MLR - LDA - VOC 0.163 0.160 0.150 0.322 0.319 0.735 0.737 0.741 0.889 0.873 0.068 0.162 0.248 0.191 0.194 1.151 1.125 1.081 1.124 1.120 0.143 0.258 0.234 0.408 0.410 1.034 1.065 1.114 0.869 0.860 0.328 0.367 0.389 0.568 0.581 0.957 0.936 0.914 0.721 0.702 SLDA 10 SLDA 30 SLDA 50 0.154 0.174 0.254 0.729 0.793 0.897 0.090 0.128 0.245 1.145 1.188 1.184 0.270 0.357 0.241 1.113 1.146 1.939 0.383 0.433 0.503 0.953 0.852 0.772 S H L DA 0.356 0.753 0.303 1.076 0.413 0.891 0.597 0.673 Models Table 2: Regression results for Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC, higher is better (↑)) and mean squared error (MSE, lower is better (↓)).

Best results are in bold. the Dirichlet hyperparameters to 0.5, and use slice sampling [19] for updating hyperparameters. For SLDA , the variance of the regression is set to 0.5. For S H L DA , we use trees with maximum depth of three. We slice sample m, π, β and γ, and ﬁx µ = 0, σ = 0.5, ω = 0.5 and ρ = 0.5. We found that the following set of initial hyperparameters works reasonably well for all the datasets in our experiments: m = 0.5, π = 100, β = (1.0, 0.5, 0.25), γ = (1, 1), α = 1. We also set the regression parameter of the root node to zero, which speeds inference (since it is associated with every document) and because it is reasonable to assume that it would not change the response variable. To compare the performance of different methods, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) and mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted values of the response variables and average over 5 folds. For the Congressional debate corpus, following Yu et al. [20], we use documents in the House to train and test on documents in the Senate and vice versa. Results and analysis Table 2 shows the performance of all models on our three datasets. Methods that only use topic-based features such as SVM - LDA and MLR - LDA do poorly. Methods only based on lexical features like SVM - VOC and MLR - VOC outperform methods that are based only on topic features signiﬁcantly for the two review datasets, but are comparable or worse on congressional debates. This suggests that reviews have more highly discriminative words than political speeches (Table 3). Combining topic-based and lexically-based features improves performance, which supports our choice of incorporating both per-topic and per-word regression parameters in S H L DA. In all cases, S H L DA achieves strong performance results. For the two cases where S H L DA was second best in MSE score (Amazon reviews and House-Senate), it outperforms other methods in PCC. Doing well in PCC for these two datasets is important since achieving low MSE is relatively easier due to the response variables’ bimodal distribution in the ﬂoor debates and positively-skewed distribution in Amazon reviews. For the ﬂoor debate dataset, the results of the House-Senate experiment are generally better than those of the Senate-House experiment, which is consistent with previous results [20] and is explained by the greater number of debates in the House. 6 Qualitative Analysis: Agendas and Framing/Perspective Although a formal coherence evaluation [21] remains a goal for future work, a qualitative look at the topic hierarchy uncovered by the model suggests that it is indeed capturing agenda/framing structure as discussed in Section 1. In Figure 3, a portion of the topic hierarchy induced from the Congressional debate corpus, Nodes A and B illustrate agendas—issues introduced into political discourse—associated with a particular ideology: Node A focuses on the hardships of the poorer victims of hurricane Katrina and is associated with Democrats, and text associated with Node E discusses a proposed constitutional amendment to ban ﬂag burning and is associated with Republicans. Nodes C and D, children of a neutral “tax” topic, reveal how parties frame taxes as gains in terms of new social services (Democrats) and losses for job creators (Republicans). 6 E ﬂag constitution freedom supreme_court elections rights continuity american_ﬂag constitutional_amendm ent gses credit_rating fannie_mae regulator freddie_mac market ﬁnancial_services agencies competition investors fannie bill speaker time amendment chairman people gentleman legislation congress support R:1.1 R:0 A minimum_wage commission independent_commissio n investigate hurricane_katrina increase investigation R:1.0 B percent tax economy estate_tax capital_gains money taxes businesses families tax_cuts pay tax_relief social_security affordable_housing housing manager fund activities funds organizations voter_registration faithbased nonproﬁts R:0.4 D:1.7 C death_tax jobs businesses business family_businesses equipment productivity repeal_permanency employees capital farms D REPUBLICAN billion budget children cuts debt tax_cuts child_support deﬁcit education students health_care republicans national_debt R:4.3 D:2.2 DEMOCRAT D:4.5 Figure 3: Topics discovered from Congressional ﬂoor debates. Many ﬁrst-level topics are bipartisan (purple), while lower level topics are associated with speciﬁc ideologies (Democrats blue, Republicans red). For example, the “tax” topic (B) is bipartisan, but its Democratic-leaning child (D) focuses on social goals supported by taxes (“children”, “education”, “health care”), while its Republican-leaning child (C) focuses on business implications (“death tax”, “jobs”, “businesses”). The number below each topic denotes the magnitude of the learned regression parameter associated with that topic. Colors and the numbers beneath each topic show the regression parameter η associated with the topic. Figure 4 shows the topic structure discovered by S H L DA in the review corpus. Nodes at higher levels are relatively neutral, with relatively small regression parameters.10 These nodes have general topics with no speciﬁc polarity. However, the bottom level clearly illustrates polarized positive/negative perspective. For example, Node A concerns washbasins for infants, and has two polarized children nodes: reviewers take a positive perspective when their children enjoy the product (Node B: “loves”, “splash”, “play”) but have negative reactions when it leaks (Node C: “leak(s/ed/ing)”). transmitter ipod car frequency iriver product transmitters live station presets itrip iriver_aft charges international_mode driving P:6.6 tried waste batteries tunecast rabbit_ears weak terrible antenna hear returned refund returning item junk return A D router setup network expander set signal wireless connect linksys connection house wireless_router laptop computer wre54g N:2.2 N:1.0 tivo adapter series adapters phone_line tivo_wireless transfer plugged wireless_adapter tivos plug dvr tivo_series tivo_box tivo_unit P:5.1 tub baby water bath sling son daughter sit bathtub sink newborn months bath_tub bathe bottom N:8.0 months loves hammock splash love baby drain eurobath hot ﬁts wash play infant secure slip P:7.5 NEGATIVE N:0 N:2.7 B POSITIVE time bought product easy buy love using price lot able set found purchased money months transmitter car static ipod radio mp3_player signal station sound music sound_quality volume stations frequency frequencies C leaks leaked leak leaking hard waste snap suction_cups lock tabs difﬁcult bottom tub_leaks properly ring N:8.9 monitor radio weather_radio night baby range alerts sound sony house interference channels receiver static alarm N:1.7 hear feature static monitors set live warning volume counties noise outside alert breathing rechargeable_battery alerts P:6.2 version hours phone F ﬁrmware told spent linksys tech_support technical_supportcusto mer_service range_expander support return N:10.6 E router ﬁrmware ddwrt wrt54gl version wrt54g tomato linksys linux routers ﬂash versions browser dlink stable P:4.8 z22 palm pda palm_z22 calendar software screen contacts computer device sync information outlook data programs N:1.9 headphones sound pair bass headset sound_quality ear ears cord earbuds comfortable hear head earphones ﬁt N:1.3 appointments organized phone lists handheld organizer photos etc pictures memos track bells books purse whistles P:5.8 noise_canceling noise sony exposed noise_cancellation stopped wires warranty noise_cancelling bud pay white_noise disappointed N:7.6 bottles bottle baby leak nipples nipple avent avent_bottles leaking son daughter formula leaks gas milk comfortable sound phones sennheiser bass px100 px100s phone headset highs portapros portapro price wear koss N:2.0 leak formula bottles_leak feeding leaked brown frustrating started clothes waste newborn playtex_ventaire soaked matter N:7.9 P:5.7 nipple breast nipples dishwasher ring sippy_cups tried breastfeed screwed breastfeeding nipple_confusion avent_system bottle P:6.4 Figure 4: Topics discovered from Amazon reviews. Higher topics are general, while lower topics are more speciﬁc. The polarity of the review is encoded in the color: red (negative) to blue (positive). Many of the ﬁrstlevel topics have no speciﬁc polarity and are associated with a broad class of products such as “routers” (Node D). However, the lowest topics in the hierarchy are often polarized; one child topic of “router” focuses on upgradable ﬁrmware such as “tomato” and “ddwrt” (Node E, positive) while another focuses on poor “tech support” and “customer service” (Node F, negative). The number below each topic is the regression parameter learned with that topic. In addition to the per-topic regression parameters, S H L DA also associates each word with a lexical regression parameter τ . Table 3 shows the top ten words with highest and lowest τ . The results are unsuprising, although the lexical regression for the Congressional debates is less clear-cut than other 10 All of the nodes at the second level have slightly negative values for the regression parameters mainly due to the very skewed distribution of the review ratings in Amazon. 7 datasets. As we saw in Section 5, for similar datasets, S H L DA’s context-speciﬁc regression is more useful when global lexical weights do not readily differentiate documents.

For the ﬂoor debates, positive τ ’s are Republican-leaning while negative τ ’s are Democrat-leaning. 7 Related Work S H L DA joins a family of LDA extensions that introduce hierarchical topics, supervision, or both. Owing to limited space, we focus here on related work that combines the two. Petinot et al. [22] propose hierarchical Labeled LDA (hLLDA), which leverages an observed document ontology to learn topics in a tree structure; however, hLLDA assumes that the underlying tree structure is known a priori. SSHLDA [23] generalizes hLLDA by allowing the document hierarchy labels to be partially observed, with unobserved labels and topic tree structure then inferred from the data. Boyd-Graber and Resnik [24] used hierarchical distributions within topics to learn topics across languages. In addition to these “upstream” models [25], Perotte et al. [26] propose a “downstream” model called HSLDA , which jointly models documents’ hierarchy of labels and topics. HSLDA ’s topic structure is ﬂat, however, and the response variable is a hierarchy of labels associated with each document, unlike S H L DA’s continuous response variable. Finally, another body related body of work includes models that jointly capture topics and other facets such as ideologies/perspectives [27, 28] and sentiments/opinions [29], albeit with discrete rather than continuously valued responses. Computational modeling of sentiment polarity is a voluminous ﬁeld [30], and many computational political science models describe agendas [5] and ideology [31]. Looking at framing or bias at the sentence level, Greene and Resnik [32] investigate the role of syntactic structure in framing, Yano et al. [33] look at lexical indications of sentence-level bias, and Recasens et al. [34] develop linguistically informed sentence-level features for identifying bias-inducing words. 8 Conclusion We have introduced S H L DA, a model that associates a continuously valued response variable with hierarchical topics to capture both the issues under discussion and alternative perspectives on those issues. The two-level structure improves predictive performance over existing models on multiple datasets, while also adding potentially insightful hierarchical structure to the topic analysis. Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis, the topic hierarchy exposed by the model plausibly captures the idea of agenda setting, which is related to the issues that get discussed, and framing, which is related to authors’ perspectives on those issues. We plan to analyze the topic structure produced by S H L DA with political science collaborators and more generally to study how S H L DA and related models can help analyze and discover useful insights from political discourse.

<p>Author: Liming Wang, David Carlson, Miguel Rodrigues, David Wilcox, Robert Calderbank, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: We consider design of linear projection measurements for a vector Poisson signal model. The projections are performed on the vector Poisson rate, X ∈ Rn , and the + observed data are a vector of counts, Y ∈ Zm . The projection matrix is designed + by maximizing mutual information between Y and X, I(Y ; X). When there is a latent class label C ∈ {1, . . . , L} associated with X, we consider the mutual information with respect to Y and C, I(Y ; C). New analytic expressions for the gradient of I(Y ; X) and I(Y ; C) are presented, with gradient performed with respect to the measurement matrix. Connections are made to the more widely studied Gaussian measurement model. Example results are presented for compressive topic modeling of a document corpora (word counting), and hyperspectral compressive sensing for chemical classiﬁcation (photon counting). 1</p><p>4 0.10261925 <a title="301-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Contrastive_Learning_Using_Spectral_Methods.html">70 nips-2013-Contrastive Learning Using Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: James Y. Zou, Daniel Hsu, David C. Parkes, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In many natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes speciﬁc to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components speciﬁc to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.10052554 <a title="301-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_PCA_for_Contaminated_Data.html">232 nips-2013-Online PCA for Contaminated Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where contaminated samples (containing outliers) are revealed sequentially to the Principal Components (PCs) estimator. Due to their sensitiveness to outliers, previous online PCA algorithms fail in this case and their results can be arbitrarily skewed by the outliers. Here we propose the online robust PCA algorithm, which is able to improve the PCs estimation upon an initial one steadily, even when faced with a constant fraction of outliers. We show that the ﬁnal result of the proposed online RPCA has an acceptable degradation from the optimum. Actually, under mild conditions, online RPCA achieves the maximal robustness with a 50% breakdown point. Moreover, online RPCA is shown to be efﬁcient for both storage and computation, since it need not re-explore the previous samples as in traditional robust PCA algorithms. This endows online RPCA with scalability for large scale data. 1</p><p>6 0.096819349 <a title="301-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Compressive_Feature_Learning.html">65 nips-2013-Compressive Feature Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>2 0.7018503 <a title="301-lsi-2" href="./nips-2013-Lexical_and_Hierarchical_Topic_Regression.html">174 nips-2013-Lexical and Hierarchical Topic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by a two-level theory from political science that uniﬁes agenda setting and ideological framing, we propose supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (S H L DA), which jointly captures documents’ multi-level topic structure and their polar response variables. Our model extends the nested Chinese restaurant processes to discover tree-structured topic hierarchies and uses both per-topic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters to model response variables. S H L DA improves prediction on political afﬁliation and sentiment tasks in addition to providing insight into how topics under discussion are framed. 1 Introduction: Agenda Setting and Framing in Hierarchical Models How do liberal-leaning bloggers talk about immigration in the US? What do conservative politicians have to say about education? How do Fox News and MSNBC differ in their language about the gun debate? Such questions concern not only what, but how things are talked about. In political communication, the question of “what” falls under the heading of agenda setting theory, which concerns the issues introduced into political discourse (e.g., by the mass media) and their inﬂuence over public priorities [1]. The question of “how” concerns framing: the way the presentation of an issue reﬂects or encourages a particular perspective or interpretation [2]. For example, the rise of the “innocence frame” in the death penalty debate, emphasizing the irreversible consequence of mistaken convictions, has led to a sharp decline in the use of capital punishment in the US [3]. In its concern with the subjects or issues under discussion in political discourse, agenda setting maps neatly to topic modeling [4] as a means of discovering and characterizing those issues [5]. Interestingly, one line of communication theory seeks to unify agenda setting and framing by viewing frames as a second-level kind of agenda [1]: just as agenda setting is about which objects of discussion are salient, framing is about the salience of attributes of those objects. The key is that what communications theorists consider an attribute in a discussion can itself be an object, as well. For example, “mistaken convictions” is one attribute of the death penalty discussion, but it can also be viewed as an object of discussion in its own right. This two-level view leads naturally to the idea of using a hierarchical topic model to formalize both agendas and frames within a uniform setting. In this paper, we introduce a new model to do exactly that. The model is predictive: it represents the idea of alternative or competing perspectives via a continuous-valued response variable. Although inspired by the study of political discourse, associating texts with “perspectives” is more general and has been studied in sentiment analysis, discovery of regional variation, and value-sensitive design. We show experimentally that the model’s hierarchical structure improves prediction of perspective in both a political domain and on sentiment analysis tasks, and we argue that the topic hierarchies exposed by the model are indeed capturing structure in line with the theory that motivated the work. 1 ߨ ݉ ߠௗ ߙ ߰ௗ ߛ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫ݖ‬ௗ௦௡ ‫ݓ‬ௗ௦௡ ܿௗ௧ ܰௗ௦ ∞ ߩ ܵௗ ‫ݕ‬ௗ ‫ܦ‬ ߱ ߟ௞ ߬௩ ܸ 1.

Words w are explained by topic hierarchy φ, and response variables y are explained by per-topic regression coefﬁcients η and global lexical coefﬁcients τ . 2 S H L DA: Combining Supervision and Hierarchical Topic Structure Jointly capturing supervision and hierarchical topic structure falls under a class of models called supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation. These models take as input a set of D documents, each of which is associated with a response variable yd , and output a hierarchy of topics which is informed by yd . Zhang et al. [6] introduce the S H L DA family, focusing on a categorical response. In contrast, our novel model (which we call S H L DA for brevity), uses continuous responses. At its core, S H L DA’s document generative process resembles a combination of hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation [7, HLDA] and the hierarchical Dirichlet process [8, HDP]. HLDA uses the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP(γ)), combined with an appropriate base distribution, to induce an unbounded tree-structured hierarchy of topics: general topics at the top, speciﬁc at the bottom. A document is generated by traversing this tree, at each level creating a new child (hence a new path) with probability proportional to γ or otherwise respecting the “rich-get-richer” property of a CRP. A drawback of HLDA, however, is that each document is restricted to only a single path in the tree. Recent work relaxes this restriction through different priors: nested HDP [9], nested Chinese franchises [10] or recursive CRPs [11]. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing documents to have multiple paths through the tree by leveraging information at the sentence level using the twolevel structure used in HDP. More speciﬁcally, in the HDP’s Chinese restaurant franchise metaphor, customers (i.e., tokens) are grouped by sitting at tables and each table takes a dish (i.e., topic) from a ﬂat global menu. In our S H L DA, dishes are organized in a tree-structured global menu by using the nCRP as prior. Each path in the tree is a collection of L dishes (one for each level) and is called a combo. S H L DA groups sentences of a document by assigning them to tables and associates each table with a combo, and thus, models each document as a distribution over combos.1 In S H L DA’s metaphor, customers come in a restaurant and sit at a table in groups, where each group is a sentence. A sentence wd,s enters restaurant d and selects a table t (and its associated combo) with probability proportional to the number of sentences Sd,t at that table; or, it sits at a new table with probability proportional to α. After choosing the table (indexed by td,s ), if the table is new, the group will select a combo of dishes (i.e., a path, indexed by cd,t ) from the tree menu. Once a combo is in place, each token in the sentence chooses a “level” (indexed by zd,s,n ) in the combo, which speciﬁes the topic (φkd,s,n ≡ φcd,td,s ,zd,s,n ) producing the associated observation (Figure 2). S H L DA also draws on supervised LDA [12, SLDA] associating each document d with an observable continuous response variable yd that represents the author’s perspective toward a topic, e.g., positive vs. negative sentiment, conservative vs. liberal ideology, etc. This lets us infer a multi-level topic structure informed by how topics are “framed” with respect to positions along the yd continuum. 1 We emphasize that, unlike in HDP where each table is assigned to a single dish, each table in our metaphor is associated with a combo–a collection of L dishes. We also use combo and path interchangeably. 2 Sd Sd,t ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ dish ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ߶ଵଶ 			ߟଵଶ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ ߶ଵଵଶ 		ߟଵଵଶ ߶ଵଶଵ 		ߟଵଶଵ ߶ଵଶଶ 		ߟଵଶଶ table ܿௗ௧ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫3=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଵ ‫3=ݏ 2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ݀=1 ݇ௗ௦௡ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଶ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬஽ ݀=2 ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ ݀=‫ܦ‬ customer group (token) (sentence) restaurant (document) ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ݀=1 ‫1=ݏ‬ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ combo (path) Nd,s Nd,·,l Nd,·,>l Nd,·,≥l Mc,l Cc,l,v Cd,x,l,v φk ηk τv cd,t td,s zd,s,n kd,s,n L C+ Figure 2: S H L DA’s restaurant franchise metaphor. # sentences in document d # groups (i.e. sentences) sitting at table t in restaurant d # tokens wd,s # tokens in wd assigned to level l # tokens in wd assigned to level > l ≡ Nd,·,l + Nd,·,>l # tables at level l on path c # word type v assigned to level l on path c # word type v in vd,x assigned to level l Topic at node k Regression parameter at node k Regression parameter of word type v Path assignment for table t in restaurant d Table assignment for group wd,s Level assignment for wd,s,n Node assignment for wd,s,n (i.e., node at level zd,s,n on path cd,td,s ) Height of the tree Set of all possible paths (including new ones) of the tree Table 1: Notation used in this paper Unlike SLDA, we model the response variables using a normal linear regression that contains both pertopic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters. The hierarchical regression parameters are just like topics’ regression parameters in SLDA: each topic k (here, a tree node) has a parameter ηk , and the model uses the empirical distribution over the nodes that generated a document as the regressors. However, the hierarchy in S H L DA makes it possible to discover relationships between topics and the response variable that SLDA’s simple latent space obscures. Consider, for example, a topic model trained on Congressional debates. Vanilla LDA would likely discover a healthcare category. SLDA [12] could discover a pro-Obamacare topic and an anti-Obamacare topic. S H L DA could do that and capture the fact that there are alternative perspectives, i.e., that the healthcare issue is being discussed from two ideological perspectives, along with characterizing how the higher level topic is discussed by those on both sides of that ideological debate. Sometimes, of course, words are strongly associated with extremes on the response variable continuum regardless of underlying topic structure. Therefore, in addition to hierarchical regression parameters, we include global lexical regression parameters to model the interaction between speciﬁc words and response variables. We denote the regression parameter associated with a word type v in the vocabulary as τv , and use the normalized frequency of v in the documents to be its regressor. Including both hierarchical and lexical parameters is important. For detecting ideology in the US, “liberty” is an effective indicator of conservative speakers regardless of context; however, “cost” is a conservative-leaning indicator in discussions about environmental policy but liberal-leaning in debates about foreign policy. For sentiment, “wonderful” is globally a positive word; however, “unexpected” is a positive descriptor of books but a negative one of a car’s steering. S H L DA captures these properties in a single model. 3 Posterior Inference and Optimization Given documents with observed words w = {wd,s,n } and response variables y = {yd }, the inference task is to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over: the tree structure including topic φk and regression parameter ηk for each node k, combo assignment cd,t for each table t in document d, table assignment td,s for each sentence s in a document d, and level assignment zd,s,n for each token wd,s,n . We approximate S H L DA’s posterior using stochastic EM, which alternates between a Gibbs sampling E-step and an optimization M-step. More speciﬁcally, in the E-step, we integrate out ψ, θ and φ to construct a Markov chain over (t, c, z) and alternate sampling each of them from their conditional distributions. In the M-step, we optimize the regression parameters η and τ using L-BFGS [13]. Before describing each step in detail, let us deﬁne the following probabilities. For more thorough derivations, please see the supplement. 3 • First, deﬁne vd,x as a set of tokens (e.g., a token, a sentence or a set of sentences) in document d. The conditional density of vd,x being assigned to path c given all other assignments is −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + V βl ) L −d,x fc (vd,x ) = l=1 −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + Cd,x,l,v + βl ) V −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + Cd,x,l,· + V βl ) (1) −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + βl ) v=1 where superscript −d,x denotes the same count excluding assignments of vd,x ; marginal counts −d,x are represented by ·’s. For a new path cnew , if the node does not exist, Ccnew ,l,v = 0 for all word types v. • Second, deﬁne the conditional density of the response variable yd of document d given vd,x being −d,x assigned to path c and all other assignments as gc (yd ) =  1 N Nd,· ηc,l · Cd,x,l,· + ηcd,td,s ,zd,s,n + wd,s,n ∈{wd \vd,x }  Sd Nd,s L τwd,s,n , ρ (2) s=1 n=1 l=1 where Nd,· is the total number of tokens in document d. For a new node at level l on a new path cnew , we integrate over all possible values of ηcnew ,l . Sampling t: For each group wd,s we need to sample a table td,s . The conditional distribution of a table t given wd,s and other assignments is proportional to the number of sentences sitting at t times the probability of wd,s and yd being observed under this assignment. This is P (td,s = t | rest) ∝ P (td,s = t | t−s ) · P (wd,s , yd | td,s = t, w−d,s , t−d,s , z, c, η) d ∝ −d,s −d,s −d,s Sd,t · fcd,t (wd,s ) · gcd,t (yd ), for existing table t; (3) −d,s −d,s α · c∈C + P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) · fc (wd,s ) · gc (yd ), for new table tnew . For a new table tnew , we need to sum over all possible paths C + of the tree, including new ones. For example, the set C + for the tree shown in Figure 2 consists of four existing paths (ending at one of the four leaf nodes) and three possible new paths (a new leaf off of one of the three internal nodes). The prior probability of path c is: P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) ∝       L l=2 −d,s Mc,l −d,s Mc,l−1 + γl−1  γl∗    −d,s M ∗ cnew ,l∗ + γl , l∗ l=2 for an existing path c; (4) −d,s Mcnew ,l , for a new path cnew which consists of an existing path −d,s Mcnew ,l−1 + γl−1 from the root to a node at level l∗ and a new node. Sampling z: After assigning a sentence wd,s to a table, we assign each token wd,s,n to a level to choose a dish from the combo. The probability of assigning wd,s,n to level l is −s,n P (zd,s,n = l | rest) ∝ P (zd,s,n = l | zd )P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) (5) The ﬁrst factor captures the probability that a customer in restaurant d is assigned to level l, conditioned on the level assignments of all other customers in restaurant d, and is equal to P (zd,s,n = −s,n l | zd ) = −d,s,n mπ + Nd,·,l −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥l l−1 −d,s,n (1 − m)π + Nd,·,>j −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥j j=1 , The second factor is the probability of observing wd,s,n and yd , given that wd,s,n is assigned to level −d,s,n −d,s,n l: P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) = fcd,t (wd,s,n ) · gcd,t (yd ). d,s d,s Sampling c: After assigning customers to tables and levels, we also sample path assignments for all tables. This is important since it can change the assignments of all customers sitting at a table, which leads to a well-mixed Markov chain and faster convergence. The probability of assigning table t in restaurant d to a path c is P (cd,t = c | rest) ∝ P (cd,t = c | c−d,t ) · P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) (6) where we slightly abuse the notation by using wd,t ≡ ∪{s|td,s =t} wd,s to denote the set of customers in all the groups sitting at table t in restaurant d. The ﬁrst factor is the prior probability of a path given all tables’ path assignments c−d,t , excluding table t in restaurant d and is given in Equation 4. The second factor in Equation 6 is the probability of observing wd,t and yd given the new path −d,t −d,t assignments, P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) = fc (wd,t ) · gc (yd ). 4 Optimizing η and τ : We optimize the regression parameters η and τ via the likelihood, 1 L(η, τ ) = − 2ρ D 1 ¯ ¯ (yd − η zd − τ wd ) − 2σ T d=1 T K+ 2 (ηk − µ)2 − k=1 1 ω V |τv |, (7) v=1 where K + is the number of nodes in the tree.2 This maximization is performed using L-BFGS [13]. 4 Data: Congress, Products, Films We conduct our experiments using three datasets: Congressional ﬂoor debates, Amazon product reviews, and movie reviews. For all datasets, we remove stopwords, add bigrams to the vocabulary, and ﬁlter the vocabulary using tf-idf.3 • U.S Congressional ﬂoor debates: We downloaded debates of the 109th US Congress from GovTrack4 and preprocessed them as in Thomas et al. [14]. To remove uninterestingly non-polarized debates, we ignore bills with less than 20% “Yea” votes or less than 20% “Nay” votes. Each document d is a turn (a continuous utterance by a single speaker, i.e. speech segment [14]), and its response variable yd is the ﬁrst dimension of the speaker’s DW- NOMINATE score [15], which captures the traditional left-right political distinction.5 After processing, our corpus contains 5,201 turns in the House, 3,060 turns in the Senate, and 5,000 words in the vocabulary.6 • Amazon product reviews: From a set of Amazon reviews of manufactured products such as computers, MP 3 players, GPS devices, etc. [16], we focused on the 50 most frequently reviewed products. After ﬁltering, this corpus contains 37,191 reviews with a vocabulary of 5,000 words. We use the rating associated with each review as the response variable yd .7 • Movie reviews: Our third corpus is a set of 5,006 reviews of movies [17], again using review ratings as the response variable yd , although in this corpus the ratings are normalized to the range from 0 to 1. After preprocessing, the vocabulary contains 5,000 words. 5 Evaluating Prediction S H L DA’s response variable predictions provide a formally rigorous way to assess whether it is an improvement over prior methods. We evaluate effectiveness in predicting values of the response variables for unseen documents in the three datasets. For comparison we consider these baselines: • Multiple linear regression (MLR) models the response variable as a linear function of multiple features (or regressors). Here, we consider two types of features: topic-based features and lexicallybased features. Topic-based MLR, denoted by MLR - LDA, uses the topic distributions learned by vanilla LDA as features [12], while lexically-based MLR, denoted by MLR - VOC, uses the frequencies of words in the vocabulary as features. MLR - LDA - VOC uses both features. • Support vector regression (SVM) is a discriminative method [18] that uses LDA topic distributions (SVM - LDA), word frequencies (SVM - VOC), and both (SVM - LDA - VOC) as features.8 • Supervised topic model (SLDA): we implemented SLDA using Gibbs sampling. The version of SLDA we use is slightly different from the original SLDA described in [12], in that we place a Gaussian prior N (0, 1) over the regression parameters to perform L2-norm regularization.9 For parametric models (LDA and SLDA), which require the number of topics K to be speciﬁed beforehand, we use K ∈ {10, 30, 50}. We use symmetric Dirichlet priors in both LDA and SLDA, initialize The superscript + is to denote that this number is unbounded and varies during the sampling process. To ﬁnd bigrams, we begin with bigram candidates that occur at least 10 times in the corpus and use Pearson’s χ2 -test to ﬁlter out those that have χ2 -value less than 5, which corresponds to a signiﬁcance level of 0.025. We then treat selected bigrams as single word types and add them to the vocabulary. 2 3 4 http://www.govtrack.us/data/us/109/ 5 Scores were downloaded from http://voteview.com/dwnomin_joint_house_and_senate.htm 6 Data will be available after blind review. 7 The ratings can range from 1 to 5, but skew positive. 8 9 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ This performs better than unregularized SLDA in our experiments. 5 Floor Debates House-Senate Senate-House PCC ↑ MSE ↓ PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Amazon Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Movie Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ SVM - LDA 10 SVM - LDA 30 SVM - LDA 50 SVM - VOC SVM - LDA - VOC 0.173 0.172 0.169 0.336 0.256 0.861 0.840 0.832 1.549 0.784 0.08 0.155 0.215 0.131 0.246 1.247 1.183 1.135 1.467 1.101 0.157 0.277 0.245 0.373 0.371 1.241 1.091 1.130 0.972 0.965 0.327 0.365 0.395 0.584 0.585 0.970 0.938 0.906 0.681 0.678 MLR - LDA 10 MLR - LDA 30 MLR - LDA 50 MLR - VOC MLR - LDA - VOC 0.163 0.160 0.150 0.322 0.319 0.735 0.737 0.741 0.889 0.873 0.068 0.162 0.248 0.191 0.194 1.151 1.125 1.081 1.124 1.120 0.143 0.258 0.234 0.408 0.410 1.034 1.065 1.114 0.869 0.860 0.328 0.367 0.389 0.568 0.581 0.957 0.936 0.914 0.721 0.702 SLDA 10 SLDA 30 SLDA 50 0.154 0.174 0.254 0.729 0.793 0.897 0.090 0.128 0.245 1.145 1.188 1.184 0.270 0.357 0.241 1.113 1.146 1.939 0.383 0.433 0.503 0.953 0.852 0.772 S H L DA 0.356 0.753 0.303 1.076 0.413 0.891 0.597 0.673 Models Table 2: Regression results for Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC, higher is better (↑)) and mean squared error (MSE, lower is better (↓)).

For SVM - LDA - VOC and MLR - LDA - VOC, only best results across K ∈ {10, 30, 50} are reported. Best results are in bold. the Dirichlet hyperparameters to 0.5, and use slice sampling [19] for updating hyperparameters. For SLDA , the variance of the regression is set to 0.5. For S H L DA , we use trees with maximum depth of three. We slice sample m, π, β and γ, and ﬁx µ = 0, σ = 0.5, ω = 0.5 and ρ = 0.5. We found that the following set of initial hyperparameters works reasonably well for all the datasets in our experiments: m = 0.5, π = 100, β = (1.0, 0.5, 0.25), γ = (1, 1), α = 1. We also set the regression parameter of the root node to zero, which speeds inference (since it is associated with every document) and because it is reasonable to assume that it would not change the response variable. To compare the performance of different methods, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) and mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted values of the response variables and average over 5 folds. For the Congressional debate corpus, following Yu et al. [20], we use documents in the House to train and test on documents in the Senate and vice versa. Results and analysis Table 2 shows the performance of all models on our three datasets. Methods that only use topic-based features such as SVM - LDA and MLR - LDA do poorly. Methods only based on lexical features like SVM - VOC and MLR - VOC outperform methods that are based only on topic features signiﬁcantly for the two review datasets, but are comparable or worse on congressional debates. This suggests that reviews have more highly discriminative words than political speeches (Table 3). Combining topic-based and lexically-based features improves performance, which supports our choice of incorporating both per-topic and per-word regression parameters in S H L DA. In all cases, S H L DA achieves strong performance results. For the two cases where S H L DA was second best in MSE score (Amazon reviews and House-Senate), it outperforms other methods in PCC. Doing well in PCC for these two datasets is important since achieving low MSE is relatively easier due to the response variables’ bimodal distribution in the ﬂoor debates and positively-skewed distribution in Amazon reviews. For the ﬂoor debate dataset, the results of the House-Senate experiment are generally better than those of the Senate-House experiment, which is consistent with previous results [20] and is explained by the greater number of debates in the House. 6 Qualitative Analysis: Agendas and Framing/Perspective Although a formal coherence evaluation [21] remains a goal for future work, a qualitative look at the topic hierarchy uncovered by the model suggests that it is indeed capturing agenda/framing structure as discussed in Section 1. In Figure 3, a portion of the topic hierarchy induced from the Congressional debate corpus, Nodes A and B illustrate agendas—issues introduced into political discourse—associated with a particular ideology: Node A focuses on the hardships of the poorer victims of hurricane Katrina and is associated with Democrats, and text associated with Node E discusses a proposed constitutional amendment to ban ﬂag burning and is associated with Republicans. Nodes C and D, children of a neutral “tax” topic, reveal how parties frame taxes as gains in terms of new social services (Democrats) and losses for job creators (Republicans). 6 E ﬂag constitution freedom supreme_court elections rights continuity american_ﬂag constitutional_amendm ent gses credit_rating fannie_mae regulator freddie_mac market ﬁnancial_services agencies competition investors fannie bill speaker time amendment chairman people gentleman legislation congress support R:1.1 R:0 A minimum_wage commission independent_commissio n investigate hurricane_katrina increase investigation R:1.0 B percent tax economy estate_tax capital_gains money taxes businesses families tax_cuts pay tax_relief social_security affordable_housing housing manager fund activities funds organizations voter_registration faithbased nonproﬁts R:0.4 D:1.7 C death_tax jobs businesses business family_businesses equipment productivity repeal_permanency employees capital farms D REPUBLICAN billion budget children cuts debt tax_cuts child_support deﬁcit education students health_care republicans national_debt R:4.3 D:2.2 DEMOCRAT D:4.5 Figure 3: Topics discovered from Congressional ﬂoor debates. Many ﬁrst-level topics are bipartisan (purple), while lower level topics are associated with speciﬁc ideologies (Democrats blue, Republicans red). For example, the “tax” topic (B) is bipartisan, but its Democratic-leaning child (D) focuses on social goals supported by taxes (“children”, “education”, “health care”), while its Republican-leaning child (C) focuses on business implications (“death tax”, “jobs”, “businesses”). The number below each topic denotes the magnitude of the learned regression parameter associated with that topic. Colors and the numbers beneath each topic show the regression parameter η associated with the topic. Figure 4 shows the topic structure discovered by S H L DA in the review corpus. Nodes at higher levels are relatively neutral, with relatively small regression parameters.10 These nodes have general topics with no speciﬁc polarity. However, the bottom level clearly illustrates polarized positive/negative perspective. For example, Node A concerns washbasins for infants, and has two polarized children nodes: reviewers take a positive perspective when their children enjoy the product (Node B: “loves”, “splash”, “play”) but have negative reactions when it leaks (Node C: “leak(s/ed/ing)”). transmitter ipod car frequency iriver product transmitters live station presets itrip iriver_aft charges international_mode driving P:6.6 tried waste batteries tunecast rabbit_ears weak terrible antenna hear returned refund returning item junk return A D router setup network expander set signal wireless connect linksys connection house wireless_router laptop computer wre54g N:2.2 N:1.0 tivo adapter series adapters phone_line tivo_wireless transfer plugged wireless_adapter tivos plug dvr tivo_series tivo_box tivo_unit P:5.1 tub baby water bath sling son daughter sit bathtub sink newborn months bath_tub bathe bottom N:8.0 months loves hammock splash love baby drain eurobath hot ﬁts wash play infant secure slip P:7.5 NEGATIVE N:0 N:2.7 B POSITIVE time bought product easy buy love using price lot able set found purchased money months transmitter car static ipod radio mp3_player signal station sound music sound_quality volume stations frequency frequencies C leaks leaked leak leaking hard waste snap suction_cups lock tabs difﬁcult bottom tub_leaks properly ring N:8.9 monitor radio weather_radio night baby range alerts sound sony house interference channels receiver static alarm N:1.7 hear feature static monitors set live warning volume counties noise outside alert breathing rechargeable_battery alerts P:6.2 version hours phone F ﬁrmware told spent linksys tech_support technical_supportcusto mer_service range_expander support return N:10.6 E router ﬁrmware ddwrt wrt54gl version wrt54g tomato linksys linux routers ﬂash versions browser dlink stable P:4.8 z22 palm pda palm_z22 calendar software screen contacts computer device sync information outlook data programs N:1.9 headphones sound pair bass headset sound_quality ear ears cord earbuds comfortable hear head earphones ﬁt N:1.3 appointments organized phone lists handheld organizer photos etc pictures memos track bells books purse whistles P:5.8 noise_canceling noise sony exposed noise_cancellation stopped wires warranty noise_cancelling bud pay white_noise disappointed N:7.6 bottles bottle baby leak nipples nipple avent avent_bottles leaking son daughter formula leaks gas milk comfortable sound phones sennheiser bass px100 px100s phone headset highs portapros portapro price wear koss N:2.0 leak formula bottles_leak feeding leaked brown frustrating started clothes waste newborn playtex_ventaire soaked matter N:7.9 P:5.7 nipple breast nipples dishwasher ring sippy_cups tried breastfeed screwed breastfeeding nipple_confusion avent_system bottle P:6.4 Figure 4: Topics discovered from Amazon reviews. Higher topics are general, while lower topics are more speciﬁc. The polarity of the review is encoded in the color: red (negative) to blue (positive). Many of the ﬁrstlevel topics have no speciﬁc polarity and are associated with a broad class of products such as “routers” (Node D). However, the lowest topics in the hierarchy are often polarized; one child topic of “router” focuses on upgradable ﬁrmware such as “tomato” and “ddwrt” (Node E, positive) while another focuses on poor “tech support” and “customer service” (Node F, negative). The number below each topic is the regression parameter learned with that topic. In addition to the per-topic regression parameters, S H L DA also associates each word with a lexical regression parameter τ . Table 3 shows the top ten words with highest and lowest τ . The results are unsuprising, although the lexical regression for the Congressional debates is less clear-cut than other 10 All of the nodes at the second level have slightly negative values for the regression parameters mainly due to the very skewed distribution of the review ratings in Amazon. 7 datasets. As we saw in Section 5, for similar datasets, S H L DA’s context-speciﬁc regression is more useful when global lexical weights do not readily differentiate documents.

For the ﬂoor debates, positive τ ’s are Republican-leaning while negative τ ’s are Democrat-leaning. 7 Related Work S H L DA joins a family of LDA extensions that introduce hierarchical topics, supervision, or both. Owing to limited space, we focus here on related work that combines the two. Petinot et al. [22] propose hierarchical Labeled LDA (hLLDA), which leverages an observed document ontology to learn topics in a tree structure; however, hLLDA assumes that the underlying tree structure is known a priori. SSHLDA [23] generalizes hLLDA by allowing the document hierarchy labels to be partially observed, with unobserved labels and topic tree structure then inferred from the data. Boyd-Graber and Resnik [24] used hierarchical distributions within topics to learn topics across languages. In addition to these “upstream” models [25], Perotte et al. [26] propose a “downstream” model called HSLDA , which jointly models documents’ hierarchy of labels and topics. HSLDA ’s topic structure is ﬂat, however, and the response variable is a hierarchy of labels associated with each document, unlike S H L DA’s continuous response variable. Finally, another body related body of work includes models that jointly capture topics and other facets such as ideologies/perspectives [27, 28] and sentiments/opinions [29], albeit with discrete rather than continuously valued responses. Computational modeling of sentiment polarity is a voluminous ﬁeld [30], and many computational political science models describe agendas [5] and ideology [31]. Looking at framing or bias at the sentence level, Greene and Resnik [32] investigate the role of syntactic structure in framing, Yano et al. [33] look at lexical indications of sentence-level bias, and Recasens et al. [34] develop linguistically informed sentence-level features for identifying bias-inducing words. 8 Conclusion We have introduced S H L DA, a model that associates a continuously valued response variable with hierarchical topics to capture both the issues under discussion and alternative perspectives on those issues. The two-level structure improves predictive performance over existing models on multiple datasets, while also adding potentially insightful hierarchical structure to the topic analysis. Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis, the topic hierarchy exposed by the model plausibly captures the idea of agenda setting, which is related to the issues that get discussed, and framing, which is related to authors’ perspectives on those issues. We plan to analyze the topic structure produced by S H L DA with political science collaborators and more generally to study how S H L DA and related models can help analyze and discover useful insights from political discourse.

<p>Author: Chong Wang, Xi Chen, Alex Smola, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is a class of widely used algorithms for training machine learning models. To optimize an objective, it uses the noisy gradient computed from the random data samples instead of the true gradient computed from the entire dataset. However, when the variance of the noisy gradient is large, the algorithm might spend much time bouncing around, leading to slower convergence and worse performance. In this paper, we develop a general approach of using control variate for variance reduction in stochastic gradient. Data statistics such as low-order moments (pre-computed or estimated online) is used to form the control variate. We demonstrate how to construct the control variate for two practical problems using stochastic gradient optimization. One is convex—the MAP estimation for logistic regression, and the other is non-convex—stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation. On both problems, our approach shows faster convergence and better performance than the classical approach. 1</p><p>4 0.67174637 <a title="301-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_Inference_for_Logistic-Normal_Topic_Models.html">287 nips-2013-Scalable Inference for Logistic-Normal Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianfei Chen, June Zhu, Zi Wang, Xun Zheng, Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Logistic-normal topic models can effectively discover correlation structures among latent topics. However, their inference remains a challenge because of the non-conjugacy between the logistic-normal prior and multinomial topic mixing proportions. Existing algorithms either make restricting mean-ﬁeld assumptions or are not scalable to large-scale applications. This paper presents a partially collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm that approaches the provably correct distribution by exploring the ideas of data augmentation. To improve time efﬁciency, we further present a parallel implementation that can deal with large-scale applications and learn the correlation structures of thousands of topics from millions of documents. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the promise. 1</p><p>5 0.65533161 <a title="301-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Contrastive_Learning_Using_Spectral_Methods.html">70 nips-2013-Contrastive Learning Using Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: James Y. Zou, Daniel Hsu, David C. Parkes, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In many natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes speciﬁc to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components speciﬁc to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.62692994 <a title="301-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Novel_Two-Step_Method_for_Cross_Language_Representation_Learning.html">12 nips-2013-A Novel Two-Step Method for Cross Language Representation Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Bartz, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Analytic shrinkage is a statistical technique that offers a fast alternative to crossvalidation for the regularization of covariance matrices and has appealing consistency properties. We show that the proof of consistency requires bounds on the growth rates of eigenvalues and their dispersion, which are often violated in data. We prove consistency under assumptions which do not restrict the covariance structure and therefore better match real world data. In addition, we propose an extension of analytic shrinkage –orthogonal complement shrinkage– which adapts to the covariance structure. Finally we demonstrate the superior performance of our novel approach on data from the domains of ﬁnance, spoken letter and optical character recognition, and neuroscience. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83595777 <a title="301-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Additive_Text_Models_with_Low_Rank_Background.html">301 nips-2013-Sparse Additive Text Models with Low Rank Background</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>3 0.81887364 <a title="301-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Efficient_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Predictors_with_Non-Decomposable_Loss_Functions.html">152 nips-2013-Learning Efficient Random Maximum A-Posteriori Predictors with Non-Decomposable Loss Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Joseph Keshet, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this work we develop efﬁcient methods for learning random MAP predictors for structured label problems. In particular, we construct posterior distributions over perturbations that can be adjusted via stochastic gradient methods. We show that any smooth posterior distribution would sufﬁce to deﬁne a smooth PAC-Bayesian risk bound suitable for gradient methods. In addition, we relate the posterior distributions to computational properties of the MAP predictors. We suggest multiplicative posteriors to learn super-modular potential functions that accompany specialized MAP predictors such as graph-cuts. We also describe label-augmented posterior models that can use efﬁcient MAP approximations, such as those arising from linear program relaxations. 1</p><p>4 0.79276305 <a title="301-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Dynamic_Parameters_in_Social_Networks.html">228 nips-2013-Online Learning of Dynamic Parameters in Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Shahin Shahrampour, Sasha Rakhlin, Ali Jadbabaie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online learning in a dynamic setting. We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a ﬁnite time. 1</p><p>5 0.77769941 <a title="301-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-Ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish theoretical results concerning local optima of regularized M estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex. Our results show that as long as the loss satisﬁes restricted strong convexity and the penalty satisﬁes suitable regularity conditions, any local optimum of the composite objective lies within statistical precision of the true parameter vector. Our theory covers a broad class of nonconvex objective functions, including corrected versions of the Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models and regression in generalized linear models using nonconvex regularizers such as SCAD and MCP. On the optimization side, we show that a simple adaptation of composite gradient descent may be used to compute a global optimum up to the statistical precision stat in log(1/ stat ) iterations, the fastest possible rate for any ﬁrst-order method. We provide simulations to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.76461148 <a title="301-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>

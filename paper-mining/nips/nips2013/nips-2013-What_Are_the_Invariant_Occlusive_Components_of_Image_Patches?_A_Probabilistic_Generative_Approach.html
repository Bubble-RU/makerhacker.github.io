<p>Author: Christian Szegedy, Alexander Toshev, Dumitru Erhan</p><p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classiﬁcation tasks [14]. In this paper we go one step further and address the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks. We deﬁne a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution object detections at a low cost by a few network applications. State-of-the-art performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC. 1</p><p>3 0.18058246 <a title="351-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Mid-level_Visual_Element_Discovery_as_Discriminative_Mode_Seeking.html">190 nips-2013-Mid-level Visual Element Discovery as Discriminative Mode Seeking</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the level of complexity higher than typical “visual words”, but lower than full-blown semantic objects. Several approaches [5, 6, 12, 23] have been proposed to discover mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difﬁcult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data. We also propose the Purity-Coverage plot as a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual discovery approaches, and compare our method against prior work on the Paris Street View dataset of [5]. We also evaluate our method on the task of scene classiﬁcation, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.17610586 <a title="351-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>5 0.17498878 <a title="351-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Extracting_regions_of_interest_from_biological_images_with_convolutional_sparse_block_coding.html">114 nips-2013-Extracting regions of interest from biological images with convolutional sparse block coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Adam M. Packer, Noah Pettit, Henry Dalgleish, Michael Hausser, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Biological tissue is often composed of cells with similar morphologies replicated throughout large volumes and many biological applications rely on the accurate identiﬁcation of these cells and their locations from image data. Here we develop a generative model that captures the regularities present in images composed of repeating elements of a few different types. Formally, the model can be described as convolutional sparse block coding. For inference we use a variant of convolutional matching pursuit adapted to block-based representations. We extend the KSVD learning algorithm to subspaces by retaining several principal vectors from the SVD decomposition instead of just one. Good models with little cross-talk between subspaces can be obtained by learning the blocks incrementally. We perform extensive experiments on simulated images and the inference algorithm consistently recovers a large proportion of the cells with a small number of false positives. We ﬁt the convolutional model to noisy GCaMP6 two-photon images of spiking neurons and to Nissl-stained slices of cortical tissue and show that it recovers cell body locations without supervision. The ﬂexibility of the block-based representation is reﬂected in the variability of the recovered cell shapes. 1</p><p>6 0.15043473 <a title="351-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>3 0.74260145 <a title="351-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Extracting_regions_of_interest_from_biological_images_with_convolutional_sparse_block_coding.html">114 nips-2013-Extracting regions of interest from biological images with convolutional sparse block coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Suvrit Sra, Reshad Hosseini</p><p>Abstract: Hermitian positive deﬁnite (hpd) matrices recur throughout machine learning, statistics, and optimisation. This paper develops (conic) geometric optimisation on the cone of hpd matrices, which allows us to globally optimise a large class of nonconvex functions of hpd matrices. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use the Riemannian manifold structure of the hpd cone for studying functions that are nonconvex in the Euclidean sense but are geodesically convex (g-convex), hence globally optimisable. We then go beyond g-convexity, and exploit the conic geometry of hpd matrices to identify another class of functions that remain amenable to global optimisation without requiring g-convexity. We present key results that help recognise g-convexity and also the additional structure alluded to above. We illustrate our ideas by applying them to likelihood maximisation for a broad family of elliptically contoured distributions: for this maximisation, we derive novel, parameter free ﬁxed-point algorithms. To our knowledge, ours are the most general results on geometric optimisation of hpd matrices known so far. Experiments show that advantages of using our ﬁxed-point algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.83178937 <a title="351-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.80925316 <a title="351-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-What_Are_the_Invariant_Occlusive_Components_of_Image_Patches%3F_A_Probabilistic_Generative_Approach.html">351 nips-2013-What Are the Invariant Occlusive Components of Image Patches? A Probabilistic Generative Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenwen Dai, Georgios Exarchakis, Jörg Lücke</p><p>Abstract: We study optimal image encoding based on a generative approach with non-linear feature combinations and explicit position encoding. By far most approaches to unsupervised learning of visual features, such as sparse coding or ICA, account for translations by representing the same features at different positions. Some earlier models used a separate encoding of features and their positions to facilitate invariant data encoding and recognition. All probabilistic generative models with explicit position encoding have so far assumed a linear superposition of components to encode image patches. Here, we for the ﬁrst time apply a model with non-linear feature superposition and explicit position encoding for patches. By avoiding linear superpositions, the studied model represents a closer match to component occlusions which are ubiquitous in natural images. In order to account for occlusions, the non-linear model encodes patches qualitatively very different from linear models by using component representations separated into mask and feature parameters. We ﬁrst investigated encodings learned by the model using artiﬁcial data with mutually occluding components. We ﬁnd that the model extracts the components, and that it can correctly identify the occlusive components with the hidden variables of the model. On natural image patches, the model learns component masks and features for typical image components. By using reverse correlation, we estimate the receptive ﬁelds associated with the model’s hidden units. We ﬁnd many Gabor-like or globular receptive ﬁelds as well as ﬁelds sensitive to more complex structures. Our results show that probabilistic models that capture occlusions and invariances can be trained efﬁciently on image patches, and that the resulting encoding represents an alternative model for the neural encoding of images in the primary visual cortex. 1</p><p>4 0.75891495 <a title="351-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish lower bounds on minimax risks for distributed statistical estimation under a communication budget. Such lower bounds reveal the minimum amount of communication required by any procedure to achieve the centralized minimax-optimal rates for statistical estimation. We study two classes of protocols: one in which machines send messages independently, and a second allowing for interactive communication. We establish lower bounds for several problems, including various types of location models, as well as for parameter estimation in regression models. 1</p><p>5 0.75356537 <a title="351-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Least_Informative_Dimensions.html">173 nips-2013-Least Informative Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>6 0.75194895 <a title="351-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Task_Bayesian_Optimization.html">201 nips-2013-Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Robust PCA methods are typically based on batch optimization and have to load all the samples into memory during optimization. This prevents them from efﬁciently processing big data. In this paper, we develop an Online Robust PCA (OR-PCA) that processes one sample per time instance and hence its memory cost is independent of the number of samples, signiﬁcantly enhancing the computation and storage efﬁciency. The proposed OR-PCA is based on stochastic optimization of an equivalent reformulation of the batch RPCA. Indeed, we show that OR-PCA provides a sequence of subspace estimations converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart and hence is provably robust to sparse corruption. Moreover, OR-PCA can naturally be applied for tracking dynamic subspace. Comprehensive simulations on subspace recovering and tracking demonstrate the robustness and efﬁciency advantages of the OR-PCA over online PCA and batch RPCA methods. 1</p><p>3 0.23014636 <a title="285-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_PCA_for_Contaminated_Data.html">232 nips-2013-Online PCA for Contaminated Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where contaminated samples (containing outliers) are revealed sequentially to the Principal Components (PCs) estimator. Due to their sensitiveness to outliers, previous online PCA algorithms fail in this case and their results can be arbitrarily skewed by the outliers. Here we propose the online robust PCA algorithm, which is able to improve the PCs estimation upon an initial one steadily, even when faced with a constant fraction of outliers. We show that the ﬁnal result of the proposed online RPCA has an acceptable degradation from the optimum. Actually, under mild conditions, online RPCA achieves the maximal robustness with a 50% breakdown point. Moreover, online RPCA is shown to be efﬁcient for both storage and computation, since it need not re-explore the previous samples as in traditional robust PCA algorithms. This endows online RPCA with scalability for large scale data. 1</p><p>4 0.21627033 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Fantope_Projection_and_Selection%3A_A_near-optimal_convex_relaxation_of_sparse_PCA.html">116 nips-2013-Fantope Projection and Selection: A near-optimal convex relaxation of sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Q. Vu, Juhee Cho, Jing Lei, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The convex problem can be solved efﬁciently using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings. We demonstrate this with an application to Kendall’s tau correlation matrices and transelliptical component analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.20011202 <a title="285-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Memory_Limited%2C_Streaming_PCA.html">188 nips-2013-Memory Limited, Streaming PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Mitliagkas, Constantine Caramanis, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider streaming, one-pass principal component analysis (PCA), in the highdimensional regime, with limited memory. Here, p-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the k-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require O(p2 ) memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than O(kp) memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the spiked covariance model, where p-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, n, scales proportionally with the dimension, p. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity O(p2 ). Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity O(kp) do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to p. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses O(kp) memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the k-dimensional spike with O(p log p) samplecomplexity – the ﬁrst algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the spiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful on much more general models for the data. 1</p><p>6 0.16129693 <a title="285-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Robust_learning_of_low-dimensional_dynamics_from_large_neural_ensembles.html">286 nips-2013-Robust learning of low-dimensional dynamics from large neural ensembles</a></p>

<p>Author: Liu Yang, Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: In many practical applications of active learning, it is more cost-effective to request labels in large batches, rather than one-at-a-time. This is because the cost of labeling a large batch of examples at once is often sublinear in the number of examples in the batch. In this work, we study the label complexity of active learning algorithms that request labels in a given number of batches, as well as the tradeoff between the total number of queries and the number of rounds allowed. We additionally study the total cost sufﬁcient for learning, for an abstract notion of the cost of requesting the labels of a given number of examples at once. In particular, we ﬁnd that for sublinear cost functions, it is often desirable to request labels in large batches (i.e., buying in bulk); although this may increase the total number of labels requested, it reduces the total cost required for learning. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85176671 <a title="285-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Transfer_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Rank_Constraints.html">285 nips-2013-Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></p>

Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA with rank constraints. 1</p><p>3 0.84454352 <a title="285-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Relationship_Between_Binary_Classification%2C_Bipartite_Ranking%2C_and_Binary_Class_Probability_Estimation.html">223 nips-2013-On the Relationship Between Binary Classification, Bipartite Ranking, and Binary Class Probability Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Harikrishna Narasimhan, Shivani Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relationship between three fundamental problems in machine learning: binary classiﬁcation, bipartite ranking, and binary class probability estimation (CPE). It is known that a good binary CPE model can be used to obtain a good binary classiﬁcation model (by thresholding at 0.5), and also to obtain a good bipartite ranking model (by using the CPE model directly as a ranking model); it is also known that a binary classiﬁcation model does not necessarily yield a CPE model. However, not much is known about other directions. Formally, these relationships involve regret transfer bounds. In this paper, we introduce the notion of weak regret transfer bounds, where the mapping needed to transform a model from one problem to another depends on the underlying probability distribution (and in practice, must be estimated from data). We then show that, in this weaker sense, a good bipartite ranking model can be used to construct a good classiﬁcation model (by thresholding at a suitable point), and more surprisingly, also to construct a good binary CPE model (by calibrating the scores of the ranking model). 1</p><p>4 0.83056885 <a title="285-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Online_Robust_PCA_via_Stochastic_Optimization.html">233 nips-2013-Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Robust PCA methods are typically based on batch optimization and have to load all the samples into memory during optimization. This prevents them from efﬁciently processing big data. In this paper, we develop an Online Robust PCA (OR-PCA) that processes one sample per time instance and hence its memory cost is independent of the number of samples, signiﬁcantly enhancing the computation and storage efﬁciency. The proposed OR-PCA is based on stochastic optimization of an equivalent reformulation of the batch RPCA. Indeed, we show that OR-PCA provides a sequence of subspace estimations converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart and hence is provably robust to sparse corruption. Moreover, OR-PCA can naturally be applied for tracking dynamic subspace. Comprehensive simulations on subspace recovering and tracking demonstrate the robustness and efﬁciency advantages of the OR-PCA over online PCA and batch RPCA methods. 1</p><p>5 0.82759476 <a title="285-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Cluster_Trees_on_Manifolds.html">63 nips-2013-Cluster Trees on Manifolds</a></p>

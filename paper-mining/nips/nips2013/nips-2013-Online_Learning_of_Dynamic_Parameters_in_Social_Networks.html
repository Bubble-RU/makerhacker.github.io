Compared with existing methods, our approach is naturally parallelizable and allows for incorporating different cost functionals with only minor adjustments. We apply our method to classical challenging instances and observe that its computational requirements scale well with p for several cost functionals. We also show that a specialization of our algorithm can be used for local motion planning by solving the problem of joint optimization in velocity space. 1</p><p>4 0.12079296 <a title="228-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Near-Optimal_Entrywise_Sampling_for_Data_Matrices.html">206 nips-2013-Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling for Data Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitris Achlioptas, Zohar S. Karnin, Edo Liberty</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting non-zero entries of a matrix A in order to produce a sparse sketch of it, B, that minimizes A B 2 . For large m n matrices, such that n m (for example, representing n observations over m attributes) we give sampling distributions that exhibit four important properties. First, they have closed forms computable from minimal information regarding A. Second, they allow sketching of matrices whose non-zeros are presented to the algorithm in arbitrary order as a stream, with O 1 computation per non-zero. Third, the resulting sketch matrices are not only sparse, but their non-zero entries are highly compressible. Lastly, and most importantly, under mild assumptions, our distributions are provably competitive with the optimal ofﬂine distribution. Note that the probabilities in the optimal ofﬂine distribution may be complex functions of all the entries in the matrix. Therefore, regardless of computational complexity, the optimal distribution might be impossible to compute in the streaming model. 1</p><p>5 0.1168295 <a title="228-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Reward_Mapping_for_Transfer_in_Long-Lived_Agents.html">278 nips-2013-Reward Mapping for Transfer in Long-Lived Agents</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: We consider how to transfer knowledge from previous tasks (MDPs) to a current task in long-lived and bounded agents that must solve a sequence of tasks over a ﬁnite lifetime. A novel aspect of our transfer approach is that we reuse reward functions. While this may seem counterintuitive, we build on the insight of recent work on the optimal rewards problem that guiding an agent’s behavior with reward functions other than the task-specifying reward function can help overcome computational bounds of the agent. Speciﬁcally, we use good guidance reward functions learned on previous tasks in the sequence to incrementally train a reward mapping function that maps task-specifying reward functions into good initial guidance reward functions for subsequent tasks. We demonstrate that our approach can substantially improve the agent’s performance relative to other approaches, including an approach that transfers policies. 1</p><p>6 0.11339981 <a title="228-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Point_Based_Value_Iteration_with_Optimal_Belief_Compression_for_Dec-POMDPs.html">248 nips-2013-Point Based Value Iteration with Optimal Belief Compression for Dec-POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Liam C. MacDermed, Charles Isbell</p><p>Abstract: We present four major results towards solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision problems (DecPOMDPs) culminating in an algorithm that outperforms all existing algorithms on all but one standard inﬁnite-horizon benchmark problems. (1) We give an integer program that solves collaborative Bayesian games (CBGs). The program is notable because its linear relaxation is very often integral. (2) We show that a DecPOMDP with bounded belief can be converted to a POMDP (albeit with actions exponential in the number of beliefs). These actions correspond to strategies of a CBG. (3) We present a method to transform any DecPOMDP into a DecPOMDP with bounded beliefs (the number of beliefs is a free parameter) using optimal (not lossless) belief compression. (4) We show that the combination of these results opens the door for new classes of DecPOMDP algorithms based on previous POMDP algorithms. We choose one such algorithm, point-based valued iteration, and modify it to produce the ﬁrst tractable value iteration method for DecPOMDPs that outperforms existing algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.55044693 <a title="228-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-A_message-passing_algorithm_for_multi-agent_trajectory_planning.html">16 nips-2013-A message-passing algorithm for multi-agent trajectory planning</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Bartz, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Analytic shrinkage is a statistical technique that offers a fast alternative to crossvalidation for the regularization of covariance matrices and has appealing consistency properties. We show that the proof of consistency requires bounds on the growth rates of eigenvalues and their dispersion, which are often violated in data. We prove consistency under assumptions which do not restrict the covariance structure and therefore better match real world data. In addition, we propose an extension of analytic shrinkage –orthogonal complement shrinkage– which adapts to the covariance structure. Finally we demonstrate the superior performance of our novel approach on data from the domains of ﬁnance, spoken letter and optical character recognition, and neuroscience. 1</p><p>2 0.86099052 <a title="228-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Additive_Text_Models_with_Low_Rank_Background.html">301 nips-2013-Sparse Additive Text Models with Low Rank Background</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85257429 <a title="228-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Dynamic_Parameters_in_Social_Networks.html">228 nips-2013-Online Learning of Dynamic Parameters in Social Networks</a></p>

We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a ﬁnite time. 1</p><p>4 0.84584856 <a title="228-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Efficient_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Predictors_with_Non-Decomposable_Loss_Functions.html">152 nips-2013-Learning Efficient Random Maximum A-Posteriori Predictors with Non-Decomposable Loss Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Joseph Keshet, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this work we develop efﬁcient methods for learning random MAP predictors for structured label problems. In particular, we construct posterior distributions over perturbations that can be adjusted via stochastic gradient methods. We show that any smooth posterior distribution would sufﬁce to deﬁne a smooth PAC-Bayesian risk bound suitable for gradient methods. In addition, we relate the posterior distributions to computational properties of the MAP predictors. We suggest multiplicative posteriors to learn super-modular potential functions that accompany specialized MAP predictors such as graph-cuts. We also describe label-augmented posterior models that can use efﬁcient MAP approximations, such as those arising from linear program relaxations. 1</p><p>5 0.83968866 <a title="228-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-Ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish theoretical results concerning local optima of regularized M estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex. Our results show that as long as the loss satisﬁes restricted strong convexity and the penalty satisﬁes suitable regularity conditions, any local optimum of the composite objective lies within statistical precision of the true parameter vector. Our theory covers a broad class of nonconvex objective functions, including corrected versions of the Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models and regression in generalized linear models using nonconvex regularizers such as SCAD and MCP. On the optimization side, we show that a simple adaptation of composite gradient descent may be used to compute a global optimum up to the statistical precision stat in log(1/ stat ) iterations, the fastest possible rate for any ﬁrst-order method. We provide simulations to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.81126004 <a title="228-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>

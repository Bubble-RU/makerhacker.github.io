<p>Author: Sinead A. Williamson, Steve N. MacEachern, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Distributions over matrices with exchangeable rows and inﬁnitely many columns are useful in constructing nonparametric latent variable models. However, the distribution implied by such models over the number of features exhibited by each data point may be poorly-suited for many modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a class of exchangeable nonparametric priors obtained by restricting the domain of existing models. Such models allow us to specify the distribution over the number of features per data point, and can achieve better performance on data sets where the number of features is not well-modeled by the original distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.10588636 <a title="252-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Theory_for_High-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixtures_with_Sparse_Mean_Separation.html">192 nips-2013-Minimax Theory for High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with Sparse Mean Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Azizyan, Aarti Singh, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: While several papers have investigated computationally and statistically efﬁcient methods for learning Gaussian mixtures, precise minimax bounds for their statistical performance as well as fundamental limits in high-dimensional settings are not well-understood. In this paper, we provide precise information theoretic bounds on the clustering accuracy and sample complexity of learning a mixture of two isotropic Gaussians in high dimensions under small mean separation. If there is a sparse subset of relevant dimensions that determine the mean separation, then the sample complexity only depends on the number of relevant dimensions and mean separation, and can be achieved by a simple computationally efﬁcient procedure. Our results provide the ﬁrst step of a theoretical basis for recent methods that combine feature selection and clustering. 1</p><p>4 0.097899646 <a title="252-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Parallel_Sampling_of_DP_Mixture_Models_using_Sub-Cluster_Splits.html">243 nips-2013-Parallel Sampling of DP Mixture Models using Sub-Cluster Splits</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Chang, John W. Fisher III</p><p>Abstract: We present an MCMC sampler for Dirichlet process mixture models that can be parallelized to achieve signiﬁcant computational gains. We combine a nonergodic, restricted Gibbs iteration with split/merge proposals in a manner that produces an ergodic Markov chain. Each cluster is augmented with two subclusters to construct likely split moves. Unlike some previous parallel samplers, the proposed sampler enforces the correct stationary distribution of the Markov chain without the need for ﬁnite approximations. Empirical results illustrate that the new sampler exhibits better convergence properties than current methods. 1</p><p>5 0.095182315 <a title="252-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Noisy_Labels.html">171 nips-2013-Learning with Noisy Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>6 0.092071459 <a title="252-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>

<p>Author: Anirban Roychowdhury, Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis</p><p>Abstract: Small-variance asymptotics provide an emerging technique for obtaining scalable combinatorial algorithms from rich probabilistic models. We present a smallvariance asymptotic analysis of the Hidden Markov Model and its inﬁnite-state Bayesian nonparametric extension. Starting with the standard HMM, we ﬁrst derive a “hard” inference algorithm analogous to k-means that arises when particular variances in the model tend to zero. This analysis is then extended to the Bayesian nonparametric case, yielding a simple, scalable, and ﬂexible algorithm for discrete-state sequence data with a non-ﬁxed number of states. We also derive the corresponding combinatorial objective functions arising from our analysis, which involve a k-means-like term along with penalties based on state transitions and the number of states. A key property of such algorithms is that— particularly in the nonparametric setting—standard probabilistic inference algorithms lack scalability and are heavily dependent on good initialization. A number of results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework. 1</p><p>3 0.68402982 <a title="252-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Theory_for_High-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixtures_with_Sparse_Mean_Separation.html">192 nips-2013-Minimax Theory for High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with Sparse Mean Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Benigno Uria, Iain Murray, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: We introduce RNADE, a new model for joint density estimation of real-valued vectors. Our model calculates the density of a datapoint as the product of onedimensional conditionals modeled using mixture density networks with shared parameters. RNADE learns a distributed representation of the data, while having a tractable expression for the calculation of densities. A tractable likelihood allows direct comparison with other methods and training by standard gradientbased optimizers. We compare the performance of RNADE on several datasets of heterogeneous and perceptual data, ﬁnding it outperforms mixture models in all but one case. 1</p><p>5 0.66260678 <a title="252-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-More_data_speeds_up_training_time_in_learning_halfspaces_over_sparse_vectors.html">199 nips-2013-More data speeds up training time in learning halfspaces over sparse vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Daniely, Nati Linial, Shai Shalev-Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to ask whether it is possible to use data as a computational resource. That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to perform the learning task? We give the ﬁrst positive answer to this question for a natural supervised learning problem — we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors in {−1, 1, 0}n . This class is inefﬁciently learnable using O n/ 2 examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random 3CNF formulas is hard, it is impossible to efﬁciently learn this class using only O n/ 2 examples. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even O n1.499 / 2 examples do not sufﬁce. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efﬁciently ˜ using Ω n2 / 2 examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.65704185 <a title="252-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Using_multiple_samples_to_learn_mixture_models.html">344 nips-2013-Using multiple samples to learn mixture models</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Rogers, Lei Li, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: Data in the sciences frequently occur as sequences of multidimensional arrays called tensors. How can hidden, evolving trends in such data be extracted while preserving the tensor structure? The model that is traditionally used is the linear dynamical system (LDS) with Gaussian noise, which treats the latent state and observation at each time slice as a vector. We present the multilinear dynamical system (MLDS) for modeling tensor time series and an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters. The MLDS models each tensor observation in the time series as the multilinear projection of the corresponding member of a sequence of latent tensors. The latent tensors are again evolving with respect to a multilinear projection. Compared to the LDS with an equal number of parameters, the MLDS achieves higher prediction accuracy and marginal likelihood for both artiﬁcial and real datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.92155546 <a title="252-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Probabilistic_Principal_Geodesic_Analysis.html">256 nips-2013-Probabilistic Principal Geodesic Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Zhang, P.T. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: Principal geodesic analysis (PGA) is a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of data on a Riemannian manifold. Currently PGA is deﬁned as a geometric ﬁt to the data, rather than as a probabilistic model. Inspired by probabilistic PCA, we present a latent variable model for PGA that provides a probabilistic framework for factor analysis on manifolds. To compute maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in our model, we develop a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm, where the expectation is approximated by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the latent variables. We demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the ground truth parameters in simulated sphere data, as well as its effectiveness in analyzing shape variability of a corpus callosum data set from human brain images. 1</p><p>3 0.88414544 <a title="252-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>4 0.87505096 <a title="252-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Contrastive_Learning_Using_Spectral_Methods.html">70 nips-2013-Contrastive Learning Using Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: James Y. Zou, Daniel Hsu, David C. Parkes, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In many natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes speciﬁc to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components speciﬁc to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.87366593 <a title="252-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Predictive_PAC_Learning_and_Process_Decompositions.html">252 nips-2013-Predictive PAC Learning and Process Decompositions</a></p>
<p>Author: Cosma Shalizi, Aryeh Kontorovitch</p><p>Abstract: We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with ﬁnite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This deﬁnition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular (β-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest. 1</p><p>6 0.83686596 <a title="252-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Statistical_analysis_of_coupled_time_series_with_Kernel_Cross-Spectral_Density_operators..html">310 nips-2013-Statistical analysis of coupled time series with Kernel Cross-Spectral Density operators.</a></p>

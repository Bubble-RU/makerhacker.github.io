<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efﬁciently from Gibbs distributions. Speciﬁcally, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs’ distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical “high signal high coupling” regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds. 1</p><p>3 0.16080342 <a title="258-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein_Inequality.html">242 nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein Inequality</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya O. Tolstikhin, Yevgeny Seldin</p><p>Abstract: We present a PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality. The inequality is based on a combination of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique with an Empirical Bernstein bound. We show that when the empirical variance is signiﬁcantly smaller than the empirical loss the PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is signiﬁcantly tighter than the PAC-Bayes-kl inequality of Seeger (2002) and otherwise it is comparable. Our theoretical analysis is conﬁrmed empirically on a synthetic example and several UCI datasets. The PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is an interesting example of an application of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique to self-bounding functions. 1</p><p>4 0.13562404 <a title="258-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Estimation_of_Latently-grouped_Parameters_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">46 nips-2013-Bayesian Estimation of Latently-grouped Parameters in Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Liu, David Page</p><p>Abstract: In large-scale applications of undirected graphical models, such as social networks and biological networks, similar patterns occur frequently and give rise to similar parameters. In this situation, it is beneﬁcial to group the parameters for more efﬁcient learning. We show that even when the grouping is unknown, we can infer these parameter groups during learning via a Bayesian approach. We impose a Dirichlet process prior on the parameters. Posterior inference usually involves calculating intractable terms, and we propose two approximation algorithms, namely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with auxiliary variables and a Gibbs sampling algorithm with “stripped” Beta approximation (Gibbs SBA). Simulations show that both algorithms outperform conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Gibbs SBA’s performance is close to Gibbs sampling with exact likelihood calculation. Models learned with Gibbs SBA also generalize better than the models learned by MLE on real-world Senate voting data. 1</p><p>5 0.12968363 <a title="258-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_Hogwild_Parallel_Gaussian_Gibbs_Sampling.html">34 nips-2013-Analyzing Hogwild Parallel Gaussian Gibbs Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Johnson, James Saunderson, Alan Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Sampling inference methods are computationally difﬁcult to scale for many models in part because global dependencies can reduce opportunities for parallel computation. Without strict conditional independence structure among variables, standard Gibbs sampling theory requires sample updates to be performed sequentially, even if dependence between most variables is not strong. Empirical work has shown that some models can be sampled effectively by going “Hogwild” and simply running Gibbs updates in parallel with only periodic global communication, but the successes and limitations of such a strategy are not well understood. As a step towards such an understanding, we study the Hogwild Gibbs sampling strategy in the context of Gaussian distributions. We develop a framework which provides convergence conditions and error bounds along with simple proofs and connections to methods in numerical linear algebra. In particular, we show that if the Gaussian precision matrix is generalized diagonally dominant, then any Hogwild Gibbs sampler, with any update schedule or allocation of variables to processors, yields a stable sampling process with the correct sample mean. 1</p><p>6 0.12098412 <a title="258-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Integrated_Non-Factorized_Variational_Inference.html">143 nips-2013-Integrated Non-Factorized Variational Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Joseph Keshet, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this work we develop efﬁcient methods for learning random MAP predictors for structured label problems. In particular, we construct posterior distributions over perturbations that can be adjusted via stochastic gradient methods. We show that any smooth posterior distribution would sufﬁce to deﬁne a smooth PAC-Bayesian risk bound suitable for gradient methods. In addition, we relate the posterior distributions to computational properties of the MAP predictors. We suggest multiplicative posteriors to learn super-modular potential functions that accompany specialized MAP predictors such as graph-cuts. We also describe label-augmented posterior models that can use efﬁcient MAP approximations, such as those arising from linear program relaxations. 1</p><p>6 0.68102503 <a title="258-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Inverses.html">161 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Inverses</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiang Cheng, Qiang Liu, Feng Chen, Alex Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are extremely useful for modeling and solving sequential decision making problems. Graph-based MDPs provide a compact representation for MDPs with large numbers of random variables. However, the complexity of exactly solving a graph-based MDP usually grows exponentially in the number of variables, which limits their application. We present a new variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms. In particular, by exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is ﬁrst approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence is optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential in only the cluster size of the graph. Experimental comparison on different models shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approximation algorithms at ﬁnding good policies. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.94894779 <a title="258-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Projecting_Ising_Model_Parameters_for_Fast_Mixing.html">258 nips-2013-Projecting Ising Model Parameters for Fast Mixing</a></p>

<p>Author: David J. Weiss, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative methods for learning structured models have enabled wide-spread use of very rich feature representations. However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to ﬁnetune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control ﬁne-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting nonhomogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efﬁcient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input. We demonstrate signiﬁcant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is also faster, with similar results on an OCR task. 1</p><p>4 0.92640436 <a title="258-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Action_is_in_the_Eye_of_the_Beholder%3A_Eye-gaze_Driven_Model_for_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization.html">22 nips-2013-Action is in the Eye of the Beholder: Eye-gaze Driven Model for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nataliya Shapovalova, Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a weakly-supervised structured learning approach for recognition and spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. As part of the proposed approach, we develop a generalization of the Max-Path search algorithm which allows us to efﬁciently search over a structured space of multiple spatio-temporal paths while also incorporating context information into the model. Instead of using spatial annotations in the form of bounding boxes to guide the latent model during training, we utilize human gaze data in the form of a weak supervisory signal. This is achieved by incorporating eye gaze, along with the classiﬁcation, into the structured loss within the latent SVM learning framework. Experiments on a challenging benchmark dataset, UCF-Sports, show that our model is more accurate, in terms of classiﬁcation, and achieves state-of-the-art results in localization. In addition, our model can produce top-down saliency maps conditioned on the classiﬁcation label and localized latent paths. 1</p><p>5 0.91528016 <a title="258-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_entropy_estimation_for_binary_spike_train_data_using_parametric_prior_knowledge.html">51 nips-2013-Bayesian entropy estimation for binary spike train data using parametric prior knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan W. Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Shannon’s entropy is a basic quantity in information theory, and a fundamental building block for the analysis of neural codes. Estimating the entropy of a discrete distribution from samples is an important and difﬁcult problem that has received considerable attention in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. However, neural responses have characteristic statistical structure that generic entropy estimators fail to exploit. For example, existing Bayesian entropy estimators make the naive assumption that all spike words are equally likely a priori, which makes for an inefﬁcient allocation of prior probability mass in cases where spikes are sparse. Here we develop Bayesian estimators for the entropy of binary spike trains using priors designed to ﬂexibly exploit the statistical structure of simultaneouslyrecorded spike responses. We deﬁne two prior distributions over spike words using mixtures of Dirichlet distributions centered on simple parametric models. The parametric model captures high-level statistical features of the data, such as the average spike count in a spike word, which allows the posterior over entropy to concentrate more rapidly than with standard estimators (e.g., in cases where the probability of spiking differs strongly from 0.5). Conversely, the Dirichlet distributions assign prior mass to distributions far from the parametric model, ensuring consistent estimates for arbitrary distributions. We devise a compact representation of the data and prior that allow for computationally efﬁcient implementations of Bayesian least squares and empirical Bayes entropy estimators with large numbers of neurons. We apply these estimators to simulated and real neural data and show that they substantially outperform traditional methods.</p><p>6 0.90350342 <a title="258-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Misha Denil, Babak Shakibi, Laurent Dinh, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there is signiﬁcant redundancy in the parameterization of several deep learning models. Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.22283712 <a title="83-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>4 0.21656446 <a title="83-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Gaussian_Graphical_Models_with_Observed_or_Latent_FVSs.html">154 nips-2013-Learning Gaussian Graphical Models with Observed or Latent FVSs</a></p>
<p>Author: Ying Liu, Alan Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) or Gauss Markov random ﬁelds are widely used in many applications, and the trade-off between the modeling capacity and the efﬁciency of learning and inference has been an important research problem. In this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex sets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all the cycles. Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the partition function has complexity O(k 2 n) using message-passing algorithms, where k is the size of the FVS, and n is the total number of nodes. We propose efﬁcient structure learning algorithms for two cases: 1) All nodes are observed, which is useful in modeling social or ﬂight networks where the FVS nodes often correspond to a small number of highly inﬂuential nodes, or hubs, while the rest of the networks is modeled by a tree. Regardless of the maximum degree, without knowing the full graph structure, we can exactly compute the maximum likelihood estimate with complexity O(kn2 + n2 log n) if the FVS is known or in polynomial time if the FVS is unknown but has bounded size. 2) The FVS nodes are latent variables, where structure learning is equivalent to decomposing an inverse covariance matrix (exactly or approximately) into the sum of a tree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. By incorporating efﬁcient inference into the learning steps, we can obtain a learning algorithm using alternating low-rank corrections with complexity O(kn2 + n2 log n) per iteration. We perform experiments using both synthetic data as well as real data of ﬂight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of various sizes. 1</p><p>5 0.20813657 <a title="83-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>6 0.15225826 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>

In this paper we go one step further and address the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks. We deﬁne a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution object detections at a low cost by a few network applications. State-of-the-art performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC. 1</p><p>6 0.70194286 <a title="83-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Hristo S. Paskov, Robert West, John C. Mitchell, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised feature learning for text data. Our method is grounded in the principle of minimum description length and uses a dictionary-based compression scheme to extract a succinct feature set. Specifically, our method ﬁnds a set of word k-grams that minimizes the cost of reconstructing the text losslessly. We formulate document compression as a binary optimization task and show how to solve it approximately via a sequence of reweighted linear programs that are efﬁcient to solve and parallelizable. As our method is unsupervised, features may be extracted once and subsequently used in a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the performance of these features over a range of scenarios including unsupervised exploratory analysis and supervised text categorization. Our compressed feature space is two orders of magnitude smaller than the full k-gram space and matches the text categorization accuracy achieved in the full feature space. This dimensionality reduction not only results in faster training times, but it can also help elucidate structure in unsupervised learning tasks and reduce the amount of training data necessary for supervised learning. 1</p><p>3 0.89630395 <a title="83-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>4 0.89436531 <a title="83-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Hierarchical_Modular_Optimization_of_Convolutional_Networks_Achieves_Representations_Similar_to_Macaque_IT_and_Human_Ventral_Stream.html">136 nips-2013-Hierarchical Modular Optimization of Convolutional Networks Achieves Representations Similar to Macaque IT and Human Ventral Stream</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel L. Yamins, Ha Hong, Charles Cadieu, James J. DiCarlo</p><p>Abstract: Humans recognize visually-presented objects rapidly and accurately. To understand this ability, we seek to construct models of the ventral stream, the series of cortical areas thought to subserve object recognition. One tool to assess the quality of a model of the ventral stream is the Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM), which uses a set of visual stimuli and measures the distances produced in either the brain (i.e. fMRI voxel responses, neural ﬁring rates) or in models (features). Previous work has shown that all known models of the ventral stream fail to capture the RDM pattern observed in either IT cortex, the highest ventral area, or in the human ventral stream. In this work, we construct models of the ventral stream using a novel optimization procedure for category-level object recognition problems, and produce RDMs resembling both macaque IT and human ventral stream. The model, while novel in the optimization procedure, further develops a long-standing functional hypothesis that the ventral visual stream is a hierarchically arranged series of processing stages optimized for visual object recognition. 1</p><p>5 0.89222556 <a title="83-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>6 0.88519841 <a title="83-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Regret_based_Robust_Solutions_for_Uncertain_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">270 nips-2013-Regret based Robust Solutions for Uncertain Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

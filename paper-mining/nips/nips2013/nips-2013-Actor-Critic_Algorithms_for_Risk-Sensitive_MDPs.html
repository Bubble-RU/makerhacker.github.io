<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>3 0.36042133 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Variational_Policy_Search_via_Trajectory_Optimization.html">348 nips-2013-Variational Policy Search via Trajectory Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Levine, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: In order to learn effective control policies for dynamical systems, policy search methods must be able to discover successful executions of the desired task. While random exploration can work well in simple domains, complex and highdimensional tasks present a serious challenge, particularly when combined with high-dimensional policies that make parameter-space exploration infeasible. We present a method that uses trajectory optimization as a powerful exploration strategy that guides the policy search. A variational decomposition of a maximum likelihood policy objective allows us to use standard trajectory optimization algorithms such as differential dynamic programming, interleaved with standard supervised learning for the policy itself. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can outperform prior methods on two challenging locomotion tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.31871992 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_policy_iteration_and_natural_actor-critic%3A_A_unifying_view_and_a_non-optimality_result.html">239 nips-2013-Optimistic policy iteration and natural actor-critic: A unifying view and a non-optimality result</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem are often categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. As our ﬁrst main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD(λ)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of softgreedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward an optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations (either in state estimation or in value function representation), the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality. 1</p><p>5 0.30344847 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Reward_Mapping_for_Transfer_in_Long-Lived_Agents.html">278 nips-2013-Reward Mapping for Transfer in Long-Lived Agents</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: We consider how to transfer knowledge from previous tasks (MDPs) to a current task in long-lived and bounded agents that must solve a sequence of tasks over a ﬁnite lifetime. A novel aspect of our transfer approach is that we reuse reward functions. While this may seem counterintuitive, we build on the insight of recent work on the optimal rewards problem that guiding an agent’s behavior with reward functions other than the task-specifying reward function can help overcome computational bounds of the agent. Speciﬁcally, we use good guidance reward functions learned on previous tasks in the sequence to incrementally train a reward mapping function that maps task-specifying reward functions into good initial guidance reward functions for subsequent tasks. We demonstrate that our approach can substantially improve the agent’s performance relative to other approaches, including an approach that transfers policies. 1</p><p>6 0.26321426 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Robust_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">273 nips-2013-Reinforcement Learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiang Cheng, Qiang Liu, Feng Chen, Alex Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are extremely useful for modeling and solving sequential decision making problems. Graph-based MDPs provide a compact representation for MDPs with large numbers of random variables. However, the complexity of exactly solving a graph-based MDP usually grows exponentially in the number of variables, which limits their application. We present a new variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms. In particular, by exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is ﬁrst approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence is optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential in only the cluster size of the graph. Experimental comparison on different models shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approximation algorithms at ﬁnding good policies. 1</p><p>4 0.73147714 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Aswin Raghavan, Roni Khardon, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. Our ﬁrst contribution is a symbolic implementation of Modiﬁed Policy Iteration (MPI) for factored actions that views policy evaluation as policy-constrained value iteration (VI). Unfortunately, a na¨ve approach ı to enforce policy constraints can lead to large memory requirements, sometimes making symbolic MPI worse than VI. We address this through our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent algorithm lying between VI and MPI, that applies policy constraints if it does not increase the size of the value function representation, and otherwise performs VI backups. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners. 1</p><p>6 0.6876865 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Policy_Shaping%3A_Integrating_Human_Feedback_with_Reinforcement_Learning.html">250 nips-2013-Policy Shaping: Integrating Human Feedback with Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Mahito Sugiyama, Karsten Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: Distance-based approaches to outlier detection are popular in data mining, as they do not require to model the underlying probability distribution, which is particularly challenging for high-dimensional data. We present an empirical comparison of various approaches to distance-based outlier detection across a large number of datasets. We report the surprising observation that a simple, sampling-based scheme outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both efﬁciency and effectiveness. To better understand this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis why the sampling-based approach outperforms alternative methods based on k-nearest neighbor search. 1</p><p>3 0.82971507 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>

In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>4 0.82787204 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced_Associative_Memories.html">210 nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced Associative Memories</a></p>
<p>Author: Amin Karbasi, Amir Hesam Salavati, Amin Shokrollahi, Lav R. Varshney</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in associative memory design through structured pattern sets and graph-based inference algorithms allow reliable learning and recall of exponential numbers of patterns. Though these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons compute noiselessly, in contrast to highly variable neurons in hippocampus and olfactory cortex. Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as internal noise is less than a speciﬁed threshold, error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show internal noise actually improves performance of the recall phase. Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional beneﬁt to noisy neurons in biological neuronal networks. 1</p><p>5 0.8270272 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Bellman_Error_Based_Feature_Generation_using_Random_Projections_on_Sparse_Spaces.html">55 nips-2013-Bellman Error Based Feature Generation using Random Projections on Sparse Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Mahdi Milani Fard, Yuri Grinberg, Amir massoud Farahmand, Joelle Pineau, Doina Precup</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of automatic generation of features for value function approximation in reinforcement learning. Bellman Error Basis Functions (BEBFs) have been shown to improve policy evaluation, with a convergence rate similar to that of value iteration. We propose a simple, fast and robust algorithm based on random projections, which generates BEBFs for sparse feature spaces. We provide a ﬁnite sample analysis of the proposed method, and prove that projections logarithmic in the dimension of the original space guarantee a contraction in the error. Empirical results demonstrate the strength of this method in domains in which choosing a good state representation is challenging. 1</p><p>6 0.82659817 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Synthesizing_Robust_Plans_under_Incomplete_Domain_Models.html">323 nips-2013-Synthesizing Robust Plans under Incomplete Domain Models</a></p>

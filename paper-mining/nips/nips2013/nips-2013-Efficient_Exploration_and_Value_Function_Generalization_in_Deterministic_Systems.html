<p>Author: Alexander Zimin, Gergely Neu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning in ﬁnite episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the loss function is allowed to change between episodes. The natural performance measure in this learning problem is the regret deﬁned as the difference between the total loss of the best stationary policy and the total loss suffered by the learner. We assume that the learner is given access to a ﬁnite action space A and the state space X has a layered structure with L layers, so that state transitions are only possible between consecutive layers. We describe a variant of the recently proposed Relative Entropy Policy Search algorithm and show that its regret after T episodes is 2 L|X ||A|T log(|X ||A|/L) in the bandit setting and 2L T log(|X ||A|/L) in the full information setting, given that the learner has perfect knowledge of the transition probabilities of the underlying MDP. These guarantees largely improve previously known results under much milder assumptions and cannot be signiﬁcantly improved under general assumptions. 1</p><p>3 0.27035627 <a title="103-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-%28More%29_Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_via_Posterior_Sampling.html">1 nips-2013-(More) Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Posterior Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Osband, Dan Russo, Benjamin Van Roy</p><p>Abstract: Most provably-eﬃcient reinforcement learning algorithms introduce optimism about poorly-understood states and actions to encourage exploration. We study an alternative approach for eﬃcient exploration: posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally eﬃcient and allows an √ agent to encode prior knowledge ˜ in a natural way. We establish an O(τ S AT ) bound on expected regret, where T is time, τ is the episode length and S and A are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This bound is one of the ﬁrst for an algorithm not based on optimism, and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. We show through simulation that PSRL signiﬁcantly outperforms existing algorithms with similar regret bounds. 1</p><p>4 0.25851485 <a title="103-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Robust_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">273 nips-2013-Reinforcement Learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiau Hong Lim, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge in Markov decision processes is to ensure robustness with respect to unexpected or adversarial system behavior while taking advantage of well-behaving parts of the system. We consider a problem setting where some unknown parts of the state space can have arbitrary transitions while other parts are purely stochastic. We devise an algorithm that is adaptive to potentially adversarial behavior and show that it achieves similar regret bounds as the purely stochastic case. 1</p><p>5 0.18566483 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Eluder_Dimension_and_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Optimistic_Exploration.html">106 nips-2013-Eluder Dimension and the Sample Complexity of Optimistic Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Russo, Benjamin Van Roy</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sample complexity of the multi-armed bandit with dependencies among the arms. Some of the most successful algorithms for this problem use the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to guide exploration. The clearest example of this is the class of upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) algorithms, but recent work has shown that a simple posterior sampling algorithm, sometimes called Thompson sampling, can be analyzed in the same manner as optimistic approaches. In this paper, we develop a regret bound that holds for both classes of algorithms. This bound applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. It depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm regret bounds for speciﬁc model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. 1</p><p>6 0.18405904 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Policy_Shaping%3A_Integrating_Human_Feedback_with_Reinforcement_Learning.html">250 nips-2013-Policy Shaping: Integrating Human Feedback with Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Asrar Ahmed, Pradeep Varakantham, Yossiri Adulyasak, Patrick Jaillet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we seek robust policies for uncertain Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Most robust optimization approaches for these problems have focussed on the computation of maximin policies which maximize the value corresponding to the worst realization of the uncertainty. Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.</p><p>6 0.57879311 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Policy_Shaping%3A_Integrating_Human_Feedback_with_Reinforcement_Learning.html">250 nips-2013-Policy Shaping: Integrating Human Feedback with Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, Thiago B. Costa, Stanley H. Chan</p><p>Abstract: Non-parametric approaches for analyzing network data based on exchangeable graph models (ExGM) have recently gained interest. The key object that deﬁnes an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon. This non-parametric perspective on network modeling poses challenging questions on how to make inference on the graphon underlying observed network data. In this paper, we propose a computationally efﬁcient procedure to estimate a graphon from a set of observed networks generated from it. This procedure is based on a stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) of the graphon. We show that, by approximating the graphon with a stochastic block model, the graphon can be consistently estimated, that is, the estimation error vanishes as the size of the graph approaches inﬁnity.</p><p>2 0.82978874 <a title="103-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Recurrent_networks_of_coupled_Winner-Take-All_oscillators_for_solving_constraint_satisfaction_problems.html">267 nips-2013-Recurrent networks of coupled Winner-Take-All oscillators for solving constraint satisfaction problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Hesham Mostafa, Lorenz. K. Mueller, Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: We present a recurrent neuronal network, modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system, that can solve constraint satisfaction problems. Discrete variables are represented by coupled Winner-Take-All (WTA) networks, and their values are encoded in localized patterns of oscillations that are learned by the recurrent weights in these networks. Constraints over the variables are encoded in the network connectivity. Although there are no sources of noise, the network can escape from local optima in its search for solutions that satisfy all constraints by modifying the effective network connectivity through oscillations. If there is no solution that satisﬁes all constraints, the network state changes in a seemingly random manner and its trajectory approximates a sampling procedure that selects a variable assignment with a probability that increases with the fraction of constraints satisﬁed by this assignment. External evidence, or input to the network, can force variables to speciﬁc values. When new inputs are applied, the network re-evaluates the entire set of variables in its search for states that satisfy the maximum number of constraints, while being consistent with the external input. Our results demonstrate that the proposed network architecture can perform a deterministic search for the optimal solution to problems with non-convex cost functions. The network is inspired by canonical microcircuit models of the cortex and suggests possible dynamical mechanisms to solve constraint satisfaction problems that can be present in biological networks, or implemented in neuromorphic electronic circuits. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8163296 <a title="103-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Exploration_and_Value_Function_Generalization_in_Deterministic_Systems.html">103 nips-2013-Efficient Exploration and Value Function Generalization in Deterministic Systems</a></p>

We establish further efﬁciency and asymptotic performance guarantees that apply even if Q⇤ does not lie in Q, for the special case where Q is the span of pre-speciﬁed indicator functions over disjoint sets. 1</p><p>4 0.80795604 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>5 0.77245092 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We provide several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm based on the idea of predictable sequences. First, we recover the Mirror Prox algorithm for ofﬂine optimization, prove an extension to H¨ lder-smooth o functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a ﬁnite zero-sum matrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate of O((log T )￿T ). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al [6]. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximate Max Flow problem. 1</p><p>6 0.77219564 <a title="103-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Dropout_Training_as_Adaptive_Regularization.html">99 nips-2013-Dropout Training as Adaptive Regularization</a></p>

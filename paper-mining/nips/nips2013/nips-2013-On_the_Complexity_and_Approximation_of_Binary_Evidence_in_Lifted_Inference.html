<p>Author: Nima Taghipour, Jesse Davis, Hendrik Blockeel</p><p>Abstract: Lifting attempts to speedup probabilistic inference by exploiting symmetries in the model. Exact lifted inference methods, like their propositional counterparts, work by recursively decomposing the model and the problem. In the propositional case, there exist formal structures, such as decomposition trees (dtrees), that represent such a decomposition and allow us to determine the complexity of inference a priori. However, there is currently no equivalent structure nor analogous complexity results for lifted inference. In this paper, we introduce FO-dtrees, which upgrade propositional dtrees to the ﬁrst-order level. We show how these trees can characterize a lifted inference solution for a probabilistic logical model (in terms of a sequence of lifted operations), and make a theoretical analysis of the complexity of lifted inference in terms of the novel notion of lifted width for the tree. 1</p><p>3 0.13338371 <a title="220-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Deep_Learning.html">350 nips-2013-Wavelets on Graphs via Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Raif Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of applications require processing of signals deﬁned on weighted graphs. While wavelets provide a ﬂexible tool for signal processing in the classical setting of regular domains, the existing graph wavelet constructions are less ﬂexible – they are guided solely by the structure of the underlying graph and do not take directly into consideration the particular class of signals to be processed. This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. Our construction uses the lifting scheme, and is based on the observation that the recurrent nature of the lifting scheme gives rise to a structure resembling a deep auto-encoder network. Particular properties that the resulting wavelets must satisfy determine the training objective and the structure of the involved neural networks. The training is unsupervised, and is conducted similarly to the greedy pre-training of a stack of auto-encoders. After training is completed, we obtain a linear wavelet transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph. Improved sparsity of our wavelet transform for the test signals is conﬁrmed via experiments both on synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.099348716 <a title="220-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_Hogwild_Parallel_Gaussian_Gibbs_Sampling.html">34 nips-2013-Analyzing Hogwild Parallel Gaussian Gibbs Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Johnson, James Saunderson, Alan Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Sampling inference methods are computationally difﬁcult to scale for many models in part because global dependencies can reduce opportunities for parallel computation. Without strict conditional independence structure among variables, standard Gibbs sampling theory requires sample updates to be performed sequentially, even if dependence between most variables is not strong. Empirical work has shown that some models can be sampled effectively by going “Hogwild” and simply running Gibbs updates in parallel with only periodic global communication, but the successes and limitations of such a strategy are not well understood. As a step towards such an understanding, we study the Hogwild Gibbs sampling strategy in the context of Gaussian distributions. We develop a framework which provides convergence conditions and error bounds along with simple proofs and connections to methods in numerical linear algebra. In particular, we show that if the Gaussian precision matrix is generalized diagonally dominant, then any Hogwild Gibbs sampler, with any update schedule or allocation of variables to processors, yields a stable sampling process with the correct sample mean. 1</p><p>5 0.098599166 <a title="220-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-More_data_speeds_up_training_time_in_learning_halfspaces_over_sparse_vectors.html">199 nips-2013-More data speeds up training time in learning halfspaces over sparse vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Daniely, Nati Linial, Shai Shalev-Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to ask whether it is possible to use data as a computational resource. That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to perform the learning task? We give the ﬁrst positive answer to this question for a natural supervised learning problem — we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors in {−1, 1, 0}n . This class is inefﬁciently learnable using O n/ 2 examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random 3CNF formulas is hard, it is impossible to efﬁciently learn this class using only O n/ 2 examples. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even O n1.499 / 2 examples do not sufﬁce. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efﬁciently ˜ using Ω n2 / 2 examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem. 1</p><p>6 0.088594876 <a title="220-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Expressive_Power_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">221 nips-2013-On the Expressive Power of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

Our technique is based on breaking the full rankings into pairwise comparisons, and then computing parameters that satisfy a set of generalized moment conditions. We identify conditions for the output of GMM to be unique, and identify a general class of consistent and inconsistent breakings. We then show by theory and experiments that our algorithms run signiﬁcantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while achieving competitive statistical efﬁciency. 1</p><p>6 0.2962693 <a title="220-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-More_data_speeds_up_training_time_in_learning_halfspaces_over_sparse_vectors.html">199 nips-2013-More data speeds up training time in learning halfspaces over sparse vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, James Cipar, Henggang Cui, Seunghak Lee, Jin Kyu Kim, Phillip B. Gibbons, Garth A. Gibson, Greg Ganger, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: We propose a parameter server system for distributed ML, which follows a Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) model of computation that maximizes the time computational workers spend doing useful work on ML algorithms, while still providing correctness guarantees. The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model’s values (parameters and variables), and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older, stale versions of these values from a local cache, instead of waiting to get them from a central storage. This signiﬁcantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values. We provide a proof of correctness under SSP, as well as empirical results demonstrating that the SSP model achieves faster algorithm convergence on several different ML problems, compared to fully-synchronous and asynchronous schemes. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70371723 <a title="220-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Complexity_and_Approximation_of_Binary_Evidence_in_Lifted_Inference.html">220 nips-2013-On the Complexity and Approximation of Binary Evidence in Lifted Inference</a></p>

This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically. 1</p><p>3 0.59376609 <a title="220-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_PCA_for_Contaminated_Data.html">232 nips-2013-Online PCA for Contaminated Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: We consider the online Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where contaminated samples (containing outliers) are revealed sequentially to the Principal Components (PCs) estimator. Due to their sensitiveness to outliers, previous online PCA algorithms fail in this case and their results can be arbitrarily skewed by the outliers. Here we propose the online robust PCA algorithm, which is able to improve the PCs estimation upon an initial one steadily, even when faced with a constant fraction of outliers. We show that the ﬁnal result of the proposed online RPCA has an acceptable degradation from the optimum. Actually, under mild conditions, online RPCA achieves the maximal robustness with a 50% breakdown point. Moreover, online RPCA is shown to be efﬁcient for both storage and computation, since it need not re-explore the previous samples as in traditional robust PCA algorithms. This endows online RPCA with scalability for large scale data. 1</p><p>4 0.56258029 <a title="220-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_to_Pass_Expectation_Propagation_Messages.html">168 nips-2013-Learning to Pass Expectation Propagation Messages</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Heess, Daniel Tarlow, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a popular approximate posterior inference algorithm that often provides a fast and accurate alternative to sampling-based methods. However, while the EP framework in theory allows for complex nonGaussian factors, there is still a signiﬁcant practical barrier to using them within EP, because doing so requires the implementation of message update operators, which can be difﬁcult and require hand-crafted approximations. In this work, we study the question of whether it is possible to automatically derive fast and accurate EP updates by learning a discriminative model (e.g., a neural network or random forest) to map EP message inputs to EP message outputs. We address the practical concerns that arise in the process, and we provide empirical analysis on several challenging and diverse factors, indicating that there is a space of factors where this approach appears promising. 1</p><p>5 0.56152558 <a title="220-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Using_multiple_samples_to_learn_mixture_models.html">344 nips-2013-Using multiple samples to learn mixture models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Rich Caruana</p><p>Abstract: In the mixture models problem it is assumed that there are K distributions θ1 , . . . , θK and one gets to observe a sample from a mixture of these distributions with unknown coeﬃcients. The goal is to associate instances with their generating distributions, or to identify the parameters of the hidden distributions. In this work we make the assumption that we have access to several samples drawn from the same K underlying distributions, but with diﬀerent mixing weights. As with topic modeling, having multiple samples is often a reasonable assumption. Instead of pooling the data into one sample, we prove that it is possible to use the diﬀerences between the samples to better recover the underlying structure. We present algorithms that recover the underlying structure under milder assumptions than the current state of art when either the dimensionality or the separation is high. The methods, when applied to topic modeling, allow generalization to words not present in the training data. 1</p><p>6 0.51633847 <a title="220-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-First-order_Decomposition_Trees.html">122 nips-2013-First-order Decomposition Trees</a></p>

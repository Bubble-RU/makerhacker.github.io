Our result provides for the ﬁrst time a rigorous solution of the mean ﬁled equations for the standard Hopﬁeld model and is in contrast to the mathematically unjustiﬁable replica technique that has been used hitherto for this derivation. We show that the critical temperature for stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree or multiplicity, when the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns is negligible compared to the network size. In the case of a single strong pattern, when the ratio of the number of all stored pattens and the network size is a positive constant, we obtain the distribution of the overlaps of the patterns with the mean ﬁeld and deduce that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for retrieving a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong pattern. This square law property provides justiﬁcation for using strong patterns to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in psychology and psychotherapy. 1 Introduction: Multiply learned patterns in Hopﬁeld networks The Hopﬁeld network as a model of associative memory and unsupervised learning was introduced in [23] and has been intensively studied from a wide range of viewpoints in the past thirty years. However, properties of a strong pattern, as a pattern that has been multiply stored or learned in these networks, have only been examined very recently, a surprising delay given that repetition of an activity is the basis of learning by the Hebbian rule and long term potentiation. In particular, while the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network with certain correlated patterns has been tackled [13, 25], the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong as well as random patterns has not been hitherto addressed. The notion of a strong pattern of a Hopﬁeld network has been proposed in [15] to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in developmental psychology and psychotherapy. This suggestion has been motivated by reviewing the pioneering work of Bowlby [9] in attachment theory and highlighting how a number of academic biologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists and neuroscientists have consistently regarded Hopﬁeld-like artiﬁcial neural networks as suitable tools to model cognitive and behavioural constructs as patterns that are deeply and repeatedly learned by individuals [11, 22, 24, 30, 29, 10]. A number of mathematical properties of strong patterns in Hopﬁeld networks, which give rise to strong attractors, have been derived in [15]. These show in particular that strong attractors are strongly stable; a series of experiments have also been carried out which conﬁrm the mathematical 1 results and also indicate that a strong pattern stored in the network can be retrieved even in the presence of a large number of simple patterns, far exceeding the well-known maximum load parameter or storage capacity of the Hopﬁeld network with random patterns (αc ≈ 0.138). In this paper, we consider strong patterns in stochastic Hopﬁeld model with temperature, which accounts for various types of noise in the network. In these networks, the updating rule is probabilistic and depend on the temperature. Since analytical solution of such a system is not possible in general, one strives to obtain the average behaviour of the network when the input to each node, the so-called ﬁeld at the node, is replaced with its mean. This is the basis of mean ﬁeld theory for these networks. Due to the close connection between the Hopﬁeld network and the Ising model in ferromagnetism [1, 8], the mean ﬁeld approach for the Hopﬁeld network and its variations has been tackled using the replica method, starting with the pioneering work of Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky [3, 2, 4, 19, 31, 1, 13]. Although this method has been widely used in the theory of spin glasses in statistical physics [26, 16] its mathematical justiﬁcation has proved to be elusive as we will discuss in the next section; see for example [20, page 264], [14, page 27], and [7, page 9]. In [17] and independently in [27], an alternative technique to the replica method for solving the mean ﬁeld equations has been proposed which is reproduced and characterised as heuristic in [20, section 2.5] since it relies on a number of assumptions that are not later justiﬁed and uses a number of mathematical steps that are not validated. Here, we use the basic idea of the above heuristic to develop a veriﬁable mathematical framework with provable results grounded on elements of probability theory, with which we assume the reader is familiar. This technique allows us to solve the mean ﬁeld equations for the Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong patterns and use the results to study, ﬁrst, the stability of these patterns in the presence of temperature (noise) and, second, the storage capacity of the network with a single strong pattern at temperature zero. We show that the critical temperature for the stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree (i.e., its multiplicity) when the ratio of the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns to the network size tends to zero when the latter tends to inﬁnity. In the case that there is only one strong pattern present with its degree small compared to the number of patterns and the latter is a ﬁxed multiple of the number of nodes, we ﬁnd the distribution of the overlap of the mean ﬁeld and the patterns when the strong pattern is being retrieved. We use these distributions to prove that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong attractor. This result matches the ﬁnding in [15] regarding the capacity of a network to recall strong patterns as mentioned above. Our results therefore show that strong patterns are robust and persistent in the network memory as attachment types and behavioural prototypes are in the human memory system. In this paper, we will several times use Lyapunov’s theorem in probability which provides a simple sufﬁcient condition to generalise the Central Limit theorem when we deal with independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. We require a general form of this theorem kn as follows. Let Yn = N i=1 Yni , for n ∈ I , be a triangular array of random variables such that for each n, the random variables Yni , for 1 ≤ i ≤ kn are independent with E(Yni ) = 0 2 2 and E(Yni ) = σni , where E(X) stands for the expected value of the random variable X. Let kn 2 2 sn = i=1 σni . We use the notation X ∼ Y when the two random variables X and Y have the same distribution (for large n if either or both of them depend on n). Theorem 1.1 (Lyapunov’s theorem [6, page 368]) If for some δ > 0, we have the condition: 1 E(|Yn |2+δ |) → 0 s2+δ n d d as n → ∞ then s1 Yn −→ N (0, 1) as n → ∞ where −→ denotes convergence in distribution, and we denote n by N (a, σ 2 ) the normal distribution with mean a and variance σ 2 . Thus, for large n we have Yn ∼ N (0, s2 ). n 2 2 Mean ﬁeld theory We consider a Hopﬁeld network with N neurons i = 1, . . . , N with values Si = ±1 and follow the notations in [20]. As in [15], we assume patterns can be multiply stored and the degree of a pattern is deﬁned as its multiplicity. The total number of patterns, counting their multiplicity, is denoted by p and we assume there are n patterns ξ 1 , . . . , ξ n with degrees d1 , . . . , dn ≥ 1 respectively and that n the remaining p − k=1 dk ≥ 0 patterns are simple, i.e., each has degree one. Note that by our assumptions there are precisely n p0 = p + n − dk k=1 distinct patterns, which we assume are independent and identically distributed with equal probability of taking value ±1 for each node. More generally, for any non-negative integer k ∈ I , we let N p0 dk . µ pk = µ=1 p µ µ 0 1 We use the generalized Hebbian rule for the synaptic couplings: wij = N µ=1 dµ ξi ξj for i = j with wii = 0 for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N . As in the standard stochastic Hopﬁeld model [20], we use Glauber dynamics [18] for the stochastic updating rule with pseudo-temperature T > 0, which accounts for various types of noise in the network, and assume zero bias in the local ﬁeld. Putting β = 1/T (i.e., with the Boltzmann constant kB = 1) and letting fβ (h) = 1/(1 + exp(−2βh)), the stochastic updating rule at time t is given by: N Pr(Si (t + 1) = ±1) = fβ (±hi (t)), where hi (t) = wij Sj (t), (1) j=1 is the local ﬁeld at i at time t. The updating is implemented asynchronously in a random way. The energy of the network in the conﬁguration S = (Si )N is given by i=1 N 1 Si Sj wij . H(S) = − 2 i,j=1 For large N , this speciﬁes a complex system, with an underlying state space of dimension 2N , which in general cannot be solved exactly. However, mean ﬁeld theory has proved very useful in studying Hopﬁeld networks. The average updated value of Si (t + 1) in Equation (1) is Si (t + 1) = 1/(1 + e−2βhi (t) ) − 1/(1 + e2βhi (t) ) = tanh(βhi (t)), (2) where . . . denotes taking average with respect to the probability distribution in the updating rule in Equation (1). The stationary solution for the mean ﬁeld thus satisﬁes: Si = tanh(βhi ) , (3) The average overlap of pattern ξ µ with the mean ﬁeld at the nodes of the network is given by: mν = 1 N N ν ξi Si (4) i=1 The replica technique for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, used in the case p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞, seeks to obtain the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) by evaluating the partition function of the system, namely, Z = TrS exp(−βH(S)), where the trace TrS stands for taking sum over all possible conﬁgurations S = (Si )N . As it i=1 is generally the case in statistical physics, once the partition function of the system is obtained, 3 all required physical quantities can in principle be computed. However, in this case, the partition function is very difﬁcult to compute since it entails computing the average log Z of log Z, where . . . indicates averaging over the random distribution of the stored patterns ξ µ . To overcome this problem, the identity Zk − 1 log Z = lim k→0 k is used to reduce the problem to ﬁnding the average Z k of Z k , which is then computed for positive integer values of k. For such k, we have: Z k = TrS 1 TrS 2 . . . TrS k exp(−β(H(S 1 ) + H(S 1 ) + . . . + H(S k ))), where for each i = 1, . . . , k the super-scripted conﬁguration S i is a replica of the conﬁguration state. In computing the trace over each replica, various parameters are obtained and the replica symmetry condition assumes that these parameters are independent of the particular replica under consideration. Apart from this assumption, there are two basic mathematical problems with the technique which makes it unjustiﬁable [20, page 264]. Firstly, the positive integer k above is eventually treated as a real number near zero without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Secondly, the order of taking limits, in particular the order of taking the two limits k → 0 and N → ∞, are several times interchanged again without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Here, we develop a mathematically rigorous method for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, i.e., computing the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) in the case of p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞. Our method turns the basic idea of the heuristic presented in [17] and reproduced in [20] for solving the mean ﬁeld equation into a mathematically veriﬁable formalism, which for the standard Hopﬁeld network with random stored patterns gives the same result as the replica method, assuming replica symmetry. In the presence of strong patterns we obtain a set of new results as explained in the next two sections. The mean ﬁeld equation is obtained from Equation (3) by approximating the right hand side of N this equation by the value of tanh at the mean ﬁeld hi = j=1 wij Sj , ignoring the sum N j=1 wij (Sj − Sj ) for large N [17, page 32]: Si = tanh(β hi ) = tanh β N N j=1 p0 µ=1 µ µ dµ ξi ξj Sj . (5) Equation (5) gives the mean ﬁeld equation for the Hopﬁeld network with n possible strong patterns n ξ µ (1 ≤ µ ≤ n) and p − µ=1 dµ simple patterns ξ µ with n + 1 ≤ µ ≤ p0 . As in the standard Hopﬁeld model, where all patterns are simple, we have two cases to deal with. However, we now have to account for the presence of strong attractors and our two cases will be as follows: (i) In the p0 ﬁrst case we assume p2 := µ=1 d2 = o(N ), which includes the simpler case p2 N when p2 µ is ﬁxed and independent of N . (ii) In the second case we assume we have a single strong attractor with the load parameter p/N = α > 0. 3 Stability of strong patterns with noise: p2 = o(N ) The case of constant p and N → ∞ is usually referred to as α = 0 in the standard Hopﬁeld model. Here, we need to consider the sum of degrees of all stored patterns (and not just the number of patterns) compared to N . We solve the mean ﬁeld equation with T > 0 by using a method similar in spirit to [20, page 33] for the standard Hopﬁeld model, but in our case strong patterns induce a sequence of independent but non-identically distributed random variables in the crosstalk term, where the Central Limit Theorem cannot be used; we show however that Lyapunov’s theorem (Theorem (1.1) can be invoked. In retrieving pattern ξ 1 , we look for a solution of the mean ﬁled 1 equation of the form: Si = mξi , where m > 0 is a constant. Using Equation (5) and separating 1 the contribution of ξ in the argument of tanh, we obtain:  1 mξi = tanh    mβ  1 d1 ξi + N 4 µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj  . j=i,µ>1 (6) For each N , µ > 1 and j = i, let dµ µ µ 1 (7) ξ ξ ξ . N i j j 2 This gives (p0 − 1)(N − 1) independent random variables with E(YN µj ) = 0, E(YN µj ) = d2 /N 2 , µ 3 3 3 and E(|YN µj |) = dµ /N . We have: YN µj = s2 := N 2 E(YN µj ) = µ>1,j=i 1 N −1 d2 ∼ N 2 µ>1 µ N d2 . µ (8) µ>1 Thus, as N → ∞, we have: 1 s3 N 3 E(|YN µj |) ∼ √ µ>1,j=i µ>1 N( d3 µ µ>1 d2 )3/2 µ → 0. (9) as N → ∞ since for positive numbers dµ we always have µ>1 d3 < ( µ>1 d2 )3/2 . Thus the µ µ Lyapunov condition is satisﬁed for δ = 1. By Lyapunov’s theorem we deduce: 1 N µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj ∼ N d2 /N µ 0, (10) µ>1 µ>1,j=i Since we also have p2 = o(N ), it follows that we can ignore the second term, i.e., the crosstalk term, in the argument of tanh in Equation (6) as N → ∞; we thus obtain: m = tanh βd1 m. (11) To examine the ﬁxed points of the Equation (11), we let d = d1 for convenience and put x = βdm = dm/T , so that tanh x = T x/d; see Figure 1. It follows that Tc = d is the critical temperature. If T < d then there is a non-zero (non-trivial) solution for m, whereas for T > d we only have the trivial solution. For d = 1 our solution is that of the standard Hopﬁeld network as in [20, page 34].

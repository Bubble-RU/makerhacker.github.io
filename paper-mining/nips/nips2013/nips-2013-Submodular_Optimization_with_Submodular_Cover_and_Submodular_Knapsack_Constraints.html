<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Stefanie Jegelka, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three related and important problems connected to machine learning: approximating a submodular function everywhere, learning a submodular function (in a PAC-like setting [28]), and constrained minimization of submodular functions. We show that the complexity of all three problems depends on the “curvature” of the submodular function, and provide lower and upper bounds that reﬁne and improve previous results [2, 6, 8, 27]. Our proof techniques are fairly generic. We either use a black-box transformation of the function (for approximation and learning), or a transformation of algorithms to use an appropriate surrogate function (for minimization). Curiously, curvature has been known to inﬂuence approximations for submodular maximization [3, 29], but its effect on minimization, approximation and learning has hitherto been open. We complete this picture, and also support our theoretical claims by empirical results. 1</p><p>3 0.43239507 <a title="319-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Reflection_methods_for_user-friendly_submodular_optimization.html">268 nips-2013-Reflection methods for user-friendly submodular optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefanie Jegelka, Francis Bach, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it has become evident that submodularity naturally captures widely occurring concepts in machine learning, signal processing and computer vision. Consequently, there is need for efﬁcient optimization procedures for submodular functions, especially for minimization problems. While general submodular minimization is challenging, we propose a new method that exploits existing decomposability of submodular functions. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and parallelize. A key component of our method is a formulation of the discrete submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem that is solved through a sequence of reﬂections, and its solution can be easily thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. This method solves both the continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction. In our experiments, we illustrate the beneﬁts of our method on two image segmentation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.4278962 <a title="319-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Submodular_Maximization%3A_Identifying_Representative_Elements_in_Massive_Data.html">97 nips-2013-Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Amin Karbasi, Rik Sarkar, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many large-scale machine learning problems (such as clustering, non-parametric learning, kernel machines, etc.) require selecting, out of a massive data set, a manageable yet representative subset. Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set function subject to cardinality constraints. Classical approaches require centralized access to the full data set; but for truly large-scale problems, rendering the data centrally is often impractical. In this paper, we consider the problem of submodular function maximization in a distributed fashion. We develop a simple, two-stage protocol G REE D I, that is easily implemented using MapReduce style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and show, that under certain natural conditions, performance close to the (impractical) centralized approach can be achieved. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, including sparse Gaussian process inference and exemplar-based clustering, on tens of millions of data points using Hadoop. 1</p><p>5 0.28244442 <a title="319-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Submodular_Maximization_in_Bandit_Setting.html">29 nips-2013-Adaptive Submodular Maximization in Bandit Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Branislav Kveton, Zheng Wen, Brian Eriksson, S. Muthukrishnan</p><p>Abstract: Maximization of submodular functions has wide applications in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Adaptive submodular maximization has been traditionally studied under the assumption that the model of the world, the expected gain of choosing an item given previously selected items and their states, is known. In this paper, we study the setting where the expected gain is initially unknown, and it is learned by interacting repeatedly with the optimized function. We propose an efﬁcient algorithm for solving our problem and prove that its expected cumulative regret increases logarithmically with time. Our regret bound captures the inherent property of submodular maximization, earlier mistakes are more costly than later ones. We refer to our approach as Optimistic Adaptive Submodular Maximization (OASM) because it trades off exploration and exploitation based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle. We evaluate our method on a preference elicitation problem and show that non-trivial K-step policies can be learned from just a few hundred interactions with the problem. 1</p><p>6 0.16578972 <a title="319-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinwoo Shin, Andrew E. Gelfand, Misha Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: Max-product ‘belief propagation’ (BP) is a popular distributed heuristic for ﬁnding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint probability distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It was recently shown that BP converges to the correct MAP assignment for a class of loopy GMs with the following common feature: the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation to the MAP problem is tight (has no integrality gap). Unfortunately, tightness of the LP relaxation does not, in general, guarantee convergence and correctness of the BP algorithm. The failure of BP in such cases motivates reverse engineering a solution – namely, given a tight LP, can we design a ‘good’ BP algorithm. In this paper, we design a BP algorithm for the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem over general graphs. We prove that the algorithm converges to the correct optimum if the respective LP relaxation, which may include inequalities associated with non-intersecting odd-sized cycles, is tight. The most signiﬁcant part of our approach is the introduction of a novel graph transformation designed to force convergence of BP. Our theoretical result suggests an efﬁcient BP-based heuristic for the MWM problem, which consists of making sequential, “cutting plane”, modiﬁcations to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this heuristic performs as well as traditional cutting-plane algorithms using LP solvers on MWM problems. 1</p><p>2 0.66911274 <a title="319-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Latent_Maximum_Margin_Clustering.html">148 nips-2013-Latent Maximum Margin Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang-Tong Zhou, Tian Lan, Arash Vahdat, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We present a maximum margin framework that clusters data using latent variables. Using latent representations enables our framework to model unobserved information embedded in the data. We implement our idea by large margin learning, and develop an alternating descent algorithm to effectively solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. We instantiate our latent maximum margin clustering framework with tag-based video clustering tasks, where each video is represented by a latent tag model describing the presence or absence of video tags. Experimental results obtained on three standard datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-latent maximum margin clustering as well as conventional clustering approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.64383221 <a title="319-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Submodular_Optimization_with_Submodular_Cover_and_Submodular_Knapsack_Constraints.html">319 nips-2013-Submodular Optimization with Submodular Cover and Submodular Knapsack Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate two new optimization problems — minimizing a submodular function subject to a submodular lower bound constraint (submodular cover) and maximizing a submodular function subject to a submodular upper bound constraint (submodular knapsack). We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 25] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.63281769 <a title="319-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Context-sensitive_active_sensing_in_humans.html">69 nips-2013-Context-sensitive active sensing in humans</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheeraz Ahmad, He Huang, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Humans and animals readily utilize active sensing, or the use of self-motion, to focus sensory and cognitive resources on the behaviorally most relevant stimuli and events in the environment. Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artiﬁcial systems. Recently, we proposed a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, C-DAC (ContextDependent Active Controller) (Ahmad & Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We ﬁnd that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better ﬁt to human data than Infomax (Butko & Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving signiﬁcant computational savings. 1</p><p>5 0.60086995 <a title="319-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Third-Order_Edge_Statistics%3A_Contour_Continuation%2C_Curvature%2C_and_Cortical_Connections.html">329 nips-2013-Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Lawlor, Steven W. Zucker</p><p>Abstract: Association ﬁeld models have attempted to explain human contour grouping performance, and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections across cortical columns in V1. However, association ﬁelds only depend on the pairwise statistics of edges in natural scenes. We develop a spectral test of the sufﬁciency of pairwise statistics and show there is signiﬁcant higher order structure. An analysis using a probabilistic spectral embedding reveals curvature-dependent components. 1</p><p>6 0.524912 <a title="319-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Curvature_and_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Learning_and_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions.html">78 nips-2013-Curvature and Optimal Algorithms for Learning and Minimizing Submodular Functions</a></p>

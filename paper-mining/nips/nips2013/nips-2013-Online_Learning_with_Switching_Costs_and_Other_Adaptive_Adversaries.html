<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi, Peter Bartlett, Varun Kanade, Yevgeny Seldin, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a mixing assumption, achieves p O( T log |⇧| + log |⇧|) regret with respect to a comparison set of policies ⇧. The regret is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When expectations over sample paths can be computed efﬁciently and the comparison set ⇧ has polynomial size, this algorithm is efﬁcient. We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path problem. Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identiﬁed start and ﬁnish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to ﬁnish node. At the end of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges) is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to a ﬁxed policy for selecting paths. This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, the problem can be efﬁciently solved. We show that it also can be efﬁciently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses. When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efﬁcient algorithms for the adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a notoriously difﬁcult problem that has been used to design efﬁcient cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs. 1</p><p>3 0.36980706 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We provide several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm based on the idea of predictable sequences. First, we recover the Mirror Prox algorithm for ofﬂine optimization, prove an extension to H¨ lder-smooth o functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a ﬁnite zero-sum matrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate of O((log T )￿T ). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al [6]. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximate Max Flow problem. 1</p><p>4 0.33976883 <a title="231-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Robust_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">273 nips-2013-Reinforcement Learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiau Hong Lim, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge in Markov decision processes is to ensure robustness with respect to unexpected or adversarial system behavior while taking advantage of well-behaving parts of the system. We consider a problem setting where some unknown parts of the state space can have arbitrary transitions while other parts are purely stochastic. We devise an algorithm that is adaptive to potentially adversarial behavior and show that it achieves similar regret bounds as the purely stochastic case. 1</p><p>5 0.33395725 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-%28Nearly%29_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Private_Online_Learning_in_Full-information_and_Bandit_Settings.html">2 nips-2013-(Nearly) Optimal Algorithms for Private Online Learning in Full-information and Bandit Settings</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Adam Smith</p><p>Abstract: We give differentially private algorithms for a large class of online learning algorithms, in both the full information and bandit settings. Our algorithms aim to minimize a convex loss function which is a sum of smaller convex loss terms, one for each data point. To design our algorithms, we modify the popular mirror descent approach, or rather a variant called follow the approximate leader. The technique leads to the ﬁrst nonprivate algorithms for private online learning in the bandit setting. In the full information setting, our algorithms improve over the regret bounds of previous work (due to Dwork, Naor, Pitassi and Rothblum (2010) and Jain, Kothari and Thakurta (2012)). In many cases, our algorithms (in both settings) match the dependence on the input length, T , of the optimal nonprivate regret bounds up to logarithmic factors in T . Our algorithms require logarithmic space and update time. 1</p><p>6 0.32684159 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>

<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen</p><p>Abstract: Performance guarantees for online learning algorithms typically take the form of regret bounds, which express that the cumulative loss overhead compared to the best expert in hindsight is small. In the common case of large but structured expert sets we typically wish to keep the regret especially small compared to simple experts, at the cost of modest additional overhead compared to more complex others. We study which such regret trade-offs can be achieved, and how. We analyse regret w.r.t. each individual expert as a multi-objective criterion in the simple but fundamental case of absolute loss. We characterise the achievable and Pareto optimal trade-offs, and the corresponding optimal strategies for each sample size both exactly for each ﬁnite horizon and asymptotically. 1</p><p>3 0.77473831 <a title="231-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>
<p>Author: Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir [14]. Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph (which must be accessible before selecting an action). In the undirected case, we show that the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>4 0.77323294 <a title="231-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Linear_Optimization.html">191 nips-2013-Minimax Optimal Algorithms for Unconstrained Linear Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan McMahan, Jacob Abernethy</p><p>Abstract: We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear optimization games where the player’s choice is unconstrained. The player strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a post-hoc benchmark strategy. While the standard benchmark is the loss of the best strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set, we consider a very broad range of benchmark functions. The problem is cast as a sequential multi-stage zero-sum game, and we give a thorough analysis of the minimax behavior of the game, providing characterizations for the value of the game, as well as both the player’s and the adversary’s optimal strategy. We show how these objects can be computed efﬁciently under certain circumstances, and by selecting an appropriate benchmark, we construct a novel hedging strategy for an unconstrained betting game. 1</p><p>5 0.76734406 <a title="231-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>

Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>3 0.87118506 <a title="231-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Adversarially_Chosen_Transition_Probability_Distributions.html">227 nips-2013-Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Adversarially Chosen Transition Probability Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi, Peter Bartlett, Varun Kanade, Yevgeny Seldin, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a mixing assumption, achieves p O( T log |⇧| + log |⇧|) regret with respect to a comparison set of policies ⇧. The regret is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When expectations over sample paths can be computed efﬁciently and the comparison set ⇧ has polynomial size, this algorithm is efﬁcient. We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path problem. Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identiﬁed start and ﬁnish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to ﬁnish node. At the end of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges) is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to a ﬁxed policy for selecting paths. This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, the problem can be efﬁciently solved. We show that it also can be efﬁciently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses. When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efﬁcient algorithms for the adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a notoriously difﬁcult problem that has been used to design efﬁcient cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs. 1</p><p>4 0.84560061 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-The_Pareto_Regret_Frontier.html">325 nips-2013-The Pareto Regret Frontier</a></p>
<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen</p><p>Abstract: Performance guarantees for online learning algorithms typically take the form of regret bounds, which express that the cumulative loss overhead compared to the best expert in hindsight is small. In the common case of large but structured expert sets we typically wish to keep the regret especially small compared to simple experts, at the cost of modest additional overhead compared to more complex others. We study which such regret trade-offs can be achieved, and how. We analyse regret w.r.t. each individual expert as a multi-objective criterion in the simple but fundamental case of absolute loss. We characterise the achievable and Pareto optimal trade-offs, and the corresponding optimal strategies for each sample size both exactly for each ﬁnite horizon and asymptotically. 1</p><p>5 0.82032043 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-%28Nearly%29_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Private_Online_Learning_in_Full-information_and_Bandit_Settings.html">2 nips-2013-(Nearly) Optimal Algorithms for Private Online Learning in Full-information and Bandit Settings</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Adam Smith</p><p>Abstract: We give differentially private algorithms for a large class of online learning algorithms, in both the full information and bandit settings. Our algorithms aim to minimize a convex loss function which is a sum of smaller convex loss terms, one for each data point. To design our algorithms, we modify the popular mirror descent approach, or rather a variant called follow the approximate leader. The technique leads to the ﬁrst nonprivate algorithms for private online learning in the bandit setting. In the full information setting, our algorithms improve over the regret bounds of previous work (due to Dwork, Naor, Pitassi and Rothblum (2010) and Jain, Kothari and Thakurta (2012)). In many cases, our algorithms (in both settings) match the dependence on the input length, T , of the optimal nonprivate regret bounds up to logarithmic factors in T . Our algorithms require logarithmic space and update time. 1</p><p>6 0.81918615 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Demixing_odors_-_fast_inference_in_olfaction.html">86 nips-2013-Demixing odors - fast inference in olfaction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashesh Jain, Brian Wojcik, Thorsten Joachims, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning good trajectories for manipulation tasks. This is challenging because the criterion deﬁning a good trajectory varies with users, tasks and environments. In this paper, we propose a co-active online learning framework for teaching robots the preferences of its users for object manipulation tasks. The key novelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user: the human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training data, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly improve over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that this co-active preference feedback can be more easily elicited from the user than demonstrations of optimal trajectories, which are often challenging and non-intuitive to provide on high degrees of freedom manipulators. Nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds of our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms. We demonstrate the generalizability of our algorithm on a variety of grocery checkout tasks, for whom, the preferences were not only inﬂuenced by the object being manipulated but also by the surrounding environment.1 1</p><p>4 0.20539792 <a title="16-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Sign_Cauchy_Projections_and_Chi-Square_Kernel.html">293 nips-2013-Sign Cauchy Projections and Chi-Square Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Gennady Samorodnitsk, John Hopcroft</p><p>Abstract: The method of stable random projections is useful for efﬁciently approximating the lα distance (0 < α ≤ 2) in high dimension and it is naturally suitable for data streams. In this paper, we propose to use only the signs of the projected data and we analyze the probability of collision (i.e., when the two signs differ). Interestingly, when α = 1 (i.e., Cauchy random projections), we show that the probability of collision can be accurately approximated as functions of the chi-square (χ2 ) similarity. In text and vision applications, the χ2 similarity is a popular measure when the features are generated from histograms (which are a typical example of data streams). Experiments conﬁrm that the proposed method is promising for large-scale learning applications. The full paper is available at arXiv:1308.1009. There are many future research problems. For example, when α → 0, the collision probability is a function of the resemblance (of the binary-quantized data). This provides an effective mechanism for resemblance estimation in data streams. 1</p><p>5 0.19540311 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Reward_Mapping_for_Transfer_in_Long-Lived_Agents.html">278 nips-2013-Reward Mapping for Transfer in Long-Lived Agents</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: We consider how to transfer knowledge from previous tasks (MDPs) to a current task in long-lived and bounded agents that must solve a sequence of tasks over a ﬁnite lifetime. A novel aspect of our transfer approach is that we reuse reward functions. While this may seem counterintuitive, we build on the insight of recent work on the optimal rewards problem that guiding an agent’s behavior with reward functions other than the task-specifying reward function can help overcome computational bounds of the agent. Speciﬁcally, we use good guidance reward functions learned on previous tasks in the sequence to incrementally train a reward mapping function that maps task-specifying reward functions into good initial guidance reward functions for subsequent tasks. We demonstrate that our approach can substantially improve the agent’s performance relative to other approaches, including an approach that transfers policies. 1</p><p>6 0.17102437 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Probabilistic_Movement_Primitives.html">255 nips-2013-Probabilistic Movement Primitives</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandros Paraschos, Christian Daniel, January Peters, Gerhard Neumann</p><p>Abstract: Movement Primitives (MP) are a well-established approach for representing modular and re-usable robot movement generators. Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios. 1</p><p>4 0.67826557 <a title="16-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Convergence_of_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_in_Simultaneous_Move_Games.html">71 nips-2013-Convergence of Monte Carlo Tree Search in Simultaneous Move Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Harish G. Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: The design of convex, calibrated surrogate losses, whose minimization entails consistency with respect to a desired target loss, is an important concept to have emerged in the theory of machine learning in recent years. We give an explicit construction of a convex least-squares type surrogate loss that can be designed to be calibrated for any multiclass learning problem for which the target loss matrix has a low-rank structure; the surrogate loss operates on a surrogate target space of dimension at most the rank of the target loss. We use this result to design convex calibrated surrogates for a variety of subset ranking problems, with target losses including the precision@q, expected rank utility, mean average precision, and pairwise disagreement. 1</p><p>2 0.78865635 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Blind_Calibration_in_Compressed_Sensing_using_Message_Passing_Algorithms.html">59 nips-2013-Blind Calibration in Compressed Sensing using Message Passing Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Christophe Schulke, Francesco Caltagirone, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova</p><p>Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) is a concept that allows to acquire compressible signals with a small number of measurements. As such it is very attractive for hardware implementations. Therefore, correct calibration of the hardware is a central issue. In this paper we study the so-called blind calibration, i.e. when the training signals that are available to perform the calibration are sparse but unknown. We extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm used in CS to the case of blind calibration. In the calibration-AMP, both the gains on the sensors and the elements of the signals are treated as unknowns. Our algorithm is also applicable to settings in which the sensors distort the measurements in other ways than multiplication by a gain, unlike previously suggested blind calibration algorithms based on convex relaxations. We study numerically the phase diagram of the blind calibration problem, and show that even in cases where convex relaxation is possible, our algorithm requires a smaller number of measurements and/or signals in order to perform well. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77399856 <a title="16-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-A_message-passing_algorithm_for_multi-agent_trajectory_planning.html">16 nips-2013-A message-passing algorithm for multi-agent trajectory planning</a></p>

<p>Author: Ben Shababo, Brooks Paige, Ari Pakman, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of modern stimulation techniques in neuroscience, the opportunity arises to map neuron to neuron connectivity. In this work, we develop a method for efﬁciently inferring posterior distributions over synaptic strengths in neural microcircuits. The input to our algorithm is data from experiments in which action potentials from putative presynaptic neurons can be evoked while a subthreshold recording is made from a single postsynaptic neuron. We present a realistic statistical model which accounts for the main sources of variability in this experiment and allows for signiﬁcant prior information about the connectivity and neuronal cell types to be incorporated if available. Due to the technical challenges and sparsity of these systems, it is important to focus experimental time stimulating the neurons whose synaptic strength is most ambiguous, therefore we also develop an online optimal design algorithm for choosing which neurons to stimulate at each trial. 1</p><p>5 0.68895882 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Projected_Natural_Actor-Critic.html">257 nips-2013-Projected Natural Actor-Critic</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas, William C. Dabney, Stephen Giguere, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: Natural actor-critics form a popular class of policy search algorithms for ﬁnding locally optimal policies for Markov decision processes. In this paper we address a drawback of natural actor-critics that limits their real-world applicability—their lack of safety guarantees. We present a principled algorithm for performing natural gradient descent over a constrained domain. In the context of reinforcement learning, this allows for natural actor-critic algorithms that are guaranteed to remain within a known safe region of policy space. While deriving our class of constrained natural actor-critic algorithms, which we call Projected Natural ActorCritics (PNACs), we also elucidate the relationship between natural gradient descent and mirror descent. 1</p><p>6 0.68612307 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Recurrent_networks_of_coupled_Winner-Take-All_oscillators_for_solving_constraint_satisfaction_problems.html">267 nips-2013-Recurrent networks of coupled Winner-Take-All oscillators for solving constraint satisfaction problems</a></p>

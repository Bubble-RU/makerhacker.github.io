<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>3 0.13002612 <a title="36-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Ratio_Matching_of_RBMs_for_Sparse_High-Dimensional_Inputs.html">315 nips-2013-Stochastic Ratio Matching of RBMs for Sparse High-Dimensional Inputs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yann Dauphin, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Sparse high-dimensional data vectors are common in many application domains where a very large number of rarely non-zero features can be devised. Unfortunately, this creates a computational bottleneck for unsupervised feature learning algorithms such as those based on auto-encoders and RBMs, because they involve a reconstruction step where the whole input vector is predicted from the current feature values. An algorithm was recently developed to successfully handle the case of auto-encoders, based on an importance sampling scheme stochastically selecting which input elements to actually reconstruct during training for each particular example. To generalize this idea to RBMs, we propose a stochastic ratio-matching algorithm that inherits all the computational advantages and unbiasedness of the importance sampling scheme. We show that stochastic ratio matching is a good estimator, allowing the approach to beat the state-of-the-art on two bag-of-word text classiﬁcation benchmarks (20 Newsgroups and RCV1), while keeping computational cost linear in the number of non-zeros. 1</p><p>4 0.12330399 <a title="36-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Hidden_Markov_Models_from_Non-sequence_Data_via_Tensor_Decomposition.html">155 nips-2013-Learning Hidden Markov Models from Non-sequence Data via Tensor Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Jeff Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic models from observed data has been a central issue in many scientiﬁc studies or engineering tasks. The usual setting is that data are collected sequentially from trajectories of some dynamical system operation. In quite a few modern scientiﬁc modeling tasks, however, it turns out that reliable sequential data are rather difﬁcult to gather, whereas out-of-order snapshots are much easier to obtain. Examples include the modeling of galaxies, chronic diseases such Alzheimer’s, or certain biological processes. Existing methods for learning dynamic model from non-sequence data are mostly based on Expectation-Maximization, which involves non-convex optimization and is thus hard to analyze. Inspired by recent advances in spectral learning methods, we propose to study this problem from a different perspective: moment matching and spectral decomposition. Under that framework, we identify reasonable assumptions on the generative process of non-sequence data, and propose learning algorithms based on the tensor decomposition method [2] to provably recover ﬁrstorder Markov models and hidden Markov models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst formal guarantee on learning from non-sequence data. Preliminary simulation results conﬁrm our theoretical ﬁndings. 1</p><p>5 0.11576084 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Expressive_Power_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">221 nips-2013-On the Expressive Power of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: James Martens, Arkadev Chattopadhya, Toni Pitassi, Richard Zemel</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the question: What kinds of distributions can be efﬁciently represented by Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)? We characterize the RBM’s unnormalized log-likelihood function as a type of neural network, and through a series of simulation results relate these networks to ones whose representational properties are better understood. We show the surprising result that RBMs can efﬁciently capture any distribution whose density depends on the number of 1’s in their input. We also provide the ﬁrst known example of a particular type of distribution that provably cannot be efﬁciently represented by an RBM, assuming a realistic exponential upper bound on the weights. By formally demonstrating that a relatively simple distribution cannot be represented efﬁciently by an RBM our results provide a new rigorous justiﬁcation for the use of potentially more expressive generative models, such as deeper ones. 1</p><p>6 0.10393438 <a title="36-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-When_are_Overcomplete_Topic_Models_Identifiable%3F_Uniqueness_of_Tensor_Tucker_Decompositions_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">353 nips-2013-When are Overcomplete Topic Models Identifiable?

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Li Yao, Guillaume Alain, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying datagenerating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justiﬁcation which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-inﬁnitesimal corruption noise (or non-inﬁnitesimal contractive penalty). 1</p><p>4 0.55832833 <a title="36-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Discovering_Hidden_Variables_in_Noisy-Or_Networks_using_Quartet_Tests.html">92 nips-2013-Discovering Hidden Variables in Noisy-Or Networks using Quartet Tests</a></p>
<p>Author: Yacine Jernite, Yonatan Halpern, David Sontag</p><p>Abstract: We give a polynomial-time algorithm for provably learning the structure and parameters of bipartite noisy-or Bayesian networks of binary variables where the top layer is completely hidden. Unsupervised learning of these models is a form of discrete factor analysis, enabling the discovery of hidden variables and their causal relationships with observed data. We obtain an efﬁcient learning algorithm for a family of Bayesian networks that we call quartet-learnable. For each latent variable, the existence of a singly-coupled quartet allows us to uniquely identify and learn all parameters involving that latent variable. We give a proof of the polynomial sample complexity of our learning algorithm, and experimentally compare it to variational EM. 1</p><p>5 0.55427957 <a title="36-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-RNADE%3A_The_real-valued_neural_autoregressive_density-estimator.html">260 nips-2013-RNADE: The real-valued neural autoregressive density-estimator</a></p>
<p>Author: Benigno Uria, Iain Murray, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: We introduce RNADE, a new model for joint density estimation of real-valued vectors. Our model calculates the density of a datapoint as the product of onedimensional conditionals modeled using mixture density networks with shared parameters. RNADE learns a distributed representation of the data, while having a tractable expression for the calculation of densities. A tractable likelihood allows direct comparison with other methods and training by standard gradientbased optimizers. We compare the performance of RNADE on several datasets of heterogeneous and perceptual data, ﬁnding it outperforms mixture models in all but one case. 1</p><p>6 0.52931327 <a title="36-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>

Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.</p><p>4 0.71839052 <a title="36-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We provide several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm based on the idea of predictable sequences. First, we recover the Mirror Prox algorithm for ofﬂine optimization, prove an extension to H¨ lder-smooth o functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a ﬁnite zero-sum matrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate of O((log T )￿T ). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al [6]. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximate Max Flow problem. 1</p><p>5 0.71790135 <a title="36-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Prediction_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">200 nips-2013-Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machine (MP-DBM). The MPDBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classiﬁcation tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classiﬁcation, classiﬁcation with missing inputs, and mean ﬁeld prediction tasks.1 1</p><p>6 0.71776468 <a title="36-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-%CE%A3-Optimality_for_Active_Learning_on_Gaussian_Random_Fields.html">359 nips-2013-Σ-Optimality for Active Learning on Gaussian Random Fields</a></p>

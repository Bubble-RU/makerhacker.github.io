<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem are often categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. As our ﬁrst main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD(λ)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of softgreedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward an optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations (either in state estimation or in value function representation), the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality. 1</p><p>3 0.23030151 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>4 0.1893996 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimizing_Instructional_Policies.html">241 nips-2013-Optimizing Instructional Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Lindsey, Michael Mozer, William J. Huggins, Harold Pashler</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists are interested in developing instructional policies that boost student learning. An instructional policy speciﬁes the manner and content of instruction. For example, in the domain of concept learning, a policy might specify the nature of exemplars chosen over a training sequence. Traditional psychological studies compare several hand-selected policies, e.g., contrasting a policy that selects only diﬃcult-to-classify exemplars with a policy that gradually progresses over the training sequence from easy exemplars to more diﬃcult (known as fading). We propose an alternative to the traditional methodology in which we deﬁne a parameterized space of policies and search this space to identify the optimal policy. For example, in concept learning, policies might be described by a fading function that speciﬁes exemplar diﬃculty over time. We propose an experimental technique for searching policy spaces using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization and a generative model of student performance. Instead of evaluating a few experimental conditions each with many human subjects, as the traditional methodology does, our technique evaluates many experimental conditions each with a few subjects. Even though individual subjects provide only a noisy estimate of the population mean, the optimization method allows us to determine the shape of the policy space and to identify the global optimum, and is as eﬃcient in its subject budget as a traditional A-B comparison. We evaluate the method via two behavioral studies, and suggest that the method has broad applicability to optimization problems involving humans outside the educational arena. 1</p><p>5 0.18295872 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Variational_Policy_Search_via_Trajectory_Optimization.html">348 nips-2013-Variational Policy Search via Trajectory Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Levine, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: In order to learn effective control policies for dynamical systems, policy search methods must be able to discover successful executions of the desired task. While random exploration can work well in simple domains, complex and highdimensional tasks present a serious challenge, particularly when combined with high-dimensional policies that make parameter-space exploration infeasible. We present a method that uses trajectory optimization as a powerful exploration strategy that guides the policy search. A variational decomposition of a maximum likelihood policy objective allows us to use standard trajectory optimization algorithms such as differential dynamic programming, interleaved with standard supervised learning for the policy itself. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can outperform prior methods on two challenging locomotion tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.17236537 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Symbolic_Opportunistic_Policy_Iteration_for_Factored-Action_MDPs.html">322 nips-2013-Symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration for Factored-Action MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Aswin Raghavan, Roni Khardon, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. Our ﬁrst contribution is a symbolic implementation of Modiﬁed Policy Iteration (MPI) for factored actions that views policy evaluation as policy-constrained value iteration (VI). Unfortunately, a na¨ve approach ı to enforce policy constraints can lead to large memory requirements, sometimes making symbolic MPI worse than VI. We address this through our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent algorithm lying between VI and MPI, that applies policy constraints if it does not increase the size of the value function representation, and otherwise performs VI backups. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners. 1</p><p>6 0.80111974 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-DESPOT%3A_Online_POMDP_Planning_with_Regularization.html">79 nips-2013-DESPOT: Online POMDP Planning with Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Bruno Scherrer</p><p>Abstract: Tetris is a video game that has been widely used as a benchmark for various optimization techniques including approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. A look at the literature of this game shows that while ADP algorithms that have been (almost) entirely based on approximating the value function (value function based) have performed poorly in Tetris, the methods that search directly in the space of policies by learning the policy parameters using an optimization black box, such as the cross entropy (CE) method, have achieved the best reported results. This makes us conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent, and thus, learn than their corresponding value functions. So, in order to obtain a good performance with ADP, we should use ADP algorithms that search in a policy space, instead of the more traditional ones that search in a value function space. In this paper, we put our conjecture to test by applying such an ADP algorithm, called classiﬁcation-based modiﬁed policy iteration (CBMPI), to the game of Tetris. Our experimental results show that for the ﬁrst time an ADP algorithm, namely CBMPI, obtains the best results reported in the literature for Tetris in both small 10 × 10 and large 10 × 20 boards. Although the CBMPI’s results are similar to those of the CE method in the large board, CBMPI uses considerably fewer (almost 1/6) samples (calls to the generative model) than CE. 1</p><p>2 0.63376749 <a title="38-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Spatial_Filtering_with_Beta_Divergence.html">284 nips-2013-Robust Spatial Filtering with Beta Divergence</a></p>
<p>Author: Wojciech Samek, Duncan Blythe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Motoaki Kawanabe</p><p>Abstract: The efﬁciency of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) largely depends upon a reliable extraction of informative features from the high-dimensional EEG signal. A crucial step in this protocol is the computation of spatial ﬁlters. The Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) algorithm computes ﬁlters that maximize the difference in band power between two conditions, thus it is tailored to extract the relevant information in motor imagery experiments. However, CSP is highly sensitive to artifacts in the EEG data, i.e. few outliers may alter the estimate drastically and decrease classiﬁcation performance. Inspired by concepts from the ﬁeld of information geometry we propose a novel approach for robustifying CSP. More precisely, we formulate CSP as a divergence maximization problem and utilize the property of a particular type of divergence, namely beta divergence, for robustifying the estimation of spatial ﬁlters in the presence of artifacts in the data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on toy data and on EEG recordings from 80 subjects. 1</p><p>3 0.56003517 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Aggregating_Optimistic_Planning_Trees_for_Solving_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">32 nips-2013-Aggregating Optimistic Planning Trees for Solving Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunnar Kedenburg, Raphael Fonteneau, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online planning in Markov decision processes using a randomized simulator, under a budget constraint. We propose a new algorithm which is based on the construction of a forest of planning trees, where each tree corresponds to a random realization of the stochastic environment. The trees are constructed using a “safe” optimistic planning strategy combining the optimistic principle (in order to explore the most promising part of the search space ﬁrst) with a safety principle (which guarantees a certain amount of uniform exploration). In the decision-making step of the algorithm, the individual trees are aggregated and an immediate action is recommended. We provide a ﬁnite-sample analysis and discuss the trade-off between the principles of optimism and safety. We also report numerical results on a benchmark problem. Our algorithm performs as well as state-of-the-art optimistic planning algorithms, and better than a related algorithm which additionally assumes the knowledge of all transition distributions. 1</p><p>4 0.46968898 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>5 0.46907526 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Synthesizing_Robust_Plans_under_Incomplete_Domain_Models.html">323 nips-2013-Synthesizing Robust Plans under Incomplete Domain Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tuan A. Nguyen, Subbarao Kambhampati, Minh Do</p><p>Abstract: Most current planners assume complete domain models and focus on generating correct plans. Unfortunately, domain modeling is a laborious and error-prone task, thus real world agents have to plan with incomplete domain models. While domain experts cannot guarantee completeness, often they are able to circumscribe the incompleteness of the model by providing annotations as to which parts of the domain model may be incomplete. In such cases, the goal should be to synthesize plans that are robust with respect to any known incompleteness of the domain. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce annotations expressing the knowledge of the domain incompleteness and formalize the notion of plan robustness with respect to an incomplete domain model. We then show an approach to compiling the problem of ﬁnding robust plans to the conformant probabilistic planning problem, and present experimental results with Probabilistic-FF planner. 1</p><p>6 0.46761879 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Bellman_Error_Based_Feature_Generation_using_Random_Projections_on_Sparse_Spaces.html">55 nips-2013-Bellman Error Based Feature Generation using Random Projections on Sparse Spaces</a></p>

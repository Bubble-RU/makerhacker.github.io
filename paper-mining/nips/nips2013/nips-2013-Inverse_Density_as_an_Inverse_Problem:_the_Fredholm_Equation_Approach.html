<p>Author: Yichao Lu, Paramveer Dhillon, Dean P. Foster, Lyle Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast algorithm for ridge regression when the number of features is much larger than the number of observations (p n). The standard way to solve ridge regression in this setting works in the dual space and gives a running time of O(n2 p). Our algorithm Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform- Dual Ridge Regression (SRHT-DRR) runs in time O(np log(n)) and works by preconditioning the design matrix by a Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform with a subsequent subsampling of features. We provide risk bounds for our SRHT-DRR algorithm in the ﬁxed design setting and show experimental results on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.19404708 <a title="144-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Invariance_via_Linear_Functionals_on_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space.html">170 nips-2013-Learning with Invariance via Linear Functionals on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Wee Sun Lee, Yee Whye Teh</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating invariance information is important for many learning problems. To exploit invariances, most existing methods resort to approximations that either lead to expensive optimization problems such as semi-deﬁnite programming, or rely on separation oracles to retain tractability. Some methods further limit the space of functions and settle for non-convex models. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using local invariances that explicitly characterize the behavior of the target function around data instances. These invariances are compactly encoded as linear functionals whose value are penalized by some loss function. Based on a representer theorem that we establish, our formulation can be efﬁciently optimized via a convex program. For the representer theorem to hold, the linear functionals are required to be bounded in the RKHS, and we show that this is true for a variety of commonly used RKHS and invariances. Experiments on learning with unlabeled data and transform invariances show that the proposed method yields better or similar results compared with the state of the art. 1</p><p>4 0.15719555 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Low_Rank_Kernel_Embeddings_of_Multivariate_Distributions.html">281 nips-2013-Robust Low Rank Kernel Embeddings of Multivariate Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Bo Dai</p><p>Abstract: Kernel embedding of distributions has led to many recent advances in machine learning. However, latent and low rank structures prevalent in real world distributions have rarely been taken into account in this setting. Furthermore, no prior work in kernel embedding literature has addressed the issue of robust embedding when the latent and low rank information are misspeciﬁed. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical low rank decomposition of kernels embeddings which can exploit such low rank structures in data while being robust to model misspeciﬁcation. We also illustrate with empirical evidence that the estimated low rank embeddings lead to improved performance in density estimation. 1</p><p>5 0.15428852 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Least_Informative_Dimensions.html">173 nips-2013-Least Informative Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>6 0.14071308 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Marius Kloft, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: We use the notion of local Rademacher complexity to design new algorithms for learning kernels. Our algorithms thereby beneﬁt from the sharper learning bounds based on that notion which, under certain general conditions, guarantee a faster convergence rate. We devise two new learning kernel algorithms: one based on a convex optimization problem for which we give an efﬁcient solution using existing learning kernel techniques, and another one that can be formulated as a DC-programming problem for which we describe a solution in detail. We also report the results of experiments with both algorithms in both binary and multi-class classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.79000777 <a title="144-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Statistical_analysis_of_coupled_time_series_with_Kernel_Cross-Spectral_Density_operators..html">310 nips-2013-Statistical analysis of coupled time series with Kernel Cross-Spectral Density operators.</a></p>
<p>Author: Michel Besserve, Nikos K. Logothetis, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Many applications require the analysis of complex interactions between time series. These interactions can be non-linear and involve vector valued as well as complex data structures such as graphs or strings. Here we provide a general framework for the statistical analysis of these dependencies when random variables are sampled from stationary time-series of arbitrary objects. To achieve this goal, we study the properties of the Kernel Cross-Spectral Density (KCSD) operator induced by positive deﬁnite kernels on arbitrary input domains. This framework enables us to develop an independence test between time series, as well as a similarity measure to compare different types of coupling. The performance of our test is compared to the HSIC test using i.i.d. assumptions, showing improvements in terms of detection errors, as well as the suitability of this approach for testing dependency in complex dynamical systems. This similarity measure enables us to identify different types of interactions in electrophysiological neural time series. 1</p><p>4 0.75473887 <a title="144-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>
<p>Author: Wojciech Zaremba, Arthur Gretton, Matthew Blaschko</p><p>Abstract: A family of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) kernel two-sample tests is introduced. Members of the test family are called Block-tests or B-tests, since the test statistic is an average over MMDs computed on subsets of the samples. The choice of block size allows control over the tradeoff between test power and computation time. In this respect, the B-test family combines favorable properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more powerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet they are more computationally efﬁcient than a quadratic time test where a single large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a U-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their asymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the U-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which estimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding. Recent results on kernel selection for hypothesis testing transfer seamlessly to the B-tests, yielding a means to optimize test power via kernel choice. 1</p><p>5 0.74708664 <a title="144-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Invariance_via_Linear_Functionals_on_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space.html">170 nips-2013-Learning with Invariance via Linear Functionals on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Mevissen, Emanuele Ragnoli, Jia Yuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust optimization for polynomial optimization problems where the uncertainty set is a set of candidate probability density functions. This set is a ball around a density function estimated from data samples, i.e., it is data-driven and random. Polynomial optimization problems are inherently hard due to nonconvex objectives and constraints. However, we show that by employing polynomial and histogram density estimates, we can introduce robustness with respect to distributional uncertainty sets without making the problem harder. We show that the optimum to the distributionally robust problem is the limit of a sequence of tractable semideﬁnite programming relaxations. We also give ﬁnite-sample consistency guarantees for the data-driven uncertainty sets. Finally, we apply our model and solution method in a water network optimization problem. 1</p><p>2 0.8059116 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_the_Harmonic_Structure_in_Graph-Based_Learning.html">35 nips-2013-Analyzing the Harmonic Structure in Graph-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Ming Wu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: We ﬁnd that various well-known graph-based models exhibit a common important harmonic structure in its target function – the value of a vertex is approximately the weighted average of the values of its adjacent neighbors. Understanding of such structure and analysis of the loss deﬁned over such structure help reveal important properties of the target function over a graph. In this paper, we show that the variation of the target function across a cut can be upper and lower bounded by the ratio of its harmonic loss and the cut cost. We use this to develop an analytical tool and analyze ﬁve popular graph-based models: absorbing random walks, partially absorbing random walks, hitting times, pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian, and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. Our analysis sheds new insights into several open questions related to these models, and provides theoretical justiﬁcations and guidelines for their practical use. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets conﬁrm the potential of the proposed theory and tool.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77922279 <a title="144-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Inverse_Density_as_an_Inverse_Problem%3A_the_Fredholm_Equation_Approach.html">144 nips-2013-Inverse Density as an Inverse Problem: the Fredholm Equation Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Qichao Que, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: q We address the problem of estimating the ratio p where p is a density function and q is another density, or, more generally an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration often referred to as importance sampling in statistical inference. It is also closely related to the problem of covariate shift in transfer learning. Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating the ratio as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel, known as the Fredholm problem of the ﬁrst kind. This formulation, combined with the techniques of regularization leads to a principled framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them theoretically. The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator) is ﬂexible, simple and easy to implement. We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel for densities deﬁned on Rd and smooth d-dimensional sub-manifolds of the Euclidean space. Model selection for unsupervised or semi-supervised inference is generally a difﬁcult problem. It turns out that in the density ratio estimation setting, when samples from both distributions are available, simple completely unsupervised model selection methods are available. We call this mechanism CD-CV for Cross-Density Cross-Validation. We show encouraging experimental results including applications to classiﬁcation within the covariate shift framework. 1</p><p>4 0.76745433 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Chordal_Markov_Networks_by_Constraint_Satisfaction.html">151 nips-2013-Learning Chordal Markov Networks by Constraint Satisfaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jukka Corander, Tomi Janhunen, Jussi Rintanen, Henrik Nyman, Johan Pensar</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning the structure of a Markov network from data. It is shown that the structure of such networks can be described in terms of constraints which enables the use of existing solver technology with optimization capabilities to compute optimal networks starting from initial scores computed from the data. To achieve efﬁcient encodings, we develop a novel characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on the separators between cliques forming the network. The resulting translations into propositional satisﬁability and its extensions such as maximum satisﬁability, satisﬁability modulo theories, and answer set programming, enable us to prove optimal certain networks which have been previously found by stochastic search. 1</p><p>5 0.72004944 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Neural_representation_of_action_sequences%3A_how_far_can_a_simple_snippet-matching_model_take_us%3F.html">208 nips-2013-Neural representation of action sequences: how far can a simple snippet-matching model take us?</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheston Tan, Jedediah M. Singer, Thomas Serre, David Sheinberg, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: The macaque Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) is a brain area that receives and integrates inputs from both the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams (thought to specialize in form and motion processing respectively). For the processing of articulated actions, prior work has shown that even a small population of STS neurons contains sufﬁcient information for the decoding of actor invariant to action, action invariant to actor, as well as the speciﬁc conjunction of actor and action. This paper addresses two questions. First, what are the invariance properties of individual neural representations (rather than the population representation) in STS? Second, what are the neural encoding mechanisms that can produce such individual neural representations from streams of pixel images? We ﬁnd that a simple model, one that simply computes a linear weighted sum of ventral and dorsal responses to short action “snippets”, produces surprisingly good ﬁts to the neural data. Interestingly, even using inputs from a single stream, both actor-invariance and action-invariance can be accounted for, by having different linear weights. 1</p><p>6 0.71809924 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Symbolic_Opportunistic_Policy_Iteration_for_Factored-Action_MDPs.html">322 nips-2013-Symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration for Factored-Action MDPs</a></p>

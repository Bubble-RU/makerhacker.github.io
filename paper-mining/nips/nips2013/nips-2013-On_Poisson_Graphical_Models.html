<p>Author: Liming Wang, David Carlson, Miguel Rodrigues, David Wilcox, Robert Calderbank, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: We consider design of linear projection measurements for a vector Poisson signal model. The projections are performed on the vector Poisson rate, X ∈ Rn , and the + observed data are a vector of counts, Y ∈ Zm . The projection matrix is designed + by maximizing mutual information between Y and X, I(Y ; X). When there is a latent class label C ∈ {1, . . . , L} associated with X, we consider the mutual information with respect to Y and C, I(Y ; C). New analytic expressions for the gradient of I(Y ; X) and I(Y ; C) are presented, with gradient performed with respect to the measurement matrix. Connections are made to the more widely studied Gaussian measurement model. Example results are presented for compressive topic modeling of a document corpora (word counting), and hyperspectral compressive sensing for chemical classiﬁcation (photon counting). 1</p><p>4 0.12766893 <a title="217-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-A_simple_example_of_Dirichlet_process_mixture_inconsistency_for_the_number_of_components.html">18 nips-2013-A simple example of Dirichlet process mixture inconsistency for the number of components</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey W. Miller, Matthew T. Harrison</p><p>Abstract: For data assumed to come from a ﬁnite mixture with an unknown number of components, it has become common to use Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) not only for density estimation, but also for inferences about the number of components. The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the number of clusters — that is, the posterior on the number of components represented in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent — it does not concentrate at the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a “mixture” with one standard normal component. Further, we show that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster converges (in probability) to 0. 1</p><p>5 0.12451825 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Comparative_Framework_for_Preconditioned_Lasso_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2013-A Comparative Framework for Preconditioned Lasso Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Nebojsa Jojic, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The Lasso is a cornerstone of modern multivariate data analysis, yet its performance suffers in the common situation in which covariates are correlated. This limitation has led to a growing number of Preconditioned Lasso algorithms that pre-multiply X and y by matrices PX , Py prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difﬁcult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter λ. In this paper we propose an agnostic framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose λ. We apply our framework to three Preconditioned Lasso instances and highlight cases when they will outperform the Lasso. Additionally, our theory reveals fragilities of these algorithms to which we provide partial solutions. 1</p><p>6 0.11708552 <a title="217-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_via_Univariate_Exponential_Families.html">67 nips-2013-Conditional Random Fields via Univariate Exponential Families</a></p>

<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar, Genevera I. Allen, Zhandong Liu</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds, which model the distribution of a multivariate response conditioned on a set of covariates using undirected graphs, are widely used in a variety of multivariate prediction applications. Popular instances of this class of models, such as categorical-discrete CRFs, Ising CRFs, and conditional Gaussian based CRFs, are not well suited to the varied types of response variables in many applications, including count-valued responses. We thus introduce a novel subclass of CRFs, derived by imposing node-wise conditional distributions of response variables conditioned on the rest of the responses and the covariates as arising from univariate exponential families. This allows us to derive novel multivariate CRFs given any univariate exponential distribution, including the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential distributions. Also in particular, it addresses the common CRF problem of specifying “feature” functions determining the interactions between response variables and covariates. We develop a class of tractable penalized M -estimators to learn these CRF distributions from data, as well as a uniﬁed sparsistency analysis for this general class of CRFs showing exact structure recovery can be achieved with high probability. 1</p><p>3 0.52162999 <a title="217-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Density_estimation_from_unweighted_k-nearest_neighbor_graphs%3A_a_roadmap.html">87 nips-2013-Density estimation from unweighted k-nearest neighbor graphs: a roadmap</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike Von Luxburg, Morteza Alamgir</p><p>Abstract: Consider an unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph on n points that have been sampled i.i.d. from some unknown density p on Rd . We prove how one can estimate the density p just from the unweighted adjacency matrix of the graph, without knowing the points themselves or any distance or similarity scores. The key insights are that local differences in link numbers can be used to estimate a local function of the gradient of p, and that integrating this function along shortest paths leads to an estimate of the underlying density. 1</p><p>4 0.50146824 <a title="217-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Regression-tree_Tuning_in_a_Streaming_Setting.html">269 nips-2013-Regression-tree Tuning in a Streaming Setting</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the design of strategies for market making in an exchange. A market maker generally seeks to proﬁt from the difference between the buy and sell price of an asset, yet the market maker also takes exposure risk in the event of large price movements. Proﬁt guarantees for market making strategies have typically required certain stochastic assumptions on the price ﬂuctuations of the asset in question; for example, assuming a model in which the price process is mean reverting. We propose a class of “spread-based” market making strategies whose performance can be controlled even under worst-case (adversarial) settings. We prove structural properties of these strategies which allows us to design a master algorithm which obtains low regret relative to the best such strategy in hindsight. We run a set of experiments showing favorable performance on recent real-world stock price data. 1</p><p>2 0.97300601 <a title="217-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Adaptivity_to_Local_Smoothness_and_Dimension_in_Kernel_Regression.html">31 nips-2013-Adaptivity to Local Smoothness and Dimension in Kernel Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the ﬁrst differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case. 1</p><p>4 0.95250261 <a title="217-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Kiraly, Louis Theran</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>5 0.91755074 <a title="217-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_Finite_State_Transducers.html">342 nips-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Bailly, Xavier Carreras, Ariadna Quattoni</p><p>Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FST) are a standard tool for modeling paired inputoutput sequences and are used in numerous applications, ranging from computational biology to natural language processing. Recently Balle et al. [4] presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as ﬁnding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identiﬁability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efﬁciently. 1</p><p>6 0.91342622 <a title="217-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-111-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4939-estimation-optimization-and-parallelism-when-data-is-sparse.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Brendan McMahan</p><p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization problems when the data is sparse, which is in a sense dual to current perspectives on high-dimensional statistical learning and optimization. We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. 1 Introduction and problem setting In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . For a probability distribution P on Ξ, we consider the following optimization problem: minimize f (x) := E[F (x; ξ)] = x∈X F (x; ξ)dP (ξ). (1) Ξ By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. (2) The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0.1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. As a motivating example, consider a text classiﬁcation problem: data ξ ∈ Rd represents words appearing in a document, and we wish to minimize a logistic loss F (x; ξ) = log(1 + exp( ξ, x )) on the data (we encode the label implicitly with the sign of ξ). Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. From a modelling perspective, it thus makes sense to allow a dense predictor x: any non-zero entry of ξ is potentially relevant and important. In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. So 1 Formally, if πξ denotes the coordinate projection zeroing all indices j of its argument where ξj = 0, then F (πξ (x); ξ) = F (x; ξ) for all x, ξ. This follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions for convexity [6]. 1 while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. In this paper, we investigate algorithms and their inherent limitations for solving problem (1) under natural conditions on the data generating distribution. Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. In another line of research, Duchi et al. [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). These algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance and have theoretical guarantees on their convergence, but it is not clear if they are optimal—in that no algorithm can attain better statistical performance—or whether they can leverage parallel computing as in the papers [12, 14]. In this paper, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). These results have two main implications. They show that in some scenarios, learning with sparse data is quite difﬁcult, as essentially each coordinate j ∈ [d] can be relevant and must be optimized for. In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . Combining insights of Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. We also give experiments on text-classiﬁcation and web-advertising tasks to illustrate the beneﬁts of the new algorithms. 2 Minimax rates for sparse optimization We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. Formally, let x denote any estimator for a minimizer of the objective (1). We deﬁne the optimality gap N for the estimator x based on N samples ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N from the distribution P as N (x, F, X , P ) := f (x) − inf f (x) = EP [F (x; ξ)] − inf EP [F (x; ξ)] . x∈X x∈X This quantity is a random variable, since x is a random variable (it is a function of ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N ). To deﬁne the minimax error, we thus take expectations of the quantity N , though we require a bit more than simply E[ N ]. We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. We can then deﬁne the minimax error for the family of losses F and distributions P as ∗ N (X , P, F) := inf sup sup EP [ x P ∈P F ∈F N (x(ξ 1:N ), F, X , P )], (3) where the inﬁmum is taken over all possible estimators x (an estimator is an optimization scheme, or a measurable mapping x : ΞN → X ) . 2.1 Minimax lower bounds Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. We obtain 2 Proposition 1. Let the conditions of the preceding paragraph hold. Let R be a constant such that X ⊃ [−R, R]d . Then √ d pj 1 ∗ . Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A.1 in the full version of the paper, providing a few remarks here. We begin by giving a corollary to Proposition 1 that follows when the data ξ obeys a type of power law: let p0 ∈ [0, 1], and assume that P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α . We have Corollary 2. Let α ≥ 0. Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. Then (1) If d > (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ 2−α 1−α p0 p0 (p0 N ) 2α − 1 + d1−α − (p0 N ) α N 1−α 2 MR 8 2−α (2) If d ≤ (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ MR 8 p0 N α 1 1 d1− 2 − 1 − α/2 1 − α/2 . . Expanding Corollary 2 slightly, for simplicity assume the number of samples is large enough that d ≤ (p0 N )1/α . Then we ﬁnd that the lower bound on optimization error is of order p0 1− α p0 p0 d 2 when α < 2, M R log d when α → 2, and M R when α > 2. (4) N N N These results beg the question of tightness: are they improvable? As we see presently, they are not. MR 2.2 Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M ( d j=1 1 pj ) 2 √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . Dual averaging, due to Nesterov [11] (sometimes called “follow the regularized leader” [5]) is a more recent algorithm. In dual averaging, one again samples g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), but instead of updating the parameter vector x one updates a dual vector z by z ← z + g, then computes 1 x ← argmin z, x + ψ(x) , η x∈X E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) x∈X 2 1 where ψ(x) is a strongly convex function deﬁned over X (often one takes ψ(x) = 2 x 2 ). As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin z, x + x ∈X 3 1 1 x ,S2x 2η . After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N d √ pj , (6) j=1 where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [4, Section 1.3 and Theorem 5]). By inspection, the A DAG RAD rate (6) matches the lower bound in Proposition 1 and is thus optimal. It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. For α > 1, the A DAG RAD rate is no worse, √ and for α ≥ 2, is more than d/ log d better—an exponential improvement in the dimension. 3 Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. To provide the setting for our further algorithms, we ﬁrst revisit Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12]. H OGWILD ! is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. Fix a stepsize η > 0. A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. Sample ξ ∼ P 2. Read x and compute g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) 3. For each j s.t. gj = 0, update xj ← ΠXj (xj − ηgj ). Here ΠXj denotes projection onto the jth coordinate of the domain X . The key of H OGWILD ! is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. Indeed, Niu et al. [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. 3.1 Asynchronous dual averaging A weakness of H OGWILD ! is that it appears only applicable to problems for which the domain X is a product space, and its analysis assumes g 0 = 1 for all gradients g. In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. Read z and compute x := argminx∈X 1 z, x + η ψ(x) // Implicitly increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) // Let g(t) = g. 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . Because the actual computation of the vector x in A SYNC DA is performed locally on each processor in step 1 of the algorithm, the algorithm can be executed with any proximal function ψ and domain X . The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. Since addition is commutative and associative, forcing all asynchrony to this point of the algorithm is a natural strategy for avoiding synchronization problems. In our analysis of A SYNC DA, and in our subsequent analysis of the adaptive methods, we require a measurement of time elapsed. With that in mind, we let t denote a time index that exists (roughly) behind-the-scenes. We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4 algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. This quantity t exists and is recoverable from the algorithm, and it is possible to track the running sum τ =1 x(τ ). Additionally, we state two assumptions encapsulating the conditions underlying our analysis. Assumption A. There is an upper bound m on the delay of any processor. In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. Assumption B. There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . With these deﬁnitions, we have the following theorem, which captures the convergence behavior of A SYNC DA under the assumption that X is a Cartesian product, meaning that X = X1 × · · · × Xd , 2 where Xj ⊂ R, and that ψ(x) = 1 x 2 . Note the algorithm itself can still be efﬁciently parallelized 2 for more general convex X , even if the theorem does not apply. Theorem 3. Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. Then T E t=1 F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) ≤ 1 x∗ 2η d 2 2 η 2 p2 Mj . + T M2 + ηT m j 2 j=1 We now provide a few remarks to explain and simplify the result. Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . Thus, for the d 2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . We then obtain the following corollary. √ T 1 Corollary 4. Deﬁne x(T ) = T t=1 x(t), and set η = x∗ 2 /M T . Then E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ M x∗ √ T 2 +m x∗ 2 √ 2M T d 2 p2 M j . j j=1 Corollary 4 is nearly immediate: since ξ t is independent of x(t), we have E[F (x(t); ξ t ) | x(t)] = f (x(t)); applying Jensen’s inequality to f (x(T )) and performing an algebraic manipulation give the result. If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗ 2 3 = 2 d j=1 2 pj M j x ∗ √ T 2 , (7) which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. 3.2 Asynchronous AdaGrad We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2.2). The matrix S is initialized as diag(δ 2 ), where δj ≥ 0 is an initial value. Each processor asynchronously performs the following iterations: 1 1 1. Read S and z and set G = S 2 . Compute x := argminx∈X { z, x + 2η x, Gx } increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x, S(t) = S 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂F (x; ξ) 2 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . 5 // Implicitly As in the description of A SYNC DA, we note that x(t) is the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth “step” of the algorithm (step 1), and similarly associate ξ t with x(t). To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. 2 Assumption C. There exist constants (Mj )d such that E[(∂xj F (x; ξ))2 | ξj = 0] ≤ Mj for all j=1 x ∈ X. 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. We then have the following convergence result. Theorem 5. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 3, let Assumption C hold. Assume that for all 2 j we have δ 2 ≥ Mj m and X ⊂ [−R∞ , R∞ ]d . Then T t=1 E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d ≤ min j=1 T 1 2 R E η ∞ 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 T + ηE gj (t) t=1 2 1 2 (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . t=1 It is possible to relax the condition on the initial constant diagonal term; we defer this to the full version of the paper. It is natural to ask in which situations the bound provided by Theorem 5 is optimal. We note that, as in the case with Theorem 3, we may obtain a convergence rate for f (x(T )) − f (x∗ ) using convexity, T 1 where x(T ) = T t=1 x(t). By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T E 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 t=1 T ≤ 2 2 E[gj (t) ] δ + t=1 1 2 ≤ 2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1) 1 2 R +η η ∞ Mj min which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e.g., to online convex optimization [5]). Speciﬁcally, an adversary may choose an arbitrary sequence of functions subject to the random data sparsity constraint (2), and our results provide an expected regret bound, which is strictly stronger than the stochastic convergence guarantees provided (and guarantees high-probability convergence in stochastic settings [3]). Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. When the data is sparse, we indeed should use asynchronous algorithms, but using adaptive methods yields even more improvement than simple gradient-based methods. 4 Experiments In this section, we give experimental validation of our theoretical results on A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA, giving results on two datasets selected for their high-dimensional sparsity.2 2 In our experiments, A SYNC DA and H OGWILD ! had effectively identical performance. 6 8 0.07 6 5 4 0.024 Test error Training loss Speedup 0.025 0.065 7 0.06 0.055 0.05 0.045 0.04 0.023 0.022 0.021 0.02 0.035 3 0.019 2 1 2 4 0.03 A-A DAG RAD A SYNC DA Number of workers 6 8 10 12 14 0.018 0.025 0.02 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 0.017 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 16 Figure 1.

The dataset in this case consists of an anonymized collection of URLs labeled as malicious (e.g., spam, phishing, etc.) or benign over a span of 120 days. The data in this case consists of 2.4 · 106 examples with dimension d = 3.2 · 106 (sparse) features. We perform several experiments, randomly dividing the dataset into 1.2 · 106 training and test samples for each experiment. In Figure 1 we compare the performance of A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA after doing after single pass through the training dataset. (For each algorithm, we choose the stepsize η for optimal training set performance.) We perform the experiments on a single machine running Ubuntu Linux with six cores (with two-way hyperthreading) and 32Gb of RAM. From the left-most plot in Fig. 1, we see that up to six processors, both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD enjoy the expected linear speedup, and from 6 to 12, they continue to enjoy a speedup that is linear in the number of processors though at a lesser slope (this is the effect of hyperthreading). For more than 12 processors, there is no further beneﬁt to parallelism on this machine. The two right plots in Figure 1 plot performance of the different methods (with standard errors) versus the number of worker threads used. Both are essentially ﬂat; increasing the amount of parallelism does nothing to the average training loss or the test error rate for either method. It is clear, however, that for this dataset, the adaptive A SYNC A DAG RAD algorithm provides substantial performance beneﬁts over A SYNC DA. 4.2 Click-through-rate prediction experiments We also experiment on a proprietary datasets consisting of search ad impressions. Each example corresponds to showing a search-engine user a particular text ad in response to a query string. From this, we construct a very sparse feature vector based on the text of the ad displayed and the query string (no user-speciﬁc data is used). The target label is 1 if the user clicked the ad and -1 otherwise. 7 (B) A-AdaGrad speedup (D) Impact of training data ordering 1.004 1.005 1.006 1.007 1.008 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1.000 1 2 A-DA base η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad base η = 0.023 0 1.005 relative stepsize (C) Optimal stepsize scaling relative log-loss 1.003 target relative log-loss 1.005 1.010 1.002 1.010 1.015 8 4 0 speedup A-DA η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad η = 0.016 1.001 1.000 relative log-loss 1.015 A-DA, L2=80 A-AdaGrad, L2=80 12 (A) Optimized stepsize for each number of passes 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 number of passes Figure 3.

(B) Effective speedup for A SYNC A DAG RAD. (C) The best stepsize η, expressed as a scaling factor on the stepsize used for one pass. (D) Five runs with different random seeds for each algorithm (with 2 penalty 80). We ﬁt logistic regression models using both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD. We run extensive experiments on a moderate-sized dataset (about 107 examples, split between training and testing), which allows thorough investigation of the impact of the stepsize η, the number of training passes,3 and 2 -regularization on accuracy. For these experiments we used 32 threads on 16 core machines for each run, as A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA achieve similar speedups from parallelization. On this dataset, A SYNC A DAG RAD typically achieves an effective additional speedup over A SYNC DA of 4× or more. That is, to reach a given level of accuracy, A SYNC DA generally needs four times as many effective passes over the dataset. We measure accuracy with log-loss (the logistic loss) averaged over ﬁve runs using different random seeds (which control the order in which the algorithms sample examples during training). We report relative values in Figures 2 and 3, that is, the ratio of the mean loss for the given datapoint to the lowest (best) mean loss obtained. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of relative log-loss as the metric of interest; we also considered AUC (the area under the ROC curve) and observed similar results. Figure 2 shows relative log-loss as a function of the number of training passes for various stepsizes. Without regularization, A SYNC A DAG RAD is prone to overﬁtting: it achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy on the training data (Fig. 2 (left)), but unless the stepsize is tuned carefully to the number of passes, it will overﬁt (Fig. 2 (middle)). Fortunately, the addition of 2 regularization largely solves this problem. Indeed, Figure 2 (right) shows that while adding an 2 penalty of 80 has very little impact on A SYNC DA, it effectively prevents the overﬁtting of A SYNC A DAG RAD.4 Fixing √ regularization multiplier to 80, we varied the stepsize η over a multiplicative grid with res2 olution 2 for each number of passes and for each algorithm. Figure 3 reports the results obtained by selecting the best stepsize in terms of test set log-loss for each number of passes. Figure 3(A) shows relative log-loss of the best stepsize for each algorithm; 3(B) shows the relative time A SYNC DA requires with respect to A SYNC A DAG RAD to achieve a given loss. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(B) shows the ratio of the number of passes the algorithms require to achieve a ﬁxed loss, which gives a broader estimate of the speedup obtained by using A SYNC A DAG RAD; speedups range from 3.6× to 12×. Figure 3(C) shows the optimal stepsizes as a function of the best setting for one pass. The optimal stepsize decreases moderately for A SYNC A DAG RAD, but are somewhat noisy for A SYNC DA. It is interesting to note that A SYNC A DAG RAD’s accuracy is largely independent of the ordering of the training data, while A SYNC DA shows signiﬁcant variability. This can be seen both in the error bars on Figure 3(A), and explicitly in Figure 3(D), where we plot one line for each of the ﬁve random seeds used. Thus, while on the one hand A SYNC DA requires somewhat less tuning of the stepsize and 2 parameter, tuning A SYNC A DAG RAD is much easier because of its predictable response. 3 Here “number of passes” more precisely means the expected number of times each example in the dataset is trained on. That is, each worker thread randomly selects a training example from the dataset for each update, and we continued making updates until (dataset size) × (number of passes) updates have been processed. 4 For both algorithms, this is accomplished by adding the term η80 x 2 to the ψ function. We can achieve 2 slightly better results for A SYNC A DAG RAD by varying the 2 penalty with the number of passes. 8 References [1] P. Auer and C. Gentile.

[sent-8, score-0.127]
</p><p>2 We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. [sent-9, score-0.096]
</p><p>3 Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. [sent-10, score-0.155]
</p><p>4 We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. [sent-11, score-0.28]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction and problem setting  In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. [sent-12, score-0.062]
</p><p>6 Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . [sent-13, score-0.068]
</p><p>7 (1)  Ξ  By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. [sent-15, score-0.103]
</p><p>8 (2)  The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0. [sent-16, score-0.122]
</p><p>9 1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. [sent-17, score-0.122]
</p><p>10 Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. [sent-19, score-0.068]
</p><p>11 In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. [sent-21, score-0.065]
</p><p>12 1  while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. [sent-24, score-0.075]
</p><p>13 Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. [sent-26, score-0.305]
</p><p>14 [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). [sent-28, score-0.1]
</p><p>15 First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. [sent-31, score-0.06]
</p><p>16 In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). [sent-32, score-0.118]
</p><p>17 In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. [sent-35, score-0.059]
</p><p>18 As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. [sent-36, score-0.12]
</p><p>19 We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . [sent-37, score-0.581]
</p><p>20 [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. [sent-40, score-0.18]
</p><p>21 2  Minimax rates for sparse optimization  We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. [sent-42, score-0.12]
</p><p>22 To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. [sent-43, score-0.116]
</p><p>23 We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. [sent-54, score-0.12]
</p><p>24 1  Minimax lower bounds  Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. [sent-57, score-0.08]
</p><p>25 For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . [sent-58, score-0.222]
</p><p>26 For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. [sent-62, score-0.092]
</p><p>27 Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A. [sent-67, score-0.222]
</p><p>28 Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. [sent-72, score-0.08]
</p><p>29 2  Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate  To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. [sent-80, score-0.165]
</p><p>30 We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . [sent-81, score-0.294]
</p><p>31 Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M (  d j=1  1  pj ) 2  √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . [sent-82, score-0.309]
</p><p>32 As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. [sent-85, score-0.326]
</p><p>33 The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. [sent-86, score-0.092]
</p><p>34 It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. [sent-87, score-0.198]
</p><p>35 The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin  z, x +  x ∈X  3  1 1 x ,S2x 2η  . [sent-88, score-0.401]
</p><p>36 After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N  d  √ pj ,  (6)  j=1  where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [sent-89, score-0.267]
</p><p>37 It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. [sent-93, score-0.059]
</p><p>38 3  Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity  As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. [sent-95, score-0.306]
</p><p>39 Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. [sent-96, score-0.066]
</p><p>40 is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. [sent-101, score-0.242]
</p><p>41 A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. [sent-103, score-0.176]
</p><p>42 is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. [sent-111, score-0.07]
</p><p>43 [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. [sent-113, score-0.281]
</p><p>44 1  Asynchronous dual averaging  A weakness of H OGWILD ! [sent-115, score-0.097]
</p><p>45 In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. [sent-117, score-0.239]
</p><p>46 A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. [sent-118, score-0.405]
</p><p>47 For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . [sent-122, score-0.32]
</p><p>48 The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. [sent-124, score-0.093]
</p><p>49 We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4  algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. [sent-128, score-0.058]
</p><p>50 In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . [sent-133, score-0.444]
</p><p>51 We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. [sent-134, score-0.076]
</p><p>52 There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . [sent-136, score-0.242]
</p><p>53 Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. [sent-140, score-0.062]
</p><p>54 Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . [sent-143, score-0.239]
</p><p>55 Thus, for the d  2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . [sent-144, score-0.26]
</p><p>56 If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗  2  3 = 2  d j=1  2 pj M j x ∗ √ T  2  ,  (7)  which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). [sent-150, score-0.585]
</p><p>57 The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. [sent-151, score-0.091]
</p><p>58 2  Asynchronous AdaGrad  We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). [sent-153, score-0.142]
</p><p>59 As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2. [sent-154, score-0.121]
</p><p>60 For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . [sent-161, score-0.451]
</p><p>61 To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. [sent-163, score-0.123]
</p><p>62 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. [sent-166, score-0.222]
</p><p>63 Then T  t=1  E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d  ≤  min j=1  T  1 2 R E η ∞  2  δ +  gj (t)  2  1 2  T  + ηE  gj (t)  t=1  2  1 2  (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . [sent-171, score-0.706]
</p><p>64 By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T  E  2  δ +  gj (t)  2  1 2  t=1  T  ≤  2  2  E[gj (t) ]  δ + t=1  1 2  ≤  2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . [sent-175, score-0.353]
</p><p>65 For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . [sent-176, score-0.222]
</p><p>66 If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d  log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. [sent-177, score-1.152]
</p><p>67 In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)  1 2 R +η η ∞  Mj min  which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. [sent-178, score-0.741]
</p><p>68 In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). [sent-179, score-0.224]
</p><p>69 We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e. [sent-180, score-0.062]
</p><p>70 Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. [sent-184, score-0.106]

<p>Author: John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Brendan McMahan</p><p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization problems when the data is sparse, which is in a sense dual to current perspectives on high-dimensional statistical learning and optimization. We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. 1 Introduction and problem setting In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . For a probability distribution P on Ξ, we consider the following optimization problem: minimize f (x) := E[F (x; ξ)] = x∈X F (x; ξ)dP (ξ). (1) Ξ By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. (2) The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0.1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. As a motivating example, consider a text classiﬁcation problem: data ξ ∈ Rd represents words appearing in a document, and we wish to minimize a logistic loss F (x; ξ) = log(1 + exp( ξ, x )) on the data (we encode the label implicitly with the sign of ξ). Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. From a modelling perspective, it thus makes sense to allow a dense predictor x: any non-zero entry of ξ is potentially relevant and important. In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. So 1 Formally, if πξ denotes the coordinate projection zeroing all indices j of its argument where ξj = 0, then F (πξ (x); ξ) = F (x; ξ) for all x, ξ. This follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions for convexity [6]. 1 while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. In this paper, we investigate algorithms and their inherent limitations for solving problem (1) under natural conditions on the data generating distribution. Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. In another line of research, Duchi et al. [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). These algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance and have theoretical guarantees on their convergence, but it is not clear if they are optimal—in that no algorithm can attain better statistical performance—or whether they can leverage parallel computing as in the papers [12, 14]. In this paper, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). These results have two main implications. They show that in some scenarios, learning with sparse data is quite difﬁcult, as essentially each coordinate j ∈ [d] can be relevant and must be optimized for. In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . Combining insights of Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. We also give experiments on text-classiﬁcation and web-advertising tasks to illustrate the beneﬁts of the new algorithms. 2 Minimax rates for sparse optimization We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. Formally, let x denote any estimator for a minimizer of the objective (1). We deﬁne the optimality gap N for the estimator x based on N samples ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N from the distribution P as N (x, F, X , P ) := f (x) − inf f (x) = EP [F (x; ξ)] − inf EP [F (x; ξ)] . x∈X x∈X This quantity is a random variable, since x is a random variable (it is a function of ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N ). To deﬁne the minimax error, we thus take expectations of the quantity N , though we require a bit more than simply E[ N ]. We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. We can then deﬁne the minimax error for the family of losses F and distributions P as ∗ N (X , P, F) := inf sup sup EP [ x P ∈P F ∈F N (x(ξ 1:N ), F, X , P )], (3) where the inﬁmum is taken over all possible estimators x (an estimator is an optimization scheme, or a measurable mapping x : ΞN → X ) . 2.1 Minimax lower bounds Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. We obtain 2 Proposition 1. Let the conditions of the preceding paragraph hold. Let R be a constant such that X ⊃ [−R, R]d . Then √ d pj 1 ∗ . Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A.1 in the full version of the paper, providing a few remarks here. We begin by giving a corollary to Proposition 1 that follows when the data ξ obeys a type of power law: let p0 ∈ [0, 1], and assume that P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α . We have Corollary 2. Let α ≥ 0. Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. Then (1) If d > (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ 2−α 1−α p0 p0 (p0 N ) 2α − 1 + d1−α − (p0 N ) α N 1−α 2 MR 8 2−α (2) If d ≤ (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ MR 8 p0 N α 1 1 d1− 2 − 1 − α/2 1 − α/2 . . Expanding Corollary 2 slightly, for simplicity assume the number of samples is large enough that d ≤ (p0 N )1/α . Then we ﬁnd that the lower bound on optimization error is of order p0 1− α p0 p0 d 2 when α < 2, M R log d when α → 2, and M R when α > 2. (4) N N N These results beg the question of tightness: are they improvable? As we see presently, they are not. MR 2.2 Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M ( d j=1 1 pj ) 2 √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . Dual averaging, due to Nesterov [11] (sometimes called “follow the regularized leader” [5]) is a more recent algorithm. In dual averaging, one again samples g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), but instead of updating the parameter vector x one updates a dual vector z by z ← z + g, then computes 1 x ← argmin z, x + ψ(x) , η x∈X E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) x∈X 2 1 where ψ(x) is a strongly convex function deﬁned over X (often one takes ψ(x) = 2 x 2 ). As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin z, x + x ∈X 3 1 1 x ,S2x 2η . After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N d √ pj , (6) j=1 where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [4, Section 1.3 and Theorem 5]). By inspection, the A DAG RAD rate (6) matches the lower bound in Proposition 1 and is thus optimal. It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. For α > 1, the A DAG RAD rate is no worse, √ and for α ≥ 2, is more than d/ log d better—an exponential improvement in the dimension. 3 Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. To provide the setting for our further algorithms, we ﬁrst revisit Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12]. H OGWILD ! is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. Fix a stepsize η > 0. A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. Sample ξ ∼ P 2. Read x and compute g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) 3. For each j s.t. gj = 0, update xj ← ΠXj (xj − ηgj ). Here ΠXj denotes projection onto the jth coordinate of the domain X . The key of H OGWILD ! is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. Indeed, Niu et al. [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. 3.1 Asynchronous dual averaging A weakness of H OGWILD ! is that it appears only applicable to problems for which the domain X is a product space, and its analysis assumes g 0 = 1 for all gradients g. In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. Read z and compute x := argminx∈X 1 z, x + η ψ(x) // Implicitly increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) // Let g(t) = g. 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . Because the actual computation of the vector x in A SYNC DA is performed locally on each processor in step 1 of the algorithm, the algorithm can be executed with any proximal function ψ and domain X . The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. Since addition is commutative and associative, forcing all asynchrony to this point of the algorithm is a natural strategy for avoiding synchronization problems. In our analysis of A SYNC DA, and in our subsequent analysis of the adaptive methods, we require a measurement of time elapsed. With that in mind, we let t denote a time index that exists (roughly) behind-the-scenes. We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4 algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. This quantity t exists and is recoverable from the algorithm, and it is possible to track the running sum τ =1 x(τ ). Additionally, we state two assumptions encapsulating the conditions underlying our analysis. Assumption A. There is an upper bound m on the delay of any processor. In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. Assumption B. There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . With these deﬁnitions, we have the following theorem, which captures the convergence behavior of A SYNC DA under the assumption that X is a Cartesian product, meaning that X = X1 × · · · × Xd , 2 where Xj ⊂ R, and that ψ(x) = 1 x 2 . Note the algorithm itself can still be efﬁciently parallelized 2 for more general convex X , even if the theorem does not apply. Theorem 3. Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. Then T E t=1 F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) ≤ 1 x∗ 2η d 2 2 η 2 p2 Mj . + T M2 + ηT m j 2 j=1 We now provide a few remarks to explain and simplify the result. Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . Thus, for the d 2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . We then obtain the following corollary. √ T 1 Corollary 4. Deﬁne x(T ) = T t=1 x(t), and set η = x∗ 2 /M T . Then E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ M x∗ √ T 2 +m x∗ 2 √ 2M T d 2 p2 M j . j j=1 Corollary 4 is nearly immediate: since ξ t is independent of x(t), we have E[F (x(t); ξ t ) | x(t)] = f (x(t)); applying Jensen’s inequality to f (x(T )) and performing an algebraic manipulation give the result. If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗ 2 3 = 2 d j=1 2 pj M j x ∗ √ T 2 , (7) which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. 3.2 Asynchronous AdaGrad We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2.2). The matrix S is initialized as diag(δ 2 ), where δj ≥ 0 is an initial value. Each processor asynchronously performs the following iterations: 1 1 1. Read S and z and set G = S 2 . Compute x := argminx∈X { z, x + 2η x, Gx } increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x, S(t) = S 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂F (x; ξ) 2 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . 5 // Implicitly As in the description of A SYNC DA, we note that x(t) is the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth “step” of the algorithm (step 1), and similarly associate ξ t with x(t). To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. 2 Assumption C. There exist constants (Mj )d such that E[(∂xj F (x; ξ))2 | ξj = 0] ≤ Mj for all j=1 x ∈ X. 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. We then have the following convergence result. Theorem 5. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 3, let Assumption C hold. Assume that for all 2 j we have δ 2 ≥ Mj m and X ⊂ [−R∞ , R∞ ]d . Then T t=1 E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d ≤ min j=1 T 1 2 R E η ∞ 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 T + ηE gj (t) t=1 2 1 2 (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . t=1 It is possible to relax the condition on the initial constant diagonal term; we defer this to the full version of the paper. It is natural to ask in which situations the bound provided by Theorem 5 is optimal. We note that, as in the case with Theorem 3, we may obtain a convergence rate for f (x(T )) − f (x∗ ) using convexity, T 1 where x(T ) = T t=1 x(t). By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T E 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 t=1 T ≤ 2 2 E[gj (t) ] δ + t=1 1 2 ≤ 2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1) 1 2 R +η η ∞ Mj min which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e.g., to online convex optimization [5]). Speciﬁcally, an adversary may choose an arbitrary sequence of functions subject to the random data sparsity constraint (2), and our results provide an expected regret bound, which is strictly stronger than the stochastic convergence guarantees provided (and guarantees high-probability convergence in stochastic settings [3]). Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. When the data is sparse, we indeed should use asynchronous algorithms, but using adaptive methods yields even more improvement than simple gradient-based methods. 4 Experiments In this section, we give experimental validation of our theoretical results on A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA, giving results on two datasets selected for their high-dimensional sparsity.2 2 In our experiments, A SYNC DA and H OGWILD ! had effectively identical performance. 6 8 0.07 6 5 4 0.024 Test error Training loss Speedup 0.025 0.065 7 0.06 0.055 0.05 0.045 0.04 0.023 0.022 0.021 0.02 0.035 3 0.019 2 1 2 4 0.03 A-A DAG RAD A SYNC DA Number of workers 6 8 10 12 14 0.018 0.025 0.02 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 0.017 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 16 Figure 1.

The dataset in this case consists of an anonymized collection of URLs labeled as malicious (e.g., spam, phishing, etc.) or benign over a span of 120 days. The data in this case consists of 2.4 · 106 examples with dimension d = 3.2 · 106 (sparse) features. We perform several experiments, randomly dividing the dataset into 1.2 · 106 training and test samples for each experiment. In Figure 1 we compare the performance of A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA after doing after single pass through the training dataset. (For each algorithm, we choose the stepsize η for optimal training set performance.) We perform the experiments on a single machine running Ubuntu Linux with six cores (with two-way hyperthreading) and 32Gb of RAM. From the left-most plot in Fig. 1, we see that up to six processors, both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD enjoy the expected linear speedup, and from 6 to 12, they continue to enjoy a speedup that is linear in the number of processors though at a lesser slope (this is the effect of hyperthreading). For more than 12 processors, there is no further beneﬁt to parallelism on this machine. The two right plots in Figure 1 plot performance of the different methods (with standard errors) versus the number of worker threads used. Both are essentially ﬂat; increasing the amount of parallelism does nothing to the average training loss or the test error rate for either method. It is clear, however, that for this dataset, the adaptive A SYNC A DAG RAD algorithm provides substantial performance beneﬁts over A SYNC DA. 4.2 Click-through-rate prediction experiments We also experiment on a proprietary datasets consisting of search ad impressions. Each example corresponds to showing a search-engine user a particular text ad in response to a query string. From this, we construct a very sparse feature vector based on the text of the ad displayed and the query string (no user-speciﬁc data is used). The target label is 1 if the user clicked the ad and -1 otherwise. 7 (B) A-AdaGrad speedup (D) Impact of training data ordering 1.004 1.005 1.006 1.007 1.008 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1.000 1 2 A-DA base η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad base η = 0.023 0 1.005 relative stepsize (C) Optimal stepsize scaling relative log-loss 1.003 target relative log-loss 1.005 1.010 1.002 1.010 1.015 8 4 0 speedup A-DA η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad η = 0.016 1.001 1.000 relative log-loss 1.015 A-DA, L2=80 A-AdaGrad, L2=80 12 (A) Optimized stepsize for each number of passes 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 number of passes Figure 3.

(B) Effective speedup for A SYNC A DAG RAD. (C) The best stepsize η, expressed as a scaling factor on the stepsize used for one pass. (D) Five runs with different random seeds for each algorithm (with 2 penalty 80). We ﬁt logistic regression models using both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD. We run extensive experiments on a moderate-sized dataset (about 107 examples, split between training and testing), which allows thorough investigation of the impact of the stepsize η, the number of training passes,3 and 2 -regularization on accuracy. For these experiments we used 32 threads on 16 core machines for each run, as A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA achieve similar speedups from parallelization. On this dataset, A SYNC A DAG RAD typically achieves an effective additional speedup over A SYNC DA of 4× or more. That is, to reach a given level of accuracy, A SYNC DA generally needs four times as many effective passes over the dataset. We measure accuracy with log-loss (the logistic loss) averaged over ﬁve runs using different random seeds (which control the order in which the algorithms sample examples during training). We report relative values in Figures 2 and 3, that is, the ratio of the mean loss for the given datapoint to the lowest (best) mean loss obtained. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of relative log-loss as the metric of interest; we also considered AUC (the area under the ROC curve) and observed similar results. Figure 2 shows relative log-loss as a function of the number of training passes for various stepsizes. Without regularization, A SYNC A DAG RAD is prone to overﬁtting: it achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy on the training data (Fig. 2 (left)), but unless the stepsize is tuned carefully to the number of passes, it will overﬁt (Fig. 2 (middle)). Fortunately, the addition of 2 regularization largely solves this problem. Indeed, Figure 2 (right) shows that while adding an 2 penalty of 80 has very little impact on A SYNC DA, it effectively prevents the overﬁtting of A SYNC A DAG RAD.4 Fixing √ regularization multiplier to 80, we varied the stepsize η over a multiplicative grid with res2 olution 2 for each number of passes and for each algorithm. Figure 3 reports the results obtained by selecting the best stepsize in terms of test set log-loss for each number of passes. Figure 3(A) shows relative log-loss of the best stepsize for each algorithm; 3(B) shows the relative time A SYNC DA requires with respect to A SYNC A DAG RAD to achieve a given loss. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(B) shows the ratio of the number of passes the algorithms require to achieve a ﬁxed loss, which gives a broader estimate of the speedup obtained by using A SYNC A DAG RAD; speedups range from 3.6× to 12×. Figure 3(C) shows the optimal stepsizes as a function of the best setting for one pass. The optimal stepsize decreases moderately for A SYNC A DAG RAD, but are somewhat noisy for A SYNC DA. It is interesting to note that A SYNC A DAG RAD’s accuracy is largely independent of the ordering of the training data, while A SYNC DA shows signiﬁcant variability. This can be seen both in the error bars on Figure 3(A), and explicitly in Figure 3(D), where we plot one line for each of the ﬁve random seeds used. Thus, while on the one hand A SYNC DA requires somewhat less tuning of the stepsize and 2 parameter, tuning A SYNC A DAG RAD is much easier because of its predictable response. 3 Here “number of passes” more precisely means the expected number of times each example in the dataset is trained on. That is, each worker thread randomly selects a training example from the dataset for each update, and we continued making updates until (dataset size) × (number of passes) updates have been processed. 4 For both algorithms, this is accomplished by adding the term η80 x 2 to the ψ function. We can achieve 2 slightly better results for A SYNC A DAG RAD by varying the 2 penalty with the number of passes. 8 References [1] P. Auer and C. Gentile.

<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lijun Zhang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that the optimal convergence rate for stochastic optimization of √ smooth functions is O(1/ T ), which is same as stochastic optimization of Lipschitz continuous convex functions. This is in contrast to optimizing smooth functions using full gradients, which yields a convergence rate of O(1/T 2 ). In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as Mixed Optimization, which allows to access both a stochastic oracle and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to signiﬁcantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle. We show that, with an O(ln T ) calls to the full gradient oracle and an O(T ) calls to the stochastic oracle, the proposed mixed optimization algorithm is able to achieve an optimization error of O(1/T ). 1</p><p>3 0.083761126 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Lexical_and_Hierarchical_Topic_Regression.html">174 nips-2013-Lexical and Hierarchical Topic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Viet-An Nguyen, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by a two-level theory from political science that uniﬁes agenda setting and ideological framing, we propose supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (S H L DA), which jointly captures documents’ multi-level topic structure and their polar response variables. Our model extends the nested Chinese restaurant processes to discover tree-structured topic hierarchies and uses both per-topic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters to model response variables. S H L DA improves prediction on political afﬁliation and sentiment tasks in addition to providing insight into how topics under discussion are framed. 1 Introduction: Agenda Setting and Framing in Hierarchical Models How do liberal-leaning bloggers talk about immigration in the US? What do conservative politicians have to say about education? How do Fox News and MSNBC differ in their language about the gun debate? Such questions concern not only what, but how things are talked about. In political communication, the question of “what” falls under the heading of agenda setting theory, which concerns the issues introduced into political discourse (e.g., by the mass media) and their inﬂuence over public priorities [1]. The question of “how” concerns framing: the way the presentation of an issue reﬂects or encourages a particular perspective or interpretation [2]. For example, the rise of the “innocence frame” in the death penalty debate, emphasizing the irreversible consequence of mistaken convictions, has led to a sharp decline in the use of capital punishment in the US [3]. In its concern with the subjects or issues under discussion in political discourse, agenda setting maps neatly to topic modeling [4] as a means of discovering and characterizing those issues [5]. Interestingly, one line of communication theory seeks to unify agenda setting and framing by viewing frames as a second-level kind of agenda [1]: just as agenda setting is about which objects of discussion are salient, framing is about the salience of attributes of those objects. The key is that what communications theorists consider an attribute in a discussion can itself be an object, as well. For example, “mistaken convictions” is one attribute of the death penalty discussion, but it can also be viewed as an object of discussion in its own right. This two-level view leads naturally to the idea of using a hierarchical topic model to formalize both agendas and frames within a uniform setting. In this paper, we introduce a new model to do exactly that. The model is predictive: it represents the idea of alternative or competing perspectives via a continuous-valued response variable. Although inspired by the study of political discourse, associating texts with “perspectives” is more general and has been studied in sentiment analysis, discovery of regional variation, and value-sensitive design. We show experimentally that the model’s hierarchical structure improves prediction of perspective in both a political domain and on sentiment analysis tasks, and we argue that the topic hierarchies exposed by the model are indeed capturing structure in line with the theory that motivated the work. 1 ߨ ݉ ߠௗ ߙ ߰ௗ ߛ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫ݖ‬ௗ௦௡ ‫ݓ‬ௗ௦௡ ܿௗ௧ ܰௗ௦ ∞ ߩ ܵௗ ‫ݕ‬ௗ ‫ܦ‬ ߱ ߟ௞ ߬௩ ܸ 1.

Words w are explained by topic hierarchy φ, and response variables y are explained by per-topic regression coefﬁcients η and global lexical coefﬁcients τ . 2 S H L DA: Combining Supervision and Hierarchical Topic Structure Jointly capturing supervision and hierarchical topic structure falls under a class of models called supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation. These models take as input a set of D documents, each of which is associated with a response variable yd , and output a hierarchy of topics which is informed by yd . Zhang et al. [6] introduce the S H L DA family, focusing on a categorical response. In contrast, our novel model (which we call S H L DA for brevity), uses continuous responses. At its core, S H L DA’s document generative process resembles a combination of hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation [7, HLDA] and the hierarchical Dirichlet process [8, HDP]. HLDA uses the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP(γ)), combined with an appropriate base distribution, to induce an unbounded tree-structured hierarchy of topics: general topics at the top, speciﬁc at the bottom. A document is generated by traversing this tree, at each level creating a new child (hence a new path) with probability proportional to γ or otherwise respecting the “rich-get-richer” property of a CRP. A drawback of HLDA, however, is that each document is restricted to only a single path in the tree. Recent work relaxes this restriction through different priors: nested HDP [9], nested Chinese franchises [10] or recursive CRPs [11]. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing documents to have multiple paths through the tree by leveraging information at the sentence level using the twolevel structure used in HDP. More speciﬁcally, in the HDP’s Chinese restaurant franchise metaphor, customers (i.e., tokens) are grouped by sitting at tables and each table takes a dish (i.e., topic) from a ﬂat global menu. In our S H L DA, dishes are organized in a tree-structured global menu by using the nCRP as prior. Each path in the tree is a collection of L dishes (one for each level) and is called a combo. S H L DA groups sentences of a document by assigning them to tables and associates each table with a combo, and thus, models each document as a distribution over combos.1 In S H L DA’s metaphor, customers come in a restaurant and sit at a table in groups, where each group is a sentence. A sentence wd,s enters restaurant d and selects a table t (and its associated combo) with probability proportional to the number of sentences Sd,t at that table; or, it sits at a new table with probability proportional to α. After choosing the table (indexed by td,s ), if the table is new, the group will select a combo of dishes (i.e., a path, indexed by cd,t ) from the tree menu. Once a combo is in place, each token in the sentence chooses a “level” (indexed by zd,s,n ) in the combo, which speciﬁes the topic (φkd,s,n ≡ φcd,td,s ,zd,s,n ) producing the associated observation (Figure 2). S H L DA also draws on supervised LDA [12, SLDA] associating each document d with an observable continuous response variable yd that represents the author’s perspective toward a topic, e.g., positive vs. negative sentiment, conservative vs. liberal ideology, etc. This lets us infer a multi-level topic structure informed by how topics are “framed” with respect to positions along the yd continuum. 1 We emphasize that, unlike in HDP where each table is assigned to a single dish, each table in our metaphor is associated with a combo–a collection of L dishes. We also use combo and path interchangeably. 2 Sd Sd,t ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ dish ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ߶ଵଶ 			ߟଵଶ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ ߶ଵଵଶ 		ߟଵଵଶ ߶ଵଶଵ 		ߟଵଶଵ ߶ଵଶଶ 		ߟଵଶଶ table ܿௗ௧ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫3=ݐ‬ ‫1=ݐ‬ ‫2=ݐ‬ ‫ݐ‬ௗ௦ ‫2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଵ ‫3=ݏ 2=ݏ 1=ݏ‬ ݀=1 ݇ௗ௦௡ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬ଶ ‫ܵ = ݏ‬஽ ݀=2 ߶ଵ 				ߟଵ ݀=‫ܦ‬ customer group (token) (sentence) restaurant (document) ߶ଵଵ 			ߟଵଵ ݀=1 ‫1=ݏ‬ ߶ଵଵଵ 		ߟଵଵଵ combo (path) Nd,s Nd,·,l Nd,·,>l Nd,·,≥l Mc,l Cc,l,v Cd,x,l,v φk ηk τv cd,t td,s zd,s,n kd,s,n L C+ Figure 2: S H L DA’s restaurant franchise metaphor. # sentences in document d # groups (i.e. sentences) sitting at table t in restaurant d # tokens wd,s # tokens in wd assigned to level l # tokens in wd assigned to level > l ≡ Nd,·,l + Nd,·,>l # tables at level l on path c # word type v assigned to level l on path c # word type v in vd,x assigned to level l Topic at node k Regression parameter at node k Regression parameter of word type v Path assignment for table t in restaurant d Table assignment for group wd,s Level assignment for wd,s,n Node assignment for wd,s,n (i.e., node at level zd,s,n on path cd,td,s ) Height of the tree Set of all possible paths (including new ones) of the tree Table 1: Notation used in this paper Unlike SLDA, we model the response variables using a normal linear regression that contains both pertopic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters. The hierarchical regression parameters are just like topics’ regression parameters in SLDA: each topic k (here, a tree node) has a parameter ηk , and the model uses the empirical distribution over the nodes that generated a document as the regressors. However, the hierarchy in S H L DA makes it possible to discover relationships between topics and the response variable that SLDA’s simple latent space obscures. Consider, for example, a topic model trained on Congressional debates. Vanilla LDA would likely discover a healthcare category. SLDA [12] could discover a pro-Obamacare topic and an anti-Obamacare topic. S H L DA could do that and capture the fact that there are alternative perspectives, i.e., that the healthcare issue is being discussed from two ideological perspectives, along with characterizing how the higher level topic is discussed by those on both sides of that ideological debate. Sometimes, of course, words are strongly associated with extremes on the response variable continuum regardless of underlying topic structure. Therefore, in addition to hierarchical regression parameters, we include global lexical regression parameters to model the interaction between speciﬁc words and response variables. We denote the regression parameter associated with a word type v in the vocabulary as τv , and use the normalized frequency of v in the documents to be its regressor. Including both hierarchical and lexical parameters is important. For detecting ideology in the US, “liberty” is an effective indicator of conservative speakers regardless of context; however, “cost” is a conservative-leaning indicator in discussions about environmental policy but liberal-leaning in debates about foreign policy. For sentiment, “wonderful” is globally a positive word; however, “unexpected” is a positive descriptor of books but a negative one of a car’s steering. S H L DA captures these properties in a single model. 3 Posterior Inference and Optimization Given documents with observed words w = {wd,s,n } and response variables y = {yd }, the inference task is to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over: the tree structure including topic φk and regression parameter ηk for each node k, combo assignment cd,t for each table t in document d, table assignment td,s for each sentence s in a document d, and level assignment zd,s,n for each token wd,s,n . We approximate S H L DA’s posterior using stochastic EM, which alternates between a Gibbs sampling E-step and an optimization M-step. More speciﬁcally, in the E-step, we integrate out ψ, θ and φ to construct a Markov chain over (t, c, z) and alternate sampling each of them from their conditional distributions. In the M-step, we optimize the regression parameters η and τ using L-BFGS [13]. Before describing each step in detail, let us deﬁne the following probabilities. For more thorough derivations, please see the supplement. 3 • First, deﬁne vd,x as a set of tokens (e.g., a token, a sentence or a set of sentences) in document d. The conditional density of vd,x being assigned to path c given all other assignments is −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + V βl ) L −d,x fc (vd,x ) = l=1 −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + Cd,x,l,v + βl ) V −d,x Γ(Cc,l,· + Cd,x,l,· + V βl ) (1) −d,x Γ(Cc,l,v + βl ) v=1 where superscript −d,x denotes the same count excluding assignments of vd,x ; marginal counts −d,x are represented by ·’s. For a new path cnew , if the node does not exist, Ccnew ,l,v = 0 for all word types v. • Second, deﬁne the conditional density of the response variable yd of document d given vd,x being −d,x assigned to path c and all other assignments as gc (yd ) =  1 N Nd,· ηc,l · Cd,x,l,· + ηcd,td,s ,zd,s,n + wd,s,n ∈{wd \vd,x }  Sd Nd,s L τwd,s,n , ρ (2) s=1 n=1 l=1 where Nd,· is the total number of tokens in document d. For a new node at level l on a new path cnew , we integrate over all possible values of ηcnew ,l . Sampling t: For each group wd,s we need to sample a table td,s . The conditional distribution of a table t given wd,s and other assignments is proportional to the number of sentences sitting at t times the probability of wd,s and yd being observed under this assignment. This is P (td,s = t | rest) ∝ P (td,s = t | t−s ) · P (wd,s , yd | td,s = t, w−d,s , t−d,s , z, c, η) d ∝ −d,s −d,s −d,s Sd,t · fcd,t (wd,s ) · gcd,t (yd ), for existing table t; (3) −d,s −d,s α · c∈C + P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) · fc (wd,s ) · gc (yd ), for new table tnew . For a new table tnew , we need to sum over all possible paths C + of the tree, including new ones. For example, the set C + for the tree shown in Figure 2 consists of four existing paths (ending at one of the four leaf nodes) and three possible new paths (a new leaf off of one of the three internal nodes). The prior probability of path c is: P (cd,tnew = c | c−d,s ) ∝       L l=2 −d,s Mc,l −d,s Mc,l−1 + γl−1  γl∗    −d,s M ∗ cnew ,l∗ + γl , l∗ l=2 for an existing path c; (4) −d,s Mcnew ,l , for a new path cnew which consists of an existing path −d,s Mcnew ,l−1 + γl−1 from the root to a node at level l∗ and a new node. Sampling z: After assigning a sentence wd,s to a table, we assign each token wd,s,n to a level to choose a dish from the combo. The probability of assigning wd,s,n to level l is −s,n P (zd,s,n = l | rest) ∝ P (zd,s,n = l | zd )P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) (5) The ﬁrst factor captures the probability that a customer in restaurant d is assigned to level l, conditioned on the level assignments of all other customers in restaurant d, and is equal to P (zd,s,n = −s,n l | zd ) = −d,s,n mπ + Nd,·,l −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥l l−1 −d,s,n (1 − m)π + Nd,·,>j −d,s,n π + Nd,·,≥j j=1 , The second factor is the probability of observing wd,s,n and yd , given that wd,s,n is assigned to level −d,s,n −d,s,n l: P (wd,s,n , yd | zd,s,n = l, w−d,s,n , z −d,s,n , t, c, η) = fcd,t (wd,s,n ) · gcd,t (yd ). d,s d,s Sampling c: After assigning customers to tables and levels, we also sample path assignments for all tables. This is important since it can change the assignments of all customers sitting at a table, which leads to a well-mixed Markov chain and faster convergence. The probability of assigning table t in restaurant d to a path c is P (cd,t = c | rest) ∝ P (cd,t = c | c−d,t ) · P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) (6) where we slightly abuse the notation by using wd,t ≡ ∪{s|td,s =t} wd,s to denote the set of customers in all the groups sitting at table t in restaurant d. The ﬁrst factor is the prior probability of a path given all tables’ path assignments c−d,t , excluding table t in restaurant d and is given in Equation 4. The second factor in Equation 6 is the probability of observing wd,t and yd given the new path −d,t −d,t assignments, P (wd,t , yd | cd,t = c, w−d,t , c−d,t , t, z, η) = fc (wd,t ) · gc (yd ). 4 Optimizing η and τ : We optimize the regression parameters η and τ via the likelihood, 1 L(η, τ ) = − 2ρ D 1 ¯ ¯ (yd − η zd − τ wd ) − 2σ T d=1 T K+ 2 (ηk − µ)2 − k=1 1 ω V |τv |, (7) v=1 where K + is the number of nodes in the tree.2 This maximization is performed using L-BFGS [13]. 4 Data: Congress, Products, Films We conduct our experiments using three datasets: Congressional ﬂoor debates, Amazon product reviews, and movie reviews. For all datasets, we remove stopwords, add bigrams to the vocabulary, and ﬁlter the vocabulary using tf-idf.3 • U.S Congressional ﬂoor debates: We downloaded debates of the 109th US Congress from GovTrack4 and preprocessed them as in Thomas et al. [14]. To remove uninterestingly non-polarized debates, we ignore bills with less than 20% “Yea” votes or less than 20% “Nay” votes. Each document d is a turn (a continuous utterance by a single speaker, i.e. speech segment [14]), and its response variable yd is the ﬁrst dimension of the speaker’s DW- NOMINATE score [15], which captures the traditional left-right political distinction.5 After processing, our corpus contains 5,201 turns in the House, 3,060 turns in the Senate, and 5,000 words in the vocabulary.6 • Amazon product reviews: From a set of Amazon reviews of manufactured products such as computers, MP 3 players, GPS devices, etc. [16], we focused on the 50 most frequently reviewed products. After ﬁltering, this corpus contains 37,191 reviews with a vocabulary of 5,000 words. We use the rating associated with each review as the response variable yd .7 • Movie reviews: Our third corpus is a set of 5,006 reviews of movies [17], again using review ratings as the response variable yd , although in this corpus the ratings are normalized to the range from 0 to 1. After preprocessing, the vocabulary contains 5,000 words. 5 Evaluating Prediction S H L DA’s response variable predictions provide a formally rigorous way to assess whether it is an improvement over prior methods. We evaluate effectiveness in predicting values of the response variables for unseen documents in the three datasets. For comparison we consider these baselines: • Multiple linear regression (MLR) models the response variable as a linear function of multiple features (or regressors). Here, we consider two types of features: topic-based features and lexicallybased features. Topic-based MLR, denoted by MLR - LDA, uses the topic distributions learned by vanilla LDA as features [12], while lexically-based MLR, denoted by MLR - VOC, uses the frequencies of words in the vocabulary as features. MLR - LDA - VOC uses both features. • Support vector regression (SVM) is a discriminative method [18] that uses LDA topic distributions (SVM - LDA), word frequencies (SVM - VOC), and both (SVM - LDA - VOC) as features.8 • Supervised topic model (SLDA): we implemented SLDA using Gibbs sampling. The version of SLDA we use is slightly different from the original SLDA described in [12], in that we place a Gaussian prior N (0, 1) over the regression parameters to perform L2-norm regularization.9 For parametric models (LDA and SLDA), which require the number of topics K to be speciﬁed beforehand, we use K ∈ {10, 30, 50}. We use symmetric Dirichlet priors in both LDA and SLDA, initialize The superscript + is to denote that this number is unbounded and varies during the sampling process. To ﬁnd bigrams, we begin with bigram candidates that occur at least 10 times in the corpus and use Pearson’s χ2 -test to ﬁlter out those that have χ2 -value less than 5, which corresponds to a signiﬁcance level of 0.025. We then treat selected bigrams as single word types and add them to the vocabulary. 2 3 4 http://www.govtrack.us/data/us/109/ 5 Scores were downloaded from http://voteview.com/dwnomin_joint_house_and_senate.htm 6 Data will be available after blind review. 7 The ratings can range from 1 to 5, but skew positive. 8 9 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ This performs better than unregularized SLDA in our experiments. 5 Floor Debates House-Senate Senate-House PCC ↑ MSE ↓ PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Amazon Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ Movie Reviews PCC ↑ MSE ↓ SVM - LDA 10 SVM - LDA 30 SVM - LDA 50 SVM - VOC SVM - LDA - VOC 0.173 0.172 0.169 0.336 0.256 0.861 0.840 0.832 1.549 0.784 0.08 0.155 0.215 0.131 0.246 1.247 1.183 1.135 1.467 1.101 0.157 0.277 0.245 0.373 0.371 1.241 1.091 1.130 0.972 0.965 0.327 0.365 0.395 0.584 0.585 0.970 0.938 0.906 0.681 0.678 MLR - LDA 10 MLR - LDA 30 MLR - LDA 50 MLR - VOC MLR - LDA - VOC 0.163 0.160 0.150 0.322 0.319 0.735 0.737 0.741 0.889 0.873 0.068 0.162 0.248 0.191 0.194 1.151 1.125 1.081 1.124 1.120 0.143 0.258 0.234 0.408 0.410 1.034 1.065 1.114 0.869 0.860 0.328 0.367 0.389 0.568 0.581 0.957 0.936 0.914 0.721 0.702 SLDA 10 SLDA 30 SLDA 50 0.154 0.174 0.254 0.729 0.793 0.897 0.090 0.128 0.245 1.145 1.188 1.184 0.270 0.357 0.241 1.113 1.146 1.939 0.383 0.433 0.503 0.953 0.852 0.772 S H L DA 0.356 0.753 0.303 1.076 0.413 0.891 0.597 0.673 Models Table 2: Regression results for Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC, higher is better (↑)) and mean squared error (MSE, lower is better (↓)). Results on Amazon product reviews and movie reviews are averaged over 5 folds. Subscripts denote the number of topics for parametric models. For SVM - LDA - VOC and MLR - LDA - VOC, only best results across K ∈ {10, 30, 50} are reported. Best results are in bold. the Dirichlet hyperparameters to 0.5, and use slice sampling [19] for updating hyperparameters. For SLDA , the variance of the regression is set to 0.5. For S H L DA , we use trees with maximum depth of three. We slice sample m, π, β and γ, and ﬁx µ = 0, σ = 0.5, ω = 0.5 and ρ = 0.5. We found that the following set of initial hyperparameters works reasonably well for all the datasets in our experiments: m = 0.5, π = 100, β = (1.0, 0.5, 0.25), γ = (1, 1), α = 1. We also set the regression parameter of the root node to zero, which speeds inference (since it is associated with every document) and because it is reasonable to assume that it would not change the response variable. To compare the performance of different methods, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) and mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted values of the response variables and average over 5 folds. For the Congressional debate corpus, following Yu et al. [20], we use documents in the House to train and test on documents in the Senate and vice versa. Results and analysis Table 2 shows the performance of all models on our three datasets. Methods that only use topic-based features such as SVM - LDA and MLR - LDA do poorly. Methods only based on lexical features like SVM - VOC and MLR - VOC outperform methods that are based only on topic features signiﬁcantly for the two review datasets, but are comparable or worse on congressional debates. This suggests that reviews have more highly discriminative words than political speeches (Table 3). Combining topic-based and lexically-based features improves performance, which supports our choice of incorporating both per-topic and per-word regression parameters in S H L DA. In all cases, S H L DA achieves strong performance results. For the two cases where S H L DA was second best in MSE score (Amazon reviews and House-Senate), it outperforms other methods in PCC. Doing well in PCC for these two datasets is important since achieving low MSE is relatively easier due to the response variables’ bimodal distribution in the ﬂoor debates and positively-skewed distribution in Amazon reviews. For the ﬂoor debate dataset, the results of the House-Senate experiment are generally better than those of the Senate-House experiment, which is consistent with previous results [20] and is explained by the greater number of debates in the House. 6 Qualitative Analysis: Agendas and Framing/Perspective Although a formal coherence evaluation [21] remains a goal for future work, a qualitative look at the topic hierarchy uncovered by the model suggests that it is indeed capturing agenda/framing structure as discussed in Section 1. In Figure 3, a portion of the topic hierarchy induced from the Congressional debate corpus, Nodes A and B illustrate agendas—issues introduced into political discourse—associated with a particular ideology: Node A focuses on the hardships of the poorer victims of hurricane Katrina and is associated with Democrats, and text associated with Node E discusses a proposed constitutional amendment to ban ﬂag burning and is associated with Republicans. Nodes C and D, children of a neutral “tax” topic, reveal how parties frame taxes as gains in terms of new social services (Democrats) and losses for job creators (Republicans). 6 E ﬂag constitution freedom supreme_court elections rights continuity american_ﬂag constitutional_amendm ent gses credit_rating fannie_mae regulator freddie_mac market ﬁnancial_services agencies competition investors fannie bill speaker time amendment chairman people gentleman legislation congress support R:1.1 R:0 A minimum_wage commission independent_commissio n investigate hurricane_katrina increase investigation R:1.0 B percent tax economy estate_tax capital_gains money taxes businesses families tax_cuts pay tax_relief social_security affordable_housing housing manager fund activities funds organizations voter_registration faithbased nonproﬁts R:0.4 D:1.7 C death_tax jobs businesses business family_businesses equipment productivity repeal_permanency employees capital farms D REPUBLICAN billion budget children cuts debt tax_cuts child_support deﬁcit education students health_care republicans national_debt R:4.3 D:2.2 DEMOCRAT D:4.5 Figure 3: Topics discovered from Congressional ﬂoor debates. Many ﬁrst-level topics are bipartisan (purple), while lower level topics are associated with speciﬁc ideologies (Democrats blue, Republicans red). For example, the “tax” topic (B) is bipartisan, but its Democratic-leaning child (D) focuses on social goals supported by taxes (“children”, “education”, “health care”), while its Republican-leaning child (C) focuses on business implications (“death tax”, “jobs”, “businesses”). The number below each topic denotes the magnitude of the learned regression parameter associated with that topic. Colors and the numbers beneath each topic show the regression parameter η associated with the topic. Figure 4 shows the topic structure discovered by S H L DA in the review corpus. Nodes at higher levels are relatively neutral, with relatively small regression parameters.10 These nodes have general topics with no speciﬁc polarity. However, the bottom level clearly illustrates polarized positive/negative perspective. For example, Node A concerns washbasins for infants, and has two polarized children nodes: reviewers take a positive perspective when their children enjoy the product (Node B: “loves”, “splash”, “play”) but have negative reactions when it leaks (Node C: “leak(s/ed/ing)”). transmitter ipod car frequency iriver product transmitters live station presets itrip iriver_aft charges international_mode driving P:6.6 tried waste batteries tunecast rabbit_ears weak terrible antenna hear returned refund returning item junk return A D router setup network expander set signal wireless connect linksys connection house wireless_router laptop computer wre54g N:2.2 N:1.0 tivo adapter series adapters phone_line tivo_wireless transfer plugged wireless_adapter tivos plug dvr tivo_series tivo_box tivo_unit P:5.1 tub baby water bath sling son daughter sit bathtub sink newborn months bath_tub bathe bottom N:8.0 months loves hammock splash love baby drain eurobath hot ﬁts wash play infant secure slip P:7.5 NEGATIVE N:0 N:2.7 B POSITIVE time bought product easy buy love using price lot able set found purchased money months transmitter car static ipod radio mp3_player signal station sound music sound_quality volume stations frequency frequencies C leaks leaked leak leaking hard waste snap suction_cups lock tabs difﬁcult bottom tub_leaks properly ring N:8.9 monitor radio weather_radio night baby range alerts sound sony house interference channels receiver static alarm N:1.7 hear feature static monitors set live warning volume counties noise outside alert breathing rechargeable_battery alerts P:6.2 version hours phone F ﬁrmware told spent linksys tech_support technical_supportcusto mer_service range_expander support return N:10.6 E router ﬁrmware ddwrt wrt54gl version wrt54g tomato linksys linux routers ﬂash versions browser dlink stable P:4.8 z22 palm pda palm_z22 calendar software screen contacts computer device sync information outlook data programs N:1.9 headphones sound pair bass headset sound_quality ear ears cord earbuds comfortable hear head earphones ﬁt N:1.3 appointments organized phone lists handheld organizer photos etc pictures memos track bells books purse whistles P:5.8 noise_canceling noise sony exposed noise_cancellation stopped wires warranty noise_cancelling bud pay white_noise disappointed N:7.6 bottles bottle baby leak nipples nipple avent avent_bottles leaking son daughter formula leaks gas milk comfortable sound phones sennheiser bass px100 px100s phone headset highs portapros portapro price wear koss N:2.0 leak formula bottles_leak feeding leaked brown frustrating started clothes waste newborn playtex_ventaire soaked matter N:7.9 P:5.7 nipple breast nipples dishwasher ring sippy_cups tried breastfeed screwed breastfeeding nipple_confusion avent_system bottle P:6.4 Figure 4: Topics discovered from Amazon reviews. Higher topics are general, while lower topics are more speciﬁc. The polarity of the review is encoded in the color: red (negative) to blue (positive). Many of the ﬁrstlevel topics have no speciﬁc polarity and are associated with a broad class of products such as “routers” (Node D). However, the lowest topics in the hierarchy are often polarized; one child topic of “router” focuses on upgradable ﬁrmware such as “tomato” and “ddwrt” (Node E, positive) while another focuses on poor “tech support” and “customer service” (Node F, negative). The number below each topic is the regression parameter learned with that topic. In addition to the per-topic regression parameters, S H L DA also associates each word with a lexical regression parameter τ . Table 3 shows the top ten words with highest and lowest τ . The results are unsuprising, although the lexical regression for the Congressional debates is less clear-cut than other 10 All of the nodes at the second level have slightly negative values for the regression parameters mainly due to the very skewed distribution of the review ratings in Amazon. 7 datasets. As we saw in Section 5, for similar datasets, S H L DA’s context-speciﬁc regression is more useful when global lexical weights do not readily differentiate documents. Dataset Floor Debates Amazon Reviews Movie Reviews Top 10 words with positive weights bringing, private property, illegally, tax relief, regulation, mandates, constitutional, committee report, illegal alien highly recommend, pleased, love, loves, perfect, easy, excellent, amazing, glad, happy hilarious, fast, schindler, excellent, motion pictures, academy award, perfect, journey, fortunately, ability Top 10 words with negative weights bush administration, strong opposition, ranking, republicans, republican leadership, secret, discriminate, majority, undermine waste, returned, return, stopped, leak, junk, useless, returning, refund, terrible bad, unfortunately, supposed, waste, mess, worst, acceptable, awful, suppose, boring Table 3: Top words based on the global lexical regression coefﬁcient, τ . For the ﬂoor debates, positive τ ’s are Republican-leaning while negative τ ’s are Democrat-leaning. 7 Related Work S H L DA joins a family of LDA extensions that introduce hierarchical topics, supervision, or both. Owing to limited space, we focus here on related work that combines the two. Petinot et al. [22] propose hierarchical Labeled LDA (hLLDA), which leverages an observed document ontology to learn topics in a tree structure; however, hLLDA assumes that the underlying tree structure is known a priori. SSHLDA [23] generalizes hLLDA by allowing the document hierarchy labels to be partially observed, with unobserved labels and topic tree structure then inferred from the data. Boyd-Graber and Resnik [24] used hierarchical distributions within topics to learn topics across languages. In addition to these “upstream” models [25], Perotte et al. [26] propose a “downstream” model called HSLDA , which jointly models documents’ hierarchy of labels and topics. HSLDA ’s topic structure is ﬂat, however, and the response variable is a hierarchy of labels associated with each document, unlike S H L DA’s continuous response variable. Finally, another body related body of work includes models that jointly capture topics and other facets such as ideologies/perspectives [27, 28] and sentiments/opinions [29], albeit with discrete rather than continuously valued responses. Computational modeling of sentiment polarity is a voluminous ﬁeld [30], and many computational political science models describe agendas [5] and ideology [31]. Looking at framing or bias at the sentence level, Greene and Resnik [32] investigate the role of syntactic structure in framing, Yano et al. [33] look at lexical indications of sentence-level bias, and Recasens et al. [34] develop linguistically informed sentence-level features for identifying bias-inducing words. 8 Conclusion We have introduced S H L DA, a model that associates a continuously valued response variable with hierarchical topics to capture both the issues under discussion and alternative perspectives on those issues. The two-level structure improves predictive performance over existing models on multiple datasets, while also adding potentially insightful hierarchical structure to the topic analysis. Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis, the topic hierarchy exposed by the model plausibly captures the idea of agenda setting, which is related to the issues that get discussed, and framing, which is related to authors’ perspectives on those issues. We plan to analyze the topic structure produced by S H L DA with political science collaborators and more generally to study how S H L DA and related models can help analyze and discover useful insights from political discourse.

<p>Author: Daniel Hernández-Lobato, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</p><p>Abstract: A probabilistic model based on the horseshoe prior is proposed for learning dependencies in the process of identifying relevant features for prediction. Exact inference is intractable in this model. However, expectation propagation offers an approximate alternative. Because the process of estimating feature selection dependencies may suffer from over-ﬁtting in the model proposed, additional data from a multi-task learning scenario are considered for induction. The same model can be used in this setting with few modiﬁcations. Furthermore, the assumptions made are less restrictive than in other multi-task methods: The different tasks must share feature selection dependencies, but can have different relevant features and model coefﬁcients. Experiments with real and synthetic data show that this model performs better than other multi-task alternatives from the literature. The experiments also show that the model is able to induce suitable feature selection dependencies for the problems considered, only from the training data. 1</p><p>5 0.07788039 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Streaming_Variational_Bayes.html">317 nips-2013-Streaming Variational Bayes</a></p>

The framework makes streaming updates to the estimated posterior according to a user-speciﬁed approximation batch primitive. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework, with variational Bayes (VB) as the primitive, by ﬁtting the latent Dirichlet allocation model to two large-scale document collections. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over stochastic variational inference (SVI) by comparing the two after a single pass through a known amount of data—a case where SVI may be applied—and in the streaming setting, where SVI does not apply. 1</p><p>6 0.07178127 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Multiple_Models_via_Regularized_Weighting.html">158 nips-2013-Learning Multiple Models via Regularized Weighting</a></p>

<p>Author: John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Brendan McMahan</p><p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization problems when the data is sparse, which is in a sense dual to current perspectives on high-dimensional statistical learning and optimization. We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. 1 Introduction and problem setting In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . For a probability distribution P on Ξ, we consider the following optimization problem: minimize f (x) := E[F (x; ξ)] = x∈X F (x; ξ)dP (ξ). (1) Ξ By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. (2) The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0.1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. As a motivating example, consider a text classiﬁcation problem: data ξ ∈ Rd represents words appearing in a document, and we wish to minimize a logistic loss F (x; ξ) = log(1 + exp( ξ, x )) on the data (we encode the label implicitly with the sign of ξ). Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. From a modelling perspective, it thus makes sense to allow a dense predictor x: any non-zero entry of ξ is potentially relevant and important. In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. So 1 Formally, if πξ denotes the coordinate projection zeroing all indices j of its argument where ξj = 0, then F (πξ (x); ξ) = F (x; ξ) for all x, ξ. This follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions for convexity [6]. 1 while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. In this paper, we investigate algorithms and their inherent limitations for solving problem (1) under natural conditions on the data generating distribution. Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. In another line of research, Duchi et al. [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). These algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance and have theoretical guarantees on their convergence, but it is not clear if they are optimal—in that no algorithm can attain better statistical performance—or whether they can leverage parallel computing as in the papers [12, 14]. In this paper, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). These results have two main implications. They show that in some scenarios, learning with sparse data is quite difﬁcult, as essentially each coordinate j ∈ [d] can be relevant and must be optimized for. In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . Combining insights of Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. We also give experiments on text-classiﬁcation and web-advertising tasks to illustrate the beneﬁts of the new algorithms. 2 Minimax rates for sparse optimization We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. Formally, let x denote any estimator for a minimizer of the objective (1). We deﬁne the optimality gap N for the estimator x based on N samples ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N from the distribution P as N (x, F, X , P ) := f (x) − inf f (x) = EP [F (x; ξ)] − inf EP [F (x; ξ)] . x∈X x∈X This quantity is a random variable, since x is a random variable (it is a function of ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N ). To deﬁne the minimax error, we thus take expectations of the quantity N , though we require a bit more than simply E[ N ]. We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. We can then deﬁne the minimax error for the family of losses F and distributions P as ∗ N (X , P, F) := inf sup sup EP [ x P ∈P F ∈F N (x(ξ 1:N ), F, X , P )], (3) where the inﬁmum is taken over all possible estimators x (an estimator is an optimization scheme, or a measurable mapping x : ΞN → X ) . 2.1 Minimax lower bounds Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. We obtain 2 Proposition 1. Let the conditions of the preceding paragraph hold. Let R be a constant such that X ⊃ [−R, R]d . Then √ d pj 1 ∗ . Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A.1 in the full version of the paper, providing a few remarks here. We begin by giving a corollary to Proposition 1 that follows when the data ξ obeys a type of power law: let p0 ∈ [0, 1], and assume that P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α . We have Corollary 2. Let α ≥ 0. Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. Then (1) If d > (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ 2−α 1−α p0 p0 (p0 N ) 2α − 1 + d1−α − (p0 N ) α N 1−α 2 MR 8 2−α (2) If d ≤ (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ MR 8 p0 N α 1 1 d1− 2 − 1 − α/2 1 − α/2 . . Expanding Corollary 2 slightly, for simplicity assume the number of samples is large enough that d ≤ (p0 N )1/α . Then we ﬁnd that the lower bound on optimization error is of order p0 1− α p0 p0 d 2 when α < 2, M R log d when α → 2, and M R when α > 2. (4) N N N These results beg the question of tightness: are they improvable? As we see presently, they are not. MR 2.2 Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M ( d j=1 1 pj ) 2 √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . Dual averaging, due to Nesterov [11] (sometimes called “follow the regularized leader” [5]) is a more recent algorithm. In dual averaging, one again samples g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), but instead of updating the parameter vector x one updates a dual vector z by z ← z + g, then computes 1 x ← argmin z, x + ψ(x) , η x∈X E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) x∈X 2 1 where ψ(x) is a strongly convex function deﬁned over X (often one takes ψ(x) = 2 x 2 ). As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin z, x + x ∈X 3 1 1 x ,S2x 2η . After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N d √ pj , (6) j=1 where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [4, Section 1.3 and Theorem 5]). By inspection, the A DAG RAD rate (6) matches the lower bound in Proposition 1 and is thus optimal. It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. For α > 1, the A DAG RAD rate is no worse, √ and for α ≥ 2, is more than d/ log d better—an exponential improvement in the dimension. 3 Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. To provide the setting for our further algorithms, we ﬁrst revisit Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12]. H OGWILD ! is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. Fix a stepsize η > 0. A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. Sample ξ ∼ P 2. Read x and compute g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) 3. For each j s.t. gj = 0, update xj ← ΠXj (xj − ηgj ). Here ΠXj denotes projection onto the jth coordinate of the domain X . The key of H OGWILD ! is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. Indeed, Niu et al. [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. 3.1 Asynchronous dual averaging A weakness of H OGWILD ! is that it appears only applicable to problems for which the domain X is a product space, and its analysis assumes g 0 = 1 for all gradients g. In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. Read z and compute x := argminx∈X 1 z, x + η ψ(x) // Implicitly increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) // Let g(t) = g. 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . Because the actual computation of the vector x in A SYNC DA is performed locally on each processor in step 1 of the algorithm, the algorithm can be executed with any proximal function ψ and domain X . The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. Since addition is commutative and associative, forcing all asynchrony to this point of the algorithm is a natural strategy for avoiding synchronization problems. In our analysis of A SYNC DA, and in our subsequent analysis of the adaptive methods, we require a measurement of time elapsed. With that in mind, we let t denote a time index that exists (roughly) behind-the-scenes. We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4 algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. This quantity t exists and is recoverable from the algorithm, and it is possible to track the running sum τ =1 x(τ ). Additionally, we state two assumptions encapsulating the conditions underlying our analysis. Assumption A. There is an upper bound m on the delay of any processor. In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. Assumption B. There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . With these deﬁnitions, we have the following theorem, which captures the convergence behavior of A SYNC DA under the assumption that X is a Cartesian product, meaning that X = X1 × · · · × Xd , 2 where Xj ⊂ R, and that ψ(x) = 1 x 2 . Note the algorithm itself can still be efﬁciently parallelized 2 for more general convex X , even if the theorem does not apply. Theorem 3. Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. Then T E t=1 F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) ≤ 1 x∗ 2η d 2 2 η 2 p2 Mj . + T M2 + ηT m j 2 j=1 We now provide a few remarks to explain and simplify the result. Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . Thus, for the d 2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . We then obtain the following corollary. √ T 1 Corollary 4. Deﬁne x(T ) = T t=1 x(t), and set η = x∗ 2 /M T . Then E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ M x∗ √ T 2 +m x∗ 2 √ 2M T d 2 p2 M j . j j=1 Corollary 4 is nearly immediate: since ξ t is independent of x(t), we have E[F (x(t); ξ t ) | x(t)] = f (x(t)); applying Jensen’s inequality to f (x(T )) and performing an algebraic manipulation give the result. If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗ 2 3 = 2 d j=1 2 pj M j x ∗ √ T 2 , (7) which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. 3.2 Asynchronous AdaGrad We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2.2). The matrix S is initialized as diag(δ 2 ), where δj ≥ 0 is an initial value. Each processor asynchronously performs the following iterations: 1 1 1. Read S and z and set G = S 2 . Compute x := argminx∈X { z, x + 2η x, Gx } increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x, S(t) = S 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂F (x; ξ) 2 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . 5 // Implicitly As in the description of A SYNC DA, we note that x(t) is the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth “step” of the algorithm (step 1), and similarly associate ξ t with x(t). To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. 2 Assumption C. There exist constants (Mj )d such that E[(∂xj F (x; ξ))2 | ξj = 0] ≤ Mj for all j=1 x ∈ X. 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. We then have the following convergence result. Theorem 5. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 3, let Assumption C hold. Assume that for all 2 j we have δ 2 ≥ Mj m and X ⊂ [−R∞ , R∞ ]d . Then T t=1 E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d ≤ min j=1 T 1 2 R E η ∞ 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 T + ηE gj (t) t=1 2 1 2 (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . t=1 It is possible to relax the condition on the initial constant diagonal term; we defer this to the full version of the paper. It is natural to ask in which situations the bound provided by Theorem 5 is optimal. We note that, as in the case with Theorem 3, we may obtain a convergence rate for f (x(T )) − f (x∗ ) using convexity, T 1 where x(T ) = T t=1 x(t). By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T E 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 t=1 T ≤ 2 2 E[gj (t) ] δ + t=1 1 2 ≤ 2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1) 1 2 R +η η ∞ Mj min which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e.g., to online convex optimization [5]). Speciﬁcally, an adversary may choose an arbitrary sequence of functions subject to the random data sparsity constraint (2), and our results provide an expected regret bound, which is strictly stronger than the stochastic convergence guarantees provided (and guarantees high-probability convergence in stochastic settings [3]). Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. When the data is sparse, we indeed should use asynchronous algorithms, but using adaptive methods yields even more improvement than simple gradient-based methods. 4 Experiments In this section, we give experimental validation of our theoretical results on A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA, giving results on two datasets selected for their high-dimensional sparsity.2 2 In our experiments, A SYNC DA and H OGWILD ! had effectively identical performance. 6 8 0.07 6 5 4 0.024 Test error Training loss Speedup 0.025 0.065 7 0.06 0.055 0.05 0.045 0.04 0.023 0.022 0.021 0.02 0.035 3 0.019 2 1 2 4 0.03 A-A DAG RAD A SYNC DA Number of workers 6 8 10 12 14 0.018 0.025 0.02 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 0.017 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 16 Figure 1.

The dataset in this case consists of an anonymized collection of URLs labeled as malicious (e.g., spam, phishing, etc.) or benign over a span of 120 days. The data in this case consists of 2.4 · 106 examples with dimension d = 3.2 · 106 (sparse) features. We perform several experiments, randomly dividing the dataset into 1.2 · 106 training and test samples for each experiment. In Figure 1 we compare the performance of A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA after doing after single pass through the training dataset. (For each algorithm, we choose the stepsize η for optimal training set performance.) We perform the experiments on a single machine running Ubuntu Linux with six cores (with two-way hyperthreading) and 32Gb of RAM. From the left-most plot in Fig. 1, we see that up to six processors, both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD enjoy the expected linear speedup, and from 6 to 12, they continue to enjoy a speedup that is linear in the number of processors though at a lesser slope (this is the effect of hyperthreading). For more than 12 processors, there is no further beneﬁt to parallelism on this machine. The two right plots in Figure 1 plot performance of the different methods (with standard errors) versus the number of worker threads used. Both are essentially ﬂat; increasing the amount of parallelism does nothing to the average training loss or the test error rate for either method. It is clear, however, that for this dataset, the adaptive A SYNC A DAG RAD algorithm provides substantial performance beneﬁts over A SYNC DA. 4.2 Click-through-rate prediction experiments We also experiment on a proprietary datasets consisting of search ad impressions. Each example corresponds to showing a search-engine user a particular text ad in response to a query string. From this, we construct a very sparse feature vector based on the text of the ad displayed and the query string (no user-speciﬁc data is used). The target label is 1 if the user clicked the ad and -1 otherwise. 7 (B) A-AdaGrad speedup (D) Impact of training data ordering 1.004 1.005 1.006 1.007 1.008 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1.000 1 2 A-DA base η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad base η = 0.023 0 1.005 relative stepsize (C) Optimal stepsize scaling relative log-loss 1.003 target relative log-loss 1.005 1.010 1.002 1.010 1.015 8 4 0 speedup A-DA η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad η = 0.016 1.001 1.000 relative log-loss 1.015 A-DA, L2=80 A-AdaGrad, L2=80 12 (A) Optimized stepsize for each number of passes 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 number of passes Figure 3.

(B) Effective speedup for A SYNC A DAG RAD. (C) The best stepsize η, expressed as a scaling factor on the stepsize used for one pass. (D) Five runs with different random seeds for each algorithm (with 2 penalty 80). We ﬁt logistic regression models using both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD. We run extensive experiments on a moderate-sized dataset (about 107 examples, split between training and testing), which allows thorough investigation of the impact of the stepsize η, the number of training passes,3 and 2 -regularization on accuracy. For these experiments we used 32 threads on 16 core machines for each run, as A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA achieve similar speedups from parallelization. On this dataset, A SYNC A DAG RAD typically achieves an effective additional speedup over A SYNC DA of 4× or more. That is, to reach a given level of accuracy, A SYNC DA generally needs four times as many effective passes over the dataset. We measure accuracy with log-loss (the logistic loss) averaged over ﬁve runs using different random seeds (which control the order in which the algorithms sample examples during training). We report relative values in Figures 2 and 3, that is, the ratio of the mean loss for the given datapoint to the lowest (best) mean loss obtained. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of relative log-loss as the metric of interest; we also considered AUC (the area under the ROC curve) and observed similar results. Figure 2 shows relative log-loss as a function of the number of training passes for various stepsizes. Without regularization, A SYNC A DAG RAD is prone to overﬁtting: it achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy on the training data (Fig. 2 (left)), but unless the stepsize is tuned carefully to the number of passes, it will overﬁt (Fig. 2 (middle)). Fortunately, the addition of 2 regularization largely solves this problem. Indeed, Figure 2 (right) shows that while adding an 2 penalty of 80 has very little impact on A SYNC DA, it effectively prevents the overﬁtting of A SYNC A DAG RAD.4 Fixing √ regularization multiplier to 80, we varied the stepsize η over a multiplicative grid with res2 olution 2 for each number of passes and for each algorithm. Figure 3 reports the results obtained by selecting the best stepsize in terms of test set log-loss for each number of passes. Figure 3(A) shows relative log-loss of the best stepsize for each algorithm; 3(B) shows the relative time A SYNC DA requires with respect to A SYNC A DAG RAD to achieve a given loss. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(B) shows the ratio of the number of passes the algorithms require to achieve a ﬁxed loss, which gives a broader estimate of the speedup obtained by using A SYNC A DAG RAD; speedups range from 3.6× to 12×. Figure 3(C) shows the optimal stepsizes as a function of the best setting for one pass. The optimal stepsize decreases moderately for A SYNC A DAG RAD, but are somewhat noisy for A SYNC DA. It is interesting to note that A SYNC A DAG RAD’s accuracy is largely independent of the ordering of the training data, while A SYNC DA shows signiﬁcant variability. This can be seen both in the error bars on Figure 3(A), and explicitly in Figure 3(D), where we plot one line for each of the ﬁve random seeds used. Thus, while on the one hand A SYNC DA requires somewhat less tuning of the stepsize and 2 parameter, tuning A SYNC A DAG RAD is much easier because of its predictable response. 3 Here “number of passes” more precisely means the expected number of times each example in the dataset is trained on. That is, each worker thread randomly selects a training example from the dataset for each update, and we continued making updates until (dataset size) × (number of passes) updates have been processed. 4 For both algorithms, this is accomplished by adding the term η80 x 2 to the ψ function.

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, James Cipar, Henggang Cui, Seunghak Lee, Jin Kyu Kim, Phillip B. Gibbons, Garth A. Gibson, Greg Ganger, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: We propose a parameter server system for distributed ML, which follows a Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) model of computation that maximizes the time computational workers spend doing useful work on ML algorithms, while still providing correctness guarantees. The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model’s values (parameters and variables), and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older, stale versions of these values from a local cache, instead of waiting to get them from a central storage. This signiﬁcantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values. We provide a proof of correctness under SSP, as well as empirical results demonstrating that the SSP model achieves faster algorithm convergence on several different ML problems, compared to fully-synchronous and asynchronous schemes. 1</p><p>4 0.59437966 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Trading_Computation_for_Communication%3A_Distributed_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">333 nips-2013-Trading Computation for Communication: Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianbao Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present and study a distributed optimization algorithm by employing a stochastic dual coordinate ascent method. Stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods enjoy strong theoretical guarantees and often have better performances than stochastic gradient descent methods in optimizing regularized loss minimization problems. It still lacks of efforts in studying them in a distributed framework. We make a progress along the line by presenting a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm in a star network, with an analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication. We verify our analysis by experiments on real data sets. Moreover, we compare the proposed algorithm with distributed stochastic gradient descent methods and distributed alternating direction methods of multipliers for optimizing SVMs in the same distributed framework, and observe competitive performances. 1</p><p>5 0.57264978 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Pass-efficient_unsupervised_feature_selection.html">245 nips-2013-Pass-efficient unsupervised feature selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Crystal Maung, Haim Schweitzer</p><p>Abstract: The goal of unsupervised feature selection is to identify a small number of important features that can represent the data. We propose a new algorithm, a modiﬁcation of the classical pivoted QR algorithm of Businger and Golub, that requires a small number of passes over the data. The improvements are based on two ideas: keeping track of multiple features in each pass, and skipping calculations that can be shown not to affect the ﬁnal selection. Our algorithm selects the exact same features as the classical pivoted QR algorithm, and has the same favorable numerical stability. We describe experiments on real-world datasets which sometimes show improvements of several orders of magnitude over the classical algorithm. These results appear to be competitive with recently proposed randomized algorithms in terms of pass efﬁciency and run time. On the other hand, the randomized algorithms may produce more accurate features, at the cost of small probability of failure. 1</p><p>6 0.53147632 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Variance_Reduction_for_Stochastic_Gradient_Optimization.html">345 nips-2013-Variance Reduction for Stochastic Gradient Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Brendan McMahan</p><p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization problems when the data is sparse, which is in a sense dual to current perspectives on high-dimensional statistical learning and optimization. We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. 1 Introduction and problem setting In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . For a probability distribution P on Ξ, we consider the following optimization problem: minimize f (x) := E[F (x; ξ)] = x∈X F (x; ξ)dP (ξ). (1) Ξ By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. (2) The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0.1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. As a motivating example, consider a text classiﬁcation problem: data ξ ∈ Rd represents words appearing in a document, and we wish to minimize a logistic loss F (x; ξ) = log(1 + exp( ξ, x )) on the data (we encode the label implicitly with the sign of ξ). Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. From a modelling perspective, it thus makes sense to allow a dense predictor x: any non-zero entry of ξ is potentially relevant and important. In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. So 1 Formally, if πξ denotes the coordinate projection zeroing all indices j of its argument where ξj = 0, then F (πξ (x); ξ) = F (x; ξ) for all x, ξ. This follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions for convexity [6]. 1 while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. In this paper, we investigate algorithms and their inherent limitations for solving problem (1) under natural conditions on the data generating distribution. Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. In another line of research, Duchi et al. [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). These algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance and have theoretical guarantees on their convergence, but it is not clear if they are optimal—in that no algorithm can attain better statistical performance—or whether they can leverage parallel computing as in the papers [12, 14]. In this paper, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). These results have two main implications. They show that in some scenarios, learning with sparse data is quite difﬁcult, as essentially each coordinate j ∈ [d] can be relevant and must be optimized for. In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . Combining insights of Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. We also give experiments on text-classiﬁcation and web-advertising tasks to illustrate the beneﬁts of the new algorithms. 2 Minimax rates for sparse optimization We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. Formally, let x denote any estimator for a minimizer of the objective (1). We deﬁne the optimality gap N for the estimator x based on N samples ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N from the distribution P as N (x, F, X , P ) := f (x) − inf f (x) = EP [F (x; ξ)] − inf EP [F (x; ξ)] . x∈X x∈X This quantity is a random variable, since x is a random variable (it is a function of ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N ). To deﬁne the minimax error, we thus take expectations of the quantity N , though we require a bit more than simply E[ N ]. We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. We can then deﬁne the minimax error for the family of losses F and distributions P as ∗ N (X , P, F) := inf sup sup EP [ x P ∈P F ∈F N (x(ξ 1:N ), F, X , P )], (3) where the inﬁmum is taken over all possible estimators x (an estimator is an optimization scheme, or a measurable mapping x : ΞN → X ) . 2.1 Minimax lower bounds Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. We obtain 2 Proposition 1. Let the conditions of the preceding paragraph hold. Let R be a constant such that X ⊃ [−R, R]d . Then √ d pj 1 ∗ . Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A.1 in the full version of the paper, providing a few remarks here. We begin by giving a corollary to Proposition 1 that follows when the data ξ obeys a type of power law: let p0 ∈ [0, 1], and assume that P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α . We have Corollary 2. Let α ≥ 0. Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. Then (1) If d > (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ 2−α 1−α p0 p0 (p0 N ) 2α − 1 + d1−α − (p0 N ) α N 1−α 2 MR 8 2−α (2) If d ≤ (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ MR 8 p0 N α 1 1 d1− 2 − 1 − α/2 1 − α/2 . . Expanding Corollary 2 slightly, for simplicity assume the number of samples is large enough that d ≤ (p0 N )1/α . Then we ﬁnd that the lower bound on optimization error is of order p0 1− α p0 p0 d 2 when α < 2, M R log d when α → 2, and M R when α > 2. (4) N N N These results beg the question of tightness: are they improvable? As we see presently, they are not. MR 2.2 Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M ( d j=1 1 pj ) 2 √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . Dual averaging, due to Nesterov [11] (sometimes called “follow the regularized leader” [5]) is a more recent algorithm. In dual averaging, one again samples g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), but instead of updating the parameter vector x one updates a dual vector z by z ← z + g, then computes 1 x ← argmin z, x + ψ(x) , η x∈X E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) x∈X 2 1 where ψ(x) is a strongly convex function deﬁned over X (often one takes ψ(x) = 2 x 2 ). As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin z, x + x ∈X 3 1 1 x ,S2x 2η . After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N d √ pj , (6) j=1 where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [4, Section 1.3 and Theorem 5]). By inspection, the A DAG RAD rate (6) matches the lower bound in Proposition 1 and is thus optimal. It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. For α > 1, the A DAG RAD rate is no worse, √ and for α ≥ 2, is more than d/ log d better—an exponential improvement in the dimension. 3 Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. To provide the setting for our further algorithms, we ﬁrst revisit Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12]. H OGWILD ! is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. Fix a stepsize η > 0. A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. Sample ξ ∼ P 2. Read x and compute g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) 3. For each j s.t. gj = 0, update xj ← ΠXj (xj − ηgj ). Here ΠXj denotes projection onto the jth coordinate of the domain X . The key of H OGWILD ! is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. Indeed, Niu et al. [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. 3.1 Asynchronous dual averaging A weakness of H OGWILD ! is that it appears only applicable to problems for which the domain X is a product space, and its analysis assumes g 0 = 1 for all gradients g. In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. Read z and compute x := argminx∈X 1 z, x + η ψ(x) // Implicitly increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) // Let g(t) = g. 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . Because the actual computation of the vector x in A SYNC DA is performed locally on each processor in step 1 of the algorithm, the algorithm can be executed with any proximal function ψ and domain X . The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. Since addition is commutative and associative, forcing all asynchrony to this point of the algorithm is a natural strategy for avoiding synchronization problems. In our analysis of A SYNC DA, and in our subsequent analysis of the adaptive methods, we require a measurement of time elapsed. With that in mind, we let t denote a time index that exists (roughly) behind-the-scenes. We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4 algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. This quantity t exists and is recoverable from the algorithm, and it is possible to track the running sum τ =1 x(τ ). Additionally, we state two assumptions encapsulating the conditions underlying our analysis. Assumption A. There is an upper bound m on the delay of any processor. In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. Assumption B. There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . With these deﬁnitions, we have the following theorem, which captures the convergence behavior of A SYNC DA under the assumption that X is a Cartesian product, meaning that X = X1 × · · · × Xd , 2 where Xj ⊂ R, and that ψ(x) = 1 x 2 . Note the algorithm itself can still be efﬁciently parallelized 2 for more general convex X , even if the theorem does not apply. Theorem 3. Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. Then T E t=1 F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) ≤ 1 x∗ 2η d 2 2 η 2 p2 Mj . + T M2 + ηT m j 2 j=1 We now provide a few remarks to explain and simplify the result. Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . Thus, for the d 2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . We then obtain the following corollary. √ T 1 Corollary 4. Deﬁne x(T ) = T t=1 x(t), and set η = x∗ 2 /M T . Then E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ M x∗ √ T 2 +m x∗ 2 √ 2M T d 2 p2 M j . j j=1 Corollary 4 is nearly immediate: since ξ t is independent of x(t), we have E[F (x(t); ξ t ) | x(t)] = f (x(t)); applying Jensen’s inequality to f (x(T )) and performing an algebraic manipulation give the result. If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗ 2 3 = 2 d j=1 2 pj M j x ∗ √ T 2 , (7) which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. 3.2 Asynchronous AdaGrad We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2.2). The matrix S is initialized as diag(δ 2 ), where δj ≥ 0 is an initial value. Each processor asynchronously performs the following iterations: 1 1 1. Read S and z and set G = S 2 . Compute x := argminx∈X { z, x + 2η x, Gx } increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x, S(t) = S 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂F (x; ξ) 2 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . 5 // Implicitly As in the description of A SYNC DA, we note that x(t) is the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth “step” of the algorithm (step 1), and similarly associate ξ t with x(t). To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. 2 Assumption C. There exist constants (Mj )d such that E[(∂xj F (x; ξ))2 | ξj = 0] ≤ Mj for all j=1 x ∈ X. 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. We then have the following convergence result. Theorem 5. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 3, let Assumption C hold. Assume that for all 2 j we have δ 2 ≥ Mj m and X ⊂ [−R∞ , R∞ ]d . Then T t=1 E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d ≤ min j=1 T 1 2 R E η ∞ 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 T + ηE gj (t) t=1 2 1 2 (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . t=1 It is possible to relax the condition on the initial constant diagonal term; we defer this to the full version of the paper. It is natural to ask in which situations the bound provided by Theorem 5 is optimal. We note that, as in the case with Theorem 3, we may obtain a convergence rate for f (x(T )) − f (x∗ ) using convexity, T 1 where x(T ) = T t=1 x(t). By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T E 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 t=1 T ≤ 2 2 E[gj (t) ] δ + t=1 1 2 ≤ 2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1) 1 2 R +η η ∞ Mj min which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e.g., to online convex optimization [5]). Speciﬁcally, an adversary may choose an arbitrary sequence of functions subject to the random data sparsity constraint (2), and our results provide an expected regret bound, which is strictly stronger than the stochastic convergence guarantees provided (and guarantees high-probability convergence in stochastic settings [3]). Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. When the data is sparse, we indeed should use asynchronous algorithms, but using adaptive methods yields even more improvement than simple gradient-based methods. 4 Experiments In this section, we give experimental validation of our theoretical results on A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA, giving results on two datasets selected for their high-dimensional sparsity.2 2 In our experiments, A SYNC DA and H OGWILD ! had effectively identical performance. 6 8 0.07 6 5 4 0.024 Test error Training loss Speedup 0.025 0.065 7 0.06 0.055 0.05 0.045 0.04 0.023 0.022 0.021 0.02 0.035 3 0.019 2 1 2 4 0.03 A-A DAG RAD A SYNC DA Number of workers 6 8 10 12 14 0.018 0.025 0.02 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 0.017 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 16 Figure 1.

The dataset in this case consists of an anonymized collection of URLs labeled as malicious (e.g., spam, phishing, etc.) or benign over a span of 120 days. The data in this case consists of 2.4 · 106 examples with dimension d = 3.2 · 106 (sparse) features. We perform several experiments, randomly dividing the dataset into 1.2 · 106 training and test samples for each experiment. In Figure 1 we compare the performance of A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA after doing after single pass through the training dataset. (For each algorithm, we choose the stepsize η for optimal training set performance.) We perform the experiments on a single machine running Ubuntu Linux with six cores (with two-way hyperthreading) and 32Gb of RAM. From the left-most plot in Fig. 1, we see that up to six processors, both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD enjoy the expected linear speedup, and from 6 to 12, they continue to enjoy a speedup that is linear in the number of processors though at a lesser slope (this is the effect of hyperthreading). For more than 12 processors, there is no further beneﬁt to parallelism on this machine. The two right plots in Figure 1 plot performance of the different methods (with standard errors) versus the number of worker threads used. Both are essentially ﬂat; increasing the amount of parallelism does nothing to the average training loss or the test error rate for either method. It is clear, however, that for this dataset, the adaptive A SYNC A DAG RAD algorithm provides substantial performance beneﬁts over A SYNC DA. 4.2 Click-through-rate prediction experiments We also experiment on a proprietary datasets consisting of search ad impressions. Each example corresponds to showing a search-engine user a particular text ad in response to a query string. From this, we construct a very sparse feature vector based on the text of the ad displayed and the query string (no user-speciﬁc data is used). The target label is 1 if the user clicked the ad and -1 otherwise. 7 (B) A-AdaGrad speedup (D) Impact of training data ordering 1.004 1.005 1.006 1.007 1.008 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1.000 1 2 A-DA base η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad base η = 0.023 0 1.005 relative stepsize (C) Optimal stepsize scaling relative log-loss 1.003 target relative log-loss 1.005 1.010 1.002 1.010 1.015 8 4 0 speedup A-DA η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad η = 0.016 1.001 1.000 relative log-loss 1.015 A-DA, L2=80 A-AdaGrad, L2=80 12 (A) Optimized stepsize for each number of passes 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 number of passes Figure 3.

(B) Effective speedup for A SYNC A DAG RAD. (C) The best stepsize η, expressed as a scaling factor on the stepsize used for one pass. (D) Five runs with different random seeds for each algorithm (with 2 penalty 80). We ﬁt logistic regression models using both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD. We run extensive experiments on a moderate-sized dataset (about 107 examples, split between training and testing), which allows thorough investigation of the impact of the stepsize η, the number of training passes,3 and 2 -regularization on accuracy. For these experiments we used 32 threads on 16 core machines for each run, as A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA achieve similar speedups from parallelization. On this dataset, A SYNC A DAG RAD typically achieves an effective additional speedup over A SYNC DA of 4× or more. That is, to reach a given level of accuracy, A SYNC DA generally needs four times as many effective passes over the dataset. We measure accuracy with log-loss (the logistic loss) averaged over ﬁve runs using different random seeds (which control the order in which the algorithms sample examples during training). We report relative values in Figures 2 and 3, that is, the ratio of the mean loss for the given datapoint to the lowest (best) mean loss obtained. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of relative log-loss as the metric of interest; we also considered AUC (the area under the ROC curve) and observed similar results. Figure 2 shows relative log-loss as a function of the number of training passes for various stepsizes. Without regularization, A SYNC A DAG RAD is prone to overﬁtting: it achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy on the training data (Fig. 2 (left)), but unless the stepsize is tuned carefully to the number of passes, it will overﬁt (Fig. 2 (middle)). Fortunately, the addition of 2 regularization largely solves this problem. Indeed, Figure 2 (right) shows that while adding an 2 penalty of 80 has very little impact on A SYNC DA, it effectively prevents the overﬁtting of A SYNC A DAG RAD.4 Fixing √ regularization multiplier to 80, we varied the stepsize η over a multiplicative grid with res2 olution 2 for each number of passes and for each algorithm. Figure 3 reports the results obtained by selecting the best stepsize in terms of test set log-loss for each number of passes. Figure 3(A) shows relative log-loss of the best stepsize for each algorithm; 3(B) shows the relative time A SYNC DA requires with respect to A SYNC A DAG RAD to achieve a given loss. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(B) shows the ratio of the number of passes the algorithms require to achieve a ﬁxed loss, which gives a broader estimate of the speedup obtained by using A SYNC A DAG RAD; speedups range from 3.6× to 12×. Figure 3(C) shows the optimal stepsizes as a function of the best setting for one pass. The optimal stepsize decreases moderately for A SYNC A DAG RAD, but are somewhat noisy for A SYNC DA. It is interesting to note that A SYNC A DAG RAD’s accuracy is largely independent of the ordering of the training data, while A SYNC DA shows signiﬁcant variability. This can be seen both in the error bars on Figure 3(A), and explicitly in Figure 3(D), where we plot one line for each of the ﬁve random seeds used. Thus, while on the one hand A SYNC DA requires somewhat less tuning of the stepsize and 2 parameter, tuning A SYNC A DAG RAD is much easier because of its predictable response. 3 Here “number of passes” more precisely means the expected number of times each example in the dataset is trained on. That is, each worker thread randomly selects a training example from the dataset for each update, and we continued making updates until (dataset size) × (number of passes) updates have been processed. 4 For both algorithms, this is accomplished by adding the term η80 x 2 to the ψ function. We can achieve 2 slightly better results for A SYNC A DAG RAD by varying the 2 penalty with the number of passes. 8 References [1] P. Auer and C. Gentile.

<p>Author: Adhiraj Somani, Nan Ye, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee</p><p>Abstract: POMDPs provide a principled framework for planning under uncertainty, but are computationally intractable, due to the “curse of dimensionality” and the “curse of history”. This paper presents an online POMDP algorithm that alleviates these difﬁculties by focusing the search on a set of randomly sampled scenarios. A Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT) compactly captures the execution of all policies on these scenarios. Our Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT) algorithm searches the DESPOT for a policy, while optimally balancing the size of the policy and its estimated value obtained under the sampled scenarios. We give an output-sensitive performance bound for all policies derived from a DESPOT, and show that R-DESPOT works well if a small optimal policy exists. We also give an anytime algorithm that approximates R-DESPOT. Experiments show strong results, compared with two of the fastest online POMDP algorithms.

<p>Author: Aijun Bai, Feng Wu, Xiaoping Chen</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been drawing great interest in recent years for planning and learning under uncertainty. One of the key challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this, we present a novel approach for MCTS using Bayesian mixture modeling and inference based Thompson sampling and apply it to the problem of online planning in MDPs. Our algorithm, named Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS), models the uncertainty of the accumulated reward for actions in the search tree as a mixture of Normal distributions. We perform inferences on the mixture in Bayesian settings by choosing conjugate priors in the form of combinations of Dirichlet and NormalGamma distributions and select the best action at each decision node using Thompson sampling. Experimental results conﬁrm that our algorithm advances the state-of-the-art UCT approach with better values on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>4 0.75888842 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Relationship_Between_Binary_Classification%2C_Bipartite_Ranking%2C_and_Binary_Class_Probability_Estimation.html">223 nips-2013-On the Relationship Between Binary Classification, Bipartite Ranking, and Binary Class Probability Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Harikrishna Narasimhan, Shivani Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relationship between three fundamental problems in machine learning: binary classiﬁcation, bipartite ranking, and binary class probability estimation (CPE). It is known that a good binary CPE model can be used to obtain a good binary classiﬁcation model (by thresholding at 0.5), and also to obtain a good bipartite ranking model (by using the CPE model directly as a ranking model); it is also known that a binary classiﬁcation model does not necessarily yield a CPE model. However, not much is known about other directions. Formally, these relationships involve regret transfer bounds. In this paper, we introduce the notion of weak regret transfer bounds, where the mapping needed to transform a model from one problem to another depends on the underlying probability distribution (and in practice, must be estimated from data). We then show that, in this weaker sense, a good bipartite ranking model can be used to construct a good classiﬁcation model (by thresholding at a suitable point), and more surprisingly, also to construct a good binary CPE model (by calibrating the scores of the ranking model). 1</p><p>5 0.72684503 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Low_Rank_Kernel_Embeddings_of_Multivariate_Distributions.html">281 nips-2013-Robust Low Rank Kernel Embeddings of Multivariate Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Bo Dai</p><p>Abstract: Kernel embedding of distributions has led to many recent advances in machine learning. However, latent and low rank structures prevalent in real world distributions have rarely been taken into account in this setting. Furthermore, no prior work in kernel embedding literature has addressed the issue of robust embedding when the latent and low rank information are misspeciﬁed. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical low rank decomposition of kernels embeddings which can exploit such low rank structures in data while being robust to model misspeciﬁcation. We also illustrate with empirical evidence that the estimated low rank embeddings lead to improved performance in density estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.68080759 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>

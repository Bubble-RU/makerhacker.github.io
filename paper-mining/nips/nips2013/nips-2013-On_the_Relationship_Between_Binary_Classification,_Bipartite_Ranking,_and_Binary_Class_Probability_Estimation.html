<p>Author: Harish G. Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: The design of convex, calibrated surrogate losses, whose minimization entails consistency with respect to a desired target loss, is an important concept to have emerged in the theory of machine learning in recent years. We give an explicit construction of a convex least-squares type surrogate loss that can be designed to be calibrated for any multiclass learning problem for which the target loss matrix has a low-rank structure; the surrogate loss operates on a surrogate target space of dimension at most the rank of the target loss. We use this result to design convex calibrated surrogates for a variety of subset ranking problems, with target losses including the precision@q, expected rank utility, mean average precision, and pairwise disagreement. 1</p><p>3 0.10129773 <a title="223-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Process_Bandits.html">137 nips-2013-High-Dimensional Gaussian Process Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Josip Djolonga, Andreas Krause, Volkan Cevher</p><p>Abstract: Many applications in machine learning require optimizing unknown functions deﬁned over a high-dimensional space from noisy samples that are expensive to obtain. We address this notoriously hard challenge, under the assumptions that the function varies only along some low-dimensional subspace and is smooth (i.e., it has a low norm in a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space). In particular, we present the SI-BO algorithm, which leverages recent low-rank matrix recovery techniques to learn the underlying subspace of the unknown function and applies Gaussian Process Upper Conﬁdence sampling for optimization of the function. We carefully calibrate the exploration–exploitation tradeoff by allocating the sampling budget to subspace estimation and function optimization, and obtain the ﬁrst subexponential cumulative regret bounds and convergence rates for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensions under noisy observations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in difﬁcult scenarios. 1</p><p>4 0.092819318 <a title="223-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Costly_Features_and_Labels.html">230 nips-2013-Online Learning with Costly Features and Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Navid Zolghadr, Gabor Bartok, Russell Greiner, András György, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces the online probing problem: In each round, the learner is able to purchase the values of a subset of feature values. After the learner uses this information to come up with a prediction for the given round, he then has the option of paying to see the loss function that he is evaluated against. Either way, the learner pays for both the errors of his predictions and also whatever he chooses to observe, including the cost of observing the loss function for the given round and the cost of the observed features. We consider two variations of this problem, depending on whether the learner can observe the label for free or not. We provide algorithms and upper and lower bounds on the regret for both variants. We show that a positive cost for observing the label signiﬁcantly increases the regret of the problem. 1</p><p>5 0.079099387 <a title="223-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-The_Pareto_Regret_Frontier.html">325 nips-2013-The Pareto Regret Frontier</a></p>
<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen</p><p>Abstract: Performance guarantees for online learning algorithms typically take the form of regret bounds, which express that the cumulative loss overhead compared to the best expert in hindsight is small. In the common case of large but structured expert sets we typically wish to keep the regret especially small compared to simple experts, at the cost of modest additional overhead compared to more complex others. We study which such regret trade-offs can be achieved, and how. We analyse regret w.r.t. each individual expert as a multi-objective criterion in the simple but fundamental case of absolute loss. We characterise the achievable and Pareto optimal trade-offs, and the corresponding optimal strategies for each sample size both exactly for each ﬁnite horizon and asymptotically. 1</p><p>6 0.074477889 <a title="223-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Raphael Bailly, Xavier Carreras, Ariadna Quattoni</p><p>Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FST) are a standard tool for modeling paired inputoutput sequences and are used in numerous applications, ranging from computational biology to natural language processing. Recently Balle et al. [4] presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as ﬁnding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identiﬁability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efﬁciently. 1</p><p>4 0.50271618 <a title="223-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Generalized_Method-of-Moments_for_Rank_Aggregation.html">128 nips-2013-Generalized Method-of-Moments for Rank Aggregation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hossein Azari Soufiani, William Chen, David C. Parkes, Lirong Xia</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a class of efﬁcient Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for computing parameters of the Plackett-Luce model, where the data consists of full rankings over alternatives. Our technique is based on breaking the full rankings into pairwise comparisons, and then computing parameters that satisfy a set of generalized moment conditions. We identify conditions for the output of GMM to be unique, and identify a general class of consistent and inconsistent breakings. We then show by theory and experiments that our algorithms run signiﬁcantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while achieving competitive statistical efﬁciency. 1</p><p>5 0.4847759 <a title="223-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Noisy_Labels.html">171 nips-2013-Learning with Noisy Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>6 0.48369017 <a title="223-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Probabilistic_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion_with_Adaptive_Spectral_Regularization_Algorithms.html">254 nips-2013-Probabilistic Low-Rank Matrix Completion with Adaptive Spectral Regularization Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Mevissen, Emanuele Ragnoli, Jia Yuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust optimization for polynomial optimization problems where the uncertainty set is a set of candidate probability density functions. This set is a ball around a density function estimated from data samples, i.e., it is data-driven and random. Polynomial optimization problems are inherently hard due to nonconvex objectives and constraints. However, we show that by employing polynomial and histogram density estimates, we can introduce robustness with respect to distributional uncertainty sets without making the problem harder. We show that the optimum to the distributionally robust problem is the limit of a sequence of tractable semideﬁnite programming relaxations. We also give ﬁnite-sample consistency guarantees for the data-driven uncertainty sets. Finally, we apply our model and solution method in a water network optimization problem. 1</p><p>2 0.85168248 <a title="223-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_the_Harmonic_Structure_in_Graph-Based_Learning.html">35 nips-2013-Analyzing the Harmonic Structure in Graph-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Ming Wu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: We ﬁnd that various well-known graph-based models exhibit a common important harmonic structure in its target function – the value of a vertex is approximately the weighted average of the values of its adjacent neighbors. Understanding of such structure and analysis of the loss deﬁned over such structure help reveal important properties of the target function over a graph. In this paper, we show that the variation of the target function across a cut can be upper and lower bounded by the ratio of its harmonic loss and the cut cost. We use this to develop an analytical tool and analyze ﬁve popular graph-based models: absorbing random walks, partially absorbing random walks, hitting times, pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian, and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. Our analysis sheds new insights into several open questions related to these models, and provides theoretical justiﬁcations and guidelines for their practical use. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets conﬁrm the potential of the proposed theory and tool.</p><p>3 0.8155663 <a title="223-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Chordal_Markov_Networks_by_Constraint_Satisfaction.html">151 nips-2013-Learning Chordal Markov Networks by Constraint Satisfaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jukka Corander, Tomi Janhunen, Jussi Rintanen, Henrik Nyman, Johan Pensar</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning the structure of a Markov network from data. It is shown that the structure of such networks can be described in terms of constraints which enables the use of existing solver technology with optimization capabilities to compute optimal networks starting from initial scores computed from the data. To achieve efﬁcient encodings, we develop a novel characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on the separators between cliques forming the network. The resulting translations into propositional satisﬁability and its extensions such as maximum satisﬁability, satisﬁability modulo theories, and answer set programming, enable us to prove optimal certain networks which have been previously found by stochastic search. 1</p><p>4 0.81110793 <a title="223-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Inverse_Density_as_an_Inverse_Problem%3A_the_Fredholm_Equation_Approach.html">144 nips-2013-Inverse Density as an Inverse Problem: the Fredholm Equation Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Qichao Que, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: q We address the problem of estimating the ratio p where p is a density function and q is another density, or, more generally an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration often referred to as importance sampling in statistical inference. It is also closely related to the problem of covariate shift in transfer learning. Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating the ratio as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel, known as the Fredholm problem of the ﬁrst kind. This formulation, combined with the techniques of regularization leads to a principled framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them theoretically. The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator) is ﬂexible, simple and easy to implement. We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel for densities deﬁned on Rd and smooth d-dimensional sub-manifolds of the Euclidean space. Model selection for unsupervised or semi-supervised inference is generally a difﬁcult problem. It turns out that in the density ratio estimation setting, when samples from both distributions are available, simple completely unsupervised model selection methods are available. We call this mechanism CD-CV for Cross-Density Cross-Validation. We show encouraging experimental results including applications to classiﬁcation within the covariate shift framework. 1</p><p>5 0.74895048 <a title="223-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Symbolic_Opportunistic_Policy_Iteration_for_Factored-Action_MDPs.html">322 nips-2013-Symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration for Factored-Action MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aswin Raghavan, Roni Khardon, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. Our ﬁrst contribution is a symbolic implementation of Modiﬁed Policy Iteration (MPI) for factored actions that views policy evaluation as policy-constrained value iteration (VI). Unfortunately, a na¨ve approach ı to enforce policy constraints can lead to large memory requirements, sometimes making symbolic MPI worse than VI. We address this through our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent algorithm lying between VI and MPI, that applies policy constraints if it does not increase the size of the value function representation, and otherwise performs VI backups. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners. 1</p><p>6 0.73219287 <a title="223-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Neural_representation_of_action_sequences%3A_how_far_can_a_simple_snippet-matching_model_take_us%3F.html">208 nips-2013-Neural representation of action sequences: how far can a simple snippet-matching model take us?</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefanie Jegelka, Francis Bach, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it has become evident that submodularity naturally captures widely occurring concepts in machine learning, signal processing and computer vision. Consequently, there is need for efﬁcient optimization procedures for submodular functions, especially for minimization problems. While general submodular minimization is challenging, we propose a new method that exploits existing decomposability of submodular functions. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and parallelize. A key component of our method is a formulation of the discrete submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem that is solved through a sequence of reﬂections, and its solution can be easily thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. This method solves both the continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction. In our experiments, we illustrate the beneﬁts of our method on two image segmentation tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.19155243 <a title="207-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Curvature_and_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Learning_and_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions.html">78 nips-2013-Curvature and Optimal Algorithms for Learning and Minimizing Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Stefanie Jegelka, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three related and important problems connected to machine learning: approximating a submodular function everywhere, learning a submodular function (in a PAC-like setting [28]), and constrained minimization of submodular functions. We show that the complexity of all three problems depends on the “curvature” of the submodular function, and provide lower and upper bounds that reﬁne and improve previous results [2, 6, 8, 27]. Our proof techniques are fairly generic. We either use a black-box transformation of the function (for approximation and learning), or a transformation of algorithms to use an appropriate surrogate function (for minimization). Curiously, curvature has been known to inﬂuence approximations for submodular maximization [3, 29], but its effect on minimization, approximation and learning has hitherto been open. We complete this picture, and also support our theoretical claims by empirical results. 1</p><p>4 0.16578972 <a title="207-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Submodular_Optimization_with_Submodular_Cover_and_Submodular_Knapsack_Constraints.html">319 nips-2013-Submodular Optimization with Submodular Cover and Submodular Knapsack Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate two new optimization problems — minimizing a submodular function subject to a submodular lower bound constraint (submodular cover) and maximizing a submodular function subject to a submodular upper bound constraint (submodular knapsack). We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 25] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.13303368 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Deep_Learning.html">350 nips-2013-Wavelets on Graphs via Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Raif Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of applications require processing of signals deﬁned on weighted graphs. While wavelets provide a ﬂexible tool for signal processing in the classical setting of regular domains, the existing graph wavelet constructions are less ﬂexible – they are guided solely by the structure of the underlying graph and do not take directly into consideration the particular class of signals to be processed. This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. Our construction uses the lifting scheme, and is based on the observation that the recurrent nature of the lifting scheme gives rise to a structure resembling a deep auto-encoder network. Particular properties that the resulting wavelets must satisfy determine the training objective and the structure of the involved neural networks. The training is unsupervised, and is conducted similarly to the greedy pre-training of a stack of auto-encoders. After training is completed, we obtain a linear wavelet transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph. Improved sparsity of our wavelet transform for the test signals is conﬁrmed via experiments both on synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>6 0.12406864 <a title="207-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Submodular_Maximization%3A_Identifying_Representative_Elements_in_Massive_Data.html">97 nips-2013-Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Hein, Simon Setzer, Leonardo Jost, Syama Sundar Rangapuram</p><p>Abstract: Hypergraphs allow one to encode higher-order relationships in data and are thus a very ﬂexible modeling tool. Current learning methods are either based on approximations of the hypergraphs via graphs or on tensor methods which are only applicable under special conditions. In this paper, we present a new learning framework on hypergraphs which fully uses the hypergraph structure. The key element is a family of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs. 1</p><p>3 0.7333644 <a title="207-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Submodular_Maximization%3A_Identifying_Representative_Elements_in_Massive_Data.html">97 nips-2013-Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Amin Karbasi, Rik Sarkar, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Many large-scale machine learning problems (such as clustering, non-parametric learning, kernel machines, etc.) require selecting, out of a massive data set, a manageable yet representative subset. Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set function subject to cardinality constraints. Classical approaches require centralized access to the full data set; but for truly large-scale problems, rendering the data centrally is often impractical. In this paper, we consider the problem of submodular function maximization in a distributed fashion. We develop a simple, two-stage protocol G REE D I, that is easily implemented using MapReduce style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and show, that under certain natural conditions, performance close to the (impractical) centralized approach can be achieved. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, including sparse Gaussian process inference and exemplar-based clustering, on tens of millions of data points using Hadoop. 1</p><p>4 0.7201221 <a title="207-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Curvature_and_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Learning_and_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions.html">78 nips-2013-Curvature and Optimal Algorithms for Learning and Minimizing Submodular Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Toby Sharp, Pushmeet Kohli, Sebastian Nowozin, John Winn, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Randomized decision trees and forests have a rich history in machine learning and have seen considerable success in application, perhaps particularly so for computer vision. However, they face a fundamental limitation: given enough data, the number of nodes in decision trees will grow exponentially with depth. For certain applications, for example on mobile or embedded processors, memory is a limited resource, and so the exponential growth of trees limits their depth, and thus their potential accuracy. This paper proposes decision jungles, revisiting the idea of ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and shows these to be compact and powerful discriminative models for classiﬁcation. Unlike conventional decision trees that only allow one path to every node, a DAG in a decision jungle allows multiple paths from the root to each leaf. We present and compare two new node merging algorithms that jointly optimize both the features and the structure of the DAGs efﬁciently. During training, node splitting and node merging are driven by the minimization of exactly the same objective function, here the weighted sum of entropies at the leaves. Results on varied datasets show that, compared to decision forests and several other baselines, decision jungles require dramatically less memory while considerably improving generalization. 1</p><p>2 0.94745183 <a title="207-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>3 0.93606293 <a title="207-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_dropout_for_training_deep_neural_networks.html">30 nips-2013-Adaptive dropout for training deep neural networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Jimmy Ba, Brendan Frey</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it was shown that deep neural networks can perform very well if the activities of hidden units are regularized during learning, e.g, by randomly dropping out 50% of their activities. We describe a method called ‘standout’ in which a binary belief network is overlaid on a neural network and is used to regularize of its hidden units by selectively setting activities to zero. This ‘adaptive dropout network’ can be trained jointly with the neural network by approximately computing local expectations of binary dropout variables, computing derivatives using back-propagation, and using stochastic gradient descent. Interestingly, experiments show that the learnt dropout network parameters recapitulate the neural network parameters, suggesting that a good dropout network regularizes activities according to magnitude. When evaluated on the MNIST and NORB datasets, we found that our method achieves lower classiﬁcation error rates than other feature learning methods, including standard dropout, denoising auto-encoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines. For example, our method achieves 0.80% and 5.8% errors on the MNIST and NORB test sets, which is better than state-of-the-art results obtained using feature learning methods, including those that use convolutional architectures. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93418318 <a title="207-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>
<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>5 0.93065441 <a title="207-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Scoring_Workers_in_Crowdsourcing%3A_How_Many_Control_Questions_are_Enough%3F.html">290 nips-2013-Scoring Workers in Crowdsourcing: How Many Control Questions are Enough?</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alex Ihler, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices, probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach. A challenging aspect of combining the crowd’s answers is that workers’ reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse. Control items with known answers can be used to evaluate workers’ performance, and hence improve the combined results on the target items with unknown answers. This raises the problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa. We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. As a byproduct, we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods. 1</p><p>6 0.91411239 <a title="207-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>

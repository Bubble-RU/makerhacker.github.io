<p>Author: Prem Gopalan, Chong Wang, David Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach for accurate network modeling using node popularities within the framework of the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). Our model integrates two basic properties of nodes in social networks: homophily and preferential connection to popular nodes. We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference, based on a novel nonconjugate variant of stochastic variational inference. We evaluate the link prediction accuracy of our algorithm on nine real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes, and on simulated networks with degree distributions that follow a power law. We demonstrate that the AMP predicts signiﬁcantly better than the MMSB. 1</p><p>3 0.087733157 <a title="13-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-On_Sampling_from_the_Gibbs_Distribution_with_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Perturbations.html">218 nips-2013-On Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution with Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efﬁciently from Gibbs distributions. Speciﬁcally, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs’ distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical “high signal high coupling” regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds. 1</p><p>4 0.085627422 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Online_Inference_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Relational_Models.html">104 nips-2013-Efficient Online Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Relational Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Dae Il Kim, Prem Gopalan, David Blei, Erik Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic block models characterize observed network relationships via latent community memberships. In large social networks, we expect entities to participate in multiple communities, and the number of communities to grow with the network size. We introduce a new model for these phenomena, the hierarchical Dirichlet process relational model, which allows nodes to have mixed membership in an unbounded set of communities. To allow scalable learning, we derive an online stochastic variational inference algorithm. Focusing on assortative models of undirected networks, we also propose an efﬁcient structured mean ﬁeld variational bound, and online methods for automatically pruning unused communities. Compared to state-of-the-art online learning methods for parametric relational models, we show signiﬁcantly improved perplexity and link prediction accuracy for sparse networks with tens of thousands of nodes. We also showcase an analysis of LittleSis, a large network of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. 1</p><p>5 0.077030912 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Nonparametric_Multi-group_Membership_Model_for_Dynamic_Networks.html">213 nips-2013-Nonparametric Multi-group Membership Model for Dynamic Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, Thiago B. Costa, Stanley H. Chan</p><p>Abstract: Non-parametric approaches for analyzing network data based on exchangeable graph models (ExGM) have recently gained interest. The key object that deﬁnes an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon. This non-parametric perspective on network modeling poses challenging questions on how to make inference on the graphon underlying observed network data. In this paper, we propose a computationally efﬁcient procedure to estimate a graphon from a set of observed networks generated from it. This procedure is based on a stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) of the graphon. We show that, by approximating the graphon with a stochastic block model, the graphon can be consistently estimated, that is, the estimation error vanishes as the size of the graph approaches inﬁnity.</p><p>6 0.57262695 <a title="13-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Estimation_of_Latently-grouped_Parameters_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">46 nips-2013-Bayesian Estimation of Latently-grouped Parameters in Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Zimin, Gergely Neu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning in ﬁnite episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the loss function is allowed to change between episodes. The natural performance measure in this learning problem is the regret deﬁned as the difference between the total loss of the best stationary policy and the total loss suffered by the learner. We assume that the learner is given access to a ﬁnite action space A and the state space X has a layered structure with L layers, so that state transitions are only possible between consecutive layers. We describe a variant of the recently proposed Relative Entropy Policy Search algorithm and show that its regret after T episodes is 2 L|X ||A|T log(|X ||A|/L) in the bandit setting and 2L T log(|X ||A|/L) in the full information setting, given that the learner has perfect knowledge of the transition probabilities of the underlying MDP. These guarantees largely improve previously known results under much milder assumptions and cannot be signiﬁcantly improved under general assumptions. 1</p><p>3 0.46857208 <a title="13-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>4 0.46727961 <a title="13-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Tang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or neural networks are popular models used for nonlinear regression and classiﬁcation tasks. As regressors, MLPs model the conditional distribution of the predictor variables Y given the input variables X. However, this predictive distribution is assumed to be unimodal (e.g. Gaussian). For tasks involving structured prediction, the conditional distribution should be multi-modal, resulting in one-to-many mappings. By using stochastic hidden variables rather than deterministic ones, Sigmoid Belief Nets (SBNs) can induce a rich multimodal distribution in the output space. However, previously proposed learning algorithms for SBNs are not efﬁcient and unsuitable for modeling real-valued data. In this paper, we propose a stochastic feedforward network with hidden layers composed of both deterministic and stochastic variables. A new Generalized EM training procedure using importance sampling allows us to efﬁciently learn complicated conditional distributions. Our model achieves superior performance on synthetic and facial expressions datasets compared to conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Mixture Density Networks. In addition, the latent features of our model improves classiﬁcation and can learn to generate colorful textures of objects. 1</p><p>5 0.46519601 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-When_are_Overcomplete_Topic_Models_Identifiable%3F_Uniqueness_of_Tensor_Tucker_Decompositions_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">353 nips-2013-When are Overcomplete Topic Models Identifiable?

<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Daniel Hsu, Majid Janzamin, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for unsupervised feature learning in recent years. In this paper, we specify which overcomplete models can be identiﬁed given observable moments of a certain order. We consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While general overcomplete topic models are not identiﬁable, we establish generic identiﬁability under a constraint, referred to as topic persistence. Our sufﬁcient conditions for identiﬁability involve a novel set of “higher order” expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We establish that random structured topic models are identiﬁable w.h.p. in the overcomplete regime. Our identiﬁability results allow for general (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our identiﬁability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition. Keywords: Overcomplete representation, admixture models, generic identiﬁability, tensor decomposition.</p><p>6 0.46478376 <a title="13-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Additive_Text_Models_with_Low_Rank_Background.html">301 nips-2013-Sparse Additive Text Models with Low Rank Background</a></p>

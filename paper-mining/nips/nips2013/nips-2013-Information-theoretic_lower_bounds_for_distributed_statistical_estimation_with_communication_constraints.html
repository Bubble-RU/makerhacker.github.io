<p>Author: Nicolas Heess, Daniel Tarlow, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a popular approximate posterior inference algorithm that often provides a fast and accurate alternative to sampling-based methods. However, while the EP framework in theory allows for complex nonGaussian factors, there is still a signiﬁcant practical barrier to using them within EP, because doing so requires the implementation of message update operators, which can be difﬁcult and require hand-crafted approximations. In this work, we study the question of whether it is possible to automatically derive fast and accurate EP updates by learning a discriminative model (e.g., a neural network or random forest) to map EP message inputs to EP message outputs. We address the practical concerns that arise in the process, and we provide empirical analysis on several challenging and diverse factors, indicating that there is a space of factors where this approach appears promising. 1</p><p>3 0.16226874 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Local_Privacy_and_Minimax_Bounds%3A_Sharp_Rates_for_Probability_Estimation.html">177 nips-2013-Local Privacy and Minimax Bounds: Sharp Rates for Probability Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: John Duchi, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the estimation of probability distributions— discrete and continuous—in a stringent setting in which data is kept private even from the statistician. We give sharp minimax rates of convergence for estimation in these locally private settings, exhibiting fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate, as well as providing tools to allow movement along the privacy-statistical efﬁciency continuum. One of the consequences of our results is that Warner’s classical work on randomized response is an optimal way to perform survey sampling while maintaining privacy of the respondents. 1</p><p>4 0.13483723 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Statistical_Models.html">68 nips-2013-Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: Fitting high-dimensional statistical models often requires the use of non-linear parameter estimation procedures. As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify the uncertainty associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical signiﬁcance as conﬁdence intervals or p-values. We consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose an efﬁcient algorithm for constructing conﬁdence intervals and p-values. The resulting conﬁdence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power. Our approach is based on constructing a ‘de-biased’ version of regularized Mestimators. The new construction improves over recent work in the ﬁeld in that it does not assume a special structure on the design matrix. Furthermore, proofs are remarkably simple. We test our method on a diabetes prediction problem. 1</p><p>5 0.11912332 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Adaptive_Value_of_Information_for_Structured_Prediction.html">150 nips-2013-Learning Adaptive Value of Information for Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: David J. Weiss, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative methods for learning structured models have enabled wide-spread use of very rich feature representations. However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to ﬁnetune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control ﬁne-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting nonhomogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efﬁcient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input. We demonstrate signiﬁcant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is also faster, with similar results on an OCR task. 1</p><p>6 0.1153722 <a title="142-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Structured_Learning_via_Logistic_Regression.html">318 nips-2013-Structured Learning via Logistic Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Nils E. Napp, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on molecular programming has explored new possibilities for computational abstractions with biomolecules, including logic gates, neural networks, and linear systems. In the future such abstractions might enable nanoscale devices that can sense and control the world at a molecular scale. Just as in macroscale robotics, it is critical that such devices can learn about their environment and reason under uncertainty. At this small scale, systems are typically modeled as chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop a procedure that can take arbitrary probabilistic graphical models, represented as factor graphs over discrete random variables, and compile them into chemical reaction networks that implement inference. In particular, we show that marginalization based on sum-product message passing can be implemented in terms of reactions between chemical species whose concentrations represent probabilities. We show algebraically that the steady state concentration of these species correspond to the marginal distributions of the random variables in the graph and validate the results in simulations. As with standard sum-product inference, this procedure yields exact results for tree-structured graphs, and approximate solutions for loopy graphs.</p><p>4 0.62251985 <a title="142-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Structured_Learning_via_Logistic_Regression.html">318 nips-2013-Structured Learning via Logistic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Justin Domke</p><p>Abstract: A successful approach to structured learning is to write the learning objective as a joint function of linear parameters and inference messages, and iterate between updates to each. This paper observes that if the inference problem is “smoothed” through the addition of entropy terms, for ﬁxed messages, the learning objective reduces to a traditional (non-structured) logistic regression problem with respect to parameters. In these logistic regression problems, each training example has a bias term determined by the current set of messages. Based on this insight, the structured energy function can be extended from linear factors to any function class where an “oracle” exists to minimize a logistic loss.</p><p>5 0.59219229 <a title="142-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation_with_Calibration.html">302 nips-2013-Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation with Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method for estimating sparse precision matrix of high dimensional elliptical distribution. The proposed method calibrates regularizations when estimating each column of the precision matrix. Thus it not only is asymptotically tuning free, but also achieves an improved ﬁnite sample performance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method achieves the parametric rates of convergence in both parameter estimation and model selection. We present numerical results on both simulated and real datasets to support our theory and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator. 1</p><p>6 0.55443567 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_as_iterated_random_functions_with__applications_to_sequential_inference_in_graphical_models.html">52 nips-2013-Bayesian inference as iterated random functions with  applications to sequential inference in graphical models</a></p>

<p>Author: Suvrit Sra, Reshad Hosseini</p><p>Abstract: Hermitian positive deﬁnite (hpd) matrices recur throughout machine learning, statistics, and optimisation. This paper develops (conic) geometric optimisation on the cone of hpd matrices, which allows us to globally optimise a large class of nonconvex functions of hpd matrices. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use the Riemannian manifold structure of the hpd cone for studying functions that are nonconvex in the Euclidean sense but are geodesically convex (g-convex), hence globally optimisable. We then go beyond g-convexity, and exploit the conic geometry of hpd matrices to identify another class of functions that remain amenable to global optimisation without requiring g-convexity. We present key results that help recognise g-convexity and also the additional structure alluded to above. We illustrate our ideas by applying them to likelihood maximisation for a broad family of elliptically contoured distributions: for this maximisation, we derive novel, parameter free ﬁxed-point algorithms. To our knowledge, ours are the most general results on geometric optimisation of hpd matrices known so far. Experiments show that advantages of using our ﬁxed-point algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.95544428 <a title="142-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>

Often, the penalties are geometrically decomposable, i.e. can be expressed as a sum of support functions over convex sets. We generalize the notion of irrepresentable to geometrically decomposable penalties and develop a general framework for establishing consistency and model selection consistency of M-estimators with such penalties.

<p>Author: Eshcar Hillel, Zohar S. Karnin, Tomer Koren, Ronny Lempel, Oren Somekh</p><p>Abstract: We study exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits in a setting where k players collaborate in order to identify an ε-optimal arm. Our motivation comes from recent employment of bandit algorithms in computationally intensive, large-scale applications. Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the k players to com√ municate only once, they are able to learn k times faster than a single player. √ That is, distributing learning to k players gives rise to a factor k parallel speedup. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible. On the other extreme, we present an algorithm that achieves the ideal factor k speed-up in learning performance, with communication only logarithmic in 1/ε. 1</p><p>5 0.94291097 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Trading_Computation_for_Communication%3A_Distributed_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">333 nips-2013-Trading Computation for Communication: Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianbao Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present and study a distributed optimization algorithm by employing a stochastic dual coordinate ascent method. Stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods enjoy strong theoretical guarantees and often have better performances than stochastic gradient descent methods in optimizing regularized loss minimization problems. It still lacks of efforts in studying them in a distributed framework. We make a progress along the line by presenting a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm in a star network, with an analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication. We verify our analysis by experiments on real data sets. Moreover, we compare the proposed algorithm with distributed stochastic gradient descent methods and distributed alternating direction methods of multipliers for optimizing SVMs in the same distributed framework, and observe competitive performances. 1</p><p>6 0.93940771 <a title="142-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Submodular_Maximization%3A_Identifying_Representative_Elements_in_Massive_Data.html">97 nips-2013-Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></p>

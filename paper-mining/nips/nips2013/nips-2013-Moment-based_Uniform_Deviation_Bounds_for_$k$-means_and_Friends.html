<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Huan Xu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of Multiple Model Learning (MML) from data, from the statistical and algorithmic perspectives; this problem includes clustering, multiple regression and subspace clustering as special cases. A common approach to solving new MML problems is to generalize Lloyd’s algorithm for clustering (or Expectation-Maximization for soft clustering). However this approach is unfortunately sensitive to outliers and large noise: a single exceptional point may take over one of the models. We propose a different general formulation that seeks for each model a distribution over data points; the weights are regularized to be sufﬁciently spread out. This enhances robustness by making assumptions on class balance. We further provide generalization bounds and explain how the new iterations may be computed efﬁciently. We demonstrate the robustness beneﬁts of our approach with some experimental results and prove for the important case of clustering that our approach has a non-trivial breakdown point, i.e., is guaranteed to be robust to a ﬁxed percentage of adversarial unbounded outliers. 1</p><p>3 0.13747774 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_for_low_rank_spatiotemporal_neural_receptive_fields.html">53 nips-2013-Bayesian inference for low rank spatiotemporal neural receptive fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Mijung Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: The receptive ﬁeld (RF) of a sensory neuron describes how the neuron integrates sensory stimuli over time and space. In typical experiments with naturalistic or ﬂickering spatiotemporal stimuli, RFs are very high-dimensional, due to the large number of coefﬁcients needed to specify an integration proﬁle across time and space. Estimating these coefﬁcients from small amounts of data poses a variety of challenging statistical and computational problems. Here we address these challenges by developing Bayesian reduced rank regression methods for RF estimation. This corresponds to modeling the RF as a sum of space-time separable (i.e., rank-1) ﬁlters. This approach substantially reduces the number of parameters needed to specify the RF, from 1K-10K down to mere 100s in the examples we consider, and confers substantial beneﬁts in statistical power and computational efﬁciency. We introduce a novel prior over low-rank RFs using the restriction of a matrix normal prior to the manifold of low-rank matrices, and use “localized” row and column covariances to obtain sparse, smooth, localized estimates of the spatial and temporal RF components. We develop two methods for inference in the resulting hierarchical model: (1) a fully Bayesian method using blocked-Gibbs sampling; and (2) a fast, approximate method that employs alternating ascent of conditional marginal likelihoods. We develop these methods for Gaussian and Poisson noise models, and show that low-rank estimates substantially outperform full rank estimates using neural data from retina and V1. 1</p><p>4 0.12379379 <a title="197-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein_Inequality.html">242 nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein Inequality</a></p>

The inequality is based on a combination of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique with an Empirical Bernstein bound. We show that when the empirical variance is signiﬁcantly smaller than the empirical loss the PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is signiﬁcantly tighter than the PAC-Bayes-kl inequality of Seeger (2002) and otherwise it is comparable. Our theoretical analysis is conﬁrmed empirically on a synthetic example and several UCI datasets.

<p>Author: Subhaneil Lahiri, Surya Ganguli</p><p>Abstract: An incredible gulf separates theoretical models of synapses, often described solely by a single scalar value denoting the size of a postsynaptic potential, from the immense complexity of molecular signaling pathways underlying real synapses. To understand the functional contribution of such molecular complexity to learning and memory, it is essential to expand our theoretical conception of a synapse from a single scalar to an entire dynamical system with many internal molecular functional states. Moreover, theoretical considerations alone demand such an expansion; network models with scalar synapses assuming ﬁnite numbers of distinguishable synaptic strengths have strikingly limited memory capacity. This raises the fundamental question, how does synaptic complexity give rise to memory? To address this, we develop new mathematical theorems elucidating the relationship between the structural organization and memory properties of complex synapses that are themselves molecular networks. Moreover, in proving such theorems, we uncover a framework, based on ﬁrst passage time theory, to impose an order on the internal states of complex synaptic models, thereby simplifying the relationship between synaptic structure and function. 1</p><p>2 0.79465604 <a title="197-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_Spectral_Clustering_under_the_Degree-Corrected_Stochastic_Blockmodel.html">272 nips-2013-Regularized Spectral Clustering under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel</a></p>
<p>Author: Tai Qin, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fast and popular algorithm for ﬁnding clusters in networks. Recently, Chaudhuri et al. [1] and Amini et al. [2] proposed inspired variations on the algorithm that artiﬁcially inﬂate the node degrees for improved statistical performance. The current paper extends the previous statistical estimation results to the more canonical spectral clustering algorithm in a way that removes any assumption on the minimum degree and provides guidance on the choice of the tuning parameter. Moreover, our results show how the “star shape” in the eigenvectors–a common feature of empirical networks–can be explained by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel and the Extended Planted Partition model, two statistical models that allow for highly heterogeneous degrees. Throughout, the paper characterizes and justiﬁes several of the variations of the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of these models. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.7942723 <a title="197-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Moment-based_Uniform_Deviation_Bounds_for_%24k%24-means_and_Friends.html">197 nips-2013-Moment-based Uniform Deviation Bounds for $k$-means and Friends</a></p>

Lastly, a rate with reﬁned constants is provided for k-means instances possessing some cluster structure. 1</p><p>4 0.78711408 <a title="197-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Simultaneous_Rectification_and_Alignment_via_Robust_Recovery_of_Low-rank_Tensors.html">295 nips-2013-Simultaneous Rectification and Alignment via Robust Recovery of Low-rank Tensors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoqin Zhang, Di Wang, Zhengyuan Zhou, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a general method for recovering low-rank three-order tensors, in which the data can be deformed by some unknown transformation and corrupted by arbitrary sparse errors. Since the unfolding matrices of a tensor are interdependent, we introduce auxiliary variables and relax the hard equality constraints by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. To improve the computational efﬁciency, we introduce a proximal gradient step to the alternating direction minimization method. We have provided proof for the convergence of the linearized version of the problem which is the inner loop of the overall algorithm. Both simulations and experiments show that our methods are more efﬁcient and effective than previous work. The proposed method can be easily applied to simultaneously rectify and align multiple images or videos frames. In this context, the state-of-the-art algorithms “RASL” and “TILT” can be viewed as two special cases of our work, and yet each only performs part of the function of our method.</p><p>5 0.78134292 <a title="197-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multiclass_Total_Variation_Clustering.html">202 nips-2013-Multiclass Total Variation Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier Bresson, Thomas Laurent, David Uminsky, James von Brecht</p><p>Abstract: Ideas from the image processing literature have recently motivated a new set of clustering algorithms that rely on the concept of total variation. While these algorithms perform well for bi-partitioning tasks, their recursive extensions yield unimpressive results for multiclass clustering tasks. This paper presents a general framework for multiclass total variation clustering that does not rely on recursion. The results greatly outperform previous total variation algorithms and compare well with state-of-the-art NMF approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.76264215 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Multiscale_Dictionary_Learning_for_Estimating_Conditional_Distributions.html">204 nips-2013-Multiscale Dictionary Learning for Estimating Conditional Distributions</a></p>

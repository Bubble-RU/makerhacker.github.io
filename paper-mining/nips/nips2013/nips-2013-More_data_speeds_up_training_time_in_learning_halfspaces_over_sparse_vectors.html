<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the ﬁrst differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case. 1</p><p>3 0.098599166 <a title="199-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Complexity_and_Approximation_of_Binary_Evidence_in_Lifted_Inference.html">220 nips-2013-On the Complexity and Approximation of Binary Evidence in Lifted Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy van den Broeck, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: Lifted inference algorithms exploit symmetries in probabilistic models to speed up inference. They show impressive performance when calculating unconditional probabilities in relational models, but often resort to non-lifted inference when computing conditional probabilities. The reason is that conditioning on evidence breaks many of the model’s symmetries, which can preempt standard lifting techniques. Recent theoretical results show, for example, that conditioning on evidence which corresponds to binary relations is #P-hard, suggesting that no lifting is to be expected in the worst case. In this paper, we balance this negative result by identifying the Boolean rank of the evidence as a key parameter for characterizing the complexity of conditioning in lifted inference. In particular, we show that conditioning on binary evidence with bounded Boolean rank is efﬁcient. This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically. 1</p><p>4 0.081152678 <a title="199-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Submodular_Maximization_in_Bandit_Setting.html">29 nips-2013-Adaptive Submodular Maximization in Bandit Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Branislav Kveton, Zheng Wen, Brian Eriksson, S. Muthukrishnan</p><p>Abstract: Maximization of submodular functions has wide applications in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Adaptive submodular maximization has been traditionally studied under the assumption that the model of the world, the expected gain of choosing an item given previously selected items and their states, is known. In this paper, we study the setting where the expected gain is initially unknown, and it is learned by interacting repeatedly with the optimized function. We propose an efﬁcient algorithm for solving our problem and prove that its expected cumulative regret increases logarithmically with time. Our regret bound captures the inherent property of submodular maximization, earlier mistakes are more costly than later ones. We refer to our approach as Optimistic Adaptive Submodular Maximization (OASM) because it trades off exploration and exploitation based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle. We evaluate our method on a preference elicitation problem and show that non-trivial K-step policies can be learned from just a few hundred interactions with the problem. 1</p><p>5 0.079554096 <a title="199-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Scoring_Workers_in_Crowdsourcing%3A_How_Many_Control_Questions_are_Enough%3F.html">290 nips-2013-Scoring Workers in Crowdsourcing: How Many Control Questions are Enough?</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alex Ihler, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices, probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach. A challenging aspect of combining the crowd’s answers is that workers’ reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse. Control items with known answers can be used to evaluate workers’ performance, and hence improve the combined results on the target items with unknown answers. This raises the problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa. We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. As a byproduct, we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods. 1</p><p>6 0.07409963 <a title="199-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Statistical_Models.html">68 nips-2013-Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Statistical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: What if there is a teacher who knows the learning goal and wants to design good training data for a machine learner? We propose an optimal teaching framework aimed at learners who employ Bayesian models. Our framework is expressed as an optimization problem over teaching examples that balance the future loss of the learner and the effort of the teacher. This optimization problem is in general hard. In the case where the learner employs conjugate exponential family models, we present an approximate algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal teaching set. Our algorithm optimizes the aggregate sufﬁcient statistics, then unpacks them into actual teaching examples. We give several examples to illustrate our framework. 1</p><p>4 0.63328457 <a title="199-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Auditing%3A_Active_Learning_with_Outcome-Dependent_Query_Costs.html">42 nips-2013-Auditing: Active Learning with Outcome-Dependent Query Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivan Sabato, Anand D. Sarwate, Nati Srebro</p><p>Abstract: We propose a learning setting in which unlabeled data is free, and the cost of a label depends on its value, which is not known in advance. We study binary classiﬁcation in an extreme case, where the algorithm only pays for negative labels. Our motivation are applications such as fraud detection, in which investigating an honest transaction should be avoided if possible. We term the setting auditing, and consider the auditing complexity of an algorithm: the number of negative labels the algorithm requires in order to learn a hypothesis with low relative error. We design auditing algorithms for simple hypothesis classes (thresholds and rectangles), and show that with these algorithms, the auditing complexity can be signiﬁcantly lower than the active label complexity. We also show a general competitive approach for learning with outcome-dependent costs. 1</p><p>5 0.62600082 <a title="199-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Statistical_Active_Learning_Algorithms.html">309 nips-2013-Statistical Active Learning Algorithms</a></p>

This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem. 1</p><p>2 0.7906363 <a title="199-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-EDML_for_Learning_Parameters_in_Directed_and_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">101 nips-2013-EDML for Learning Parameters in Directed and Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Khaled Refaat, Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: EDML is a recently proposed algorithm for learning parameters in Bayesian networks. It was originally derived in terms of approximate inference on a metanetwork, which underlies the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation. While this initial derivation helped discover EDML in the ﬁrst place and provided a concrete context for identifying some of its properties (e.g., in contrast to EM), the formal setting was somewhat tedious in the number of concepts it drew on. In this paper, we propose a greatly simpliﬁed perspective on EDML, which casts it as a general approach to continuous optimization. The new perspective has several advantages. First, it makes immediate some results that were non-trivial to prove initially. Second, it facilitates the design of EDML algorithms for new graphical models, leading to a new algorithm for learning parameters in Markov networks. We derive this algorithm in this paper, and show, empirically, that it can sometimes learn estimates more efﬁciently from complete data, compared to commonly used optimization methods, such as conjugate gradient and L-BFGS. 1</p><p>3 0.73212683 <a title="199-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Action_from_Still_Image_Dataset_and_Inverse_Optimal_Control_to_Learn_Task_Specific_Visual_Scanpaths.html">21 nips-2013-Action from Still Image Dataset and Inverse Optimal Control to Learn Task Specific Visual Scanpaths</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Mathe, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human eye movements provide a rich source of information into the human visual information processing. The complex interplay between the task and the visual stimulus is believed to determine human eye movements, yet it is not fully understood, making it difﬁcult to develop reliable eye movement prediction systems. Our work makes three contributions towards addressing this problem. First, we complement one of the largest and most challenging static computer vision datasets, VOC 2012 Actions, with human eye movement recordings collected under the primary task constraint of action recognition, as well as, separately, for context recognition, in order to analyze the impact of different tasks. Our dataset is unique among the eyetracking datasets of still images in terms of large scale (over 1 million ﬁxations recorded in 9157 images) and different task controls. Second, we propose Markov models to automatically discover areas of interest (AOI) and introduce novel sequential consistency metrics based on them. Our methods can automatically determine the number, the spatial support and the transitions between AOIs, in addition to their locations. Based on such encodings, we quantitatively show that given unconstrained read-world stimuli, task instructions have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the human visual search patterns and are stable across subjects. Finally, we leverage powerful machine learning techniques and computer vision features in order to learn task-sensitive reward functions from eye movement data within models that allow to effectively predict the human visual search patterns based on inverse optimal control. The methodology achieves state of the art scanpath modeling results. 1</p><p>4 0.72605562 <a title="199-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish lower bounds on minimax risks for distributed statistical estimation under a communication budget. Such lower bounds reveal the minimum amount of communication required by any procedure to achieve the centralized minimax-optimal rates for statistical estimation. We study two classes of protocols: one in which machines send messages independently, and a second allowing for interactive communication. We establish lower bounds for several problems, including various types of location models, as well as for parameter estimation in regression models. 1</p><p>5 0.7254554 <a title="199-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Linear_Convergence_with_Condition_Number_Independent_Access_of_Full_Gradients.html">175 nips-2013-Linear Convergence with Condition Number Independent Access of Full Gradients</a></p>
<p>Author: Lijun Zhang, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: For smooth and strongly convex optimizations, the optimal iteration complexity of √ the gradient-based algorithm is O( κ log 1/ǫ), where κ is the condition number. In the case that the optimization problem is ill-conditioned, we need to evaluate a large number of full gradients, which could be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to remove the dependence on the condition number by allowing the algorithm to access stochastic gradients of the objective function. To this end, we present a novel algorithm named Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD) that is able to utilize two kinds of gradients. A distinctive step in EMGD is the mixed gradient descent, where we use a combination of the full and stochastic gradients to update the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis shows that EMGD is able to ﬁnd an ǫ-optimal solution by computing O(log 1/ǫ) full gradients and O(κ2 log 1/ǫ) stochastic gradients. 1</p><p>6 0.72212952 <a title="199-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Linear_Convergence_of_the_Proximal_Gradient_Method_for_Trace_Norm_Regularization.html">222 nips-2013-On the Linear Convergence of the Proximal Gradient Method for Trace Norm Regularization</a></p>

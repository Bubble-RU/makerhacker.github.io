<p>Author: Suvrit Sra, Reshad Hosseini</p><p>Abstract: Hermitian positive deﬁnite (hpd) matrices recur throughout machine learning, statistics, and optimisation. This paper develops (conic) geometric optimisation on the cone of hpd matrices, which allows us to globally optimise a large class of nonconvex functions of hpd matrices. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use the Riemannian manifold structure of the hpd cone for studying functions that are nonconvex in the Euclidean sense but are geodesically convex (g-convex), hence globally optimisable. We then go beyond g-convexity, and exploit the conic geometry of hpd matrices to identify another class of functions that remain amenable to global optimisation without requiring g-convexity. We present key results that help recognise g-convexity and also the additional structure alluded to above. We illustrate our ideas by applying them to likelihood maximisation for a broad family of elliptically contoured distributions: for this maximisation, we derive novel, parameter free ﬁxed-point algorithms. To our knowledge, ours are the most general results on geometric optimisation of hpd matrices known so far. Experiments show that advantages of using our ﬁxed-point algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.19302489 <a title="256-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Cluster_Trees_on_Manifolds.html">63 nips-2013-Cluster Trees on Manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Vincent Q. Vu, Juhee Cho, Jing Lei, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The convex problem can be solved efﬁciently using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings. We demonstrate this with an application to Kendall’s tau correlation matrices and transelliptical component analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.11340153 <a title="256-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Gradient_Riemannian_Langevin_Dynamics_on_the_Probability_Simplex.html">312 nips-2013-Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics on the Probability Simplex</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Rudi, Guillermo D. Canas, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: A large number of algorithms in machine learning, from principal component analysis (PCA), and its non-linear (kernel) extensions, to more recent spectral embedding and support estimation methods, rely on estimating a linear subspace from samples. In this paper we introduce a general formulation of this problem and derive novel learning error estimates. Our results rely on natural assumptions on the spectral properties of the covariance operator associated to the data distribution, and hold for a wide class of metrics between subspaces. As special cases, we discuss sharp error estimates for the reconstruction properties of PCA and spectral support estimation. Key to our analysis is an operator theoretic approach that has broad applicability to spectral learning methods. 1</p><p>5 0.45449778 <a title="256-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation_with_Calibration.html">302 nips-2013-Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation with Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method for estimating sparse precision matrix of high dimensional elliptical distribution. The proposed method calibrates regularizations when estimating each column of the precision matrix. Thus it not only is asymptotically tuning free, but also achieves an improved ﬁnite sample performance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method achieves the parametric rates of convergence in both parameter estimation and model selection. We present numerical results on both simulated and real datasets to support our theory and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator. 1</p><p>6 0.44748992 <a title="256-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Solving_inverse_problem_of_Markov_chain_with_partial_observations.html">299 nips-2013-Solving inverse problem of Markov chain with partial observations</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Rogers, Lei Li, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: Data in the sciences frequently occur as sequences of multidimensional arrays called tensors. How can hidden, evolving trends in such data be extracted while preserving the tensor structure? The model that is traditionally used is the linear dynamical system (LDS) with Gaussian noise, which treats the latent state and observation at each time slice as a vector. We present the multilinear dynamical system (MLDS) for modeling tensor time series and an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters. The MLDS models each tensor observation in the time series as the multilinear projection of the corresponding member of a sequence of latent tensors. The latent tensors are again evolving with respect to a multilinear projection. Compared to the LDS with an equal number of parameters, the MLDS achieves higher prediction accuracy and marginal likelihood for both artiﬁcial and real datasets. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71286666 <a title="256-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Probabilistic_Principal_Geodesic_Analysis.html">256 nips-2013-Probabilistic Principal Geodesic Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>4 0.62352848 <a title="256-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Contrastive_Learning_Using_Spectral_Methods.html">70 nips-2013-Contrastive Learning Using Spectral Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: James Y. Zou, Daniel Hsu, David C. Parkes, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: In many natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes speciﬁc to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components speciﬁc to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.61158812 <a title="256-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Predictive_PAC_Learning_and_Process_Decompositions.html">252 nips-2013-Predictive PAC Learning and Process Decompositions</a></p>
<p>Author: Cosma Shalizi, Aryeh Kontorovitch</p><p>Abstract: We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with ﬁnite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This deﬁnition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular (β-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest. 1</p><p>6 0.55873811 <a title="256-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-On_model_selection_consistency_of_penalized_M-estimators%3A_a_geometric_theory.html">219 nips-2013-On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></p>

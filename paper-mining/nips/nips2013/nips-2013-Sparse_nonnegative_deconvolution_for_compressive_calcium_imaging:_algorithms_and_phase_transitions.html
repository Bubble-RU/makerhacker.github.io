<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>3 0.34858769 <a title="304-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Real-Time_Inference_for_a_Gamma_Process_Model_of_Neural_Spiking.html">262 nips-2013-Real-Time Inference for a Gamma Process Model of Neural Spiking</a></p>
<p>Author: David Carlson, Vinayak Rao, Joshua T. Vogelstein, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: With simultaneous measurements from ever increasing populations of neurons, there is a growing need for sophisticated tools to recover signals from individual neurons. In electrophysiology experiments, this classically proceeds in a two-step process: (i) threshold the waveforms to detect putative spikes and (ii) cluster the waveforms into single units (neurons). We extend previous Bayesian nonparametric models of neural spiking to jointly detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model. Importantly, we develop an online approximate inference scheme enabling real-time analysis, with performance exceeding the previous state-of-theart. Via exploratory data analysis—using data with partial ground truth as well as two novel data sets—we ﬁnd several features of our model collectively contribute to our improved performance including: (i) accounting for colored noise, (ii) detecting overlapping spikes, (iii) tracking waveform dynamics, and (iv) using multiple channels. We hope to enable novel experiments simultaneously measuring many thousands of neurons and possibly adapting stimuli dynamically to probe ever deeper into the mysteries of the brain. 1</p><p>4 0.2992526 <a title="304-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Firing_rate_predictions_in_optimal_balanced_networks.html">121 nips-2013-Firing rate predictions in optimal balanced networks</a></p>
<p>Author: David G. Barrett, Sophie Denève, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How are ﬁring rates in a spiking network related to neural input, connectivity and network function? This is an important problem because ﬁring rates are a key measure of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difﬁcult problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculating ﬁring rates in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate ﬁring rates by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimising signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate ﬁring rates by ﬁnding the solution to the algorithm. Our ﬁring rate calculation relates network ﬁring rates directly to network input, connectivity and function. This allows us to explain the function and underlying mechanism of tuning curves in a variety of systems. 1</p><p>5 0.24705057 <a title="304-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>6 0.23800966 <a title="304-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_entropy_estimation_for_binary_spike_train_data_using_parametric_prior_knowledge.html">51 nips-2013-Bayesian entropy estimation for binary spike train data using parametric prior knowledge</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Albers, Maren Westkott, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: Recent extensions of the Perceptron as the Tempotron and the Chronotron suggest that this theoretical concept is highly relevant for understanding networks of spiking neurons in the brain. It is not known, however, how the computational power of the Perceptron might be accomplished by the plasticity mechanisms of real synapses. Here we prove that spike-timing-dependent plasticity having an anti-Hebbian form for excitatory synapses as well as a spike-timing-dependent plasticity of Hebbian shape for inhibitory synapses are sufﬁcient for realizing the original Perceptron Learning Rule if these respective plasticity mechanisms act in concert with the hyperpolarisation of the post-synaptic neurons. We also show that with these simple yet biologically realistic dynamics Tempotrons and Chronotrons are learned. The proposed mechanism enables incremental associative learning from a continuous stream of patterns and might therefore underly the acquisition of long term memories in cortex. Our results underline that learning processes in realistic networks of spiking neurons depend crucially on the interactions of synaptic plasticity mechanisms with the dynamics of participating neurons.</p><p>5 0.75773287 <a title="304-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Firing_rate_predictions_in_optimal_balanced_networks.html">121 nips-2013-Firing rate predictions in optimal balanced networks</a></p>

We provide tight approximations to the number of measurements needed for perfect deconvolution for certain classes of spiking processes, and show that this number undergoes a “phase transition,” which we characterize using modern tools relating conic geometry to compressed sensing. 1</p><p>2 0.8047629 <a title="304-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-The_Power_of_Asymmetry_in_Binary_Hashing.html">326 nips-2013-The Power of Asymmetry in Binary Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Behnam Neyshabur, Nati Srebro, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Yury Makarychev, Payman Yadollahpour</p><p>Abstract: When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance between short binary hashes, we show that even if the similarity is symmetric, we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two distinct code maps. I.e. by approximating the similarity between x and x as the hamming distance between f (x) and g(x ), for two distinct binary codes f, g, rather than as the hamming distance between f (x) and f (x ). 1</p><p>3 0.77655911 <a title="304-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Locally_Adaptive_Bayesian_Multivariate_Time_Series.html">178 nips-2013-Locally Adaptive Bayesian Multivariate Time Series</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniele Durante, Bruno Scarpa, David Dunson</p><p>Abstract: In modeling multivariate time series, it is important to allow time-varying smoothness in the mean and covariance process. In particular, there may be certain time intervals exhibiting rapid changes and others in which changes are slow. If such locally adaptive smoothness is not accounted for, one can obtain misleading inferences and predictions, with over-smoothing across erratic time intervals and under-smoothing across times exhibiting slow variation. This can lead to miscalibration of predictive intervals, which can be substantially too narrow or wide depending on the time. We propose a continuous multivariate stochastic process for time series having locally varying smoothness in both the mean and covariance matrix. This process is constructed utilizing latent dictionary functions in time, which are given nested Gaussian process priors and linearly related to the observed data through a sparse mapping. Using a differential equation representation, we bypass usual computational bottlenecks in obtaining MCMC and online algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference. The performance is assessed in simulations and illustrated in a ﬁnancial application. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.76901197 <a title="304-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Tang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or neural networks are popular models used for nonlinear regression and classiﬁcation tasks. As regressors, MLPs model the conditional distribution of the predictor variables Y given the input variables X. However, this predictive distribution is assumed to be unimodal (e.g. Gaussian). For tasks involving structured prediction, the conditional distribution should be multi-modal, resulting in one-to-many mappings. By using stochastic hidden variables rather than deterministic ones, Sigmoid Belief Nets (SBNs) can induce a rich multimodal distribution in the output space. However, previously proposed learning algorithms for SBNs are not efﬁcient and unsuitable for modeling real-valued data. In this paper, we propose a stochastic feedforward network with hidden layers composed of both deterministic and stochastic variables. A new Generalized EM training procedure using importance sampling allows us to efﬁciently learn complicated conditional distributions. Our model achieves superior performance on synthetic and facial expressions datasets compared to conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Mixture Density Networks. In addition, the latent features of our model improves classiﬁcation and can learn to generate colorful textures of objects. 1</p><p>5 0.76657832 <a title="304-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Compete_to_Compute.html">64 nips-2013-Compete to Compute</a></p>
<p>Author: Rupesh K. Srivastava, Jonathan Masci, Sohrob Kazerounian, Faustino Gomez, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Local competition among neighboring neurons is common in biological neural networks (NNs). In this paper, we apply the concept to gradient-based, backprop-trained artiﬁcial multilayer NNs. NNs with competing linear units tend to outperform those with non-competing nonlinear units, and avoid catastrophic forgetting when training sets change over time. 1</p><p>6 0.73073465 <a title="304-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Eluder_Dimension_and_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Optimistic_Exploration.html">106 nips-2013-Eluder Dimension and the Sample Complexity of Optimistic Exploration</a></p>

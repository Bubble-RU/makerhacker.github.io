<p>Author: Srikrishna Sridhar, Stephen Wright, Christopher Re, Ji Liu, Victor Bittorf, Ce Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in machine learning can be solved by rounding the solution of an appropriate linear program (LP). This paper shows that we can recover solutions of comparable quality by rounding an approximate LP solution instead of the exact one. These approximate LP solutions can be computed efﬁciently by applying a parallel stochastic-coordinate-descent method to a quadratic-penalty formulation of the LP. We derive worst-case runtime and solution quality guarantees of this scheme using novel perturbation and convergence analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that on such combinatorial problems as vertex cover, independent set and multiway-cut, our approximate rounding scheme is up to an order of magnitude faster than Cplex (a commercial LP solver) while producing solutions of similar quality. 1</p><p>3 0.11247617 <a title="8-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Understanding_Dropout.html">339 nips-2013-Understanding Dropout</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Baldi, Peter J. Sadowski</p><p>Abstract: Dropout is a relatively new algorithm for training neural networks which relies on stochastically “dropping out” neurons during training in order to avoid the co-adaptation of feature detectors. We introduce a general formalism for studying dropout on either units or connections, with arbitrary probability values, and use it to analyze the averaging and regularizing properties of dropout in both linear and non-linear networks. For deep neural networks, the averaging properties of dropout are characterized by three recursive equations, including the approximation of expectations by normalized weighted geometric means. We provide estimates and bounds for these approximations and corroborate the results with simulations. Among other results, we also show how dropout performs stochastic gradient descent on a regularized error function. 1</p><p>4 0.095456049 <a title="8-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Kiraly, Louis Theran</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>5 0.083430089 <a title="8-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_%24k%24-means_and_%24k%24-median_Clustering_on_General_Topologies.html">94 nips-2013-Distributed $k$-means and $k$-median Clustering on General Topologies</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Steven Ehrlich, Yingyu Liang</p><p>Abstract: This paper provides new algorithms for distributed clustering for two popular center-based objectives, k-median and k-means. These algorithms have provable guarantees and improve communication complexity over existing approaches. Following a classic approach in clustering by [13], we reduce the problem of ﬁnding a clustering with low cost to the problem of ﬁnding a coreset of small size. We provide a distributed method for constructing a global coreset which improves over the previous methods by reducing the communication complexity, and which works over general communication topologies. Experimental results on large scale data sets show that this approach outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.08098986 <a title="8-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_as_iterated_random_functions_with__applications_to_sequential_inference_in_graphical_models.html">52 nips-2013-Bayesian inference as iterated random functions with  applications to sequential inference in graphical models</a></p>

<p>Author: Bogdan Savchynskyy, Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Paul Swoboda, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: We consider energy minimization for undirected graphical models, also known as the MAP-inference problem for Markov random ﬁelds. Although combinatorial methods, which return a provably optimal integral solution of the problem, made a signiﬁcant progress in the past decade, they are still typically unable to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, large scale datasets are often deﬁned on sparse graphs and convex relaxation methods, such as linear programming relaxations then provide good approximations to integral solutions. We propose a novel method of combining combinatorial and convex programming techniques to obtain a global solution of the initial combinatorial problem. Based on the information obtained from the solution of the convex relaxation, our method conﬁnes application of the combinatorial solver to a small fraction of the initial graphical model, which allows to optimally solve much larger problems. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach on a computer vision energy minimization benchmark. 1</p><p>4 0.6112833 <a title="8-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Marginals-to-Models_Reducibility.html">184 nips-2013-Marginals-to-Models Reducibility</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim Roughgarden, Michael Kearns</p><p>Abstract: We consider a number of classical and new computational problems regarding marginal distributions, and inference in models specifying a full joint distribution. We prove general and efﬁcient reductions between a number of these problems, which demonstrate that algorithmic progress in inference automatically yields progress for “pure data” problems. Our main technique involves formulating the problems as linear programs, and proving that the dual separation oracle required by the ellipsoid method is provided by the target problem. This technique may be of independent interest in probabilistic inference. 1</p><p>5 0.54310268 <a title="8-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Density_estimation_from_unweighted_k-nearest_neighbor_graphs%3A_a_roadmap.html">87 nips-2013-Density estimation from unweighted k-nearest neighbor graphs: a roadmap</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike Von Luxburg, Morteza Alamgir</p><p>Abstract: Consider an unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph on n points that have been sampled i.i.d. from some unknown density p on Rd . We prove how one can estimate the density p just from the unweighted adjacency matrix of the graph, without knowing the points themselves or any distance or similarity scores. The key insights are that local differences in link numbers can be used to estimate a local function of the gradient of p, and that integrating this function along shortest paths leads to an estimate of the underlying density. 1</p><p>6 0.54154128 <a title="8-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>

<p>Author: Guang-Tong Zhou, Tian Lan, Arash Vahdat, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We present a maximum margin framework that clusters data using latent variables. Using latent representations enables our framework to model unobserved information embedded in the data. We implement our idea by large margin learning, and develop an alternating descent algorithm to effectively solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. We instantiate our latent maximum margin clustering framework with tag-based video clustering tasks, where each video is represented by a latent tag model describing the presence or absence of video tags. Experimental results obtained on three standard datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-latent maximum margin clustering as well as conventional clustering approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.64020622 <a title="8-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Submodular_Optimization_with_Submodular_Cover_and_Submodular_Knapsack_Constraints.html">319 nips-2013-Submodular Optimization with Submodular Cover and Submodular Knapsack Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Rishabh K. Iyer, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate two new optimization problems — minimizing a submodular function subject to a submodular lower bound constraint (submodular cover) and maximizing a submodular function subject to a submodular upper bound constraint (submodular knapsack). We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 25] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.62384224 <a title="8-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Context-sensitive_active_sensing_in_humans.html">69 nips-2013-Context-sensitive active sensing in humans</a></p>
<p>Author: Sheeraz Ahmad, He Huang, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Humans and animals readily utilize active sensing, or the use of self-motion, to focus sensory and cognitive resources on the behaviorally most relevant stimuli and events in the environment. Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artiﬁcial systems. Recently, we proposed a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, C-DAC (ContextDependent Active Controller) (Ahmad & Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We ﬁnd that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better ﬁt to human data than Infomax (Butko & Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving signiﬁcant computational savings. 1</p><p>5 0.58686763 <a title="8-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Third-Order_Edge_Statistics%3A_Contour_Continuation%2C_Curvature%2C_and_Cortical_Connections.html">329 nips-2013-Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Lawlor, Steven W. Zucker</p><p>Abstract: Association ﬁeld models have attempted to explain human contour grouping performance, and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections across cortical columns in V1. However, association ﬁelds only depend on the pairwise statistics of edges in natural scenes. We develop a spectral test of the sufﬁciency of pairwise statistics and show there is signiﬁcant higher order structure. An analysis using a probabilistic spectral embedding reveals curvature-dependent components. 1</p><p>6 0.52314335 <a title="8-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Noisy_Labels.html">171 nips-2013-Learning with Noisy Labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Boqing Gong, Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha</p><p>Abstract: In visual recognition problems, the common data distribution mismatches between training and testing make domain adaptation essential. However, image data is difﬁcult to manually divide into the discrete domains required by adaptation algorithms, and the standard practice of equating datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways (lighting, pose, background, resolution, etc.) We propose an approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets. Our formulation imposes two key properties on domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. By maximum distinctiveness, we require the underlying distributions of the identiﬁed domains to be different from each other to the maximum extent; by maximum learnability, we ensure that a strong discriminative model can be learned from the domain. We devise a nonparametric formulation and efﬁcient optimization procedure that can successfully discover domains among both training and test data. We extensively evaluate our approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.15742417 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: I present a new online learning algorithm that extends the exponentiated gradient framework to inﬁnite dimensional spaces. My analysis shows that the algorithm is implicitly able to estimate the L2 norm of the unknown competitor, U , achieving √ a regret bound of the order of O(U log(U T + 1)) T ), instead of the standard √ O((U 2 + 1) T ), achievable without knowing U . For this analysis, I introduce novel tools for algorithms with time-varying regularizers, through the use of local smoothness. Through a lower bound, I also show that the algorithm is optimal up to log(U T ) term for linear and Lipschitz losses. 1</p><p>4 0.15358819 <a title="211-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimization%2C_Learning%2C_and_Games_with_Predictable_Sequences.html">240 nips-2013-Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Sasha Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We provide several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm based on the idea of predictable sequences. First, we recover the Mirror Prox algorithm for ofﬂine optimization, prove an extension to H¨ lder-smooth o functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a ﬁnite zero-sum matrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate of O((log T )￿T ). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al [6]. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximate Max Flow problem. 1</p><p>5 0.13405225 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>6 0.13336794 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Reservoir_Boosting_%3A_Between_Online_and_Offline_Ensemble_Learning.html">275 nips-2013-Reservoir Boosting : Between Online and Offline Ensemble Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shaodan Zhai, Tian Xia, Ming Tan, Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a boosting method, DirectBoost, a greedy coordinate descent algorithm that builds an ensemble classiﬁer of weak classiﬁers through directly minimizing empirical classiﬁcation error over labeled training examples; once the training classiﬁcation error is reduced to a local coordinatewise minimum, DirectBoost runs a greedy coordinate ascent algorithm that continuously adds weak classiﬁers to maximize any targeted arbitrarily deﬁned margins until reaching a local coordinatewise maximum of the margins in a certain sense. Experimental results on a collection of machine-learning benchmark datasets show that DirectBoost gives better results than AdaBoost, LogitBoost, LPBoost with column generation and BrownBoost, and is noise tolerant when it maximizes an n′ th order bottom sample margin. 1</p><p>4 0.66669679 <a title="211-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Reservoir_Boosting_%3A_Between_Online_and_Offline_Ensemble_Learning.html">275 nips-2013-Reservoir Boosting : Between Online and Offline Ensemble Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, François Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: We propose to train an ensemble with the help of a reservoir in which the learning algorithm can store a limited number of samples. This novel approach lies in the area between ofﬂine and online ensemble approaches and can be seen either as a restriction of the former or an enhancement of the latter. We identify some basic strategies that can be used to populate this reservoir and present our main contribution, dubbed Greedy Edge Expectation Maximization (GEEM), that maintains the reservoir content in the case of Boosting by viewing the samples through their projections into the weak classiﬁer response space. We propose an efﬁcient algorithmic implementation which makes it tractable in practice, and demonstrate its efﬁciency experimentally on several compute-vision data-sets, on which it outperforms both online and ofﬂine methods in a memory constrained setting. 1</p><p>5 0.64169091 <a title="211-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Parametric_Task_Learning.html">244 nips-2013-Parametric Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ichiro Takeuchi, Tatsuya Hongo, Masashi Sugiyama, Shinichi Nakajima</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an extended formulation of multi-task learning (MTL) called parametric task learning (PTL) that can systematically handle inﬁnitely many tasks parameterized by a continuous parameter. Our key ﬁnding is that, for a certain class of PTL problems, the path of the optimal task-wise solutions can be represented as piecewise-linear functions of the continuous task parameter. Based on this fact, we employ a parametric programming technique to obtain the common shared representation across all the continuously parameterized tasks. We show that our PTL formulation is useful in various scenarios such as learning under non-stationarity, cost-sensitive learning, and quantile regression. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach in these scenarios.</p><p>6 0.63454151 <a title="211-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Transportability_from_Multiple_Environments_with_Limited_Experiments.html">337 nips-2013-Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments</a></p>

<p>Author: Cristina Savin, Peter Dayan, Mate Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: It has long been recognised that statistical dependencies in neuronal activity need to be taken into account when decoding stimuli encoded in a neural population. Less studied, though equally pernicious, is the need to take account of dependencies between synaptic weights when decoding patterns previously encoded in an auto-associative memory. We show that activity-dependent learning generically produces such correlations, and failing to take them into account in the dynamics of memory retrieval leads to catastrophically poor recall. We derive optimal network dynamics for recall in the face of synaptic correlations caused by a range of synaptic plasticity rules. These dynamics involve well-studied circuit motifs, such as forms of feedback inhibition and experimentally observed dendritic nonlinearities. We therefore show how addressing the problem of synaptic correlations leads to a novel functional account of key biophysical features of the neural substrate. 1</p><p>3 0.75402588 <a title="211-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Reflection_methods_for_user-friendly_submodular_optimization.html">268 nips-2013-Reflection methods for user-friendly submodular optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefanie Jegelka, Francis Bach, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it has become evident that submodularity naturally captures widely occurring concepts in machine learning, signal processing and computer vision. Consequently, there is need for efﬁcient optimization procedures for submodular functions, especially for minimization problems. While general submodular minimization is challenging, we propose a new method that exploits existing decomposability of submodular functions. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and parallelize. A key component of our method is a formulation of the discrete submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem that is solved through a sequence of reﬂections, and its solution can be easily thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. This method solves both the continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction. In our experiments, we illustrate the beneﬁts of our method on two image segmentation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.72143108 <a title="211-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Compressive_Feature_Learning.html">65 nips-2013-Compressive Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hristo S. Paskov, Robert West, John C. Mitchell, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised feature learning for text data. Our method is grounded in the principle of minimum description length and uses a dictionary-based compression scheme to extract a succinct feature set. Specifically, our method ﬁnds a set of word k-grams that minimizes the cost of reconstructing the text losslessly. We formulate document compression as a binary optimization task and show how to solve it approximately via a sequence of reweighted linear programs that are efﬁcient to solve and parallelizable. As our method is unsupervised, features may be extracted once and subsequently used in a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the performance of these features over a range of scenarios including unsupervised exploratory analysis and supervised text categorization. Our compressed feature space is two orders of magnitude smaller than the full k-gram space and matches the text categorization accuracy achieved in the full feature space. This dimensionality reduction not only results in faster training times, but it can also help elucidate structure in unsupervised learning tasks and reduce the amount of training data necessary for supervised learning. 1</p><p>5 0.71682644 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Reshaping_Visual_Datasets_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">276 nips-2013-Reshaping Visual Datasets for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Boqing Gong, Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha</p><p>Abstract: In visual recognition problems, the common data distribution mismatches between training and testing make domain adaptation essential. However, image data is difﬁcult to manually divide into the discrete domains required by adaptation algorithms, and the standard practice of equating datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways (lighting, pose, background, resolution, etc.) We propose an approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets. Our formulation imposes two key properties on domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. By maximum distinctiveness, we require the underlying distributions of the identiﬁed domains to be different from each other to the maximum extent; by maximum learnability, we ensure that a strong discriminative model can be learned from the domain. We devise a nonparametric formulation and efﬁcient optimization procedure that can successfully discover domains among both training and test data. We extensively evaluate our approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.71496648 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>

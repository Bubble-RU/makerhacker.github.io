<p>Author: Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the level of complexity higher than typical “visual words”, but lower than full-blown semantic objects. Several approaches [5, 6, 12, 23] have been proposed to discover mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difﬁcult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data. We also propose the Purity-Coverage plot as a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual discovery approaches, and compare our method against prior work on the Paris Street View dataset of [5]. We also evaluate our method on the task of scene classiﬁcation, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset. 1</p><p>3 0.2704958 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>5 0.19158719 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>6 0.17610586 <a title="5-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-What_Are_the_Invariant_Occlusive_Components_of_Image_Patches%3F_A_Probabilistic_Generative_Approach.html">351 nips-2013-What Are the Invariant Occlusive Components of Image Patches?

A Probabilistic Generative Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenwen Dai, Georgios Exarchakis, Jörg Lücke</p><p>Abstract: We study optimal image encoding based on a generative approach with non-linear feature combinations and explicit position encoding. By far most approaches to unsupervised learning of visual features, such as sparse coding or ICA, account for translations by representing the same features at different positions. Some earlier models used a separate encoding of features and their positions to facilitate invariant data encoding and recognition. All probabilistic generative models with explicit position encoding have so far assumed a linear superposition of components to encode image patches. Here, we for the ﬁrst time apply a model with non-linear feature superposition and explicit position encoding for patches. By avoiding linear superpositions, the studied model represents a closer match to component occlusions which are ubiquitous in natural images. In order to account for occlusions, the non-linear model encodes patches qualitatively very different from linear models by using component representations separated into mask and feature parameters. We ﬁrst investigated encodings learned by the model using artiﬁcial data with mutually occluding components. We ﬁnd that the model extracts the components, and that it can correctly identify the occlusive components with the hidden variables of the model. On natural image patches, the model learns component masks and features for typical image components. By using reverse correlation, we estimate the receptive ﬁelds associated with the model’s hidden units. We ﬁnd many Gabor-like or globular receptive ﬁelds as well as ﬁelds sensitive to more complex structures. Our results show that probabilistic models that capture occlusions and invariances can be trained efﬁciently on image patches, and that the resulting encoding represents an alternative model for the neural encoding of images in the primary visual cortex. 1</p><p>4 0.67856079 <a title="5-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification.html">83 nips-2013-Deep Fisher Networks for Large-Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: As massively parallel computations have become broadly available with modern GPUs, deep architectures trained on very large datasets have risen in popularity. Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classiﬁcation benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper, we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the stateof-the-art Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture signiﬁcantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted image classiﬁcation pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination further improves the accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.66725481 <a title="5-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Toby Sharp, Pushmeet Kohli, Sebastian Nowozin, John Winn, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Randomized decision trees and forests have a rich history in machine learning and have seen considerable success in application, perhaps particularly so for computer vision. However, they face a fundamental limitation: given enough data, the number of nodes in decision trees will grow exponentially with depth. For certain applications, for example on mobile or embedded processors, memory is a limited resource, and so the exponential growth of trees limits their depth, and thus their potential accuracy. This paper proposes decision jungles, revisiting the idea of ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and shows these to be compact and powerful discriminative models for classiﬁcation. Unlike conventional decision trees that only allow one path to every node, a DAG in a decision jungle allows multiple paths from the root to each leaf. We present and compare two new node merging algorithms that jointly optimize both the features and the structure of the DAGs efﬁciently. During training, node splitting and node merging are driven by the minimization of exactly the same objective function, here the weighted sum of entropies at the leaves. Results on varied datasets show that, compared to decision forests and several other baselines, decision jungles require dramatically less memory while considerably improving generalization. 1</p><p>2 0.94123715 <a title="5-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>3 0.93706787 <a title="5-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_dropout_for_training_deep_neural_networks.html">30 nips-2013-Adaptive dropout for training deep neural networks</a></p>

We describe a method called ‘standout’ in which a binary belief network is overlaid on a neural network and is used to regularize of its hidden units by selectively setting activities to zero. This ‘adaptive dropout network’ can be trained jointly with the neural network by approximately computing local expectations of binary dropout variables, computing derivatives using back-propagation, and using stochastic gradient descent. Interestingly, experiments show that the learnt dropout network parameters recapitulate the neural network parameters, suggesting that a good dropout network regularizes activities according to magnitude. When evaluated on the MNIST and NORB datasets, we found that our method achieves lower classiﬁcation error rates than other feature learning methods, including standard dropout, denoising auto-encoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines. For example, our method achieves 0.80% and 5.8% errors on the MNIST and NORB test sets, which is better than state-of-the-art results obtained using feature learning methods, including those that use convolutional architectures. 1</p><p>4 0.92265749 <a title="5-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Scoring_Workers_in_Crowdsourcing%3A_How_Many_Control_Questions_are_Enough%3F.html">290 nips-2013-Scoring Workers in Crowdsourcing: How Many Control Questions are Enough?</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alex Ihler, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices, probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach. A challenging aspect of combining the crowd’s answers is that workers’ reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse. Control items with known answers can be used to evaluate workers’ performance, and hence improve the combined results on the target items with unknown answers. This raises the problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa. We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. As a byproduct, we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods. 1</p><p>5 0.91996473 <a title="5-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>
<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.91264635 <a title="5-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>

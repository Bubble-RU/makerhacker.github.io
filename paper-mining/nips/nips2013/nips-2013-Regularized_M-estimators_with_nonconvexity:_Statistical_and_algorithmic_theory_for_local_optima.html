<p>Author: Ilya O. Tolstikhin, Yevgeny Seldin</p><p>Abstract: We present a PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality. The inequality is based on a combination of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique with an Empirical Bernstein bound. We show that when the empirical variance is signiﬁcantly smaller than the empirical loss the PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is signiﬁcantly tighter than the PAC-Bayes-kl inequality of Seeger (2002) and otherwise it is comparable. Our theoretical analysis is conﬁrmed empirically on a synthetic example and several UCI datasets. The PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is an interesting example of an application of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique to self-bounding functions. 1</p><p>3 0.16765939 <a title="271-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_Spectral_Clustering_under_the_Degree-Corrected_Stochastic_Blockmodel.html">272 nips-2013-Regularized Spectral Clustering under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel</a></p>
<p>Author: Tai Qin, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fast and popular algorithm for ﬁnding clusters in networks. Recently, Chaudhuri et al. [1] and Amini et al. [2] proposed inspired variations on the algorithm that artiﬁcially inﬂate the node degrees for improved statistical performance. The current paper extends the previous statistical estimation results to the more canonical spectral clustering algorithm in a way that removes any assumption on the minimum degree and provides guidance on the choice of the tuning parameter. Moreover, our results show how the “star shape” in the eigenvectors–a common feature of empirical networks–can be explained by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel and the Extended Planted Partition model, two statistical models that allow for highly heterogeneous degrees. Throughout, the paper characterizes and justiﬁes several of the variations of the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of these models. 1</p><p>4 0.16220529 <a title="271-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Statistical_Models.html">68 nips-2013-Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: Fitting high-dimensional statistical models often requires the use of non-linear parameter estimation procedures. As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify the uncertainty associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical signiﬁcance as conﬁdence intervals or p-values. We consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose an efﬁcient algorithm for constructing conﬁdence intervals and p-values. The resulting conﬁdence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power. Our approach is based on constructing a ‘de-biased’ version of regularized Mestimators. The new construction improves over recent work in the ﬁeld in that it does not assume a special structure on the design matrix. Furthermore, proofs are remarkably simple. We test our method on a diabetes prediction problem. 1</p><p>5 0.16155128 <a title="271-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-On_model_selection_consistency_of_penalized_M-estimators%3A_a_geometric_theory.html">219 nips-2013-On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Jonathan E. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: Penalized M-estimators are used in diverse areas of science and engineering to ﬁt high-dimensional models with some low-dimensional structure. Often, the penalties are geometrically decomposable, i.e. can be expressed as a sum of support functions over convex sets. We generalize the notion of irrepresentable to geometrically decomposable penalties and develop a general framework for establishing consistency and model selection consistency of M-estimators with such penalties. We then use this framework to derive results for some special cases of interest in bioinformatics and statistical learning. 1</p><p>6 0.15273628 <a title="271-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Dirty_Statistical_Models.html">91 nips-2013-Dirty Statistical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Bartz, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Analytic shrinkage is a statistical technique that offers a fast alternative to crossvalidation for the regularization of covariance matrices and has appealing consistency properties. We show that the proof of consistency requires bounds on the growth rates of eigenvalues and their dispersion, which are often violated in data. We prove consistency under assumptions which do not restrict the covariance structure and therefore better match real world data. In addition, we propose an extension of analytic shrinkage –orthogonal complement shrinkage– which adapts to the covariance structure. Finally we demonstrate the superior performance of our novel approach on data from the domains of ﬁnance, spoken letter and optical character recognition, and neuroscience. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.89966065 <a title="271-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>

<p>Author: Shahin Shahrampour, Sasha Rakhlin, Ali Jadbabaie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online learning in a dynamic setting. We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a ﬁnite time. 1</p><p>4 0.87794977 <a title="271-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Efficient_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Predictors_with_Non-Decomposable_Loss_Functions.html">152 nips-2013-Learning Efficient Random Maximum A-Posteriori Predictors with Non-Decomposable Loss Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Joseph Keshet, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this work we develop efﬁcient methods for learning random MAP predictors for structured label problems. In particular, we construct posterior distributions over perturbations that can be adjusted via stochastic gradient methods. We show that any smooth posterior distribution would sufﬁce to deﬁne a smooth PAC-Bayesian risk bound suitable for gradient methods. In addition, we relate the posterior distributions to computational properties of the MAP predictors. We suggest multiplicative posteriors to learn super-modular potential functions that accompany specialized MAP predictors such as graph-cuts. We also describe label-augmented posterior models that can use efﬁcient MAP approximations, such as those arising from linear program relaxations. 1</p><p>5 0.87594658 <a title="271-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Additive_Text_Models_with_Low_Rank_Background.html">301 nips-2013-Sparse Additive Text Models with Low Rank Background</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>6 0.85837996 <a title="271-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Theory_for_High-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixtures_with_Sparse_Mean_Separation.html">192 nips-2013-Minimax Theory for High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with Sparse Mean Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Sprechmann, Joshua Vogelstein, Pablo Muse, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching is a challenging problem with very important applications in a wide range of ﬁelds, from image and video analysis to biological and biomedical problems. We propose a robust graph matching algorithm inspired in sparsityrelated techniques. We cast the problem, resembling group or collaborative sparsity formulations, as a non-smooth convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved using augmented Lagrangian techniques. The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs. We also present results on multimodal graphs and applications to collaborative inference of brain connectivity from alignment-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The code is publicly available. 1</p><p>3 0.13993819 <a title="291-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Chordal_Markov_Networks_by_Constraint_Satisfaction.html">151 nips-2013-Learning Chordal Markov Networks by Constraint Satisfaction</a></p>

<p>Author: Bogdan Savchynskyy, Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Paul Swoboda, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: We consider energy minimization for undirected graphical models, also known as the MAP-inference problem for Markov random ﬁelds. Although combinatorial methods, which return a provably optimal integral solution of the problem, made a signiﬁcant progress in the past decade, they are still typically unable to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, large scale datasets are often deﬁned on sparse graphs and convex relaxation methods, such as linear programming relaxations then provide good approximations to integral solutions. We propose a novel method of combining combinatorial and convex programming techniques to obtain a global solution of the initial combinatorial problem. Based on the information obtained from the solution of the convex relaxation, our method conﬁnes application of the combinatorial solver to a small fraction of the initial graphical model, which allows to optimally solve much larger problems. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach on a computer vision energy minimization benchmark. 1</p><p>5 0.1230178 <a title="291-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_to_Pass_Expectation_Propagation_Messages.html">168 nips-2013-Learning to Pass Expectation Propagation Messages</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Heess, Daniel Tarlow, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a popular approximate posterior inference algorithm that often provides a fast and accurate alternative to sampling-based methods. However, while the EP framework in theory allows for complex nonGaussian factors, there is still a signiﬁcant practical barrier to using them within EP, because doing so requires the implementation of message update operators, which can be difﬁcult and require hand-crafted approximations. In this work, we study the question of whether it is possible to automatically derive fast and accurate EP updates by learning a discriminative model (e.g., a neural network or random forest) to map EP message inputs to EP message outputs. We address the practical concerns that arise in the process, and we provide empirical analysis on several challenging and diverse factors, indicating that there is a space of factors where this approach appears promising. 1</p><p>6 0.11590452 <a title="291-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_kernels_for_graphs_with_continuous_attributes.html">289 nips-2013-Scalable kernels for graphs with continuous attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ying Liu, Alan Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) or Gauss Markov random ﬁelds are widely used in many applications, and the trade-off between the modeling capacity and the efﬁciency of learning and inference has been an important research problem. In this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex sets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all the cycles. Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the partition function has complexity O(k 2 n) using message-passing algorithms, where k is the size of the FVS, and n is the total number of nodes. We propose efﬁcient structure learning algorithms for two cases: 1) All nodes are observed, which is useful in modeling social or ﬂight networks where the FVS nodes often correspond to a small number of highly inﬂuential nodes, or hubs, while the rest of the networks is modeled by a tree. Regardless of the maximum degree, without knowing the full graph structure, we can exactly compute the maximum likelihood estimate with complexity O(kn2 + n2 log n) if the FVS is known or in polynomial time if the FVS is unknown but has bounded size. 2) The FVS nodes are latent variables, where structure learning is equivalent to decomposing an inverse covariance matrix (exactly or approximately) into the sum of a tree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. By incorporating efﬁcient inference into the learning steps, we can obtain a learning algorithm using alternating low-rank corrections with complexity O(kn2 + n2 log n) per iteration. We perform experiments using both synthetic data as well as real data of ﬂight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of various sizes. 1</p><p>4 0.7168895 <a title="291-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Message_Passing_Inference_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks.html">189 nips-2013-Message Passing Inference with Chemical Reaction Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nils E. Napp, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on molecular programming has explored new possibilities for computational abstractions with biomolecules, including logic gates, neural networks, and linear systems. In the future such abstractions might enable nanoscale devices that can sense and control the world at a molecular scale. Just as in macroscale robotics, it is critical that such devices can learn about their environment and reason under uncertainty. At this small scale, systems are typically modeled as chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop a procedure that can take arbitrary probabilistic graphical models, represented as factor graphs over discrete random variables, and compile them into chemical reaction networks that implement inference. In particular, we show that marginalization based on sum-product message passing can be implemented in terms of reactions between chemical species whose concentrations represent probabilities. We show algebraically that the steady state concentration of these species correspond to the marginal distributions of the random variables in the graph and validate the results in simulations. As with standard sum-product inference, this procedure yields exact results for tree-structured graphs, and approximate solutions for loopy graphs.</p><p>5 0.68891466 <a title="291-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Global_MAP-Optimality_by_Shrinking_the_Combinatorial_Search_Area_with_Convex_Relaxation.html">132 nips-2013-Global MAP-Optimality by Shrinking the Combinatorial Search Area with Convex Relaxation</a></p>

<p>Author: José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, James R. Lloyd, Daniel Hernández-Lobato</p><p>Abstract: The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of ﬁnancial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large inﬂuence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other timevarying copula methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73694146 <a title="291-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Sensor_Selection_in_High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Trees_with_Nuisances.html">291 nips-2013-Sensor Selection in High-Dimensional Gaussian Trees with Nuisances</a></p>

We additionally derive an online-computable performance bound based on augmentations of the relevant latent variable set that, when such a valid augmentation exists, is applicable for any distribution with nuisances. 1</p><p>3 0.73116398 <a title="291-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Beyond_Pairwise%3A_Provably_Fast_Algorithms_for_Approximate_%24k%24-Way__Similarity_Search.html">57 nips-2013-Beyond Pairwise: Provably Fast Algorithms for Approximate $k$-Way  Similarity Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Anshumali Shrivastava, Ping Li</p><p>Abstract: We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with k-way similarity functions. In this paper, we focus on problems related to 3-way Jaccard similarity: R3way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | , S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C, where C is a |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | size n collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate R3way similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees, analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. In the process, we extend traditional framework of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of R3way search is shown on the “Google Sets” application. In addition, we demonstrate the advantage of R3way resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality. 1 Introduction and Motivation Similarity search (near neighbor search) is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Science. The task is to identify a small set of data points which are “most similar” to a given input query. Similarity search algorithms have been one of the basic building blocks in numerous applications including search, databases, learning, recommendation systems, computer vision, etc. One widely used notion of similarity on sets is the Jaccard similarity or resemblance [5, 10, 18, 20]. Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, the resemblance R2way between S1 and S2 is deﬁned as: R2way = |S1 ∩S2 | . Existing notions of similarity in search problems mainly work with |S1 ∪S2 | pairwise similarity functions. In this paper, we go beyond this notion and look at the problem of k-way similarity search, where the similarity function of interest involves k sets (k ≥ 2). Our work exploits the fact that resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance similarity [18, 21], deﬁned over k sets {S1 , S2 , ..., Sk } as Rk−way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩...∩Sk | . |S1 ∪S2 ∪...∪Sk | Binary high-dimensional data The current web datasets are typically binary, sparse, and extremely high-dimensional, largely due to the wide adoption of the “Bag of Words” (BoW) representations for documents and images. It is often the case, in BoW representations, that just the presence or absence (0/1) of speciﬁc feature words captures sufﬁcient information [7, 16, 20], especially with (e.g.,) 3-grams or higher-order models. And so, the web can be imagined as a giant storehouse of ultra high-dimensional sparse binary vectors. Of course, binary vectors can also be equivalently viewed as sets (containing locations of the nonzero features). We list four practical scenarios where k-way resemblance search would be a natural choice. (i) Google Sets: (http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/11/google-sets-still-available.html) Google Sets is among the earliest google projects, which allows users to generate list of similar words by typing only few related keywords. For example, if the user types “mazda” and “honda” the application will automatically generate related words like “bmw”, “ford”, “toyota”, etc. This application is currently available in google spreadsheet. If we assume the term document binary representation of each word w in the database, then given query w1 and w2 , we show that |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| turns out to be a very good similarity measure for this application (see Section 7.1). 1 (ii) Joint recommendations: Users A and B would like to watch a movie together. The proﬁle of each person can be represented as a sparse vector over a giant universe of attributes. For example, a user proﬁle may be the set of actors, actresses, genres, directors, etc, which she/he likes. On the other hand, we can represent a movie M in the database over the same universe based on attributes associated with the movie. If we have to recommend movie M, jointly to users A and B, then a natural measure to maximize is |A∩B∩M | . The problem of group recommendation [3] is applicable |A∪B∪M | in many more settings such as recommending people to join circles, etc. (iii) Improving retrieval quality: We are interested in ﬁnding images of a particular type of object, and we have two or three (possibly noisy) representative images. In such a scenario, a natural expectation is that retrieving images simultaneously similar to all the representative images should be more reﬁned than just retrieving images similar to any one of them. In Section 7.2, we demonstrate that in cases where we have more than one element to search for, we can reﬁne our search quality using k-way resemblance search. In a dynamic feedback environment [4], we can improve subsequent search quality by using k-way similarity search on the pages already clicked by the user. (iv) Beyond pairwise clustering: While machine learning algorithms often utilize the data through pairwise similarities (e.g., inner product or resemblance), there are natural scenarios where the afﬁnity relations are not pairwise, but rather triadic, tetradic or higher [2, 30]. The computational cost, of course, will increase exponentially if we go beyond pairwise similarity. Efﬁciency is crucial With the data explosion in modern applications, the brute force way of scanning all the data for searching is prohibitively expensive, specially in user-facing applications like search. The need for k-way similarity search can only be fulﬁlled if it admits efﬁcient algorithms. This paper fulﬁlls this requirement for k-way resemblance and its derived similarities. In particular, we show fast algorithms with provable query time guarantees for approximate k-way resemblance search. Our algorithms and analysis naturally provide a framework to extend classical LSH framework [14, 13] to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. Organization In Section 2, we review approximate near neighbor search and classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In Section 3, we formulate the 3-way similarity search problems. Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe provable fast algorithms for several search problems. Section 7 demonstrates the applicability of 3-way resemblance search in real applications. 2 Classical c-NN and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Initial attempts of ﬁnding efﬁcient (sub-linear time) algorithms for exact near neighbor search, based on space partitioning, turned out to be a disappointment with the massive dimensionality of current datasets [11, 28]. Approximate versions of the problem were proposed [14, 13] to break the linear query time bottleneck. One widely adopted formalism is the c-approximate near neighbor (c-NN). Deﬁnition 1 (c-Approximate Near Neighbor or c-NN). Consider a set of points, denoted by P, in a D-dimensional space RD , and parameters R0 > 0, δ > 0. The task is to construct a data structure which, given any query point q, if there exist an R0 -near neighbor of q in P, it reports some cR0 -near neighbor of q in P with probability 1 − δ. The usual notion of c-NN is for distance. Since we deal with similarities, we deﬁne R0 -near neighbor of point q as a point p with Sim(q, p) ≥ R0 , where Sim is the similarity function of interest. Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [14, 13] is a popular framework for c-NN problems. LSH is a family of functions, with the property that similar input objects in the domain of these functions have a higher probability of colliding in the range space than non-similar ones. In formal terms, consider H a family of hash functions mapping RD to some set S Deﬁnition 2 (Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)). A family H is called (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 )-sensitive if for any two points x, y ∈ RD and h chosen uniformly from H satisﬁes the following: • if Sim(x, y) ≥ R0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≥ p1 • if Sim(x, y) ≤ cR0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≤ p2 For approximate nearest neighbor search typically, p1 > p2 and c < 1 is needed. Note, c < 1 as we are deﬁning neighbors in terms of similarity. Basically, LSH trades off query time with extra preprocessing time and space which can be accomplished off-line. 2 Fact 1 Given a family of (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 ) -sensitive hash functions, one can construct a data structure for c-NN with O(nρ log1/p2 n) query time and space O(n1+ρ ), where ρ = log 1/p1 . log 1/p2 Minwise Hashing for Pairwise Resemblance One popular choice of LSH family of functions associated with resemblance similarity is, Minwise Hashing family [5, 6, 13]. Minwise Hashing family applies an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, on the given set S ⊆ Ω, and looks at the minimum element under π, i.e. min(π(S)). Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, it can be shown by elementary probability argument that P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 ))) = |S1 ∩ S2 | = R2way . |S1 ∪ S2 | (1) The recent work on b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] provides an improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of the hashed values: min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )). [26] implemented the idea of building hash tables for near neighbor search, by directly using the bits from b-bit minwise hashing. 3 3-way Similarity Search Formulation Our focus will remain on binary vectors which can also be viewed as sets. We illustrate our method |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | using 3-way resemblance similarity function Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) = |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | . The algorithm and guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. Given a size n collection C ⊆ 2Ω of sets (or binary vectors), we are particularly interested in the following three problems: 1. Given two query sets S1 and S2 , ﬁnd S3 ∈ C that maximizes Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 2. Given a query set S1 , ﬁnd two sets S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 3. Find three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). The brute force way of enumerating all possibilities leads to the worst case query time of O(n), O(n2 ) and O(n3 ) for problem 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In a hope to break this barrier, just like the case of pairwise near neighbor search, we deﬁne the c-approximate (c < 1) versions of the above three problems. As in the case of c-NN, we are given two parameters R0 > 0 and δ > 0. For each of the following three problems, the guarantee is with probability at least 1 − δ: 1. (3-way c-Near Neighbor or 3-way c-NN) Given two query sets S1 and S2 , if there ′ exists S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report some S3 ∈ C so that ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 2. (3-way c-Close Pair or 3-way c-CP) Given a query set S1 , if there exists a pair of ′ ′ set S2 , S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S2 , S3 ∈ C so that ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 3. (3-way c-Best Cluster or 3-way c-BC) If there exist sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C with ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C so that Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 4 Sub-linear Algorithm for 3-way c-NN The basic philosophy behind sub-linear search is bucketing, which allows us to preprocess dataset in a fashion so that we can ﬁlter many bad candidates without scanning all of them. LSH-based techniques rely on randomized hash functions to create buckets that probabilistically ﬁlter bad candidates. This philosophy is not restricted for binary similarity functions and is much more general. Here, we ﬁrst focus on 3-way c-NN problem for binary data. Theorem 1 For R3way c-NN one can construct a data structure with O(nρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument for 2-way resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance. Speciﬁcally, given three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ⊆ Ω and an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, we have: P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S3 ))) = R3way . (2) Eq.( 2) shows that minwise hashing, although it operates on sets individually, preserves all 3-way (in fact k-way) similarity structure of the data. The existence of such a hash function is the key requirement behind the existence of efﬁcient approximate search. For the pairwise case, the probability event was a simple hash collision, and the min-hash itself serves as the bucket index. In case 3 of 3-way (and higher) c-NN problem, we have to take care of a more complicated event to create an indexing scheme. In particular, during preprocessing we need to create buckets for each individual S3 , and while querying we need to associate the query sets S1 and S2 to the appropriate bucket. We need extra mechanisms to manipulate these minwise hashes to obtain a bucketing scheme. Proof of Theorem 1: We use two additional functions: f1 : Ω → N for manipulating min(π(S3 )) and f2 : Ω × Ω → N for manipulating both min(π(S1 )) and min(π(S2 )). Let a ∈ N+ such that |Ω| = D < 10a . We deﬁne f1 (x) = (10a + 1) × x and f2 (x, y) = 10a x + y. This choice ensures that given query S1 and S2 , for any S3 ∈ C, f1 (min(π(S3 ))) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))) holds if and only if min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S2 )), and thus we get a bucketing scheme. To complete the proof, we introduce two integer parameters K and L. Deﬁne a new hash function by concatenating K events. To be more precise, while preprocessing, for every element S3 ∈ C create buckets g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hK (S3 ))] where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise hashing family. For given query points S1 and S2 , retrieve only points in the bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) = [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hK (S1 ), hK (S2 ))]. Repeat this process L times independently. For any K S3 ∈ C, with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , is retrieved with probability at least 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Using log 1/c log K = ⌈ log n ⌉ and L = ⌈nρ log( 1 )⌉, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 , the proof can be obtained 1 δ cR0 using standard concentration arguments used to prove Fact 1, see [14, 13]. It is worth noting that the probability guarantee parameter δ gets absorbed in the constants as log( 1 ). Note, the process is δ stopped as soon as we ﬁnd some element with R3way ≥ cR0 . Theorem 1 can be easily extended to k-way resemblance with same query time and space guarantees. Note that k-way c-NN is at least as hard as k ∗ -way c-NN for any k ∗ ≤ k, because we can always choose (k −k ∗ +1) identical query sets in k-way c-NN, and it reduces to k ∗ -way c-NN problem. So, any improvements in R3way c-NN implies improvement in the classical min-hash LSH for Jaccard similarity. The proposed analysis is thus tight in this sense. The above observation makes it possible to also perform the traditional pairwise c-NN search using the same hash tables deployed for 3-way c-NN. In the query phase we have an option, if we have two different queries S1 , S2 , then we retrieve from bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) and that is usual 3-way c-NN search. If we are just interested in pairwise near neighbor search given one query S1 , then we will look into bucket g2 (S1 , S1 ), and we know that the 3-way resemblance between S1 , S1 , S3 boils down to the pairwise resemblance between S1 and S3 . So, the same hash tables can be used for both the purposes. This property generalizes, and hash tables created for k-way c-NN can be used for any k ∗ -way similarity search so long as k ∗ ≤ k. The approximation guarantees still holds. This ﬂexibility makes k-way c-NN bucketing scheme more advantageous over the pairwise scheme. ρ 1 One of the peculiarity of LSH based techniques is that the query complexity exponent ρ < 1 is dependent on the choice R0=0.01 0.8 of the threshold R0 we are interested in and the value of c 0.05 0.1 0.3 0.6 which is the approximation ratio that we will tolerate. Figure 1 0.2 0.4 0.8 log 1/c 0.5 plots ρ = 1− log 1/c+log 1/R0 with respect to c, for selected R0 0.4 0.6 0.9 0.7 values from 0.01 to 0.99. For instance, if we are interested in 0.2 0.95 highly similar pairs, i.e. R0 ≈ 1, then we are looking at near R =0.99 0 O(log n) query complexity for c-NN problem as ρ ≈ 0. On 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 the other hand, for very lower threshold R0 , there is no much c log 1/c of hope of time-saving because ρ is close to 1. Figure 1: ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . 5 Other Efﬁcient k-way Similarities We refer to the k-way similarities for which there exist sub-linear algorithms for c-NN search with query and space complexity exactly as given in Theorem 1 as efﬁcient . We have demonstrated existence of one such example of efﬁcient similarities, which is the k-way resemblance. This leads to a natural question: “Are there more of them?”. [9] analyzed all the transformations on similarities that preserve existence of efﬁcient LSH search. In particular, they showed that if S is a similarity for which there exists an LSH family, then there also exists an LSH family for any similarity which is a probability generating function (PGF) transfor∑∞ mation on S. PGF transformation on S is deﬁned as P GF (S) = i=1 pi S i , where S ∈ [0, 1] and ∑∞ pi ≥ 0 satisﬁes i=1 pi = 1. Similar theorem can also be shown in the case of 3-way resemblance. 4 Theorem 2 Any PGF transformation on 3-way resemblance R3way is efﬁcient. Recall in the proof of Theorem 1, we created hash assignments f1 (min(π(S3 ))) and f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))), which lead to a bucketing scheme for the 3-way resemblance search, where the collision event E = {f1 (min(π(S3 )) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )))} happens with probability P r(E) = R3way . To prove the above Theorem 2, we will need to create hash events ∑∞ i having probability P GF (R3way ) = i=1 pi (R3way ) . Note that 0 ≤ P GF (R3way ) ≤ 1. We will make use of the following simple lemma. Lemma 1 (R3way )n is efﬁcient for all n ∈ N. n n Proof: Deﬁne new hash assignments g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hn (S3 ))] and g2 (S1 , S2 ) = n n [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hn (S1 ), hn (S2 ))]. The collision event g1 (S3 ) = g2 (S1 , S2 ) has n n probability (R3way )n . We now use the pair < g1 , g2 > instead of < f1 , f2 > and obtain same 3way n guarantees, as in Theorem 1, for (R ) as well. i i Proof of Theorem 2: From Lemma 1, let < g1 , g2 > be the hash pair corresponding to (R3way )i i i as used in above lemma. We sample one hash pair from the set {< g1 , g2 >: i ∈ N}, where i i the probability of sampling < g1 , g2 > is proportional to pi . Note that pi ≥ 0, and satisﬁes ∑∞ is i=1 pi = 1, and so the above sampling ∑ valid. It is not difﬁcult to see that the collision of the ∞ sampled hash pair has probability exactly i=1 pi (R3way )i . Theorem 2 can be naturally extended to k-way similarity for any k ≥ 2. Thus, we now have inﬁnitely many k-way similarity functions admitting efﬁcient sub-linear search. One, that might be interesting, because of its radial basis kernel like nature, is shown in the following corollary. Corollary 1 eR k−way −1 is efﬁcient. Proof: Use the expansion of eR k−way normalized by e to see that eR k−way −1 is a PGF on Rk−way . 6 Fast Algorithms for 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC Problems For 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC problems, using bucketing scheme with minwise hashing family will save even more computations. Theorem 3 For R3way c-Close Pair Problem (or c-CP) one can construct a data structure with log 1/c O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+2ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . Note that we can switch the role of f1 and f2 in the proof of Theorem 1. We are thus left with a c-NN problem with search space O(n2 ) (all pairs) instead of n. A bit of analysis, similar to Theorem 1, will show that this procedure achieves the required query time O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n), but uses a lot more space, O(n2(1+ρ )), than shown in the above theorem. It turns out that there is a better way of doing c-CP that saves us space. Proof of Theorem 3: We again start with constructing hash tables. For every element Sc ∈ C, we create a hash-table and store Sc in bucket B(Sc ) = [h1 (Sc ); h2 (Sc ); ...; hK (Sc )], where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise independent family of hash functions H. We create L such hash-tables. For a query element Sq we look for all pairs in bucket B(Sq ) = [h1 (Sq ); h2 (Sq ); ...; hK (Sq )] and repeat this for each of the L tables. Note, we do not form pairs of elements retrieved from different tables as they do not satisfy Eq. (2). If there exists a pair S1 , S2 ∈ C with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ R0 , using K Eq. (2), we can see that we will ﬁnd that pair in bucket B(Sq ) with probability 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Here, we cannot use traditional choice of K and L, similar to what we did in Theorem 1, as there 2 log are O(n2 ) instead of O(n) possible pairs. We instead use K = ⌈ log 1n ⌉ and L = ⌈n2ρ log( 1 )⌉, δ cR0 log 1/c with ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . With this choice of K and L, the result follows. Note, the process is stopped as soon as we ﬁnd pairs S1 and S2 with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ cR0 . The key argument that saves space from O(n2(1+ρ) ) to O(n1+2ρ ) is that we hash n points individually. Eq. (2) makes it clear that hashing all possible pairs is not needed when every point can be processed individually, and pairs formed within each bucket itself ﬁlter out most of the unnecessary combinations. 5 Theorem 4 For R3way c-Best Cluster Problem (or c-BC) there exist an algorithm with running time log 1/c O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n), where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument similar to one used in proof of Theorem 3 leads to the running time of O(n1+3ρ log1/cR0 n) as we need L = O(n3ρ ), and we have to processes all points at least once. Proof of Theorem 4: Repeat c-CP problem n times for every element in collection C acting as query once. We use the same set of hash tables and hash functions every time. The preprocessing time is O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n) evaluations of hash functions and the total querying time is O(n × n2ρ log1/cR0 n), which makes the total running time O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n). For k-way c-BC Problem, we can achieve O(n1+(k−1)ρ log1/cR0 n) running time. If we are interested in very high similarity cluster, with R0 ≈ 1, then ρ ≈ 0, and the running time is around O(n log n). This is a huge saving over the brute force O(nk ). In most practical cases, specially in big data regime where we have enormous amount of data, we can expect the k-way similarity of good clusters to be high and ﬁnding them should be efﬁcient. We can see that with increasing k, hashing techniques save more computations. 7 Experiments In this section, we demonstrate the usability of 3-way and higher-order similarity search using (i) Google Sets, and (ii) Improving retrieval quality. 7.1 Google Sets: Generating Semantically Similar Words Here, the task is to retrieve words which are “semantically” similar to the given set of query words. We collected 1.2 million random documents from Wikipedia and created a standard term-doc binary vector representation of each term present in the collected documents after removing standard stop words and punctuation marks. More speciﬁcally, every word is represented as a 1.2 million dimension binary vector indicating its presence or absence in the corresponding document. The total number of terms (or words) was around 60,000 in this experiment. Since there is no standard benchmark available for this task, we show qualitative evaluations. For querying, we used the following four pairs of semantically related words: (i) “jaguar” and “tiger”; (ii) “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence”; (iii) “milky” and “way” ; (iv) “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Given the query words w1 and w2 , we compare the results obtained by the following four methods. • Google Sets: We use Google’s algorithm and report 5 words from Google spreadsheets [1]. This is Google’s algorithm which uses its own data. • 3-way Resemblance (3-way): We use 3-way resemblance |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| to rank every word |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| w and report top 5 words based on this ranking. • Sum Resemblance (SR): Another intuitive method is to use the sum of pairwise resem|w2 ∩w| blance |w1 ∩w| + |w2 ∪w| and report top 5 words based on this ranking. |w1 ∪w| • Pairwise Intersection (PI): We ﬁrst retrieve top 100 words based on pairwise resemblance for each w1 and w2 independently. We then report the words common in both. If there is no word in common we do not report anything. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that using 3-way resemblance retrieves reasonable candidates for these four queries. An interesting query is “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Finger Lakes is a region in upstate New York. Google could only relate it to New York, while 3-way resemblance could even retrieve the names of cities and lakes in the region. Also, for query “milky” and “way”, we can see some (perhaps) unrelated words like “dance” returned by Google. We do not see such random behavior with 3-way resemblance. Although we are not aware of the algorithm and the dataset used by Google, we can see that 3-way resemblance appears to be a right measure for this application. The above results also illustrate the problem with using the sum of pairwise similarity method. The similarity value with one of the words dominates the sum and hence we see for queries “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence” that all the retrieved words are mostly related to the word “intelligence”. Same is the case with query “ﬁnger” and “lakes” as well as “jaguar” and “tiger”. Note that “jaguar” is also a car brand. In addition, for all 4 queries, there was no common word in the top 100 words similar to the each query word individually and so PI method never returns anything. 6 Table 1: Top ﬁve words retrieved using various methods for different queries. “JAGUAR” AND “ TIGER” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR LION LEOPARD CHEETAH CAT DOG LEOPARD CHEETAH LION PANTHER CAT CAT LEOPARD LITRE BMW CHASIS “MILKY” AND “ WAY” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR DANCE STARS SPACE THE UNIVERSE GALAXY STARS EARTH LIGHT SPACE EVEN ANOTHER STILL BACK TIME PI — — — — — “ARTIFICIAL” AND “INTELLIGENCE” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR PI COMPUTER COMPUTER SECURITY — PROGRAMMING SCIENCE WEAPONS — INTELLIGENT SECRET — SCIENCE ROBOT HUMAN ATTACKS — ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY HUMAN — PI — — — — — G OOGLE NEW YORK NY PARK CITY “FINGER” AND “LAKES” 3- WAY SR SENECA CAYUGA ERIE ROCHESTER IROQUOIS RIVERS FRESHWATER FISH STREAMS FORESTED PI — — — — — We should note the importance of the denominator term in 3-way resemblance, without which frequent words will be blindly favored. The exciting contribution of this paper is that 3-way resemblance similarity search admits provable sub-linear guarantees, making it an ideal choice. On the other hand, no such provable guarantees are known for SR and other heuristic based search methods. 7.2 Improving Retrieval Quality in Similarity Search We also demonstrate how the retrieval quality of traditional similarity search can be boosted by utilizing more query candidates instead of just one. For the evaluations we choose two public datasets: MNIST and WEBSPAM, which were used in a recent related paper [26] for near neighbor search with binary data using b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23]. The two datasets reﬂect diversity both in terms of task and scale that is encountered in practice. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digit samples. Each sample is an image of 28 × 28 pixel yielding a 784 dimension vector with the associated class label (digit 0 − 9). We binarize the data by settings all non zeros to be 1. We used the standard partition of MNIST, which consists of 10,000 samples in one set and 60,000 in the other. The WEBSPAM dataset, with 16,609,143 features, consists of sparse vector representation of emails labeled as spam or not. We randomly sample 70,000 data points and partitioned them into two independent sets of size 35,000 each. Table 2: Percentage of top candidates with the same labels as that of query retrieved using various similarity criteria. More indicates better retrieval quality (Best marked in bold).

It makes no sense in trying to search for object simultaneously similar to two very different objects. To generate such query candidates, we took one independent set of the data and partition it according to the class labels. We then run a cheap k-mean clustering on each class, and randomly sample triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > from each cluster for evaluating 2-way, 3-way and 4-way similarity search. For MNIST dataset, the standard 10,000 test set was partitioned according to the labels into 10 sets, each partition was then clustered into 10 clusters, and we choose 10 triplets randomly from each cluster. In all we had 100 such triplets for each class, and thus 1000 overall query triplets. For WEBSPAM, which consists only of 2 classes, we choose one of the independent set and performed the same procedure. We selected 100 triplets from each cluster. We thus have 1000 triplets from each class making the total number of 2000 query candidates. The above procedures ensure that the elements in each triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > are not very far from each other and are of the same class label. For each triplet < x1 , x2 , x3 >, we sort all the points x in the other independent set based on the following: • Pairwise: We only use the information in x1 and rank x based on resemblance 7 |x1 ∩x| |x1 ∪x| . • 3-way NN: We rank x based on 3-way resemblance • 4-way NN: We rank x based on 4-way resemblance |x1 ∩x2 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x| . |x1 ∩x2 ∩x3 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x3 ∪x| . We look at the top 1, 10, 20 and 50 points based on orderings described above. Since, all the query triplets are of the same label, The percentage of top retrieved candidates having same label as that of the query items is a natural metric to evaluate the retrieval quality. This percentage values accumulated over all the triplets are summarized in Table 2. We can see that top candidates retrieved by 3-way resemblance similarity, using 2 query points, are of better quality than vanilla pairwise similarity search. Also 4-way resemblance, with 3 query points, further improves the results compared to 3-way resemblance similarity search. This clearly demonstrates that multi-way resemblance similarity search is more desirable whenever we have more than one representative query in mind. Note that, for MNIST, which contains 10 classes, the boost compared to pairwise retrieval is substantial. The results follow a consistent trend. 8 Future Work While the work presented in this paper is promising for efﬁcient 3-way and k-way similarity search in binary high-dimensional data, there are numerous interesting and practical research problems we can study as future work. In this section, we mention a few such examples. One-permutation hashing. Traditionally, building hash tables for near neighbor search required many (e.g., 1000) independent hashes. This is both time- and energy-consuming, not only for building tables but also for processing un-seen queries which have not been processed. One permutation hashing [22] provides the hope of reducing many permutations to merely one. The version in [22], however, was not applicable to near neighbor search due to the existence of many empty bins (which offer no indexing capability). The most recent work [27] is able to ﬁll the empty bins and works well for pairwise near neighbor search. It will be interesting to extend [27] to k-way search. Non-binary sparse data. This paper focuses on minwise hashing for binary data. Various extensions to real-valued data are possible. For example, our results naturally apply to consistent weighted sampling [25, 15], which is one way to handle non-binary sparse data. The problem, however, is not solved if we are interested in similarities such as (normalized) k-way inner products, although the line of work on Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) [19, 18] may be promising. CRS works on non-binary sparse data by storing a bottom subset of nonzero entries after applying one permutation to (real-valued) sparse data matrix. CRS performs very well for certain applications but it does not work in our context because the bottom (nonzero) subsets are not properly aligned. Building hash tables by directly using bits from minwise hashing. This will be a different approach from the way how the hash tables are constructed in this paper. For example, [26] directly used the bits from b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] to build hash tables and demonstrated the signiﬁcant advantages compared to sim-hash [8, 12] and spectral hashing [29]. It would be interesting to see the performance of this approach in k-way similarity search. k-Way sign random projections. It would be very useful to develop theory for k-way sign random projections. For usual (real-valued) random projections, it is known that the volume (which is related to the determinant) is approximately preserved [24, 17]. We speculate that the collision probability of k-way sign random projections might be also a (monotonic) function of the determinant. 9 Conclusions We formulate a new framework for k-way similarity search and obtain fast algorithms in the case of k-way resemblance with provable worst-case approximation guarantees. We show some applications of k-way resemblance search in practice and demonstrate the advantages over traditional search. Our analysis involves the idea of probabilistic hashing and extends the well-known LSH family beyond the pairwise case. We believe the idea of probabilistic hashing still has a long way to go.

<p>Author: Tetsuro Morimura, Takayuki Osogami, Tsuyoshi Ide</p><p>Abstract: The Markov chain is a convenient tool to represent the dynamics of complex systems such as trafﬁc and social systems, where probabilistic transition takes place between internal states. A Markov chain is characterized by initial-state probabilities and a state-transition probability matrix. In the traditional setting, a major goal is to study properties of a Markov chain when those probabilities are known. This paper tackles an inverse version of the problem: we ﬁnd those probabilities from partial observations at a limited number of states. The observations include the frequency of visiting a state and the rate of reaching a state from another. Practical examples of this task include trafﬁc monitoring systems in cities, where we need to infer the trafﬁc volume on single link on a road network from a limited number of observation points. We formulate this task as a regularized optimization problem, which is efﬁciently solved using the notion of natural gradient. Using synthetic and real-world data sets including city trafﬁc monitoring data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>5 0.70013833 <a title="291-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitish Srivastava, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: High capacity classiﬁers, such as deep neural networks, often struggle on classes that have very few training examples. We propose a method for improving classiﬁcation performance for such classes by discovering similar classes and transferring knowledge among them. Our method learns to organize the classes into a tree hierarchy. This tree structure imposes a prior over the classiﬁer’s parameters. We show that the performance of deep neural networks can be improved by applying these priors to the weights in the last layer. Our method combines the strength of discriminatively trained deep neural networks, which typically require large amounts of training data, with tree-based priors, making deep neural networks work well on infrequent classes as well. We also propose an algorithm for learning the underlying tree structure. Starting from an initial pre-speciﬁed tree, this algorithm modiﬁes the tree to make it more pertinent to the task being solved, for example, removing semantic relationships in favour of visual ones for an image classiﬁcation task. Our method achieves state-of-the-art classiﬁcation results on the CIFAR-100 image data set and the MIR Flickr image-text data set. 1</p><p>6 0.64920247 <a title="291-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Policy_Shaping%3A_Integrating_Human_Feedback_with_Reinforcement_Learning.html">250 nips-2013-Policy Shaping: Integrating Human Feedback with Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

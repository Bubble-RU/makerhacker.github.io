<p>Author: Nathaniel Korda, Emilie Kaufmann, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a ﬁnite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families. 1</p><p>3 0.38182804 <a title="253-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Eluder_Dimension_and_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Optimistic_Exploration.html">106 nips-2013-Eluder Dimension and the Sample Complexity of Optimistic Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Russo, Benjamin Van Roy</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sample complexity of the multi-armed bandit with dependencies among the arms. Some of the most successful algorithms for this problem use the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to guide exploration. The clearest example of this is the class of upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) algorithms, but recent work has shown that a simple posterior sampling algorithm, sometimes called Thompson sampling, can be analyzed in the same manner as optimistic approaches. In this paper, we develop a regret bound that holds for both classes of algorithms. This bound applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. It depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm regret bounds for speciﬁc model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. 1</p><p>4 0.38007218 <a title="253-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Two-Target_Algorithms__for_Infinite-Armed___Bandits_with_Bernoulli_Rewards.html">338 nips-2013-Two-Target Algorithms  for Infinite-Armed   Bandits with Bernoulli Rewards</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Bonald, Alexandre Proutiere</p><p>Abstract: We consider an inﬁnite-armed bandit problem with Bernoulli rewards. The mean rewards are independent, uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. Rewards 0 and 1 are referred to as a success and a failure, respectively. We propose a novel algorithm where the decision to exploit any arm is based on two successive targets, namely, the total number of successes until the ﬁrst failure and until the ﬁrst m failures, respectively, where m is a ﬁxed parameter. This two-target algorithm achieves a √ long-term average regret in 2n for a large parameter m and a known time horizon n. This regret is optimal and strictly less than the regret achieved by the best √ known algorithms, which is in 2 n. The results are extended to any mean-reward distribution whose support contains 1 and to unknown time horizons. Numerical experiments show the performance of the algorithm for ﬁnite time horizons. 1</p><p>5 0.29116672 <a title="253-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Exploration_in_Multi-Armed_Bandits.html">95 nips-2013-Distributed Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Eshcar Hillel, Zohar S. Karnin, Tomer Koren, Ronny Lempel, Oren Somekh</p><p>Abstract: We study exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits in a setting where k players collaborate in order to identify an ε-optimal arm. Our motivation comes from recent employment of bandit algorithms in computationally intensive, large-scale applications. Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the k players to com√ municate only once, they are able to learn k times faster than a single player. √ That is, distributing learning to k players gives rise to a factor k parallel speedup. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible. On the other extreme, we present an algorithm that achieves the ideal factor k speed-up in learning performance, with communication only logarithmic in 1/ε. 1</p><p>6 0.25656623 <a title="253-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Mixture_Modelling_and_Inference_based_Thompson_Sampling_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search.html">50 nips-2013-Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi azar, Alessandro Lazaric, Emma Brunskill</p><p>Abstract: Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is critical for building lifelong learning agents. Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may signiﬁcantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of sequential transfer in online learning, notably in the multi–armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the total regret over a sequence of tasks by transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for estimating the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it. 1</p><p>5 0.72512412 <a title="253-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Exploration_in_Multi-Armed_Bandits.html">95 nips-2013-Distributed Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits</a></p>

Unsupervised learning of these models is a form of discrete factor analysis, enabling the discovery of hidden variables and their causal relationships with observed data. We obtain an efﬁcient learning algorithm for a family of Bayesian networks that we call quartet-learnable. For each latent variable, the existence of a singly-coupled quartet allows us to uniquely identify and learn all parameters involving that latent variable. We give a proof of the polynomial sample complexity of our learning algorithm, and experimentally compare it to variational EM. 1</p><p>3 0.62173545 <a title="253-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Relevance_Topic_Model_for_Unstructured_Social_Group_Activity_Recognition.html">274 nips-2013-Relevance Topic Model for Unstructured Social Group Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Zhao, Yongzhen Huang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Unstructured social group activity recognition in web videos is a challenging task due to 1) the semantic gap between class labels and low-level visual features and 2) the lack of labeled training data. To tackle this problem, we propose a “relevance topic model” for jointly learning meaningful mid-level representations upon bagof-words (BoW) video representations and a classiﬁer with sparse weights. In our approach, sparse Bayesian learning is incorporated into an undirected topic model (i.e., Replicated Softmax) to discover topics which are relevant to video classes and suitable for prediction. Rectiﬁed linear units are utilized to increase the expressive power of topics so as to explain better video data containing complex contents and make variational inference tractable for the proposed model. An efﬁcient variational EM algorithm is presented for model parameter estimation and inference. Experimental results on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute dataset show that our model achieves state of the art performance and outperforms other supervised topic model in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, particularly in the case of a very small number of labeled training videos. 1</p><p>4 0.60328007 <a title="253-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>
<p>Author: Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir [14]. Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph (which must be accessible before selecting an action). In the undirected case, we show that the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>5 0.59274334 <a title="253-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Adversarially_Chosen_Transition_Probability_Distributions.html">227 nips-2013-Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Adversarially Chosen Transition Probability Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi, Peter Bartlett, Varun Kanade, Yevgeny Seldin, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a mixing assumption, achieves p O( T log |⇧| + log |⇧|) regret with respect to a comparison set of policies ⇧. The regret is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When expectations over sample paths can be computed efﬁciently and the comparison set ⇧ has polynomial size, this algorithm is efﬁcient. We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path problem. Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identiﬁed start and ﬁnish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to ﬁnish node. At the end of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges) is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to a ﬁxed policy for selecting paths. This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, the problem can be efﬁciently solved. We show that it also can be efﬁciently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses. When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efﬁcient algorithms for the adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a notoriously difﬁcult problem that has been used to design efﬁcient cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.59247833 <a title="253-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>

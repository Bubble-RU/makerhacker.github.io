<p>Author: Prem Gopalan, Chong Wang, David Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach for accurate network modeling using node popularities within the framework of the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). Our model integrates two basic properties of nodes in social networks: homophily and preferential connection to popular nodes. We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference, based on a novel nonconjugate variant of stochastic variational inference. We evaluate the link prediction accuracy of our algorithm on nine real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes, and on simulated networks with degree distributions that follow a power law. We demonstrate that the AMP predicts signiﬁcantly better than the MMSB. 1</p><p>3 0.14209248 <a title="213-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Restricting_exchangeable_nonparametric_distributions.html">277 nips-2013-Restricting exchangeable nonparametric distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Sinead A. Williamson, Steve N. MacEachern, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Distributions over matrices with exchangeable rows and inﬁnitely many columns are useful in constructing nonparametric latent variable models. However, the distribution implied by such models over the number of features exhibited by each data point may be poorly-suited for many modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a class of exchangeable nonparametric priors obtained by restricting the domain of existing models. Such models allow us to specify the distribution over the number of features per data point, and can achieve better performance on data sets where the number of features is not well-modeled by the original distribution. 1</p><p>4 0.12721229 <a title="213-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Estimation_of_Latently-grouped_Parameters_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">46 nips-2013-Bayesian Estimation of Latently-grouped Parameters in Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Liu, David Page</p><p>Abstract: In large-scale applications of undirected graphical models, such as social networks and biological networks, similar patterns occur frequently and give rise to similar parameters. In this situation, it is beneﬁcial to group the parameters for more efﬁcient learning. We show that even when the grouping is unknown, we can infer these parameter groups during learning via a Bayesian approach. We impose a Dirichlet process prior on the parameters. Posterior inference usually involves calculating intractable terms, and we propose two approximation algorithms, namely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with auxiliary variables and a Gibbs sampling algorithm with “stripped” Beta approximation (Gibbs SBA). Simulations show that both algorithms outperform conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Gibbs SBA’s performance is close to Gibbs sampling with exact likelihood calculation. Models learned with Gibbs SBA also generalize better than the models learned by MLE on real-world Senate voting data. 1</p><p>5 0.1105326 <a title="213-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Overlapping_Sets_Lasso_for_Multitask_Learning_and_its_Application_to_fMRI_Analysis.html">303 nips-2013-Sparse Overlapping Sets Lasso for Multitask Learning and its Application to fMRI Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikhil Rao, Christopher Cox, Rob Nowak, Timothy T. Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Multitask learning can be effective when features useful in one task are also useful for other tasks, and the group lasso is a standard method for selecting a common subset of features. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of multitask learning, wherein (1) the available features can be organized into subsets according to a notion of similarity and (2) features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the features best suited for other tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks. Error bounds are derived for SOSlasso and its consistency is established for squared error loss. In particular, SOSlasso is motivated by multisubject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classiﬁed using brain voxels as features. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOSlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso. 1</p><p>6 0.10824674 <a title="213-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_Spectral_Clustering_under_the_Degree-Corrected_Stochastic_Blockmodel.html">272 nips-2013-Regularized Spectral Clustering under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel</a></p>

<p>Author: Dae Il Kim, Prem Gopalan, David Blei, Erik Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic block models characterize observed network relationships via latent community memberships. In large social networks, we expect entities to participate in multiple communities, and the number of communities to grow with the network size. We introduce a new model for these phenomena, the hierarchical Dirichlet process relational model, which allows nodes to have mixed membership in an unbounded set of communities. To allow scalable learning, we derive an online stochastic variational inference algorithm. Focusing on assortative models of undirected networks, we also propose an efﬁcient structured mean ﬁeld variational bound, and online methods for automatically pruning unused communities. Compared to state-of-the-art online learning methods for parametric relational models, we show signiﬁcantly improved perplexity and link prediction accuracy for sparse networks with tens of thousands of nodes. We also showcase an analysis of LittleSis, a large network of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. 1</p><p>3 0.80681163 <a title="213-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Modeling_Overlapping_Communities_with_Node_Popularities.html">196 nips-2013-Modeling Overlapping Communities with Node Popularities</a></p>

<p>Author: Junming Yin, Qirong Ho, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scalable approach for making inference about latent spaces of large networks. With a succinct representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs, a parsimonious statistical model, and an efﬁcient stochastic variational inference algorithm, we are able to analyze real networks with over a million vertices and hundreds of latent roles on a single machine in a matter of hours, a setting that is out of reach for many existing methods. When compared to the state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches, our method is several orders of magnitude faster, with competitive or improved accuracy for latent space recovery and link prediction. 1</p><p>5 0.64900869 <a title="213-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_Influence_Estimation_in_Continuous-Time_Diffusion_Networks.html">288 nips-2013-Scalable Influence Estimation in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: If a piece of information is released from a media site, can we predict whether it may spread to one million web pages, in a month ? This inﬂuence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for inﬂuence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the inﬂuence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of using n = O(1/ 2 ) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy inﬂuence maximization approach, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd a set of C nodes with the inﬂuence of at least (1 − 1/e) OPT −2C , where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while signiﬁcantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated inﬂuence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the inﬂuence. 1</p><p>6 0.63334465 <a title="213-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_Spectral_Clustering_under_the_Degree-Corrected_Stochastic_Blockmodel.html">272 nips-2013-Regularized Spectral Clustering under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel</a></p>

<p>Author: Remi Gribonval, Pierre Machart</p><p>Abstract: There are two major routes to address linear inverse problems. Whereas regularization-based approaches build estimators as solutions of penalized regression optimization problems, Bayesian estimators rely on the posterior distribution of the unknown, given some assumed family of priors. While these may seem radically different approaches, recent results have shown that, in the context of additive white Gaussian denoising, the Bayesian conditional mean estimator is always the solution of a penalized regression problem. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we extend the additive white Gaussian denoising results to general linear inverse problems with colored Gaussian noise. Second, we characterize conditions under which the penalty function associated to the conditional mean estimator can satisfy certain popular properties such as convexity, separability, and smoothness. This sheds light on some tradeoff between computational efﬁciency and estimation accuracy in sparse regularization, and draws some connections between Bayesian estimation and proximal optimization. 1</p><p>3 0.73785746 <a title="213-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Firing_rate_predictions_in_optimal_balanced_networks.html">121 nips-2013-Firing rate predictions in optimal balanced networks</a></p>
<p>Author: David G. Barrett, Sophie Denève, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How are ﬁring rates in a spiking network related to neural input, connectivity and network function? This is an important problem because ﬁring rates are a key measure of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difﬁcult problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculating ﬁring rates in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate ﬁring rates by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimising signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate ﬁring rates by ﬁnding the solution to the algorithm. Our ﬁring rate calculation relates network ﬁring rates directly to network input, connectivity and function. This allows us to explain the function and underlying mechanism of tuning curves in a variety of systems. 1</p><p>4 0.70051432 <a title="213-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimal_Neural_Population_Codes_for_High-dimensional_Stimulus_Variables.html">236 nips-2013-Optimal Neural Population Codes for High-dimensional Stimulus Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuo Wang, Alan Stocker, Daniel Lee</p><p>Abstract: In many neural systems, information about stimulus variables is often represented in a distributed manner by means of a population code. It is generally assumed that the responses of the neural population are tuned to the stimulus statistics, and most prior work has investigated the optimal tuning characteristics of one or a small number of stimulus variables. In this work, we investigate the optimal tuning for diffeomorphic representations of high-dimensional stimuli. We analytically derive the solution that minimizes the L2 reconstruction loss. We compared our solution with other well-known criteria such as maximal mutual information. Our solution suggests that the optimal weights do not necessarily decorrelate the inputs, and the optimal nonlinearity differs from the conventional equalization solution. Results illustrating these optimal representations are shown for some input distributions that may be relevant for understanding the coding of perceptual pathways. 1</p><p>5 0.69600773 <a title="213-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Multiple_Models_via_Regularized_Weighting.html">158 nips-2013-Learning Multiple Models via Regularized Weighting</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Huan Xu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of Multiple Model Learning (MML) from data, from the statistical and algorithmic perspectives; this problem includes clustering, multiple regression and subspace clustering as special cases. A common approach to solving new MML problems is to generalize Lloyd’s algorithm for clustering (or Expectation-Maximization for soft clustering). However this approach is unfortunately sensitive to outliers and large noise: a single exceptional point may take over one of the models. We propose a different general formulation that seeks for each model a distribution over data points; the weights are regularized to be sufﬁciently spread out. This enhances robustness by making assumptions on class balance. We further provide generalization bounds and explain how the new iterations may be computed efﬁciently. We demonstrate the robustness beneﬁts of our approach with some experimental results and prove for the important case of clustering that our approach has a non-trivial breakdown point, i.e., is guaranteed to be robust to a ﬁxed percentage of adversarial unbounded outliers. 1</p><p>6 0.69540417 <a title="213-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Trading_Computation_for_Communication%3A_Distributed_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">333 nips-2013-Trading Computation for Communication: Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>

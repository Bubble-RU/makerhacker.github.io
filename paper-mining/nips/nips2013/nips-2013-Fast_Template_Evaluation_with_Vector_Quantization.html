<p>Author: Qianli Liao, Joel Z. Leibo, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: One approach to computer object recognition and modeling the brain’s ventral stream involves unsupervised learning of representations that are invariant to common transformations. However, applications of these ideas have usually been limited to 2D afﬁne transformations, e.g., translation and scaling, since they are easiest to solve via convolution. In accord with a recent theory of transformationinvariance [1], we propose a model that, while capturing other common convolutional networks as special cases, can also be used with arbitrary identitypreserving transformations. The model’s wiring can be learned from videos of transforming objects—or any other grouping of images into sets by their depicted object. Through a series of successively more complex empirical tests, we study the invariance/discriminability properties of this model with respect to different transformations. First, we empirically conﬁrm theoretical predictions (from [1]) for the case of 2D afﬁne transformations. Next, we apply the model to non-afﬁne transformations; as expected, it performs well on face veriﬁcation tasks requiring invariance to the relatively smooth transformations of 3D rotation-in-depth and changes in illumination direction. Surprisingly, it can also tolerate clutter “transformations” which map an image of a face on one background to an image of the same face on a different background. Motivated by these empirical ﬁndings, we tested the same model on face veriﬁcation benchmark tasks from the computer vision literature: Labeled Faces in the Wild, PubFig [2, 3, 4] and a new dataset we gathered—achieving strong performance in these highly unconstrained cases as well. 1</p><p>3 0.17955573 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Mid-level_Visual_Element_Discovery_as_Discriminative_Mode_Seeking.html">190 nips-2013-Mid-level Visual Element Discovery as Discriminative Mode Seeking</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the level of complexity higher than typical “visual words”, but lower than full-blown semantic objects. Several approaches [5, 6, 12, 23] have been proposed to discover mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difﬁcult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data. We also propose the Purity-Coverage plot as a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual discovery approaches, and compare our method against prior work on the Paris Street View dataset of [5]. We also evaluate our method on the task of scene classiﬁcation, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.17939328 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection.html">84 nips-2013-Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Szegedy, Alexander Toshev, Dumitru Erhan</p><p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classiﬁcation tasks [14]. In this paper we go one step further and address the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks. We deﬁne a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution object detections at a low cost by a few network applications. State-of-the-art performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC. 1</p><p>5 0.12932329 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Extracting_regions_of_interest_from_biological_images_with_convolutional_sparse_block_coding.html">114 nips-2013-Extracting regions of interest from biological images with convolutional sparse block coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Adam M. Packer, Noah Pettit, Henry Dalgleish, Michael Hausser, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Biological tissue is often composed of cells with similar morphologies replicated throughout large volumes and many biological applications rely on the accurate identiﬁcation of these cells and their locations from image data. Here we develop a generative model that captures the regularities present in images composed of repeating elements of a few different types. Formally, the model can be described as convolutional sparse block coding. For inference we use a variant of convolutional matching pursuit adapted to block-based representations. We extend the KSVD learning algorithm to subspaces by retaining several principal vectors from the SVD decomposition instead of just one. Good models with little cross-talk between subspaces can be obtained by learning the blocks incrementally. We perform extensive experiments on simulated images and the inference algorithm consistently recovers a large proportion of the cells with a small number of false positives. We ﬁt the convolutional model to noisy GCaMP6 two-photon images of spiking neurons and to Nissl-stained slices of cortical tissue and show that it recovers cell body locations without supervision. The ﬂexibility of the block-based representation is reﬂected in the variability of the recovered cell shapes. 1</p><p>6 0.11492661 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-A_simple_example_of_Dirichlet_process_mixture_inconsistency_for_the_number_of_components.html">18 nips-2013-A simple example of Dirichlet process mixture inconsistency for the number of components</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen-Ping Yu, Wen-Yu Hua, Dimitris Samaras, Greg Zelinsky</p><p>Abstract: Visual clutter, the perception of an image as being crowded and disordered, affects aspects of our lives ranging from object detection to aesthetics, yet relatively little effort has been made to model this important and ubiquitous percept. Our approach models clutter as the number of proto-objects segmented from an image, with proto-objects deﬁned as groupings of superpixels that are similar in intensity, color, and gradient orientation features. We introduce a novel parametric method of clustering superpixels by modeling mixture of Weibulls on Earth Mover’s Distance statistics, then taking the normalized number of proto-objects following partitioning as our estimate of clutter perception. We validated this model using a new 90-image dataset of real world scenes rank ordered by human raters for clutter, and showed that our method not only predicted clutter extremely well (Spearman’s ρ = 0.8038, p < 0.001), but also outperformed all existing clutter perception models and even a behavioral object segmentation ground truth. We conclude that the number of proto-objects in an image affects clutter perception more than the number of objects or features. 1</p><p>5 0.62886125 <a title="119-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Higher_Order_Priors_for_Joint_Intrinsic_Image%2C_Objects%2C_and_Attributes_Estimation.html">138 nips-2013-Higher Order Priors for Joint Intrinsic Image, Objects, and Attributes Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Vibhav Vineet, Carsten Rother, Philip Torr</p><p>Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to solve the problems of recovering intrinsic scene properties such as shape, reﬂectance and illumination from a single image, and object class segmentation separately. While these two problems are mutually informative, in the past not many papers have addressed this topic. In this work we explore such joint estimation of intrinsic scene properties recovered from an image, together with the estimation of the objects and attributes present in the scene. In this way, our uniﬁed framework is able to capture the correlations between intrinsic properties (reﬂectance, shape, illumination), objects (table, tv-monitor), and materials (wooden, plastic) in a given scene. For example, our model is able to enforce the condition that if a set of pixels take same object label, e.g. table, most likely those pixels would receive similar reﬂectance values. We cast the problem in an energy minimization framework and demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative improvement in the overall accuracy on the NYU and Pascal datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.61611474 <a title="119-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Mid-level_Visual_Element_Discovery_as_Discriminative_Mode_Seeking.html">190 nips-2013-Mid-level Visual Element Discovery as Discriminative Mode Seeking</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanshuai Cao, Marcus A. Brubaker, David Fleet, Aaron Hertzmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-ofart performance in discrete cases and competitive results in the continuous case. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80821627 <a title="119-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Fast_Template_Evaluation_with_Vector_Quantization.html">119 nips-2013-Fast Template Evaluation with Vector Quantization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Amin Sadeghi, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Applying linear templates is an integral part of many object detection systems and accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of computation time. We describe a method that achieves a substantial end-to-end speedup over the best current methods, without loss of accuracy. Our method is a combination of approximating scores by vector quantizing feature windows and a number of speedup techniques including cascade. Our procedure allows speed and accuracy to be traded off in two ways: by choosing the number of Vector Quantization levels, and by choosing to rescore windows or not. Our method can be directly plugged into any recognition system that relies on linear templates. We demonstrate our method to speed up the original Exemplar SVM detector [1] by an order of magnitude and Deformable Part models [2] by two orders of magnitude with no loss of accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.7526409 <a title="119-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>
<p>Author: Wojciech Zaremba, Arthur Gretton, Matthew Blaschko</p><p>Abstract: A family of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) kernel two-sample tests is introduced. Members of the test family are called Block-tests or B-tests, since the test statistic is an average over MMDs computed on subsets of the samples. The choice of block size allows control over the tradeoff between test power and computation time. In this respect, the B-test family combines favorable properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more powerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet they are more computationally efﬁcient than a quadratic time test where a single large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a U-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their asymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the U-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which estimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding. Recent results on kernel selection for hypothesis testing transfer seamlessly to the B-tests, yielding a means to optimize test power via kernel choice. 1</p><p>4 0.74974322 <a title="119-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Prices_for_Repeated_Auctions_with_Strategic_Buyers.html">159 nips-2013-Learning Prices for Repeated Auctions with Strategic Buyers</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Amin, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Umar Syed</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by real-time ad exchanges for online display advertising, we consider the problem of inferring a buyer’s value distribution for a good when the buyer is repeatedly interacting with a seller through a posted-price mechanism. We model the buyer as a strategic agent, whose goal is to maximize her long-term surplus, and we are interested in mechanisms that maximize the seller’s long-term revenue. We deﬁne the natural notion of strategic regret — the lost revenue as measured against a truthful (non-strategic) buyer. We present seller algorithms that are no(strategic)-regret when the buyer discounts her future surplus — i.e. the buyer prefers showing advertisements to users sooner rather than later. We also give a lower bound on strategic regret that increases as the buyer’s discounting weakens and shows, in particular, that any seller algorithm will suffer linear strategic regret if there is no discounting. 1</p><p>5 0.70747614 <a title="119-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Task_Bayesian_Optimization.html">201 nips-2013-Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Swersky, Jasper Snoek, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization has recently been proposed as a framework for automatically tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models and has been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance with impressive ease and efﬁciency. In this paper, we explore whether it is possible to transfer the knowledge gained from previous optimizations to new tasks in order to ﬁnd optimal hyperparameter settings more efﬁciently. Our approach is based on extending multi-task Gaussian processes to the framework of Bayesian optimization. We show that this method signiﬁcantly speeds up the optimization process when compared to the standard single-task approach. We further propose a straightforward extension of our algorithm in order to jointly minimize the average error across multiple tasks and demonstrate how this can be used to greatly speed up k-fold cross-validation. Lastly, we propose an adaptation of a recently developed acquisition function, entropy search, to the cost-sensitive, multi-task setting. We demonstrate the utility of this new acquisition function by leveraging a small dataset to explore hyperparameter settings for a large dataset. Our algorithm dynamically chooses which dataset to query in order to yield the most information per unit cost. 1</p><p>6 0.70707524 <a title="119-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Reward_Mapping_for_Transfer_in_Long-Lived_Agents.html">278 nips-2013-Reward Mapping for Transfer in Long-Lived Agents</a></p>

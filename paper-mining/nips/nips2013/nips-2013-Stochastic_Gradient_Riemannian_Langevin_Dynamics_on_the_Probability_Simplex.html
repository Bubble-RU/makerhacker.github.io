<p>Author: Miaomiao Zhang, P.T. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: Principal geodesic analysis (PGA) is a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of data on a Riemannian manifold. Currently PGA is deﬁned as a geometric ﬁt to the data, rather than as a probabilistic model. Inspired by probabilistic PCA, we present a latent variable model for PGA that provides a probabilistic framework for factor analysis on manifolds. To compute maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in our model, we develop a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm, where the expectation is approximated by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the latent variables. We demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the ground truth parameters in simulated sphere data, as well as its effectiveness in analyzing shape variability of a corpus callosum data set from human brain images. 1</p><p>3 0.10716283 <a title="312-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Streaming_Variational_Bayes.html">317 nips-2013-Streaming Variational Bayes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason Chang, John W. Fisher III</p><p>Abstract: We present an MCMC sampler for Dirichlet process mixture models that can be parallelized to achieve signiﬁcant computational gains. We combine a nonergodic, restricted Gibbs iteration with split/merge proposals in a manner that produces an ergodic Markov chain. Each cluster is augmented with two subclusters to construct likely split moves. Unlike some previous parallel samplers, the proposed sampler enforces the correct stationary distribution of the Markov chain without the need for ﬁnite approximations. Empirical results illustrate that the new sampler exhibits better convergence properties than current methods. 1</p><p>5 0.095200188 <a title="312-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Nonparametric_Mixture_Models_via_Sequential_Variational_Approximation.html">229 nips-2013-Online Learning of Nonparametric Mixture Models via Sequential Variational Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dahua Lin</p><p>Abstract: Reliance on computationally expensive algorithms for inference has been limiting the use of Bayesian nonparametric models in large scale applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian learning algorithm for DP mixture models. Instead of following the conventional paradigm – random initialization plus iterative update, we take an progressive approach. Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the ﬂy when needed. The algorithm can reliably estimate a DP mixture model in one pass, making it particularly suited for applications with massive data. Experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate remarkable improvement on efﬁciency – orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>6 0.089973748 <a title="312-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_Inference_for_Logistic-Normal_Topic_Models.html">287 nips-2013-Scalable Inference for Logistic-Normal Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianfei Chen, June Zhu, Zi Wang, Xun Zheng, Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Logistic-normal topic models can effectively discover correlation structures among latent topics. However, their inference remains a challenge because of the non-conjugacy between the logistic-normal prior and multinomial topic mixing proportions. Existing algorithms either make restricting mean-ﬁeld assumptions or are not scalable to large-scale applications. This paper presents a partially collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm that approaches the provably correct distribution by exploring the ideas of data augmentation. To improve time efﬁciency, we further present a parallel implementation that can deal with large-scale applications and learn the correlation structures of thousands of topics from millions of documents. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the promise. 1</p><p>3 0.74746966 <a title="312-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Streaming_Variational_Bayes.html">317 nips-2013-Streaming Variational Bayes</a></p>

<p>Author: Chong Wang, Xi Chen, Alex Smola, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is a class of widely used algorithms for training machine learning models. To optimize an objective, it uses the noisy gradient computed from the random data samples instead of the true gradient computed from the entire dataset. However, when the variance of the noisy gradient is large, the algorithm might spend much time bouncing around, leading to slower convergence and worse performance. In this paper, we develop a general approach of using control variate for variance reduction in stochastic gradient. Data statistics such as low-order moments (pre-computed or estimated online) is used to form the control variate. We demonstrate how to construct the control variate for two practical problems using stochastic gradient optimization. One is convex—the MAP estimation for logistic regression, and the other is non-convex—stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation. On both problems, our approach shows faster convergence and better performance than the classical approach. 1</p><p>5 0.64407021 <a title="312-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Additive_Text_Models_with_Low_Rank_Background.html">301 nips-2013-Sparse Additive Text Models with Low Rank Background</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>6 0.63341761 <a title="312-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Lexical_and_Hierarchical_Topic_Regression.html">174 nips-2013-Lexical and Hierarchical Topic Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Aaron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative ﬁltering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks signiﬁcantly outperforming the traditional approach. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68292892 <a title="312-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Gradient_Riemannian_Langevin_Dynamics_on_the_Probability_Simplex.html">312 nips-2013-Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics on the Probability Simplex</a></p>

<p>Author: Aijun Bai, Feng Wu, Xiaoping Chen</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been drawing great interest in recent years for planning and learning under uncertainty. One of the key challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this, we present a novel approach for MCTS using Bayesian mixture modeling and inference based Thompson sampling and apply it to the problem of online planning in MDPs. Our algorithm, named Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS), models the uncertainty of the accumulated reward for actions in the search tree as a mixture of Normal distributions. We perform inferences on the mixture in Bayesian settings by choosing conjugate priors in the form of combinations of Dirichlet and NormalGamma distributions and select the best action at each decision node using Thompson sampling. Experimental results conﬁrm that our algorithm advances the state-of-the-art UCT approach with better values on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>4 0.63886374 <a title="312-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Manifold-based_Similarity_Adaptation_for_Label_Propagation.html">182 nips-2013-Manifold-based Similarity Adaptation for Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Masayuki Karasuyama, Hiroshi Mamitsuka</p><p>Abstract: Label propagation is one of the state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised learning, which estimates labels by propagating label information through a graph. Label propagation assumes that data points (nodes) connected in a graph should have similar labels. Consequently, the label estimation heavily depends on edge weights in a graph which represent similarity of each node pair. We propose a method for a graph to capture the manifold structure of input features using edge weights parameterized by a similarity function. In this approach, edge weights represent both similarity and local reconstruction weight simultaneously, both being reasonable for label propagation. For further justiﬁcation, we provide analytical considerations including an interpretation as a cross-validation of a propagation model in the feature space, and an error analysis based on a low dimensional manifold model. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach both in synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.63744318 <a title="312-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Reservoir_Boosting_%3A_Between_Online_and_Offline_Ensemble_Learning.html">275 nips-2013-Reservoir Boosting : Between Online and Offline Ensemble Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, François Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: We propose to train an ensemble with the help of a reservoir in which the learning algorithm can store a limited number of samples. This novel approach lies in the area between ofﬂine and online ensemble approaches and can be seen either as a restriction of the former or an enhancement of the latter. We identify some basic strategies that can be used to populate this reservoir and present our main contribution, dubbed Greedy Edge Expectation Maximization (GEEM), that maintains the reservoir content in the case of Boosting by viewing the samples through their projections into the weak classiﬁer response space. We propose an efﬁcient algorithmic implementation which makes it tractable in practice, and demonstrate its efﬁciency experimentally on several compute-vision data-sets, on which it outperforms both online and ofﬂine methods in a memory constrained setting. 1</p><p>6 0.5685721 <a title="312-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Robust_PCA_via_Stochastic_Optimization.html">233 nips-2013-Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></p>

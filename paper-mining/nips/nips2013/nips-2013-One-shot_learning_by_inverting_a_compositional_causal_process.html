<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Joshua T. Abbott, Joseph Austerweil, Thomas Griffiths, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Learning a visual concept from a small number of positive examples is a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Current methods typically fail to ﬁnd the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classiﬁers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a signiﬁcant advantage results from combining visual classiﬁers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization. 1</p><p>3 0.11017495 <a title="226-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Bayesian_Image_Interpretation_using_Generative_Probabilistic_Graphics_Programs.html">37 nips-2013-Approximate Bayesian Image Interpretation using Generative Probabilistic Graphics Programs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vikash Mansinghka, Tejas D. Kulkarni, Yura N. Perov, Josh Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: The idea of computer vision as the Bayesian inverse problem to computer graphics has a long history and an appealing elegance, but it has proved difﬁcult to directly implement. Instead, most vision tasks are approached via complex bottom-up processing pipelines. Here we show that it is possible to write short, simple probabilistic graphics programs that deﬁne ﬂexible generative models and to automatically invert them to interpret real-world images. Generative probabilistic graphics programs (GPGP) consist of a stochastic scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood model linking the renderer’s output and the data, and latent variables that adjust the ﬁdelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood. Representations and algorithms from computer graphics are used as the deterministic backbone for highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian computation, and depends only on generalpurpose, automatic inference techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and adversarially obscured characters, and inferring 3D road models from vehicle-mounted camera images. Each of the probabilistic graphics programs we present relies on under 20 lines of probabilistic code, and yields accurate, approximately Bayesian inferences about real-world images. 1</p><p>4 0.10147783 <a title="226-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Zero-Shot_Learning_Through_Cross-Modal_Transfer.html">356 nips-2013-Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Milind Ganjoo, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually deﬁned semantic or visual features for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty detection strategies; the ﬁrst gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes’ accuracy high. 1</p><p>5 0.095229268 <a title="226-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Prediction_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">200 nips-2013-Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machine (MP-DBM). The MPDBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classiﬁcation tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classiﬁcation, classiﬁcation with missing inputs, and mean ﬁeld prediction tasks.1 1</p><p>6 0.093663439 <a title="226-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Qianli Liao, Joel Z. Leibo, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: One approach to computer object recognition and modeling the brain’s ventral stream involves unsupervised learning of representations that are invariant to common transformations. However, applications of these ideas have usually been limited to 2D afﬁne transformations, e.g., translation and scaling, since they are easiest to solve via convolution. In accord with a recent theory of transformationinvariance [1], we propose a model that, while capturing other common convolutional networks as special cases, can also be used with arbitrary identitypreserving transformations. The model’s wiring can be learned from videos of transforming objects—or any other grouping of images into sets by their depicted object. Through a series of successively more complex empirical tests, we study the invariance/discriminability properties of this model with respect to different transformations. First, we empirically conﬁrm theoretical predictions (from [1]) for the case of 2D afﬁne transformations. Next, we apply the model to non-afﬁne transformations; as expected, it performs well on face veriﬁcation tasks requiring invariance to the relatively smooth transformations of 3D rotation-in-depth and changes in illumination direction. Surprisingly, it can also tolerate clutter “transformations” which map an image of a face on one background to an image of the same face on a different background. Motivated by these empirical ﬁndings, we tested the same model on face veriﬁcation benchmark tasks from the computer vision literature: Labeled Faces in the Wild, PubFig [2, 3, 4] and a new dataset we gathered—achieving strong performance in these highly unconstrained cases as well. 1</p><p>5 0.68919599 <a title="226-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Modeling_Clutter_Perception_using_Parametric_Proto-object_Partitioning.html">195 nips-2013-Modeling Clutter Perception using Parametric Proto-object Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen-Ping Yu, Wen-Yu Hua, Dimitris Samaras, Greg Zelinsky</p><p>Abstract: Visual clutter, the perception of an image as being crowded and disordered, affects aspects of our lives ranging from object detection to aesthetics, yet relatively little effort has been made to model this important and ubiquitous percept. Our approach models clutter as the number of proto-objects segmented from an image, with proto-objects deﬁned as groupings of superpixels that are similar in intensity, color, and gradient orientation features. We introduce a novel parametric method of clustering superpixels by modeling mixture of Weibulls on Earth Mover’s Distance statistics, then taking the normalized number of proto-objects following partitioning as our estimate of clutter perception. We validated this model using a new 90-image dataset of real world scenes rank ordered by human raters for clutter, and showed that our method not only predicted clutter extremely well (Spearman’s ρ = 0.8038, p < 0.001), but also outperformed all existing clutter perception models and even a behavioral object segmentation ground truth. We conclude that the number of proto-objects in an image affects clutter perception more than the number of objects or features. 1</p><p>6 0.67833817 <a title="226-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Non-Uniform_Camera_Shake_Removal_Using_a_Spatially-Adaptive_Sparse_Penalty.html">212 nips-2013-Non-Uniform Camera Shake Removal Using a Spatially-Adaptive Sparse Penalty</a></p>

<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of tracking the trajectory of a moving object in a video with possibly very complex background. In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Speciﬁcally, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked denoising autoencoder ofﬂine to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from ofﬂine training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classiﬁcation neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classiﬁcation layer. Both the feature extractor and the classiﬁer can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU). 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91277117 <a title="226-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-One-shot_learning_by_inverting_a_compositional_causal_process.html">226 nips-2013-One-shot learning by inverting a compositional causal process</a></p>
<p>Author: Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Josh Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: People can learn a new visual class from just one example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds or thousands of examples to tackle the same problems. Here we present a Hierarchical Bayesian model based on compositionality and causality that can learn a wide range of natural (although simple) visual concepts, generalizing in human-like ways from just one image. We evaluated performance on a challenging one-shot classiﬁcation task, where our model achieved a human-level error rate while substantially outperforming two deep learning models. We also tested the model on another conceptual task, generating new examples, by using a “visual Turing test” to show that our model produces human-like performance. 1</p><p>3 0.89029801 <a title="226-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_the_Unseen%3A_Improved_Estimators_for_Entropy_and_other_Properties.html">110 nips-2013-Estimating the Unseen: Improved Estimators for Entropy and other Properties</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Valiant, Gregory Valiant</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Valiant and Valiant [1, 2] showed that a class of distributional properties, which includes such practically relevant properties as entropy, the number of distinct elements, and distance metrics between pairs of distributions, can be estimated given a sublinear sized sample. Speciﬁcally, given a sample consisting of independent draws from any distribution over at most n distinct elements, these properties can be estimated accurately using a sample of size O(n/ log n). We propose a novel modiﬁcation of this approach and show: 1) theoretically, this estimator is optimal (to constant factors, over worst-case instances), and 2) in practice, it performs exceptionally well for a variety of estimation tasks, on a variety of natural distributions, for a wide range of parameters. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the key step in our approach is to ﬁrst use the sample to characterize the “unseen” portion of the distribution. This goes beyond such tools as the Good-Turing frequency estimation scheme, which estimates the total probability mass of the unobserved portion of the distribution: we seek to estimate the shape of the unobserved portion of the distribution. This approach is robust, general, and theoretically principled; we expect that it may be fruitfully used as a component within larger machine learning and data analysis systems. 1</p><p>4 0.87974072 <a title="226-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Prediction_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">200 nips-2013-Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machine (MP-DBM). The MPDBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classiﬁcation tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classiﬁcation, classiﬁcation with missing inputs, and mean ﬁeld prediction tasks.1 1</p><p>5 0.8778559 <a title="226-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification.html">83 nips-2013-Deep Fisher Networks for Large-Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: As massively parallel computations have become broadly available with modern GPUs, deep architectures trained on very large datasets have risen in popularity. Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classiﬁcation benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper, we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the stateof-the-art Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture signiﬁcantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted image classiﬁcation pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination further improves the accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.87689042 <a title="226-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a n ⇥ n matrix of rank r from merely ⌦(nr3/2 log(r)) matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order T tensor using ⌦(nrT 1/2 T 2 log(r)) entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using ⌦(nr3/2 polylog(n)) entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.11963562 <a title="307-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_Completion_From_any_Given_Set_of_Observations.html">185 nips-2013-Matrix Completion From any Given Set of Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Troy Lee, Adi Shraibman</p><p>Abstract: In the matrix completion problem the aim is to recover an unknown real matrix from a subset of its entries. This problem comes up in many application areas, and has received a great deal of attention in the context of the netﬂix prize. A central approach to this problem is to output a matrix of lowest possible complexity (e.g. rank or trace norm) that agrees with the partially speciﬁed matrix. The performance of this approach under the assumption that the revealed entries are sampled randomly has received considerable attention (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). In practice, often the set of revealed entries is not chosen at random and these results do not apply. We are therefore left with no guarantees on the performance of the algorithm we are using. We present a means to obtain performance guarantees with respect to any set of initial observations. The ﬁrst step remains the same: ﬁnd a matrix of lowest possible complexity that agrees with the partially speciﬁed matrix. We give a new way to interpret the output of this algorithm by next ﬁnding a probability distribution over the non-revealed entries with respect to which a bound on the generalization error can be proven. The more complex the set of revealed entries according to a certain measure, the better the bound on the generalization error. 1</p><p>4 0.10578556 <a title="307-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>5 0.098132528 <a title="307-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Kiraly, Louis Theran</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>6 0.090229221 <a title="307-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Exact_and_Stable_Recovery_of_Pairwise_Interaction_Tensors.html">113 nips-2013-Exact and Stable Recovery of Pairwise Interaction Tensors</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrien Todeschini, François Caron, Marie Chavent</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel class of algorithms for low rank matrix completion. Our approach builds on novel penalty functions on the singular values of the low rank matrix. By exploiting a mixture model representation of this penalty, we show that a suitably chosen set of latent variables enables to derive an ExpectationMaximization algorithm to obtain a Maximum A Posteriori estimate of the completed low rank matrix. The resulting algorithm is an iterative soft-thresholded algorithm which iteratively adapts the shrinkage coefﬁcients associated to the singular values. The algorithm is simple to implement and can scale to large matrices. We provide numerical comparisons between our approach and recent alternatives showing the interest of the proposed approach for low rank matrix completion. 1</p><p>4 0.76006132 <a title="307-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_Finite_State_Transducers.html">342 nips-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Bailly, Xavier Carreras, Ariadna Quattoni</p><p>Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FST) are a standard tool for modeling paired inputoutput sequences and are used in numerous applications, ranging from computational biology to natural language processing. Recently Balle et al. [4] presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as ﬁnding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identiﬁability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efﬁciently. 1</p><p>5 0.73380899 <a title="307-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-Optimal_Entrywise_Sampling_for_Data_Matrices.html">206 nips-2013-Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling for Data Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitris Achlioptas, Zohar S. Karnin, Edo Liberty</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting non-zero entries of a matrix A in order to produce a sparse sketch of it, B, that minimizes A B 2 . For large m n matrices, such that n m (for example, representing n observations over m attributes) we give sampling distributions that exhibit four important properties. First, they have closed forms computable from minimal information regarding A. Second, they allow sketching of matrices whose non-zeros are presented to the algorithm in arbitrary order as a stream, with O 1 computation per non-zero. Third, the resulting sketch matrices are not only sparse, but their non-zero entries are highly compressible. Lastly, and most importantly, under mild assumptions, our distributions are provably competitive with the optimal ofﬂine distribution. Note that the probabilities in the optimal ofﬂine distribution may be complex functions of all the entries in the matrix. Therefore, regardless of computational complexity, the optimal distribution might be impossible to compute in the streaming model. 1</p><p>6 0.69100487 <a title="307-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Dino Sejdinovic, Arthur Gretton, Wicher Bergsma</p><p>Abstract: We introduce kernel nonparametric tests for Lancaster three-variable interaction and for total independence, using embeddings of signed measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The resulting test statistics are straightforward to compute, and are used in powerful interaction tests, which are consistent against all alternatives for a large family of reproducing kernels. We show the Lancaster test to be sensitive to cases where two independent causes individually have weak inﬂuence on a third dependent variable, but their combined effect has a strong inﬂuence.

We assume that only a small subset of covariates is ‘active’ (i.e., the corresponding coefﬁcients are non-zero), and consider the model-selection problem of identifying the active covariates. A popular approach is to estimate the regression coefﬁcients through the Lasso ( 1 -regularized least squares). This is known to correctly identify the active set only if the irrelevant covariates are roughly orthogonal to the relevant ones, as quantiﬁed through the so called ‘irrepresentability’ condition. In this paper we study the ‘Gauss-Lasso’ selector, a simple two-stage method that ﬁrst solves the Lasso, and then performs ordinary least squares restricted to the Lasso active set. We formulate ‘generalized irrepresentability condition’ (GIC), an assumption that is substantially weaker than irrepresentability. We prove that, under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso correctly recovers the active set. 1</p><p>4 0.72082686 <a title="307-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lijun Zhang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that the optimal convergence rate for stochastic optimization of √ smooth functions is O(1/ T ), which is same as stochastic optimization of Lipschitz continuous convex functions. This is in contrast to optimizing smooth functions using full gradients, which yields a convergence rate of O(1/T 2 ). In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as Mixed Optimization, which allows to access both a stochastic oracle and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to signiﬁcantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle. We show that, with an O(ln T ) calls to the full gradient oracle and an O(T ) calls to the stochastic oracle, the proposed mixed optimization algorithm is able to achieve an optimization error of O(1/T ). 1</p><p>5 0.68793654 <a title="307-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Fantope_Projection_and_Selection%3A_A_near-optimal_convex_relaxation_of_sparse_PCA.html">116 nips-2013-Fantope Projection and Selection: A near-optimal convex relaxation of sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Q. Vu, Juhee Cho, Jing Lei, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The convex problem can be solved efﬁciently using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings. We demonstrate this with an application to Kendall’s tau correlation matrices and transelliptical component analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.68747443 <a title="307-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Estimation%2C_Optimization%2C_and_Parallelism_when_Data_is_Sparse.html">111 nips-2013-Estimation, Optimization, and Parallelism when Data is Sparse</a></p>

<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the development of efﬁcient algorithms for convex optimization problems in the simultaneous presence of multiple objectives and stochasticity in the ﬁrst-order information. We cast the stochastic multiple objective optimization problem into a constrained optimization problem by choosing one function as the objective and try to bound other objectives by appropriate thresholds. We ﬁrst examine a two stages exploration-exploitation based algorithm which ﬁrst approximates the stochastic objectives by sampling and then solves a constrained stochastic optimization problem by projected gradient method. This method attains a suboptimal convergence rate even under strong assumption on the objectives. Our second approach is an efﬁcient primal-dual stochastic algorithm. It leverages on the theory of Lagrangian method √ conin strained optimization and attains the optimal convergence rate of O(1/ T ) in high probability for general Lipschitz continuous objectives.</p><p>3 0.16002664 <a title="333-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Linear_Convergence_with_Condition_Number_Independent_Access_of_Full_Gradients.html">175 nips-2013-Linear Convergence with Condition Number Independent Access of Full Gradients</a></p>
<p>Author: Lijun Zhang, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: For smooth and strongly convex optimizations, the optimal iteration complexity of √ the gradient-based algorithm is O( κ log 1/ǫ), where κ is the condition number. In the case that the optimization problem is ill-conditioned, we need to evaluate a large number of full gradients, which could be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to remove the dependence on the condition number by allowing the algorithm to access stochastic gradients of the objective function. To this end, we present a novel algorithm named Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD) that is able to utilize two kinds of gradients. A distinctive step in EMGD is the mixed gradient descent, where we use a combination of the full and stochastic gradients to update the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis shows that EMGD is able to ﬁnd an ǫ-optimal solution by computing O(log 1/ǫ) full gradients and O(κ2 log 1/ǫ) stochastic gradients. 1</p><p>4 0.12641118 <a title="333-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lijun Zhang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that the optimal convergence rate for stochastic optimization of √ smooth functions is O(1/ T ), which is same as stochastic optimization of Lipschitz continuous convex functions. This is in contrast to optimizing smooth functions using full gradients, which yields a convergence rate of O(1/T 2 ). In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as Mixed Optimization, which allows to access both a stochastic oracle and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to signiﬁcantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle. We show that, with an O(ln T ) calls to the full gradient oracle and an O(T ) calls to the stochastic oracle, the proposed mixed optimization algorithm is able to achieve an optimization error of O(1/T ). 1</p><p>5 0.12275399 <a title="333-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Accelerated_Mini-Batch_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">19 nips-2013-Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>

This paper considers an extension of SDCA under the mini-batch setting that is often used in practice. Our main contribution is to introduce an accelerated mini-batch version of SDCA and prove a fast convergence rate for this method. We discuss an implementation of our method over a parallel computing system, and compare the results to both the vanilla stochastic dual coordinate ascent and to the accelerated deterministic gradient descent method of Nesterov [2007]. 1</p><p>6 0.11605756 <a title="333-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Accelerating_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_using_Predictive_Variance_Reduction.html">20 nips-2013-Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Rie Johnson, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is popular for large scale optimization but has slow convergence asymptotically due to the inherent variance. To remedy this problem, we introduce an explicit variance reduction method for stochastic gradient descent which we call stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG). For smooth and strongly convex functions, we prove that this method enjoys the same fast convergence rate as those of stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) and Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG). However, our analysis is signiﬁcantly simpler and more intuitive. Moreover, unlike SDCA or SAG, our method does not require the storage of gradients, and thus is more easily applicable to complex problems such as some structured prediction problems and neural network learning. 1</p><p>3 0.77146083 <a title="333-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: We study a new class of structured Schatten norms for tensors that includes two recently proposed norms (“overlapped” and “latent”) for convex-optimizationbased tensor decomposition. We analyze the performance of “latent” approach for tensor decomposition, which was empirically found to perform better than the “overlapped” approach in some settings. We show theoretically that this is indeed the case. In particular, when the unknown true tensor is low-rank in a speciﬁc unknown mode, this approach performs as well as knowing the mode with the smallest rank. Along the way, we show a novel duality result for structured Schatten norms, which is also interesting in the general context of structured sparsity. We conﬁrm through numerical simulations that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour of the mean squared error. 1</p><p>3 0.85118628 <a title="333-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Linear_Convergence_of_the_Proximal_Gradient_Method_for_Trace_Norm_Regularization.html">222 nips-2013-On the Linear Convergence of the Proximal Gradient Method for Trace Norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Hou, Zirui Zhou, Anthony Man-Cho So, Zhi-Quan Luo</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by various applications in machine learning, the problem of minimizing a convex smooth loss function with trace norm regularization has received much attention lately. Currently, a popular method for solving such problem is the proximal gradient method (PGM), which is known to have a sublinear rate of convergence. In this paper, we show that for a large class of loss functions, the convergence rate of the PGM is in fact linear. Our result is established without any strong convexity assumption on the loss function. A key ingredient in our proof is a new Lipschitzian error bound for the aforementioned trace norm–regularized problem, which may be of independent interest.</p><p>4 0.84824419 <a title="333-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Fantope_Projection_and_Selection%3A_A_near-optimal_convex_relaxation_of_sparse_PCA.html">116 nips-2013-Fantope Projection and Selection: A near-optimal convex relaxation of sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Q. Vu, Juhee Cho, Jing Lei, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The convex problem can be solved efﬁciently using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings. We demonstrate this with an application to Kendall’s tau correlation matrices and transelliptical component analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.84666413 <a title="333-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Estimation%2C_Optimization%2C_and_Parallelism_when_Data_is_Sparse.html">111 nips-2013-Estimation, Optimization, and Parallelism when Data is Sparse</a></p>
<p>Author: John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Brendan McMahan</p><p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization problems when the data is sparse, which is in a sense dual to current perspectives on high-dimensional statistical learning and optimization. We highlight both the difﬁculties—in terms of increased sample complexity that sparse data necessitates—and the potential beneﬁts, in terms of allowing parallelism and asynchrony in the design of algorithms. Concretely, we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for optimization and learning with sparse data, and we exhibit algorithms achieving these rates. We also show how leveraging sparsity leads to (still minimax optimal) parallel and asynchronous algorithms, providing experimental evidence complementing our theoretical results on several medium to large-scale learning tasks. 1 Introduction and problem setting In this paper, we investigate stochastic optimization problems in which the data is sparse. Formally, let {F (·; ξ), ξ ∈ Ξ} be a collection of real-valued convex functions, each of whose domains contains the convex set X ⊂ Rd . For a probability distribution P on Ξ, we consider the following optimization problem: minimize f (x) := E[F (x; ξ)] = x∈X F (x; ξ)dP (ξ). (1) Ξ By data sparsity, we mean the samples ξ are sparse: assuming that samples ξ lie in Rd , and deﬁning the support supp(x) of a vector x to the set of indices of its non-zero components, we assume supp F (x; ξ) ⊂ supp ξ. (2) The sparsity condition (2) means that F (x; ξ) does not “depend” on the values of xj for indices j such that ξj = 0.1 This type of data sparsity is prevalent in statistical optimization problems and machine learning applications; in spite of its prevalence, study of such problems has been limited. As a motivating example, consider a text classiﬁcation problem: data ξ ∈ Rd represents words appearing in a document, and we wish to minimize a logistic loss F (x; ξ) = log(1 + exp( ξ, x )) on the data (we encode the label implicitly with the sign of ξ). Such generalized linear models satisfy the sparsity condition (2), and while instances are of very high dimension, in any given instance, very few entries of ξ are non-zero [8]. From a modelling perspective, it thus makes sense to allow a dense predictor x: any non-zero entry of ξ is potentially relevant and important. In a sense, this is dual to the standard approaches to high-dimensional problems; one usually assumes that the data ξ may be dense, but there are only a few relevant features, and thus a parsimonious model x is desirous [2]. So 1 Formally, if πξ denotes the coordinate projection zeroing all indices j of its argument where ξj = 0, then F (πξ (x); ξ) = F (x; ξ) for all x, ξ. This follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions for convexity [6]. 1 while such sparse data problems are prevalent—natural language processing, information retrieval, and other large data settings all have signiﬁcant data sparsity—they do not appear to have attracted as much study as their high-dimensional “duals” of dense data and sparse predictors. In this paper, we investigate algorithms and their inherent limitations for solving problem (1) under natural conditions on the data generating distribution. Recent work in the optimization and machine learning communities has shown that data sparsity can be leveraged to develop parallel (and even asynchronous [12]) optimization algorithms [13, 14], but this work does not consider the statistical effects of data sparsity. In another line of research, Duchi et al. [4] and McMahan and Streeter [9] develop “adaptive” stochastic gradient algorithms to address problems in sparse data regimes (2). These algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance and have theoretical guarantees on their convergence, but it is not clear if they are optimal—in that no algorithm can attain better statistical performance—or whether they can leverage parallel computing as in the papers [12, 14]. In this paper, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the fundamental limits of optimization and learning algorithms in sparse data regimes. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the optimization error of any algorithm for problems of the form (1) with sparsity condition (2). These results have two main implications. They show that in some scenarios, learning with sparse data is quite difﬁcult, as essentially each coordinate j ∈ [d] can be relevant and must be optimized for. In spite of this seemingly negative result, we are also able to show that the A DAG RAD algorithms of [4, 9] are optimal, and we show examples in which their dependence on the dimension d can be made exponentially better than standard gradient methods. As the second facet of our two-pronged approach, we study how sparsity may be leveraged in parallel computing frameworks to give substantially faster algorithms that still achieve optimal sample complexity in terms of the number of samples ξ used. We develop two new algorithms, asynchronous dual averaging (A SYNC DA) and asynchronous A DAG RAD (A SYNC A DAG RAD), which allow asynchronous parallel solution of the problem (1) for general convex f and X . Combining insights of Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12] with a new analysis, we prove our algorithms achieve linear speedup in the number of processors while maintaining optimal statistical guarantees. We also give experiments on text-classiﬁcation and web-advertising tasks to illustrate the beneﬁts of the new algorithms. 2 Minimax rates for sparse optimization We begin our study of sparse optimization problems by establishing their fundamental statistical and optimization-theoretic properties. To do this, we derive bounds on the minimax convergence rate of any algorithm for such problems. Formally, let x denote any estimator for a minimizer of the objective (1). We deﬁne the optimality gap N for the estimator x based on N samples ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N from the distribution P as N (x, F, X , P ) := f (x) − inf f (x) = EP [F (x; ξ)] − inf EP [F (x; ξ)] . x∈X x∈X This quantity is a random variable, since x is a random variable (it is a function of ξ 1 , . . . , ξ N ). To deﬁne the minimax error, we thus take expectations of the quantity N , though we require a bit more than simply E[ N ]. We let P denote a collection of probability distributions, and we consider a collection of loss functions F speciﬁed by a collection F of convex losses F : X × ξ → R. We can then deﬁne the minimax error for the family of losses F and distributions P as ∗ N (X , P, F) := inf sup sup EP [ x P ∈P F ∈F N (x(ξ 1:N ), F, X , P )], (3) where the inﬁmum is taken over all possible estimators x (an estimator is an optimization scheme, or a measurable mapping x : ΞN → X ) . 2.1 Minimax lower bounds Let us now give a more precise characterization of the (natural) set of sparse optimization problems we consider to provide the lower bound. For the next proposition, we let P consist of distributions supported on Ξ = {−1, 0, 1}d , and we let pj := P (ξj = 0) be the marginal probability of appearance of feature j ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For our class of functions, we set F to consist of functions F satisfying the sparsity condition (2) and with the additional constraint that for g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), we have that the jth coordinate |gj | ≤ Mj for a constant Mj < ∞. We obtain 2 Proposition 1. Let the conditions of the preceding paragraph hold. Let R be a constant such that X ⊃ [−R, R]d . Then √ d pj 1 ∗ . Mj min pj , √ N (X , P, F) ≥ R 8 j=1 N log 3 We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the supplement A.1 in the full version of the paper, providing a few remarks here. We begin by giving a corollary to Proposition 1 that follows when the data ξ obeys a type of power law: let p0 ∈ [0, 1], and assume that P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α . We have Corollary 2. Let α ≥ 0. Let the conditions of Proposition 1 hold with Mj ≡ M for all j, and assume the power law condition P (ξj = 0) = p0 j −α on coordinate appearance probabilities. Then (1) If d > (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ 2−α 1−α p0 p0 (p0 N ) 2α − 1 + d1−α − (p0 N ) α N 1−α 2 MR 8 2−α (2) If d ≤ (p0 N )1/α , ∗ N (X , P, F) ≥ MR 8 p0 N α 1 1 d1− 2 − 1 − α/2 1 − α/2 . . Expanding Corollary 2 slightly, for simplicity assume the number of samples is large enough that d ≤ (p0 N )1/α . Then we ﬁnd that the lower bound on optimization error is of order p0 1− α p0 p0 d 2 when α < 2, M R log d when α → 2, and M R when α > 2. (4) N N N These results beg the question of tightness: are they improvable? As we see presently, they are not. MR 2.2 Algorithms for attaining the minimax rate To show that the lower bounds of Proposition 1 and its subsequent specializations are sharp, we review a few stochastic gradient algorithms. We begin with stochastic gradient descent (SGD): SGD repeatedly samples ξ ∼ P , computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then performs the update x ← ΠX (x − ηg), where η is a stepsize parameter and ΠX denotes Euclidean projection onto X . Standard analyses of stochastic gradient descent [10] show that after N samples ξ i , the SGD estimator x(N ) satisﬁes R2 M ( d j=1 1 pj ) 2 √ , (5) N where R2 denotes the 2 -radius of X . Dual averaging, due to Nesterov [11] (sometimes called “follow the regularized leader” [5]) is a more recent algorithm. In dual averaging, one again samples g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), but instead of updating the parameter vector x one updates a dual vector z by z ← z + g, then computes 1 x ← argmin z, x + ψ(x) , η x∈X E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) x∈X 2 1 where ψ(x) is a strongly convex function deﬁned over X (often one takes ψ(x) = 2 x 2 ). As we discuss presently, the dual averaging algorithm is somewhat more natural in asynchronous and parallel computing environments, and it enjoys the same type of convergence guarantees (5) as SGD. The A DAG RAD algorithm [4, 9] is an extension of the preceding stochastic gradient methods. It maintains a diagonal matrix S, where upon receiving a new sample ξ, A DAG RAD performs the following: it computes g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ), then updates 2 Sj ← Sj + gj for j ∈ [d]. The dual averaging variant of A DAG RAD updates the usual dual vector z ← z + g; the update to x is based on S and a stepsize η and computes x ← argmin z, x + x ∈X 3 1 1 x ,S2x 2η . After N samples ξ, the averaged parameter x(N ) returned by A DAG RAD satisﬁes R∞ M E[f (x(N ))] − inf f (x) ≤ O(1) √ x∈X N d √ pj , (6) j=1 where R∞ denotes the ∞ -radius of X (cf. [4, Section 1.3 and Theorem 5]). By inspection, the A DAG RAD rate (6) matches the lower bound in Proposition 1 and is thus optimal. It is interesting to note, though, that in the power law setting of Corollary 2 (recall the error order (4)), a calculation √ shows that the multiplier for the SGD guarantee (5) becomes R∞ d max{d(1−α)/2 , 1}, while A DA G RAD attains rate at worst R∞ max{d1−α/2 , log d}. For α > 1, the A DAG RAD rate is no worse, √ and for α ≥ 2, is more than d/ log d better—an exponential improvement in the dimension. 3 Parallel and asynchronous optimization with sparsity As we note in the introduction, recent works [12, 14] have suggested that sparsity can yield beneﬁts in our ability to parallelize stochastic gradient-type algorithms. Given the optimality of A DAG RADtype algorithms, it is natural to focus on their parallelization in the hope that we can leverage their ability to “adapt” to sparsity in the data. To provide the setting for our further algorithms, we ﬁrst revisit Niu et al.’s H OGWILD ! [12]. H OGWILD ! is an asynchronous (parallelized) stochastic gradient algorithm for optimization over product-space domains, meaning that X in problem (1) decomposes as X = X1 × · · · × Xd , where Xj ⊂ R. Fix a stepsize η > 0. A pool of independently running processors then performs the following updates asynchronously to a centralized vector x: 1. Sample ξ ∼ P 2. Read x and compute g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) 3. For each j s.t. gj = 0, update xj ← ΠXj (xj − ηgj ). Here ΠXj denotes projection onto the jth coordinate of the domain X . The key of H OGWILD ! is that in step 2, the parameter x is allowed to be inconsistent—it may have received partial gradient updates from many processors—and for appropriate problems, this inconsistency is negligible. Indeed, Niu et al. [12] show linear speedup in optimization time as the number of processors grow; they show this empirically in many scenarios, providing a proof under the somewhat restrictive assumptions that there is at most one non-zero entry in any gradient g and that f has Lipschitz gradients. 3.1 Asynchronous dual averaging A weakness of H OGWILD ! is that it appears only applicable to problems for which the domain X is a product space, and its analysis assumes g 0 = 1 for all gradients g. In effort to alleviate these difﬁculties, we now develop and present our asynchronous dual averaging algorithm, A SYNC DA. A SYNC DA maintains and upates a centralized dual vector z instead of a parameter x, and a pool of processors perform asynchronous updates to z, where each processor independently iterates: 1. Read z and compute x := argminx∈X 1 z, x + η ψ(x) // Implicitly increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂x F (x; ξ) // Let g(t) = g. 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update zj ← zj + gj . Because the actual computation of the vector x in A SYNC DA is performed locally on each processor in step 1 of the algorithm, the algorithm can be executed with any proximal function ψ and domain X . The only communication point between any of the processors is the addition operation in step 3. Since addition is commutative and associative, forcing all asynchrony to this point of the algorithm is a natural strategy for avoiding synchronization problems. In our analysis of A SYNC DA, and in our subsequent analysis of the adaptive methods, we require a measurement of time elapsed. With that in mind, we let t denote a time index that exists (roughly) behind-the-scenes. We let x(t) denote the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth step 1 of the A SYNC DA 4 algorithm, that is, whichever is the tth x actually computed by any of the processors. This quantity t exists and is recoverable from the algorithm, and it is possible to track the running sum τ =1 x(τ ). Additionally, we state two assumptions encapsulating the conditions underlying our analysis. Assumption A. There is an upper bound m on the delay of any processor. In addition, for each j ∈ [d] there is a constant pj ∈ [0, 1] such that P (ξj = 0) ≤ pj . We also require certain continuity (Lipschitzian) properties of the loss functions; these amount to a second moment constraint on the instantaneous ∂F and a rough measure of gradient sparsity. Assumption B. There exist constants M and (Mj )d such that the following bounds hold for all j=1 2 x ∈ X : E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ M2 and for each j ∈ [d] we have E[|∂xj F (x; ξ)|] ≤ pj Mj . With these deﬁnitions, we have the following theorem, which captures the convergence behavior of A SYNC DA under the assumption that X is a Cartesian product, meaning that X = X1 × · · · × Xd , 2 where Xj ⊂ R, and that ψ(x) = 1 x 2 . Note the algorithm itself can still be efﬁciently parallelized 2 for more general convex X , even if the theorem does not apply. Theorem 3. Let Assumptions A and B and the conditions in the preceding paragraph hold. Then T E t=1 F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) ≤ 1 x∗ 2η d 2 2 η 2 p2 Mj . + T M2 + ηT m j 2 j=1 We now provide a few remarks to explain and simplify the result. Under the more stringent condition 2 d 2 that |∂xj F (x; ξ)| ≤ Mj , Assumption A implies E[ ∂x F (x; ξ) 2 ] ≤ j=1 pj Mj . Thus, for the d 2 remainder of this section we take M2 = j=1 pj Mj , which upper bounds the Lipschitz continuity constant of the objective function f . We then obtain the following corollary. √ T 1 Corollary 4. Deﬁne x(T ) = T t=1 x(t), and set η = x∗ 2 /M T . Then E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ M x∗ √ T 2 +m x∗ 2 √ 2M T d 2 p2 M j . j j=1 Corollary 4 is nearly immediate: since ξ t is independent of x(t), we have E[F (x(t); ξ t ) | x(t)] = f (x(t)); applying Jensen’s inequality to f (x(T )) and performing an algebraic manipulation give the result. If the data is suitably sparse, meaning that pj ≤ 1/m, the bound in Corollary 4 simpliﬁes to 3 M x∗ √ E[f (x(T )) − f (x )] ≤ 2 T ∗ 2 3 = 2 d j=1 2 pj M j x ∗ √ T 2 , (7) which is the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent even in centralized settings (5). The √ convergence guarantee (7) shows that after T timesteps, the error scales as 1/ T ; however, if we have k processors, updates occur roughly k times as quickly, as they are asynchronous, and in time scaling as N/k, we can evaluate N gradient samples: a linear speedup. 3.2 Asynchronous AdaGrad We now turn to extending A DAG RAD to asynchronous settings, developing A SYNC A DAG RAD (asynchronous A DAG RAD). As in the A SYNC DA algorithm, A SYNC A DAG RAD maintains a shared dual vector z (the sum of gradients) and the shared matrix S, which is the diagonal sum of squares of gradient entries (recall Section 2.2). The matrix S is initialized as diag(δ 2 ), where δj ≥ 0 is an initial value. Each processor asynchronously performs the following iterations: 1 1 1. Read S and z and set G = S 2 . Compute x := argminx∈X { z, x + 2η x, Gx } increment “time” counter t and let x(t) = x, S(t) = S 2. Sample ξ ∼ P and let g ∈ ∂F (x; ξ) 2 3. For j ∈ [d] such that gj = 0, update Sj ← Sj + gj and zj ← zj + gj . 5 // Implicitly As in the description of A SYNC DA, we note that x(t) is the vector x ∈ X computed in the tth “step” of the algorithm (step 1), and similarly associate ξ t with x(t). To analyze A SYNC A DAG RAD, we make a somewhat stronger assumption on the sparsity properties of the losses F than Assumption B. 2 Assumption C. There exist constants (Mj )d such that E[(∂xj F (x; ξ))2 | ξj = 0] ≤ Mj for all j=1 x ∈ X. 2 Indeed, taking M2 = j pj Mj shows that Assumption C implies Assumption B with speciﬁc constants. We then have the following convergence result. Theorem 5. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 3, let Assumption C hold. Assume that for all 2 j we have δ 2 ≥ Mj m and X ⊂ [−R∞ , R∞ ]d . Then T t=1 E F (x(t); ξ t ) − F (x∗ ; ξ t ) d ≤ min j=1 T 1 2 R E η ∞ 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 T + ηE gj (t) t=1 2 1 2 (1 + pj m), Mj R∞ pj T . t=1 It is possible to relax the condition on the initial constant diagonal term; we defer this to the full version of the paper. It is natural to ask in which situations the bound provided by Theorem 5 is optimal. We note that, as in the case with Theorem 3, we may obtain a convergence rate for f (x(T )) − f (x∗ ) using convexity, T 1 where x(T ) = T t=1 x(t). By Jensen’s inequality, we have for any δ that T E 2 δ + gj (t) 2 1 2 t=1 T ≤ 2 2 E[gj (t) ] δ + t=1 1 2 ≤ 2 δ 2 + T pj Mj . For interpretation, let us now make a few assumptions on the probabilities pj . If we assume that pj ≤ c/m for a universal (numerical) constant c, then Theorem 5 guarantees that d log(T )/T + pj √ (8) , pj , T j=1 √ which is the convergence rate of A DAG RAD except for a small factor of min{ log T /T, pj } in addition to the usual pj /T rate. In particular, optimizing by choosing η = R∞ , and assuming 1 pj T log T , we have convergence guarantee √ d pj E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1)R∞ Mj min √ , pj , T j=1 E[f (x(T )) − f (x∗ )] ≤ O(1) 1 2 R +η η ∞ Mj min which is minimax optimal by Proposition 1. In fact, however, the bounds of Theorem 5 are somewhat stronger: they provide bounds using the expectation of the squared gradients gj (t) rather than the maximal value Mj , though the bounds are perhaps clearer in the form (8). We note also that our analysis applies to more adversarial settings than stochastic optimization (e.g., to online convex optimization [5]). Speciﬁcally, an adversary may choose an arbitrary sequence of functions subject to the random data sparsity constraint (2), and our results provide an expected regret bound, which is strictly stronger than the stochastic convergence guarantees provided (and guarantees high-probability convergence in stochastic settings [3]). Moreover, our comments in Section 2 about the relative optimality of A DAG RAD versus standard gradient methods apply. When the data is sparse, we indeed should use asynchronous algorithms, but using adaptive methods yields even more improvement than simple gradient-based methods. 4 Experiments In this section, we give experimental validation of our theoretical results on A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA, giving results on two datasets selected for their high-dimensional sparsity.2 2 In our experiments, A SYNC DA and H OGWILD ! had effectively identical performance. 6 8 0.07 6 5 4 0.024 Test error Training loss Speedup 0.025 0.065 7 0.06 0.055 0.05 0.045 0.04 0.023 0.022 0.021 0.02 0.035 3 0.019 2 1 2 4 0.03 A-A DAG RAD A SYNC DA Number of workers 6 8 10 12 14 0.018 0.025 0.02 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 0.017 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Number of workers 16 Figure 1.

The dataset in this case consists of an anonymized collection of URLs labeled as malicious (e.g., spam, phishing, etc.) or benign over a span of 120 days. The data in this case consists of 2.4 · 106 examples with dimension d = 3.2 · 106 (sparse) features. We perform several experiments, randomly dividing the dataset into 1.2 · 106 training and test samples for each experiment. In Figure 1 we compare the performance of A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA after doing after single pass through the training dataset. (For each algorithm, we choose the stepsize η for optimal training set performance.) We perform the experiments on a single machine running Ubuntu Linux with six cores (with two-way hyperthreading) and 32Gb of RAM. From the left-most plot in Fig. 1, we see that up to six processors, both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD enjoy the expected linear speedup, and from 6 to 12, they continue to enjoy a speedup that is linear in the number of processors though at a lesser slope (this is the effect of hyperthreading). For more than 12 processors, there is no further beneﬁt to parallelism on this machine. The two right plots in Figure 1 plot performance of the different methods (with standard errors) versus the number of worker threads used. Both are essentially ﬂat; increasing the amount of parallelism does nothing to the average training loss or the test error rate for either method. It is clear, however, that for this dataset, the adaptive A SYNC A DAG RAD algorithm provides substantial performance beneﬁts over A SYNC DA. 4.2 Click-through-rate prediction experiments We also experiment on a proprietary datasets consisting of search ad impressions. Each example corresponds to showing a search-engine user a particular text ad in response to a query string. From this, we construct a very sparse feature vector based on the text of the ad displayed and the query string (no user-speciﬁc data is used). The target label is 1 if the user clicked the ad and -1 otherwise. 7 (B) A-AdaGrad speedup (D) Impact of training data ordering 1.004 1.005 1.006 1.007 1.008 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1.000 1 2 A-DA base η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad base η = 0.023 0 1.005 relative stepsize (C) Optimal stepsize scaling relative log-loss 1.003 target relative log-loss 1.005 1.010 1.002 1.010 1.015 8 4 0 speedup A-DA η = 1.600 A-AdaGrad η = 0.016 1.001 1.000 relative log-loss 1.015 A-DA, L2=80 A-AdaGrad, L2=80 12 (A) Optimized stepsize for each number of passes 1 2 4 8 16 32 number of passes 64 128 256 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 number of passes Figure 3.

(B) Effective speedup for A SYNC A DAG RAD. (C) The best stepsize η, expressed as a scaling factor on the stepsize used for one pass. (D) Five runs with different random seeds for each algorithm (with 2 penalty 80). We ﬁt logistic regression models using both A SYNC DA and A SYNC A DAG RAD. We run extensive experiments on a moderate-sized dataset (about 107 examples, split between training and testing), which allows thorough investigation of the impact of the stepsize η, the number of training passes,3 and 2 -regularization on accuracy. For these experiments we used 32 threads on 16 core machines for each run, as A SYNC A DAG RAD and A SYNC DA achieve similar speedups from parallelization. On this dataset, A SYNC A DAG RAD typically achieves an effective additional speedup over A SYNC DA of 4× or more. That is, to reach a given level of accuracy, A SYNC DA generally needs four times as many effective passes over the dataset. We measure accuracy with log-loss (the logistic loss) averaged over ﬁve runs using different random seeds (which control the order in which the algorithms sample examples during training). We report relative values in Figures 2 and 3, that is, the ratio of the mean loss for the given datapoint to the lowest (best) mean loss obtained. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of relative log-loss as the metric of interest; we also considered AUC (the area under the ROC curve) and observed similar results. Figure 2 shows relative log-loss as a function of the number of training passes for various stepsizes. Without regularization, A SYNC A DAG RAD is prone to overﬁtting: it achieves signiﬁcantly higher accuracy on the training data (Fig. 2 (left)), but unless the stepsize is tuned carefully to the number of passes, it will overﬁt (Fig. 2 (middle)). Fortunately, the addition of 2 regularization largely solves this problem. Indeed, Figure 2 (right) shows that while adding an 2 penalty of 80 has very little impact on A SYNC DA, it effectively prevents the overﬁtting of A SYNC A DAG RAD.4 Fixing √ regularization multiplier to 80, we varied the stepsize η over a multiplicative grid with res2 olution 2 for each number of passes and for each algorithm. Figure 3 reports the results obtained by selecting the best stepsize in terms of test set log-loss for each number of passes. Figure 3(A) shows relative log-loss of the best stepsize for each algorithm; 3(B) shows the relative time A SYNC DA requires with respect to A SYNC A DAG RAD to achieve a given loss. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(B) shows the ratio of the number of passes the algorithms require to achieve a ﬁxed loss, which gives a broader estimate of the speedup obtained by using A SYNC A DAG RAD; speedups range from 3.6× to 12×. Figure 3(C) shows the optimal stepsizes as a function of the best setting for one pass. The optimal stepsize decreases moderately for A SYNC A DAG RAD, but are somewhat noisy for A SYNC DA. It is interesting to note that A SYNC A DAG RAD’s accuracy is largely independent of the ordering of the training data, while A SYNC DA shows signiﬁcant variability. This can be seen both in the error bars on Figure 3(A), and explicitly in Figure 3(D), where we plot one line for each of the ﬁve random seeds used. Thus, while on the one hand A SYNC DA requires somewhat less tuning of the stepsize and 2 parameter, tuning A SYNC A DAG RAD is much easier because of its predictable response. 3 Here “number of passes” more precisely means the expected number of times each example in the dataset is trained on. That is, each worker thread randomly selects a training example from the dataset for each update, and we continued making updates until (dataset size) × (number of passes) updates have been processed. 4 For both algorithms, this is accomplished by adding the term η80 x 2 to the ψ function. We can achieve 2 slightly better results for A SYNC A DAG RAD by varying the 2 penalty with the number of passes. 8 References [1] P. Auer and C. Gentile.

<p>Author: Qichao Que, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: q We address the problem of estimating the ratio p where p is a density function and q is another density, or, more generally an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration often referred to as importance sampling in statistical inference. It is also closely related to the problem of covariate shift in transfer learning. Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating the ratio as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel, known as the Fredholm problem of the ﬁrst kind. This formulation, combined with the techniques of regularization leads to a principled framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them theoretically. The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator) is ﬂexible, simple and easy to implement. We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel for densities deﬁned on Rd and smooth d-dimensional sub-manifolds of the Euclidean space. Model selection for unsupervised or semi-supervised inference is generally a difﬁcult problem. It turns out that in the density ratio estimation setting, when samples from both distributions are available, simple completely unsupervised model selection methods are available. We call this mechanism CD-CV for Cross-Density Cross-Validation. We show encouraging experimental results including applications to classiﬁcation within the covariate shift framework. 1</p><p>3 0.1590517 <a title="170-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Low_Rank_Kernel_Embeddings_of_Multivariate_Distributions.html">281 nips-2013-Robust Low Rank Kernel Embeddings of Multivariate Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Bo Dai</p><p>Abstract: Kernel embedding of distributions has led to many recent advances in machine learning. However, latent and low rank structures prevalent in real world distributions have rarely been taken into account in this setting. Furthermore, no prior work in kernel embedding literature has addressed the issue of robust embedding when the latent and low rank information are misspeciﬁed. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical low rank decomposition of kernels embeddings which can exploit such low rank structures in data while being robust to model misspeciﬁcation. We also illustrate with empirical evidence that the estimated low rank embeddings lead to improved performance in density estimation. 1</p><p>4 0.12916768 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_invariant_representations_and_applications_to_face_verification.html">166 nips-2013-Learning invariant representations and applications to face verification</a></p>
<p>Author: Qianli Liao, Joel Z. Leibo, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: One approach to computer object recognition and modeling the brain’s ventral stream involves unsupervised learning of representations that are invariant to common transformations. However, applications of these ideas have usually been limited to 2D afﬁne transformations, e.g., translation and scaling, since they are easiest to solve via convolution. In accord with a recent theory of transformationinvariance [1], we propose a model that, while capturing other common convolutional networks as special cases, can also be used with arbitrary identitypreserving transformations. The model’s wiring can be learned from videos of transforming objects—or any other grouping of images into sets by their depicted object. Through a series of successively more complex empirical tests, we study the invariance/discriminability properties of this model with respect to different transformations. First, we empirically conﬁrm theoretical predictions (from [1]) for the case of 2D afﬁne transformations. Next, we apply the model to non-afﬁne transformations; as expected, it performs well on face veriﬁcation tasks requiring invariance to the relatively smooth transformations of 3D rotation-in-depth and changes in illumination direction. Surprisingly, it can also tolerate clutter “transformations” which map an image of a face on one background to an image of the same face on a different background. Motivated by these empirical ﬁndings, we tested the same model on face veriﬁcation benchmark tasks from the computer vision literature: Labeled Faces in the Wild, PubFig [2, 3, 4] and a new dataset we gathered—achieving strong performance in these highly unconstrained cases as well. 1</p><p>5 0.12133891 <a title="170-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>6 0.11472073 <a title="170-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Process_Bandits.html">137 nips-2013-High-Dimensional Gaussian Process Bandits</a></p>

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Marius Kloft, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: We use the notion of local Rademacher complexity to design new algorithms for learning kernels. Our algorithms thereby beneﬁt from the sharper learning bounds based on that notion which, under certain general conditions, guarantee a faster convergence rate. We devise two new learning kernel algorithms: one based on a convex optimization problem for which we give an efﬁcient solution using existing learning kernel techniques, and another one that can be formulated as a DC-programming problem for which we describe a solution in detail. We also report the results of experiments with both algorithms in both binary and multi-class classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.77259767 <a title="170-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Statistical_analysis_of_coupled_time_series_with_Kernel_Cross-Spectral_Density_operators..html">310 nips-2013-Statistical analysis of coupled time series with Kernel Cross-Spectral Density operators.</a></p>
<p>Author: Michel Besserve, Nikos K. Logothetis, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Many applications require the analysis of complex interactions between time series. These interactions can be non-linear and involve vector valued as well as complex data structures such as graphs or strings. Here we provide a general framework for the statistical analysis of these dependencies when random variables are sampled from stationary time-series of arbitrary objects. To achieve this goal, we study the properties of the Kernel Cross-Spectral Density (KCSD) operator induced by positive deﬁnite kernels on arbitrary input domains. This framework enables us to develop an independence test between time series, as well as a similarity measure to compare different types of coupling. The performance of our test is compared to the HSIC test using i.i.d. assumptions, showing improvements in terms of detection errors, as well as the suitability of this approach for testing dependency in complex dynamical systems. This similarity measure enables us to identify different types of interactions in electrophysiological neural time series. 1</p><p>5 0.7416473 <a title="170-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Correlated_random_features_for_fast_semi-supervised_learning.html">76 nips-2013-Correlated random features for fast semi-supervised learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian McWilliams, David Balduzzi, Joachim Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents Correlated Nystr¨ m Views (XNV), a fast semi-supervised alo gorithm for regression and classiﬁcation. The algorithm draws on two main ideas. First, it generates two views consisting of computationally inexpensive random features. Second, multiview regression, using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on unlabeled data, biases the regression towards useful features. It has been shown that CCA regression can substantially reduce variance with a minimal increase in bias if the views contains accurate estimators. Recent theoretical and empirical work shows that regression with random features closely approximates kernel regression, implying that the accuracy requirement holds for random views. We show that XNV consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for semi-supervised learning: substantially improving predictive performance and reducing the variability of performance on a wide variety of real-world datasets, whilst also reducing runtime by orders of magnitude. 1</p><p>6 0.72843611 <a title="170-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>

<p>Author: Qichao Que, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: q We address the problem of estimating the ratio p where p is a density function and q is another density, or, more generally an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration often referred to as importance sampling in statistical inference. It is also closely related to the problem of covariate shift in transfer learning. Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating the ratio as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel, known as the Fredholm problem of the ﬁrst kind. This formulation, combined with the techniques of regularization leads to a principled framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them theoretically. The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator) is ﬂexible, simple and easy to implement. We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel for densities deﬁned on Rd and smooth d-dimensional sub-manifolds of the Euclidean space. Model selection for unsupervised or semi-supervised inference is generally a difﬁcult problem. It turns out that in the density ratio estimation setting, when samples from both distributions are available, simple completely unsupervised model selection methods are available. We call this mechanism CD-CV for Cross-Density Cross-Validation. We show encouraging experimental results including applications to classiﬁcation within the covariate shift framework. 1</p><p>3 0.87715328 <a title="170-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_the_Harmonic_Structure_in_Graph-Based_Learning.html">35 nips-2013-Analyzing the Harmonic Structure in Graph-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Ming Wu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: We ﬁnd that various well-known graph-based models exhibit a common important harmonic structure in its target function – the value of a vertex is approximately the weighted average of the values of its adjacent neighbors. Understanding of such structure and analysis of the loss deﬁned over such structure help reveal important properties of the target function over a graph. In this paper, we show that the variation of the target function across a cut can be upper and lower bounded by the ratio of its harmonic loss and the cut cost. We use this to develop an analytical tool and analyze ﬁve popular graph-based models: absorbing random walks, partially absorbing random walks, hitting times, pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian, and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. Our analysis sheds new insights into several open questions related to these models, and provides theoretical justiﬁcations and guidelines for their practical use. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets conﬁrm the potential of the proposed theory and tool.</p><p>4 0.87440675 <a title="170-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Chordal_Markov_Networks_by_Constraint_Satisfaction.html">151 nips-2013-Learning Chordal Markov Networks by Constraint Satisfaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jukka Corander, Tomi Janhunen, Jussi Rintanen, Henrik Nyman, Johan Pensar</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning the structure of a Markov network from data. It is shown that the structure of such networks can be described in terms of constraints which enables the use of existing solver technology with optimization capabilities to compute optimal networks starting from initial scores computed from the data. To achieve efﬁcient encodings, we develop a novel characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on the separators between cliques forming the network. The resulting translations into propositional satisﬁability and its extensions such as maximum satisﬁability, satisﬁability modulo theories, and answer set programming, enable us to prove optimal certain networks which have been previously found by stochastic search. 1</p><p>5 0.86277884 <a title="170-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Data-driven_Distributionally_Robust_Polynomial_Optimization.html">80 nips-2013-Data-driven Distributionally Robust Polynomial Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Mevissen, Emanuele Ragnoli, Jia Yuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust optimization for polynomial optimization problems where the uncertainty set is a set of candidate probability density functions. This set is a ball around a density function estimated from data samples, i.e., it is data-driven and random. Polynomial optimization problems are inherently hard due to nonconvex objectives and constraints. However, we show that by employing polynomial and histogram density estimates, we can introduce robustness with respect to distributional uncertainty sets without making the problem harder. We show that the optimum to the distributionally robust problem is the limit of a sequence of tractable semideﬁnite programming relaxations. We also give ﬁnite-sample consistency guarantees for the data-driven uncertainty sets. Finally, we apply our model and solution method in a water network optimization problem. 1</p><p>6 0.86045355 <a title="170-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Neural_representation_of_action_sequences%3A_how_far_can_a_simple_snippet-matching_model_take_us%3F.html">208 nips-2013-Neural representation of action sequences: how far can a simple snippet-matching model take us?</a></p>

<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: In the high-dimensional regression model a response variable is linearly related to p covariates, but the sample size n is smaller than p. We assume that only a small subset of covariates is ‘active’ (i.e., the corresponding coefﬁcients are non-zero), and consider the model-selection problem of identifying the active covariates. A popular approach is to estimate the regression coefﬁcients through the Lasso ( 1 -regularized least squares). This is known to correctly identify the active set only if the irrelevant covariates are roughly orthogonal to the relevant ones, as quantiﬁed through the so called ‘irrepresentability’ condition. In this paper we study the ‘Gauss-Lasso’ selector, a simple two-stage method that ﬁrst solves the Lasso, and then performs ordinary least squares restricted to the Lasso active set. We formulate ‘generalized irrepresentability condition’ (GIC), an assumption that is substantially weaker than irrepresentability. We prove that, under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso correctly recovers the active set. 1</p><p>3 0.26355329 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Murat A. Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector θ0 ∈ Rp from noisy linear observations y = Xθ0 + w ∈ Rn (p > n) and the popular estimation procedure of solving the 1 -penalized least squares objective known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). In this context, we develop new estimators for the 2 estimation risk θ − θ0 2 and the variance of the noise when distributions of θ0 and w are unknown. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein’s unbiased risk estimate [Ste81] and the recent results of [BM12a][BM12b] on the analysis of approximate message passing and the risk of LASSO. We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices X of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on a certain conjecture from statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the ﬁrst that provides an asymptotically consistent risk estimator for the LASSO solely based on data. In addition, we demonstrate through simulations that our variance estimation outperforms several existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>4 0.19477241 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-On_model_selection_consistency_of_penalized_M-estimators%3A_a_geometric_theory.html">219 nips-2013-On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Jonathan E. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: Penalized M-estimators are used in diverse areas of science and engineering to ﬁt high-dimensional models with some low-dimensional structure. Often, the penalties are geometrically decomposable, i.e. can be expressed as a sum of support functions over convex sets. We generalize the notion of irrepresentable to geometrically decomposable penalties and develop a general framework for establishing consistency and model selection consistency of M-estimators with such penalties. We then use this framework to derive results for some special cases of interest in bioinformatics and statistical learning. 1</p><p>5 0.16513491 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Dirty_Statistical_Models.html">91 nips-2013-Dirty Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We provide a uniﬁed framework for the high-dimensional analysis of “superposition-structured” or “dirty” statistical models: where the model parameters are a superposition of structurally constrained parameters. We allow for any number and types of structures, and any statistical model. We consider the general class of M -estimators that minimize the sum of any loss function, and an instance of what we call a “hybrid” regularization, that is the inﬁmal convolution of weighted regularization functions, one for each structural component. We provide corollaries showcasing our uniﬁed framework for varied statistical models such as linear regression, multiple regression and principal component analysis, over varied superposition structures. 1</p><p>6 0.16220529 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikhil Rao, Christopher Cox, Rob Nowak, Timothy T. Rogers</p><p>Abstract: Multitask learning can be effective when features useful in one task are also useful for other tasks, and the group lasso is a standard method for selecting a common subset of features. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of multitask learning, wherein (1) the available features can be organized into subsets according to a notion of similarity and (2) features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the features best suited for other tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks. Error bounds are derived for SOSlasso and its consistency is established for squared error loss. In particular, SOSlasso is motivated by multisubject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classiﬁed using brain voxels as features. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOSlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso. 1</p><p>6 0.72427636 <a title="68-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>

<p>Author: Divyanshu Vats, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately estimating a high-dimensional sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that standard computationally tractable sparse recovery algorithms, such as the Lasso, OMP, and their various extensions, perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. We develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until a desired loss function cannot be decreased any further. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. We prove that SWAP can easily be used as a wrapper around standard sparse recovery algorithms for improved performance. We theoretically quantify the statistical guarantees of SWAP and complement our analysis with numerical results on synthetic and real data.</p><p>3 0.91920173 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Murat A. Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector θ0 ∈ Rp from noisy linear observations y = Xθ0 + w ∈ Rn (p > n) and the popular estimation procedure of solving the 1 -penalized least squares objective known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). In this context, we develop new estimators for the 2 estimation risk θ − θ0 2 and the variance of the noise when distributions of θ0 and w are unknown. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein’s unbiased risk estimate [Ste81] and the recent results of [BM12a][BM12b] on the analysis of approximate message passing and the risk of LASSO. We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices X of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on a certain conjecture from statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the ﬁrst that provides an asymptotically consistent risk estimator for the LASSO solely based on data. In addition, we demonstrate through simulations that our variance estimation outperforms several existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.90044498 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Statistical_Models.html">68 nips-2013-Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: Fitting high-dimensional statistical models often requires the use of non-linear parameter estimation procedures. As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify the uncertainty associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical signiﬁcance as conﬁdence intervals or p-values. We consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose an efﬁcient algorithm for constructing conﬁdence intervals and p-values. The resulting conﬁdence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power. Our approach is based on constructing a ‘de-biased’ version of regularized Mestimators. The new construction improves over recent work in the ﬁeld in that it does not assume a special structure on the design matrix. Furthermore, proofs are remarkably simple. We test our method on a diabetes prediction problem. 1</p><p>5 0.89072847 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-On_model_selection_consistency_of_penalized_M-estimators%3A_a_geometric_theory.html">219 nips-2013-On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Jonathan E. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: Penalized M-estimators are used in diverse areas of science and engineering to ﬁt high-dimensional models with some low-dimensional structure. Often, the penalties are geometrically decomposable, i.e. can be expressed as a sum of support functions over convex sets. We generalize the notion of irrepresentable to geometrically decomposable penalties and develop a general framework for establishing consistency and model selection consistency of M-estimators with such penalties. We then use this framework to derive results for some special cases of interest in bioinformatics and statistical learning. 1</p><p>6 0.88589031 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition.html">194 nips-2013-Model Selection for High-Dimensional Regression under the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition</a></p>

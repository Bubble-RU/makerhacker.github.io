<p>Author: Nathaniel Korda, Emilie Kaufmann, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a ﬁnite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families. 1</p><p>3 0.13579904 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Active_Learning_for_Probabilistic_Hypotheses_Using_the_Maximum_Gibbs_Error_Criterion.html">23 nips-2013-Active Learning for Probabilistic Hypotheses Using the Maximum Gibbs Error Criterion</a></p>
<p>Author: Nguyen Viet Cuong, Wee Sun Lee, Nan Ye, Kian Ming A. Chai, Hai Leong Chieu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new objective function for pool-based Bayesian active learning with probabilistic hypotheses. This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classiﬁer drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classiﬁer selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a ﬁxed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random ﬁelds and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classiﬁcation task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models. 1</p><p>4 0.11708552 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-On_Poisson_Graphical_Models.html">217 nips-2013-On Poisson Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar, Genevera I. Allen, Zhandong Liu</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphical models, such as Gaussian graphical models, Ising, and multinomial/categorical graphical models, are widely used in a variety of applications for modeling distributions over a large number of variables. These standard instances, however, are ill-suited to modeling count data, which are increasingly ubiquitous in big-data settings such as genomic sequencing data, user-ratings data, spatial incidence data, climate studies, and site visits. Existing classes of Poisson graphical models, which arise as the joint distributions that correspond to Poisson distributed node-conditional distributions, have a major drawback: they can only model negative conditional dependencies for reasons of normalizability given its inﬁnite domain. In this paper, our objective is to modify the Poisson graphical model distribution so that it can capture a rich dependence structure between count-valued variables. We begin by discussing two strategies for truncating the Poisson distribution and show that only one of these leads to a valid joint distribution. While this model can accommodate a wider range of conditional dependencies, some limitations still remain. To address this, we investigate two additional novel variants of the Poisson distribution and their corresponding joint graphical model distributions. Our three novel approaches provide classes of Poisson-like graphical models that can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables. One can learn the graph structure of our models via penalized neighborhood selection, and we demonstrate the performance of our methods by learning simulated networks as well as a network from microRNA-sequencing data. 1</p><p>5 0.096154243 <a title="67-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Global_MAP-Optimality_by_Shrinking_the_Combinatorial_Search_Area_with_Convex_Relaxation.html">132 nips-2013-Global MAP-Optimality by Shrinking the Combinatorial Search Area with Convex Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Savchynskyy, Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Paul Swoboda, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: We consider energy minimization for undirected graphical models, also known as the MAP-inference problem for Markov random ﬁelds. Although combinatorial methods, which return a provably optimal integral solution of the problem, made a signiﬁcant progress in the past decade, they are still typically unable to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, large scale datasets are often deﬁned on sparse graphs and convex relaxation methods, such as linear programming relaxations then provide good approximations to integral solutions. We propose a novel method of combining combinatorial and convex programming techniques to obtain a global solution of the initial combinatorial problem. Based on the information obtained from the solution of the convex relaxation, our method conﬁnes application of the combinatorial solver to a small fraction of the initial graphical model, which allows to optimally solve much larger problems. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach on a computer vision energy minimization benchmark. 1</p><p>6 0.078390963 <a title="67-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Robust_learning_of_low-dimensional_dynamics_from_large_neural_ensembles.html">286 nips-2013-Robust learning of low-dimensional dynamics from large neural ensembles</a></p>

<p>Author: Liming Wang, David Carlson, Miguel Rodrigues, David Wilcox, Robert Calderbank, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: We consider design of linear projection measurements for a vector Poisson signal model. The projections are performed on the vector Poisson rate, X ∈ Rn , and the + observed data are a vector of counts, Y ∈ Zm . The projection matrix is designed + by maximizing mutual information between Y and X, I(Y ; X). When there is a latent class label C ∈ {1, . . . , L} associated with X, we consider the mutual information with respect to Y and C, I(Y ; C). New analytic expressions for the gradient of I(Y ; X) and I(Y ; C) are presented, with gradient performed with respect to the measurement matrix. Connections are made to the more widely studied Gaussian measurement model. Example results are presented for compressive topic modeling of a document corpora (word counting), and hyperspectral compressive sensing for chemical classiﬁcation (photon counting). 1</p><p>5 0.43167049 <a title="67-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Spectral_methods_for_neural_characterization_using_generalized_quadratic_models.html">305 nips-2013-Spectral methods for neural characterization using generalized quadratic models</a></p>
<p>Author: Il M. Park, Evan W. Archer, Nicholas Priebe, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We describe a set of fast, tractable methods for characterizing neural responses to high-dimensional sensory stimuli using a model we refer to as the generalized quadratic model (GQM). The GQM consists of a low-rank quadratic function followed by a point nonlinearity and exponential-family noise. The quadratic function characterizes the neuron’s stimulus selectivity in terms of a set linear receptive ﬁelds followed by a quadratic combination rule, and the invertible nonlinearity maps this output to the desired response range. Special cases of the GQM include the 2nd-order Volterra model [1, 2] and the elliptical Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson model [3]. Here we show that for “canonical form” GQMs, spectral decomposition of the ﬁrst two response-weighted moments yields approximate maximumlikelihood estimators via a quantity called the expected log-likelihood. The resulting theory generalizes moment-based estimators such as the spike-triggered covariance, and, in the Gaussian noise case, provides closed-form estimators under a large class of non-Gaussian stimulus distributions. We show that these estimators are fast and provide highly accurate estimates with far lower computational cost than full maximum likelihood. Moreover, the GQM provides a natural framework for combining multi-dimensional stimulus sensitivity and spike-history dependencies within a single model. We show applications to both analog and spiking data using intracellular recordings of V1 membrane potential and extracellular recordings of retinal spike trains. 1</p><p>6 0.43105838 <a title="67-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-On_Sampling_from_the_Gibbs_Distribution_with_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Perturbations.html">218 nips-2013-On Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution with Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations</a></p>

Popular instances of this class of models, such as categorical-discrete CRFs, Ising CRFs, and conditional Gaussian based CRFs, are not well suited to the varied types of response variables in many applications, including count-valued responses. We thus introduce a novel subclass of CRFs, derived by imposing node-wise conditional distributions of response variables conditioned on the rest of the responses and the covariates as arising from univariate exponential families. This allows us to derive novel multivariate CRFs given any univariate exponential distribution, including the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential distributions. Also in particular, it addresses the common CRF problem of specifying “feature” functions determining the interactions between response variables and covariates. We develop a class of tractable penalized M -estimators to learn these CRF distributions from data, as well as a uniﬁed sparsistency analysis for this general class of CRFs showing exact structure recovery can be achieved with high probability. 1</p><p>2 0.67723161 <a title="67-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Generalized_Denoising_Auto-Encoders_as_Generative_Models.html">127 nips-2013-Generalized Denoising Auto-Encoders as Generative Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Li Yao, Guillaume Alain, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying datagenerating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justiﬁcation which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-inﬁnitesimal corruption noise (or non-inﬁnitesimal contractive penalty). 1</p><p>3 0.67553759 <a title="67-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-On_Sampling_from_the_Gibbs_Distribution_with_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Perturbations.html">218 nips-2013-On Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution with Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efﬁciently from Gibbs distributions. Speciﬁcally, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs’ distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical “high signal high coupling” regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds. 1</p><p>4 0.67162132 <a title="67-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Embed_and_Project%3A_Discrete_Sampling_with_Universal_Hashing.html">107 nips-2013-Embed and Project: Discrete Sampling with Universal Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefano Ermon, Carla P. Gomes, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution deﬁned over a high-dimensional discrete set, speciﬁed for instance by a graphical model. We propose a sampling algorithm, called PAWS, based on embedding the set into a higher-dimensional space which is then randomly projected using universal hash functions to a lower-dimensional subspace and explored using combinatorial search methods. Our scheme can leverage fast combinatorial optimization tools as a blackbox and, unlike MCMC methods, samples produced are guaranteed to be within an (arbitrarily small) constant factor of the true probability distribution. We demonstrate that by using state-of-the-art combinatorial search tools, PAWS can efﬁciently sample from Ising grids with strong interactions and from software veriﬁcation instances, while MCMC and variational methods fail in both cases. 1</p><p>5 0.67132628 <a title="67-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Using_multiple_samples_to_learn_mixture_models.html">344 nips-2013-Using multiple samples to learn mixture models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Rich Caruana</p><p>Abstract: In the mixture models problem it is assumed that there are K distributions θ1 , . . . , θK and one gets to observe a sample from a mixture of these distributions with unknown coeﬃcients. The goal is to associate instances with their generating distributions, or to identify the parameters of the hidden distributions. In this work we make the assumption that we have access to several samples drawn from the same K underlying distributions, but with diﬀerent mixing weights. As with topic modeling, having multiple samples is often a reasonable assumption. Instead of pooling the data into one sample, we prove that it is possible to use the diﬀerences between the samples to better recover the underlying structure. We present algorithms that recover the underlying structure under milder assumptions than the current state of art when either the dimensionality or the separation is high. The methods, when applied to topic modeling, allow generalization to words not present in the training data. 1</p><p>6 0.67042875 <a title="67-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Estimation_of_Latently-grouped_Parameters_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">46 nips-2013-Bayesian Estimation of Latently-grouped Parameters in Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Ioannis Mitliagkas, Constantine Caramanis, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider streaming, one-pass principal component analysis (PCA), in the highdimensional regime, with limited memory. Here, p-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the k-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require O(p2 ) memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than O(kp) memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the spiked covariance model, where p-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, n, scales proportionally with the dimension, p. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity O(p2 ). Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity O(kp) do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to p. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses O(kp) memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the k-dimensional spike with O(p log p) samplecomplexity – the ﬁrst algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the spiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful on much more general models for the data. 1</p><p>3 0.15962541 <a title="314-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Transfer_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Rank_Constraints.html">285 nips-2013-Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), a well-established technique for data analysis and processing, provides a convenient form of dimensionality reduction that is effective for cleaning small Gaussian noises presented in the data. However, the applicability of standard principal component analysis in real scenarios is limited by its sensitivity to large errors. In this paper, we tackle the challenge problem of recovering data corrupted with errors of high magnitude by developing a novel robust transfer principal component analysis method. Our method is based on the assumption that useful information for the recovery of a corrupted data matrix can be gained from an uncorrupted related data matrix. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the data recovery problem as a joint robust principal component analysis problem on the two data matrices, with common principal components shared across matrices and individual principal components speciﬁc to each data matrix. The formulated optimization problem is a minimization problem over a convex objective function but with non-convex rank constraints. We develop an efﬁcient proximal projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem with convergence guarantees. Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA with rank constraints. 1</p><p>4 0.13317475 <a title="314-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Dirty_Statistical_Models.html">91 nips-2013-Dirty Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We provide a uniﬁed framework for the high-dimensional analysis of “superposition-structured” or “dirty” statistical models: where the model parameters are a superposition of structurally constrained parameters. We allow for any number and types of structures, and any statistical model. We consider the general class of M -estimators that minimize the sum of any loss function, and an instance of what we call a “hybrid” regularization, that is the inﬁmal convolution of weighted regularization functions, one for each structural component. We provide corollaries showcasing our uniﬁed framework for varied statistical models such as linear regression, multiple regression and principal component analysis, over varied superposition structures. 1</p><p>5 0.12471118 <a title="314-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Fantope_Projection_and_Selection%3A_A_near-optimal_convex_relaxation_of_sparse_PCA.html">116 nips-2013-Fantope Projection and Selection: A near-optimal convex relaxation of sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Q. Vu, Juhee Cho, Jing Lei, Karl Rohe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The convex problem can be solved efﬁciently using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings. We demonstrate this with an application to Kendall’s tau correlation matrices and transelliptical component analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.10298551 <a title="314-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Robust_PCA_via_Stochastic_Optimization.html">233 nips-2013-Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Robust PCA methods are typically based on batch optimization and have to load all the samples into memory during optimization. This prevents them from efﬁciently processing big data. In this paper, we develop an Online Robust PCA (OR-PCA) that processes one sample per time instance and hence its memory cost is independent of the number of samples, signiﬁcantly enhancing the computation and storage efﬁciency. The proposed OR-PCA is based on stochastic optimization of an equivalent reformulation of the batch RPCA. Indeed, we show that OR-PCA provides a sequence of subspace estimations converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart and hence is provably robust to sparse corruption. Moreover, OR-PCA can naturally be applied for tracking dynamic subspace. Comprehensive simulations on subspace recovering and tracking demonstrate the robustness and efﬁciency advantages of the OR-PCA over online PCA and batch RPCA methods. 1</p><p>4 0.75954664 <a title="314-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Memory_Limited%2C_Streaming_PCA.html">188 nips-2013-Memory Limited, Streaming PCA</a></p>

<p>Author: Grani Adiwena Hanasusanto, Daniel Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: In stochastic optimal control the distribution of the exogenous noise is typically unknown and must be inferred from limited data before dynamic programming (DP)-based solution schemes can be applied. If the conditional expectations in the DP recursions are estimated via kernel regression, however, the historical sample paths enter the solution procedure directly as they determine the evaluation points of the cost-to-go functions. The resulting data-driven DP scheme is asymptotically consistent and admits an efﬁcient computational solution when combined with parametric value function approximations. If training data is sparse, however, the estimated cost-to-go functions display a high variability and an optimistic bias, while the corresponding control policies perform poorly in out-of-sample tests. To mitigate these small sample effects, we propose a robust data-driven DP scheme, which replaces the expectations in the DP recursions with worst-case expectations over a set of distributions close to the best estimate. We show that the arising minmax problems in the DP recursions reduce to tractable conic programs. We also demonstrate that the proposed robust DP algorithm dominates various non-robust schemes in out-of-sample tests across several application domains. 1</p><p>3 0.81030905 <a title="314-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Memory_Limited%2C_Streaming_PCA.html">188 nips-2013-Memory Limited, Streaming PCA</a></p>

While our theoretical analysis focuses on the spiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful on much more general models for the data. 1</p><p>4 0.80906469 <a title="314-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>
<p>Author: Wojciech Zaremba, Arthur Gretton, Matthew Blaschko</p><p>Abstract: A family of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) kernel two-sample tests is introduced. Members of the test family are called Block-tests or B-tests, since the test statistic is an average over MMDs computed on subsets of the samples. The choice of block size allows control over the tradeoff between test power and computation time. In this respect, the B-test family combines favorable properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more powerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet they are more computationally efﬁcient than a quadratic time test where a single large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a U-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their asymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the U-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which estimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding. Recent results on kernel selection for hypothesis testing transfer seamlessly to the B-tests, yielding a means to optimize test power via kernel choice. 1</p><p>5 0.80547243 <a title="314-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Transfer_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Rank_Constraints.html">285 nips-2013-Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), a well-established technique for data analysis and processing, provides a convenient form of dimensionality reduction that is effective for cleaning small Gaussian noises presented in the data. However, the applicability of standard principal component analysis in real scenarios is limited by its sensitivity to large errors. In this paper, we tackle the challenge problem of recovering data corrupted with errors of high magnitude by developing a novel robust transfer principal component analysis method. Our method is based on the assumption that useful information for the recovery of a corrupted data matrix can be gained from an uncorrupted related data matrix. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the data recovery problem as a joint robust principal component analysis problem on the two data matrices, with common principal components shared across matrices and individual principal components speciﬁc to each data matrix. The formulated optimization problem is a minimization problem over a convex objective function but with non-convex rank constraints. We develop an efﬁcient proximal projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem with convergence guarantees. Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA with rank constraints. 1</p><p>6 0.8054595 <a title="314-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-On_model_selection_consistency_of_penalized_M-estimators%3A_a_geometric_theory.html">219 nips-2013-On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></p>

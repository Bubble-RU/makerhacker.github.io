<p>Author: Guy van den Broeck, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: Lifted inference algorithms exploit symmetries in probabilistic models to speed up inference. They show impressive performance when calculating unconditional probabilities in relational models, but often resort to non-lifted inference when computing conditional probabilities. The reason is that conditioning on evidence breaks many of the model’s symmetries, which can preempt standard lifting techniques. Recent theoretical results show, for example, that conditioning on evidence which corresponds to binary relations is #P-hard, suggesting that no lifting is to be expected in the worst case. In this paper, we balance this negative result by identifying the Boolean rank of the evidence as a key parameter for characterizing the complexity of conditioning in lifted inference. In particular, we show that conditioning on binary evidence with bounded Boolean rank is efﬁcient. This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically. 1</p><p>3 0.15999359 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Deep_Learning.html">350 nips-2013-Wavelets on Graphs via Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Raif Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of applications require processing of signals deﬁned on weighted graphs. While wavelets provide a ﬂexible tool for signal processing in the classical setting of regular domains, the existing graph wavelet constructions are less ﬂexible – they are guided solely by the structure of the underlying graph and do not take directly into consideration the particular class of signals to be processed. This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. Our construction uses the lifting scheme, and is based on the observation that the recurrent nature of the lifting scheme gives rise to a structure resembling a deep auto-encoder network. Particular properties that the resulting wavelets must satisfy determine the training objective and the structure of the involved neural networks. The training is unsupervised, and is conducted similarly to the greedy pre-training of a stack of auto-encoders. After training is completed, we obtain a linear wavelet transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph. Improved sparsity of our wavelet transform for the test signals is conﬁrmed via experiments both on synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>4 0.11718214 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Analyzing_Hogwild_Parallel_Gaussian_Gibbs_Sampling.html">34 nips-2013-Analyzing Hogwild Parallel Gaussian Gibbs Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Johnson, James Saunderson, Alan Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Sampling inference methods are computationally difﬁcult to scale for many models in part because global dependencies can reduce opportunities for parallel computation. Without strict conditional independence structure among variables, standard Gibbs sampling theory requires sample updates to be performed sequentially, even if dependence between most variables is not strong. Empirical work has shown that some models can be sampled effectively by going “Hogwild” and simply running Gibbs updates in parallel with only periodic global communication, but the successes and limitations of such a strategy are not well understood. As a step towards such an understanding, we study the Hogwild Gibbs sampling strategy in the context of Gaussian distributions. We develop a framework which provides convergence conditions and error bounds along with simple proofs and connections to methods in numerical linear algebra. In particular, we show that if the Gaussian precision matrix is generalized diagonally dominant, then any Hogwild Gibbs sampler, with any update schedule or allocation of variables to processors, yields a stable sampling process with the correct sample mean. 1</p><p>5 0.059551176 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Multimodal_Graph_Matching%3A_Sparse_Coding_Meets_Graph_Matching.html">282 nips-2013-Robust Multimodal Graph Matching: Sparse Coding Meets Graph Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Sprechmann, Joshua Vogelstein, Pablo Muse, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching is a challenging problem with very important applications in a wide range of ﬁelds, from image and video analysis to biological and biomedical problems. We propose a robust graph matching algorithm inspired in sparsityrelated techniques. We cast the problem, resembling group or collaborative sparsity formulations, as a non-smooth convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved using augmented Lagrangian techniques. The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs. We also present results on multimodal graphs and applications to collaborative inference of brain connectivity from alignment-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The code is publicly available. 1</p><p>6 0.051079102 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Polar_Operators_for_Structured_Sparse_Estimation.html">249 nips-2013-Polar Operators for Structured Sparse Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Baldi, Peter J. Sadowski</p><p>Abstract: Dropout is a relatively new algorithm for training neural networks which relies on stochastically “dropping out” neurons during training in order to avoid the co-adaptation of feature detectors. We introduce a general formalism for studying dropout on either units or connections, with arbitrary probability values, and use it to analyze the averaging and regularizing properties of dropout in both linear and non-linear networks. For deep neural networks, the averaging properties of dropout are characterized by three recursive equations, including the approximation of expectations by normalized weighted geometric means. We provide estimates and bounds for these approximations and corroborate the results with simulations. Among other results, we also show how dropout performs stochastic gradient descent on a regularized error function. 1</p><p>3 0.37229729 <a title="122-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Complexity_and_Approximation_of_Binary_Evidence_in_Lifted_Inference.html">220 nips-2013-On the Complexity and Approximation of Binary Evidence in Lifted Inference</a></p>

This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically. 1</p><p>4 0.37164363 <a title="122-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-More_Effective_Distributed_ML_via_a_Stale_Synchronous_Parallel_Parameter_Server.html">198 nips-2013-More Effective Distributed ML via a Stale Synchronous Parallel Parameter Server</a></p>
<p>Author: Qirong Ho, James Cipar, Henggang Cui, Seunghak Lee, Jin Kyu Kim, Phillip B. Gibbons, Garth A. Gibson, Greg Ganger, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: We propose a parameter server system for distributed ML, which follows a Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) model of computation that maximizes the time computational workers spend doing useful work on ML algorithms, while still providing correctness guarantees. The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model’s values (parameters and variables), and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older, stale versions of these values from a local cache, instead of waiting to get them from a central storage. This signiﬁcantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values. We provide a proof of correctness under SSP, as well as empirical results demonstrating that the SSP model achieves faster algorithm convergence on several different ML problems, compared to fully-synchronous and asynchronous schemes. 1</p><p>5 0.36822408 <a title="122-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Capacity_of_strong_attractor_patterns_to_model_behavioural_and_cognitive_prototypes.html">61 nips-2013-Capacity of strong attractor patterns to model behavioural and cognitive prototypes</a></p>
<p>Author: Abbas Edalat</p><p>Abstract: We solve the mean ﬁeld equations for a stochastic Hopﬁeld network with temperature (noise) in the presence of strong, i.e., multiply stored, patterns, and use this solution to obtain the storage capacity of such a network. Our result provides for the ﬁrst time a rigorous solution of the mean ﬁled equations for the standard Hopﬁeld model and is in contrast to the mathematically unjustiﬁable replica technique that has been used hitherto for this derivation. We show that the critical temperature for stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree or multiplicity, when the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns is negligible compared to the network size. In the case of a single strong pattern, when the ratio of the number of all stored pattens and the network size is a positive constant, we obtain the distribution of the overlaps of the patterns with the mean ﬁeld and deduce that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for retrieving a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong pattern. This square law property provides justiﬁcation for using strong patterns to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in psychology and psychotherapy. 1 Introduction: Multiply learned patterns in Hopﬁeld networks The Hopﬁeld network as a model of associative memory and unsupervised learning was introduced in [23] and has been intensively studied from a wide range of viewpoints in the past thirty years. However, properties of a strong pattern, as a pattern that has been multiply stored or learned in these networks, have only been examined very recently, a surprising delay given that repetition of an activity is the basis of learning by the Hebbian rule and long term potentiation. In particular, while the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network with certain correlated patterns has been tackled [13, 25], the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong as well as random patterns has not been hitherto addressed. The notion of a strong pattern of a Hopﬁeld network has been proposed in [15] to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in developmental psychology and psychotherapy. This suggestion has been motivated by reviewing the pioneering work of Bowlby [9] in attachment theory and highlighting how a number of academic biologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists and neuroscientists have consistently regarded Hopﬁeld-like artiﬁcial neural networks as suitable tools to model cognitive and behavioural constructs as patterns that are deeply and repeatedly learned by individuals [11, 22, 24, 30, 29, 10]. A number of mathematical properties of strong patterns in Hopﬁeld networks, which give rise to strong attractors, have been derived in [15]. These show in particular that strong attractors are strongly stable; a series of experiments have also been carried out which conﬁrm the mathematical 1 results and also indicate that a strong pattern stored in the network can be retrieved even in the presence of a large number of simple patterns, far exceeding the well-known maximum load parameter or storage capacity of the Hopﬁeld network with random patterns (αc ≈ 0.138). In this paper, we consider strong patterns in stochastic Hopﬁeld model with temperature, which accounts for various types of noise in the network. In these networks, the updating rule is probabilistic and depend on the temperature. Since analytical solution of such a system is not possible in general, one strives to obtain the average behaviour of the network when the input to each node, the so-called ﬁeld at the node, is replaced with its mean. This is the basis of mean ﬁeld theory for these networks. Due to the close connection between the Hopﬁeld network and the Ising model in ferromagnetism [1, 8], the mean ﬁeld approach for the Hopﬁeld network and its variations has been tackled using the replica method, starting with the pioneering work of Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky [3, 2, 4, 19, 31, 1, 13]. Although this method has been widely used in the theory of spin glasses in statistical physics [26, 16] its mathematical justiﬁcation has proved to be elusive as we will discuss in the next section; see for example [20, page 264], [14, page 27], and [7, page 9]. In [17] and independently in [27], an alternative technique to the replica method for solving the mean ﬁeld equations has been proposed which is reproduced and characterised as heuristic in [20, section 2.5] since it relies on a number of assumptions that are not later justiﬁed and uses a number of mathematical steps that are not validated. Here, we use the basic idea of the above heuristic to develop a veriﬁable mathematical framework with provable results grounded on elements of probability theory, with which we assume the reader is familiar. This technique allows us to solve the mean ﬁeld equations for the Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong patterns and use the results to study, ﬁrst, the stability of these patterns in the presence of temperature (noise) and, second, the storage capacity of the network with a single strong pattern at temperature zero. We show that the critical temperature for the stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree (i.e., its multiplicity) when the ratio of the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns to the network size tends to zero when the latter tends to inﬁnity. In the case that there is only one strong pattern present with its degree small compared to the number of patterns and the latter is a ﬁxed multiple of the number of nodes, we ﬁnd the distribution of the overlap of the mean ﬁeld and the patterns when the strong pattern is being retrieved. We use these distributions to prove that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong attractor. This result matches the ﬁnding in [15] regarding the capacity of a network to recall strong patterns as mentioned above. Our results therefore show that strong patterns are robust and persistent in the network memory as attachment types and behavioural prototypes are in the human memory system. In this paper, we will several times use Lyapunov’s theorem in probability which provides a simple sufﬁcient condition to generalise the Central Limit theorem when we deal with independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. We require a general form of this theorem kn as follows. Let Yn = N i=1 Yni , for n ∈ I , be a triangular array of random variables such that for each n, the random variables Yni , for 1 ≤ i ≤ kn are independent with E(Yni ) = 0 2 2 and E(Yni ) = σni , where E(X) stands for the expected value of the random variable X. Let kn 2 2 sn = i=1 σni . We use the notation X ∼ Y when the two random variables X and Y have the same distribution (for large n if either or both of them depend on n). Theorem 1.1 (Lyapunov’s theorem [6, page 368]) If for some δ > 0, we have the condition: 1 E(|Yn |2+δ |) → 0 s2+δ n d d as n → ∞ then s1 Yn −→ N (0, 1) as n → ∞ where −→ denotes convergence in distribution, and we denote n by N (a, σ 2 ) the normal distribution with mean a and variance σ 2 . Thus, for large n we have Yn ∼ N (0, s2 ). n 2 2 Mean ﬁeld theory We consider a Hopﬁeld network with N neurons i = 1, . . . , N with values Si = ±1 and follow the notations in [20]. As in [15], we assume patterns can be multiply stored and the degree of a pattern is deﬁned as its multiplicity. The total number of patterns, counting their multiplicity, is denoted by p and we assume there are n patterns ξ 1 , . . . , ξ n with degrees d1 , . . . , dn ≥ 1 respectively and that n the remaining p − k=1 dk ≥ 0 patterns are simple, i.e., each has degree one. Note that by our assumptions there are precisely n p0 = p + n − dk k=1 distinct patterns, which we assume are independent and identically distributed with equal probability of taking value ±1 for each node. More generally, for any non-negative integer k ∈ I , we let N p0 dk . µ pk = µ=1 p µ µ 0 1 We use the generalized Hebbian rule for the synaptic couplings: wij = N µ=1 dµ ξi ξj for i = j with wii = 0 for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N . As in the standard stochastic Hopﬁeld model [20], we use Glauber dynamics [18] for the stochastic updating rule with pseudo-temperature T > 0, which accounts for various types of noise in the network, and assume zero bias in the local ﬁeld. Putting β = 1/T (i.e., with the Boltzmann constant kB = 1) and letting fβ (h) = 1/(1 + exp(−2βh)), the stochastic updating rule at time t is given by: N Pr(Si (t + 1) = ±1) = fβ (±hi (t)), where hi (t) = wij Sj (t), (1) j=1 is the local ﬁeld at i at time t. The updating is implemented asynchronously in a random way. The energy of the network in the conﬁguration S = (Si )N is given by i=1 N 1 Si Sj wij . H(S) = − 2 i,j=1 For large N , this speciﬁes a complex system, with an underlying state space of dimension 2N , which in general cannot be solved exactly. However, mean ﬁeld theory has proved very useful in studying Hopﬁeld networks. The average updated value of Si (t + 1) in Equation (1) is Si (t + 1) = 1/(1 + e−2βhi (t) ) − 1/(1 + e2βhi (t) ) = tanh(βhi (t)), (2) where . . . denotes taking average with respect to the probability distribution in the updating rule in Equation (1). The stationary solution for the mean ﬁeld thus satisﬁes: Si = tanh(βhi ) , (3) The average overlap of pattern ξ µ with the mean ﬁeld at the nodes of the network is given by: mν = 1 N N ν ξi Si (4) i=1 The replica technique for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, used in the case p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞, seeks to obtain the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) by evaluating the partition function of the system, namely, Z = TrS exp(−βH(S)), where the trace TrS stands for taking sum over all possible conﬁgurations S = (Si )N . As it i=1 is generally the case in statistical physics, once the partition function of the system is obtained, 3 all required physical quantities can in principle be computed. However, in this case, the partition function is very difﬁcult to compute since it entails computing the average log Z of log Z, where . . . indicates averaging over the random distribution of the stored patterns ξ µ . To overcome this problem, the identity Zk − 1 log Z = lim k→0 k is used to reduce the problem to ﬁnding the average Z k of Z k , which is then computed for positive integer values of k. For such k, we have: Z k = TrS 1 TrS 2 . . . TrS k exp(−β(H(S 1 ) + H(S 1 ) + . . . + H(S k ))), where for each i = 1, . . . , k the super-scripted conﬁguration S i is a replica of the conﬁguration state. In computing the trace over each replica, various parameters are obtained and the replica symmetry condition assumes that these parameters are independent of the particular replica under consideration. Apart from this assumption, there are two basic mathematical problems with the technique which makes it unjustiﬁable [20, page 264]. Firstly, the positive integer k above is eventually treated as a real number near zero without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Secondly, the order of taking limits, in particular the order of taking the two limits k → 0 and N → ∞, are several times interchanged again without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Here, we develop a mathematically rigorous method for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, i.e., computing the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) in the case of p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞. Our method turns the basic idea of the heuristic presented in [17] and reproduced in [20] for solving the mean ﬁeld equation into a mathematically veriﬁable formalism, which for the standard Hopﬁeld network with random stored patterns gives the same result as the replica method, assuming replica symmetry. In the presence of strong patterns we obtain a set of new results as explained in the next two sections. The mean ﬁeld equation is obtained from Equation (3) by approximating the right hand side of N this equation by the value of tanh at the mean ﬁeld hi = j=1 wij Sj , ignoring the sum N j=1 wij (Sj − Sj ) for large N [17, page 32]: Si = tanh(β hi ) = tanh β N N j=1 p0 µ=1 µ µ dµ ξi ξj Sj . (5) Equation (5) gives the mean ﬁeld equation for the Hopﬁeld network with n possible strong patterns n ξ µ (1 ≤ µ ≤ n) and p − µ=1 dµ simple patterns ξ µ with n + 1 ≤ µ ≤ p0 . As in the standard Hopﬁeld model, where all patterns are simple, we have two cases to deal with. However, we now have to account for the presence of strong attractors and our two cases will be as follows: (i) In the p0 ﬁrst case we assume p2 := µ=1 d2 = o(N ), which includes the simpler case p2 N when p2 µ is ﬁxed and independent of N . (ii) In the second case we assume we have a single strong attractor with the load parameter p/N = α > 0. 3 Stability of strong patterns with noise: p2 = o(N ) The case of constant p and N → ∞ is usually referred to as α = 0 in the standard Hopﬁeld model. Here, we need to consider the sum of degrees of all stored patterns (and not just the number of patterns) compared to N . We solve the mean ﬁeld equation with T > 0 by using a method similar in spirit to [20, page 33] for the standard Hopﬁeld model, but in our case strong patterns induce a sequence of independent but non-identically distributed random variables in the crosstalk term, where the Central Limit Theorem cannot be used; we show however that Lyapunov’s theorem (Theorem (1.1) can be invoked. In retrieving pattern ξ 1 , we look for a solution of the mean ﬁled 1 equation of the form: Si = mξi , where m > 0 is a constant. Using Equation (5) and separating 1 the contribution of ξ in the argument of tanh, we obtain:  1 mξi = tanh    mβ  1 d1 ξi + N 4 µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj  . j=i,µ>1 (6) For each N , µ > 1 and j = i, let dµ µ µ 1 (7) ξ ξ ξ . N i j j 2 This gives (p0 − 1)(N − 1) independent random variables with E(YN µj ) = 0, E(YN µj ) = d2 /N 2 , µ 3 3 3 and E(|YN µj |) = dµ /N . We have: YN µj = s2 := N 2 E(YN µj ) = µ>1,j=i 1 N −1 d2 ∼ N 2 µ>1 µ N d2 . µ (8) µ>1 Thus, as N → ∞, we have: 1 s3 N 3 E(|YN µj |) ∼ √ µ>1,j=i µ>1 N( d3 µ µ>1 d2 )3/2 µ → 0. (9) as N → ∞ since for positive numbers dµ we always have µ>1 d3 < ( µ>1 d2 )3/2 . Thus the µ µ Lyapunov condition is satisﬁed for δ = 1. By Lyapunov’s theorem we deduce: 1 N µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj ∼ N d2 /N µ 0, (10) µ>1 µ>1,j=i Since we also have p2 = o(N ), it follows that we can ignore the second term, i.e., the crosstalk term, in the argument of tanh in Equation (6) as N → ∞; we thus obtain: m = tanh βd1 m. (11) To examine the ﬁxed points of the Equation (11), we let d = d1 for convenience and put x = βdm = dm/T , so that tanh x = T x/d; see Figure 1. It follows that Tc = d is the critical temperature. If T < d then there is a non-zero (non-trivial) solution for m, whereas for T > d we only have the trivial solution. For d = 1 our solution is that of the standard Hopﬁeld network as in [20, page 34].

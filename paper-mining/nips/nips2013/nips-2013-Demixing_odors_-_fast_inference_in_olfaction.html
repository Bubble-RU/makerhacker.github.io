<p>Author: Amin Karbasi, Amir Hesam Salavati, Amin Shokrollahi, Lav R. Varshney</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in associative memory design through structured pattern sets and graph-based inference algorithms allow reliable learning and recall of exponential numbers of patterns. Though these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons compute noiselessly, in contrast to highly variable neurons in hippocampus and olfactory cortex. Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as internal noise is less than a speciﬁed threshold, error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show internal noise actually improves performance of the recall phase. Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional beneﬁt to noisy neurons in biological neuronal networks. 1</p><p>3 0.11864732 <a title="86-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Firing_rate_predictions_in_optimal_balanced_networks.html">121 nips-2013-Firing rate predictions in optimal balanced networks</a></p>
<p>Author: David G. Barrett, Sophie Denève, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: How are ﬁring rates in a spiking network related to neural input, connectivity and network function? This is an important problem because ﬁring rates are a key measure of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difﬁcult problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculating ﬁring rates in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate ﬁring rates by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimising signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate ﬁring rates by ﬁnding the solution to the algorithm. Our ﬁring rate calculation relates network ﬁring rates directly to network input, connectivity and function. This allows us to explain the function and underlying mechanism of tuning curves in a variety of systems. 1</p><p>4 0.11450791 <a title="86-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Online_Experimental_Design_for_Mapping_Neural_Microcircuits.html">49 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Online Experimental Design for Mapping Neural Microcircuits</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Shababo, Brooks Paige, Ari Pakman, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of modern stimulation techniques in neuroscience, the opportunity arises to map neuron to neuron connectivity. In this work, we develop a method for efﬁciently inferring posterior distributions over synaptic strengths in neural microcircuits. The input to our algorithm is data from experiments in which action potentials from putative presynaptic neurons can be evoked while a subthreshold recording is made from a single postsynaptic neuron. We present a realistic statistical model which accounts for the main sources of variability in this experiment and allows for signiﬁcant prior information about the connectivity and neuronal cell types to be incorporated if available. Due to the technical challenges and sparsity of these systems, it is important to focus experimental time stimulating the neurons whose synaptic strength is most ambiguous, therefore we also develop an online optimal design algorithm for choosing which neurons to stimulate at each trial. 1</p><p>5 0.10229823 <a title="86-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>6 0.10080147 <a title="86-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>

<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>3 0.75840682 <a title="86-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced_Associative_Memories.html">210 nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced Associative Memories</a></p>

<p>Author: Cheston Tan, Jedediah M. Singer, Thomas Serre, David Sheinberg, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: The macaque Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) is a brain area that receives and integrates inputs from both the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams (thought to specialize in form and motion processing respectively). For the processing of articulated actions, prior work has shown that even a small population of STS neurons contains sufﬁcient information for the decoding of actor invariant to action, action invariant to actor, as well as the speciﬁc conjunction of actor and action. This paper addresses two questions. First, what are the invariance properties of individual neural representations (rather than the population representation) in STS? Second, what are the neural encoding mechanisms that can produce such individual neural representations from streams of pixel images? We ﬁnd that a simple model, one that simply computes a linear weighted sum of ventral and dorsal responses to short action “snippets”, produces surprisingly good ﬁts to the neural data. Interestingly, even using inputs from a single stream, both actor-invariance and action-invariance can be accounted for, by having different linear weights. 1</p><p>6 0.70641547 <a title="86-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Multi-level_Sparse_Representations.html">157 nips-2013-Learning Multi-level Sparse Representations</a></p>

If so, that would provide insight into the mechanisms employed by the olfactory system, and, because the two algorithms use very different coding strategies, that would also provide insight into how networks represent probabilities. 1</p><p>2 0.74506295 <a title="86-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>
<p>Author: Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir [14]. Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph (which must be accessible before selecting an action). In the undirected case, we show that the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>3 0.72020078 <a title="86-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Sign_Cauchy_Projections_and_Chi-Square_Kernel.html">293 nips-2013-Sign Cauchy Projections and Chi-Square Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Gennady Samorodnitsk, John Hopcroft</p><p>Abstract: The method of stable random projections is useful for efﬁciently approximating the lα distance (0 < α ≤ 2) in high dimension and it is naturally suitable for data streams. In this paper, we propose to use only the signs of the projected data and we analyze the probability of collision (i.e., when the two signs differ). Interestingly, when α = 1 (i.e., Cauchy random projections), we show that the probability of collision can be accurately approximated as functions of the chi-square (χ2 ) similarity. In text and vision applications, the χ2 similarity is a popular measure when the features are generated from histograms (which are a typical example of data streams). Experiments conﬁrm that the proposed method is promising for large-scale learning applications. The full paper is available at arXiv:1308.1009. There are many future research problems. For example, when α → 0, the collision probability is a function of the resemblance (of the binary-quantized data). This provides an effective mechanism for resemblance estimation in data streams. 1</p><p>4 0.70297152 <a title="86-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Ofer Dekel, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We study the power of different types of adaptive (nonoblivious) adversaries in the setting of prediction with expert advice, under both full-information and bandit feedback. We measure the player’s performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary’s adaptiveness to the player’s behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize —in a nearly complete manner— the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switch� ing costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is Θ(T 2/3 ). Interestingly, this √ rate is signiﬁcantly worse than the Θ( T ) rate attainable with switching costs in the full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also � show that a bounded memory adversary can force Θ(T 2/3 ) regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a new stochastic adversary strategy that generates loss processes with strong dependencies. 1</p><p>5 0.6882239 <a title="86-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Extracting_regions_of_interest_from_biological_images_with_convolutional_sparse_block_coding.html">114 nips-2013-Extracting regions of interest from biological images with convolutional sparse block coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Adam M. Packer, Noah Pettit, Henry Dalgleish, Michael Hausser, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Biological tissue is often composed of cells with similar morphologies replicated throughout large volumes and many biological applications rely on the accurate identiﬁcation of these cells and their locations from image data. Here we develop a generative model that captures the regularities present in images composed of repeating elements of a few different types. Formally, the model can be described as convolutional sparse block coding. For inference we use a variant of convolutional matching pursuit adapted to block-based representations. We extend the KSVD learning algorithm to subspaces by retaining several principal vectors from the SVD decomposition instead of just one. Good models with little cross-talk between subspaces can be obtained by learning the blocks incrementally. We perform extensive experiments on simulated images and the inference algorithm consistently recovers a large proportion of the cells with a small number of false positives. We ﬁt the convolutional model to noisy GCaMP6 two-photon images of spiking neurons and to Nissl-stained slices of cortical tissue and show that it recovers cell body locations without supervision. The ﬂexibility of the block-based representation is reﬂected in the variability of the recovered cell shapes. 1</p><p>6 0.681207 <a title="86-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Adversarially_Chosen_Transition_Probability_Distributions.html">227 nips-2013-Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Adversarially Chosen Transition Probability Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenjie Luo, Alex Schwing, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present active learning algorithms in the context of structured prediction problems. To reduce the amount of labeling necessary to learn good models, our algorithms operate with weakly labeled data and we query additional examples based on entropies of local marginals, which are a good surrogate for uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of 3D layout prediction from single images, and show that good models are learned when labeling only a handful of random variables. In particular, the same performance as using the full training set can be obtained while only labeling ∼10% of the random variables. 1</p><p>3 0.17178418 <a title="318-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Projected_Natural_Actor-Critic.html">257 nips-2013-Projected Natural Actor-Critic</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas, William C. Dabney, Stephen Giguere, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: Natural actor-critics form a popular class of policy search algorithms for ﬁnding locally optimal policies for Markov decision processes. In this paper we address a drawback of natural actor-critics that limits their real-world applicability—their lack of safety guarantees. We present a principled algorithm for performing natural gradient descent over a constrained domain. In the context of reinforcement learning, this allows for natural actor-critic algorithms that are guaranteed to remain within a known safe region of policy space. While deriving our class of constrained natural actor-critic algorithms, which we call Projected Natural ActorCritics (PNACs), we also elucidate the relationship between natural gradient descent and mirror descent. 1</p><p>4 0.15761958 <a title="318-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_to_Pass_Expectation_Propagation_Messages.html">168 nips-2013-Learning to Pass Expectation Propagation Messages</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Heess, Daniel Tarlow, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a popular approximate posterior inference algorithm that often provides a fast and accurate alternative to sampling-based methods. However, while the EP framework in theory allows for complex nonGaussian factors, there is still a signiﬁcant practical barrier to using them within EP, because doing so requires the implementation of message update operators, which can be difﬁcult and require hand-crafted approximations. In this work, we study the question of whether it is possible to automatically derive fast and accurate EP updates by learning a discriminative model (e.g., a neural network or random forest) to map EP message inputs to EP message outputs. We address the practical concerns that arise in the process, and we provide empirical analysis on several challenging and diverse factors, indicating that there is a space of factors where this approach appears promising. 1</p><p>5 0.1299428 <a title="318-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-On_Algorithms_for_Sparse_Multi-factor_NMF.html">214 nips-2013-On Algorithms for Sparse Multi-factor NMF</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Xin Wang</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data analysis method, the objective of which is to approximate a matrix with all nonnegative components into the product of two nonnegative matrices. In this work, we describe a new simple and efﬁcient algorithm for multi-factor nonnegative matrix factorization (mfNMF) problem that generalizes the original NMF problem to more than two factors. Furthermore, we extend the mfNMF algorithm to incorporate a regularizer based on the Dirichlet distribution to encourage the sparsity of the components of the obtained factors. Our sparse mfNMF algorithm affords a closed form and an intuitive interpretation, and is more efﬁcient in comparison with previous works that use ﬁx point iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.12291012 <a title="318-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Non-Linear_Domain_Adaptation_with_Boosting.html">211 nips-2013-Non-Linear Domain Adaptation with Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, François Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: We propose to train an ensemble with the help of a reservoir in which the learning algorithm can store a limited number of samples. This novel approach lies in the area between ofﬂine and online ensemble approaches and can be seen either as a restriction of the former or an enhancement of the latter. We identify some basic strategies that can be used to populate this reservoir and present our main contribution, dubbed Greedy Edge Expectation Maximization (GEEM), that maintains the reservoir content in the case of Boosting by viewing the samples through their projections into the weak classiﬁer response space. We propose an efﬁcient algorithmic implementation which makes it tractable in practice, and demonstrate its efﬁciency experimentally on several compute-vision data-sets, on which it outperforms both online and ofﬂine methods in a memory constrained setting. 1</p><p>4 0.66632372 <a title="318-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Direct_0-1_Loss_Minimization_and_Margin_Maximization_with_Boosting.html">90 nips-2013-Direct 0-1 Loss Minimization and Margin Maximization with Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaodan Zhai, Tian Xia, Ming Tan, Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a boosting method, DirectBoost, a greedy coordinate descent algorithm that builds an ensemble classiﬁer of weak classiﬁers through directly minimizing empirical classiﬁcation error over labeled training examples; once the training classiﬁcation error is reduced to a local coordinatewise minimum, DirectBoost runs a greedy coordinate ascent algorithm that continuously adds weak classiﬁers to maximize any targeted arbitrarily deﬁned margins until reaching a local coordinatewise maximum of the margins in a certain sense. Experimental results on a collection of machine-learning benchmark datasets show that DirectBoost gives better results than AdaBoost, LogitBoost, LPBoost with column generation and BrownBoost, and is noise tolerant when it maximizes an n′ th order bottom sample margin. 1</p><p>5 0.64650995 <a title="318-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Efficient_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Predictors_with_Non-Decomposable_Loss_Functions.html">152 nips-2013-Learning Efficient Random Maximum A-Posteriori Predictors with Non-Decomposable Loss Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Joseph Keshet, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this work we develop efﬁcient methods for learning random MAP predictors for structured label problems. In particular, we construct posterior distributions over perturbations that can be adjusted via stochastic gradient methods. We show that any smooth posterior distribution would sufﬁce to deﬁne a smooth PAC-Bayesian risk bound suitable for gradient methods. In addition, we relate the posterior distributions to computational properties of the MAP predictors. We suggest multiplicative posteriors to learn super-modular potential functions that accompany specialized MAP predictors such as graph-cuts. We also describe label-augmented posterior models that can use efﬁcient MAP approximations, such as those arising from linear program relaxations. 1</p><p>6 0.64410979 <a title="318-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>

We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks.

<p>Author: Christina E. Lee, Asuman Ozdaglar, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Computing the stationary distribution of a large ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite state space Markov Chain (MC) has become central in many problems such as statistical inference and network analysis. Standard methods involve large matrix multiplications as in power iteration, or simulations of long random walks, as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Power iteration is costly, as it involves computation at every state. For MCMC, it is difﬁcult to determine whether the random walks are long enough to guarantee convergence. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm that answers whether a chosen state in a MC has stationary probability larger than some ∆ ∈ (0, 1), and outputs an estimate of the stationary probability. Our algorithm is constant time, using information from a local neighborhood of the state on the graph induced by the MC, which has constant size relative to the state space. The multiplicative error of the estimate is upper bounded by a function of the mixing properties of the MC. Simulation results show MCs for which this method gives tight estimates. 1</p><p>4 0.88940674 <a title="318-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-A_message-passing_algorithm_for_multi-agent_trajectory_planning.html">16 nips-2013-A message-passing algorithm for multi-agent trajectory planning</a></p>

Compared with existing methods, our approach is naturally parallelizable and allows for incorporating different cost functionals with only minor adjustments. We apply our method to classical challenging instances and observe that its computational requirements scale well with p for several cost functionals. We also show that a specialization of our algorithm can be used for local motion planning by solving the problem of joint optimization in velocity space. 1</p><p>5 0.88871145 <a title="318-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Recurrent_networks_of_coupled_Winner-Take-All_oscillators_for_solving_constraint_satisfaction_problems.html">267 nips-2013-Recurrent networks of coupled Winner-Take-All oscillators for solving constraint satisfaction problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Hesham Mostafa, Lorenz. K. Mueller, Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: We present a recurrent neuronal network, modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system, that can solve constraint satisfaction problems. Discrete variables are represented by coupled Winner-Take-All (WTA) networks, and their values are encoded in localized patterns of oscillations that are learned by the recurrent weights in these networks. Constraints over the variables are encoded in the network connectivity. Although there are no sources of noise, the network can escape from local optima in its search for solutions that satisfy all constraints by modifying the effective network connectivity through oscillations. If there is no solution that satisﬁes all constraints, the network state changes in a seemingly random manner and its trajectory approximates a sampling procedure that selects a variable assignment with a probability that increases with the fraction of constraints satisﬁed by this assignment. External evidence, or input to the network, can force variables to speciﬁc values. When new inputs are applied, the network re-evaluates the entire set of variables in its search for states that satisfy the maximum number of constraints, while being consistent with the external input. Our results demonstrate that the proposed network architecture can perform a deterministic search for the optimal solution to problems with non-convex cost functions. The network is inspired by canonical microcircuit models of the cortex and suggests possible dynamical mechanisms to solve constraint satisfaction problems that can be present in biological networks, or implemented in neuromorphic electronic circuits. 1</p><p>6 0.88658041 <a title="318-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Capacity_of_strong_attractor_patterns_to_model_behavioural_and_cognitive_prototypes.html">61 nips-2013-Capacity of strong attractor patterns to model behavioural and cognitive prototypes</a></p>

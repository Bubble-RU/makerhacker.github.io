<p>Author: Chris Hinrichs, Vamsi Ithapu, Qinyuan Sun, Sterling C. Johnson, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing is a signiﬁcant problem in nearly all neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known Bonferroni correction method, while simple to implement, is quite conservative, and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact, non-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given α-threshold, but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive. In this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating the columns of a very large matrix P. By analyzing the spectrum of this matrix, under certain conditions, we see that P has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly sub–sampled — on the order of 0.5% — matrix completion methods. Based on this observation, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which offers a large speedup, without sacriﬁcing the ﬁdelity of the estimated FWER. Our evaluations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a computational speedup factor of roughly 50× can be achieved while recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show that the estimated α-threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is stable. 1</p><p>3 0.21506494 <a title="300-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Relaxations_for_Permutation_Problems.html">73 nips-2013-Convex Relaxations for Permutation Problems</a></p>

We prove the equivalence between the seriation and the combinatorial 2-SUM problem (a quadratic minimization problem over permutations) over a class of similarity matrices. The seriation problem can be solved exactly by a spectral algorithm in the noiseless case and we produce a convex relaxation for the 2-SUM problem to improve the robustness of solutions in a noisy setting. This relaxation also allows us to impose additional structural constraints on the solution, to solve semi-supervised seriation problems.

<p>Author: Marcelo Fiori, Pablo Sprechmann, Joshua Vogelstein, Pablo Muse, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching is a challenging problem with very important applications in a wide range of ﬁelds, from image and video analysis to biological and biomedical problems. We propose a robust graph matching algorithm inspired in sparsityrelated techniques. We cast the problem, resembling group or collaborative sparsity formulations, as a non-smooth convex optimization problem that can be efﬁciently solved using augmented Lagrangian techniques. The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs. We also present results on multimodal graphs and applications to collaborative inference of brain connectivity from alignment-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Jeff Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic models from observed data has been a central issue in many scientiﬁc studies or engineering tasks. The usual setting is that data are collected sequentially from trajectories of some dynamical system operation. In quite a few modern scientiﬁc modeling tasks, however, it turns out that reliable sequential data are rather difﬁcult to gather, whereas out-of-order snapshots are much easier to obtain. Examples include the modeling of galaxies, chronic diseases such Alzheimer’s, or certain biological processes. Existing methods for learning dynamic model from non-sequence data are mostly based on Expectation-Maximization, which involves non-convex optimization and is thus hard to analyze. Inspired by recent advances in spectral learning methods, we propose to study this problem from a different perspective: moment matching and spectral decomposition. Under that framework, we identify reasonable assumptions on the generative process of non-sequence data, and propose learning algorithms based on the tensor decomposition method [2] to provably recover ﬁrstorder Markov models and hidden Markov models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst formal guarantee on learning from non-sequence data. Preliminary simulation results conﬁrm our theoretical ﬁndings. 1</p><p>6 0.10389499 <a title="300-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-The_Fast_Convergence_of_Incremental_PCA.html">324 nips-2013-The Fast Convergence of Incremental PCA</a></p>

Uniqueness of Tensor Tucker Decompositions with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Anima Anandkumar, Daniel Hsu, Majid Janzamin, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for unsupervised feature learning in recent years. In this paper, we specify which overcomplete models can be identiﬁed given observable moments of a certain order. We consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While general overcomplete topic models are not identiﬁable, we establish generic identiﬁability under a constraint, referred to as topic persistence. Our sufﬁcient conditions for identiﬁability involve a novel set of “higher order” expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We establish that random structured topic models are identiﬁable w.h.p. in the overcomplete regime. Our identiﬁability results allow for general (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our identiﬁability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition. Keywords: Overcomplete representation, admixture models, generic identiﬁability, tensor decomposition.</p><p>6 0.52128458 <a title="300-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Graphical_Models_for_Inference_with_Missing_Data.html">134 nips-2013-Graphical Models for Inference with Missing Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Yannick Schwartz, Bertrand Thirion, Gael Varoquaux</p><p>Abstract: Imaging neuroscience links brain activation maps to behavior and cognition via correlational studies. Due to the nature of the individual experiments, based on eliciting neural response from a small number of stimuli, this link is incomplete, and unidirectional from the causal point of view. To come to conclusions on the function implied by the activation of brain regions, it is necessary to combine a wide exploration of the various brain functions and some inversion of the statistical inference. Here we introduce a methodology for accumulating knowledge towards a bidirectional link between observed brain activity and the corresponding function. We rely on a large corpus of imaging studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to ﬁnd commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus. The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus. To our knowledge, our approach is the ﬁrst demonstration of predicting the cognitive content of completely new brain images. To that end, we propose a method that predicts the experimental paradigms across different studies. 1</p><p>3 0.98151678 <a title="300-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_factorization_with_binary_components.html">186 nips-2013-Matrix factorization with binary components</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein, Pavlo Lutsik</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application in computational biology, we consider low-rank matrix factorization with {0, 1}-constraints on one of the factors and optionally convex constraints on the second one. In addition to the non-convexity shared with other matrix factorization schemes, our problem is further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size 2m·r , where m is the dimension of the data points and r the rank of the factorization. Despite apparent intractability, we provide − in the line of recent work on non-negative matrix factorization by Arora et al. (2012)− an algorithm that provably recovers the underlying factorization in the exact case with O(mr2r + mnr + r2 n) operations for n datapoints. To obtain this result, we use theory around the Littlewood-Offord lemma from combinatorics.</p><p>4 0.97978908 <a title="300-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Summary_Statistics_for_Partitionings_and_Feature_Allocations.html">320 nips-2013-Summary Statistics for Partitionings and Feature Allocations</a></p>
<p>Author: Isik B. Fidaner, Taylan Cemgil</p><p>Abstract: Inﬁnite mixture models are commonly used for clustering. One can sample from the posterior of mixture assignments by Monte Carlo methods or ﬁnd its maximum a posteriori solution by optimization. However, in some problems the posterior is diffuse and it is hard to interpret the sampled partitionings. In this paper, we introduce novel statistics based on block sizes for representing sample sets of partitionings and feature allocations. We develop an element-based deﬁnition of entropy to quantify segmentation among their elements. Then we propose a simple algorithm called entropy agglomeration (EA) to summarize and visualize this information. Experiments on various inﬁnite mixture posteriors as well as a feature allocation dataset demonstrate that the proposed statistics are useful in practice.</p><p>5 0.97537786 <a title="300-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multisensory_Encoding%2C_Decoding%2C_and_Identification.html">205 nips-2013-Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurel A. Lazar, Yevgeniy Slutskiy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive ﬁelds in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identiﬁcation of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identiﬁed. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identiﬁcation algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.9675293 <a title="300-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Accelerated_Mini-Batch_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">19 nips-2013-Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>

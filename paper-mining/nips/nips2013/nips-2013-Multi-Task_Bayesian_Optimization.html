<p>Author: Michalis Titsias, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel variational method that allows to approximately integrate out kernel hyperparameters, such as length-scales, in Gaussian process regression. This approach consists of a novel variant of the variational framework that has been recently developed for the Gaussian process latent variable model which additionally makes use of a standardised representation of the Gaussian process. We consider this technique for learning Mahalanobis distance metrics in a Gaussian process regression setting and provide experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing methods by considering datasets with high-dimensional inputs. 1</p><p>3 0.2014239 <a title="201-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_optimization_explains_human_active_search.html">54 nips-2013-Bayesian optimization explains human active search</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Borji, Laurent Itti</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world problems have complicated objective functions. To optimize such functions, humans utilize sophisticated sequential decision-making strategies. Many optimization algorithms have also been developed for this same purpose, but how do they compare to humans in terms of both performance and behavior? We try to unravel the general underlying algorithm people may be using while searching for the maximum of an invisible 1D function. Subjects click on a blank screen and are shown the ordinate of the function at each clicked abscissa location. Their task is to ﬁnd the function’s maximum in as few clicks as possible. Subjects win if they get close enough to the maximum location. Analysis over 23 non-maths undergraduates, optimizing 25 functions from different families, shows that humans outperform 24 well-known optimization algorithms. Bayesian Optimization based on Gaussian Processes, which exploits all the x values tried and all the f (x) values obtained so far to pick the next x, predicts human performance and searched locations better. In 6 follow-up controlled experiments over 76 subjects, covering interpolation, extrapolation, and optimization tasks, we further conﬁrm that Gaussian Processes provide a general and uniﬁed theoretical account to explain passive and active function learning and search in humans. 1</p><p>4 0.16277583 <a title="201-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC.html">48 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Learning in Gaussian Process State-Space Models with Particle MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger Frigola, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Schon, Carl Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identiﬁcation) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a ﬂexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efﬁcient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and, instead, infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity. 1</p><p>5 0.13042064 <a title="201-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-It_is_all_in_the_noise%3A_Efficient_multi-task_Gaussian_process_inference_with_structured_residuals.html">145 nips-2013-It is all in the noise: Efficient multi-task Gaussian process inference with structured residuals</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Rakitsch, Christoph Lippert, Karsten Borgwardt, Oliver Stegle</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task prediction methods are widely used to couple regressors or classiﬁcation models by sharing information across related tasks. We propose a multi-task Gaussian process approach for modeling both the relatedness between regressors and the task correlations in the residuals, in order to more accurately identify true sharing between regressors. The resulting Gaussian model has a covariance term in form of a sum of Kronecker products, for which efﬁcient parameter inference and out of sample prediction are feasible. On both synthetic examples and applications to phenotype prediction in genetics, we ﬁnd substantial beneﬁts of modeling structured noise compared to established alternatives. 1</p><p>6 0.11409429 <a title="201-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Optimization_for_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">105 nips-2013-Efficient Optimization for Sparse Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanshuai Cao, Marcus A. Brubaker, David Fleet, Aaron Hertzmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-ofart performance in discrete cases and competitive results in the continuous case. 1</p><p>5 0.67030239 <a title="201-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC.html">48 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Learning in Gaussian Process State-Space Models with Particle MCMC</a></p>

<p>Author: Haim Avron, Vikas Sindhwani, David Woodruff</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the desire to extend fast randomized techniques to nonlinear lp regression, we consider a class of structured regression problems. These problems involve Vandermonde matrices which arise naturally in various statistical modeling settings, including classical polynomial ﬁtting problems, additive models and approximations to recently developed randomized techniques for scalable kernel methods. We show that this structure can be exploited to further accelerate the solution of the regression problem, achieving running times that are faster than “input sparsity”. We present empirical results conﬁrming both the practical value of our modeling framework, as well as speedup beneﬁts of randomized regression. 1</p><p>2 0.83537996 <a title="201-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-A_Comparative_Framework_for_Preconditioned_Lasso_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2013-A Comparative Framework for Preconditioned Lasso Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Nebojsa Jojic, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: The Lasso is a cornerstone of modern multivariate data analysis, yet its performance suffers in the common situation in which covariates are correlated. This limitation has led to a growing number of Preconditioned Lasso algorithms that pre-multiply X and y by matrices PX , Py prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difﬁcult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter λ. In this paper we propose an agnostic framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose λ. We apply our framework to three Preconditioned Lasso instances and highlight cases when they will outperform the Lasso. Additionally, our theory reveals fragilities of these algorithms to which we provide partial solutions. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83265871 <a title="201-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Task_Bayesian_Optimization.html">201 nips-2013-Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</a></p>

We further propose a straightforward extension of our algorithm in order to jointly minimize the average error across multiple tasks and demonstrate how this can be used to greatly speed up k-fold cross-validation. Lastly, we propose an adaptation of a recently developed acquisition function, entropy search, to the cost-sensitive, multi-task setting. We demonstrate the utility of this new acquisition function by leveraging a small dataset to explore hyperparameter settings for a large dataset. Our algorithm dynamically chooses which dataset to query in order to yield the most information per unit cost. 1</p><p>4 0.8151108 <a title="201-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Large_Scale_Distributed_Sparse_Precision_Estimation.html">146 nips-2013-Large Scale Distributed Sparse Precision Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Huahua Wang, Arindam Banerjee, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Pradeep Ravikumar, Inderjit Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions using the CLIME estimator, which has several desirable theoretical properties. We present an inexact alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm for CLIME, and establish rates of convergence for both the objective and optimality conditions. Further, we develop a large scale distributed framework for the computations, which scales to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, using hundreds of cores. The proposed framework solves CLIME in columnblocks and only involves elementwise operations and parallel matrix multiplications. We evaluate our algorithm on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, which can use block cyclic distribution of data and parameters to achieve load balance and improve the efﬁciency in the use of memory hierarchies. Experimental results show that our algorithm is substantially more scalable than state-of-the-art methods and scales almost linearly with the number of cores. 1</p><p>5 0.78737253 <a title="201-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Two-Target_Algorithms__for_Infinite-Armed___Bandits_with_Bernoulli_Rewards.html">338 nips-2013-Two-Target Algorithms  for Infinite-Armed   Bandits with Bernoulli Rewards</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Bonald, Alexandre Proutiere</p><p>Abstract: We consider an inﬁnite-armed bandit problem with Bernoulli rewards. The mean rewards are independent, uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. Rewards 0 and 1 are referred to as a success and a failure, respectively. We propose a novel algorithm where the decision to exploit any arm is based on two successive targets, namely, the total number of successes until the ﬁrst failure and until the ﬁrst m failures, respectively, where m is a ﬁxed parameter. This two-target algorithm achieves a √ long-term average regret in 2n for a large parameter m and a known time horizon n. This regret is optimal and strictly less than the regret achieved by the best √ known algorithms, which is in 2 n. The results are extended to any mean-reward distribution whose support contains 1 and to unknown time horizons. Numerical experiments show the performance of the algorithm for ﬁnite time horizons. 1</p><p>6 0.78498822 <a title="201-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Recurrent_networks_of_coupled_Winner-Take-All_oscillators_for_solving_constraint_satisfaction_problems.html">267 nips-2013-Recurrent networks of coupled Winner-Take-All oscillators for solving constraint satisfaction problems</a></p>

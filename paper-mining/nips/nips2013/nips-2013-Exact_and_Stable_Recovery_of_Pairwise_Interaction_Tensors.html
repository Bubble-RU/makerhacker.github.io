<p>Author: Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a tensor from a set of linear measurements. A prominent methodology for this problem is based on a generalization of trace norm regularization, which has been used extensively for learning low rank matrices, to the tensor setting. In this paper, we highlight some limitations of this approach and propose an alternative convex relaxation on the Euclidean ball. We then describe a technique to solve the associated regularization problem, which builds upon the alternating direction method of multipliers.

<p>Author: Xiaoqin Zhang, Di Wang, Zhengyuan Zhou, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a general method for recovering low-rank three-order tensors, in which the data can be deformed by some unknown transformation and corrupted by arbitrary sparse errors. Since the unfolding matrices of a tensor are interdependent, we introduce auxiliary variables and relax the hard equality constraints by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. To improve the computational efﬁciency, we introduce a proximal gradient step to the alternating direction minimization method. We have provided proof for the convergence of the linearized version of the problem which is the inner loop of the overall algorithm. Both simulations and experiments show that our methods are more efﬁcient and effective than previous work. The proposed method can be easily applied to simultaneously rectify and align multiple images or videos frames. In this context, the state-of-the-art algorithms “RASL” and “TILT” can be viewed as two special cases of our work, and yet each only performs part of the function of our method.</p><p>4 0.44205844 <a title="113-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Tensor_Decomposition_via_Structured_Schatten_Norm_Regularization.html">74 nips-2013-Convex Tensor Decomposition via Structured Schatten Norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: We study a new class of structured Schatten norms for tensors that includes two recently proposed norms (“overlapped” and “latent”) for convex-optimizationbased tensor decomposition. We analyze the performance of “latent” approach for tensor decomposition, which was empirically found to perform better than the “overlapped” approach in some settings. We show theoretically that this is indeed the case. In particular, when the unknown true tensor is low-rank in a speciﬁc unknown mode, this approach performs as well as knowing the mode with the smallest rank. Along the way, we show a novel duality result for structured Schatten norms, which is also interesting in the general context of structured sparsity. We conﬁrm through numerical simulations that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour of the mean squared error. 1</p><p>5 0.43421015 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Low-Rank_Matrix_and_Tensor_Completion_via_Adaptive_Sampling.html">179 nips-2013-Low-Rank Matrix and Tensor Completion via Adaptive Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Rogers, Lei Li, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: Data in the sciences frequently occur as sequences of multidimensional arrays called tensors. How can hidden, evolving trends in such data be extracted while preserving the tensor structure? The model that is traditionally used is the linear dynamical system (LDS) with Gaussian noise, which treats the latent state and observation at each time slice as a vector. We present the multilinear dynamical system (MLDS) for modeling tensor time series and an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters. The MLDS models each tensor observation in the time series as the multilinear projection of the corresponding member of a sequence of latent tensors. The latent tensors are again evolving with respect to a multilinear projection. Compared to the LDS with an equal number of parameters, the MLDS achieves higher prediction accuracy and marginal likelihood for both artiﬁcial and real datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.93148404 <a title="113-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-A_New_Convex_Relaxation_for_Tensor_Completion.html">11 nips-2013-A New Convex Relaxation for Tensor Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Ari Pakman, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to sample from generic binary distributions, based on an exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm applied to a piecewise continuous augmentation of the binary distribution of interest. An extension of this idea to distributions over mixtures of binary and possibly-truncated Gaussian or exponential variables allows us to sample from posteriors of linear and probit regression models with spike-and-slab priors and truncated parameters. We illustrate the advantages of these algorithms in several examples in which they outperform the Metropolis or Gibbs samplers. 1</p><p>3 0.67786938 <a title="113-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Low-Rank_Matrix_and_Tensor_Completion_via_Adaptive_Sampling.html">179 nips-2013-Low-Rank Matrix and Tensor Completion via Adaptive Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a n ⇥ n matrix of rank r from merely ⌦(nr3/2 log(r)) matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order T tensor using ⌦(nrT 1/2 T 2 log(r)) entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using ⌦(nr3/2 polylog(n)) entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.67567903 <a title="113-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>5 0.67563254 <a title="113-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-Optimal_Entrywise_Sampling_for_Data_Matrices.html">206 nips-2013-Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling for Data Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitris Achlioptas, Zohar S. Karnin, Edo Liberty</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting non-zero entries of a matrix A in order to produce a sparse sketch of it, B, that minimizes A B 2 . For large m n matrices, such that n m (for example, representing n observations over m attributes) we give sampling distributions that exhibit four important properties. First, they have closed forms computable from minimal information regarding A. Second, they allow sketching of matrices whose non-zeros are presented to the algorithm in arbitrary order as a stream, with O 1 computation per non-zero. Third, the resulting sketch matrices are not only sparse, but their non-zero entries are highly compressible. Lastly, and most importantly, under mild assumptions, our distributions are provably competitive with the optimal ofﬂine distribution. Note that the probabilities in the optimal ofﬂine distribution may be complex functions of all the entries in the matrix. Therefore, regardless of computational complexity, the optimal distribution might be impossible to compute in the streaming model. 1</p><p>6 0.67239743 <a title="113-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Hidden_Markov_Models_from_Non-sequence_Data_via_Tensor_Decomposition.html">155 nips-2013-Learning Hidden Markov Models from Non-sequence Data via Tensor Decomposition</a></p>

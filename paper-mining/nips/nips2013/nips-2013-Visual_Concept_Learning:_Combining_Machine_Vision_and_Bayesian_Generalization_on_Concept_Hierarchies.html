<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Greg S. Corrado, Jon Shlens, Samy Bengio, Jeff Dean, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Tomas Mikolov</p><p>Abstract: Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to the increasing difﬁculty of acquiring sufﬁcient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model. 1</p><p>3 0.20096864 <a title="349-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-One-shot_learning_by_inverting_a_compositional_causal_process.html">226 nips-2013-One-shot learning by inverting a compositional causal process</a></p>
<p>Author: Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Josh Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: People can learn a new visual class from just one example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds or thousands of examples to tackle the same problems. Here we present a Hierarchical Bayesian model based on compositionality and causality that can learn a wide range of natural (although simple) visual concepts, generalizing in human-like ways from just one image. We evaluated performance on a challenging one-shot classiﬁcation task, where our model achieved a human-level error rate while substantially outperforming two deep learning models. We also tested the model on another conceptual task, generating new examples, by using a “visual Turing test” to show that our model produces human-like performance. 1</p><p>4 0.16835494 <a title="349-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitish Srivastava, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: High capacity classiﬁers, such as deep neural networks, often struggle on classes that have very few training examples. We propose a method for improving classiﬁcation performance for such classes by discovering similar classes and transferring knowledge among them. Our method learns to organize the classes into a tree hierarchy. This tree structure imposes a prior over the classiﬁer’s parameters. We show that the performance of deep neural networks can be improved by applying these priors to the weights in the last layer. Our method combines the strength of discriminatively trained deep neural networks, which typically require large amounts of training data, with tree-based priors, making deep neural networks work well on infrequent classes as well. We also propose an algorithm for learning the underlying tree structure. Starting from an initial pre-speciﬁed tree, this algorithm modiﬁes the tree to make it more pertinent to the task being solved, for example, removing semantic relationships in favour of visual ones for an image classiﬁcation task. Our method achieves state-of-the-art classiﬁcation results on the CIFAR-100 image data set and the MIR Flickr image-text data set. 1</p><p>5 0.16643561 <a title="349-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Zero-Shot_Learning_Through_Cross-Modal_Transfer.html">356 nips-2013-Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Milind Ganjoo, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually deﬁned semantic or visual features for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty detection strategies; the ﬁrst gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes’ accuracy high. 1</p><p>6 0.1630041 <a title="349-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Transfer_Learning_in_a_Transductive_Setting.html">335 nips-2013-Transfer Learning in a Transductive Setting</a></p>

<p>Author: Kewei Tu, Maria Pavlovskaia, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic And-Or grammars compactly represent both compositionality and reconﬁgurability and have been used to model different types of data such as images and events. We present a uniﬁed formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that is agnostic to the type of the data being modeled, and propose an unsupervised approach to learning the structures as well as the parameters of such grammars. Starting from a trivial initial grammar, our approach iteratively induces compositions and reconﬁgurations in a uniﬁed manner and optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar. In our empirical evaluation, we applied our approach to learning event grammars and image grammars and achieved comparable or better performance than previous approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.75309491 <a title="349-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Transfer_Learning_in_a_Transductive_Setting.html">335 nips-2013-Transfer Learning in a Transductive Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcus Rohrbach, Sandra Ebert, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Category models for objects or activities typically rely on supervised learning requiring sufﬁciently large training sets. Transferring knowledge from known categories to novel classes with no or only a few labels is far less researched even though it is a common scenario. In this work, we extend transfer learning with semi-supervised learning to exploit unlabeled instances of (novel) categories with no or only a few labeled instances. Our proposed approach Propagated Semantic Transfer combines three techniques. First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expertspeciﬁed information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More speciﬁcally we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm – so far only used for semi-supervised learning – to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation. We evaluate our approach on three challenging datasets in two different applications, namely on Animals with Attributes and ImageNet for image classiﬁcation and on MPII Composites for activity recognition. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transfer and semi-supervised approaches on all datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.73192859 <a title="349-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Modeling_Clutter_Perception_using_Parametric_Proto-object_Partitioning.html">195 nips-2013-Modeling Clutter Perception using Parametric Proto-object Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen-Ping Yu, Wen-Yu Hua, Dimitris Samaras, Greg Zelinsky</p><p>Abstract: Visual clutter, the perception of an image as being crowded and disordered, affects aspects of our lives ranging from object detection to aesthetics, yet relatively little effort has been made to model this important and ubiquitous percept. Our approach models clutter as the number of proto-objects segmented from an image, with proto-objects deﬁned as groupings of superpixels that are similar in intensity, color, and gradient orientation features. We introduce a novel parametric method of clustering superpixels by modeling mixture of Weibulls on Earth Mover’s Distance statistics, then taking the normalized number of proto-objects following partitioning as our estimate of clutter perception. We validated this model using a new 90-image dataset of real world scenes rank ordered by human raters for clutter, and showed that our method not only predicted clutter extremely well (Spearman’s ρ = 0.8038, p < 0.001), but also outperformed all existing clutter perception models and even a behavioral object segmentation ground truth. We conclude that the number of proto-objects in an image affects clutter perception more than the number of objects or features. 1</p><p>6 0.71848899 <a title="349-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Nebojsa Jojic, Manuele Bicego, Andrzej Truski</p><p>Abstract: In text analysis documents are often represented as disorganized bags of words; models of such count features are typically based on mixing a small number of topics [1, 2]. Recently, it has been observed that for many text corpora documents evolve into one another in a smooth way, with some features dropping and new ones being introduced. The counting grid [3] models this spatial metaphor literally: it is a grid of word distributions learned in such a way that a document’s own distribution of features can be modeled as the sum of the histograms found in a window into the grid. The major drawback of this method is that it is essentially a mixture and all the content must be generated by a single contiguous area on the grid. This may be problematic especially for lower dimensional grids. In this paper, we overcome this issue by introducing the Componential Counting Grid which brings the componential nature of topic models to the basic counting grid. We evaluated our approach on document classiﬁcation and multimodal retrieval obtaining state of the art results on standard benchmarks. 1</p><p>2 0.9003967 <a title="349-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Least_Informative_Dimensions.html">173 nips-2013-Least Informative Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.87206686 <a title="349-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Visual_Concept_Learning%3A_Combining_Machine_Vision_and_Bayesian_Generalization_on_Concept_Hierarchies.html">349 nips-2013-Visual Concept Learning: Combining Machine Vision and Bayesian Generalization on Concept Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Joshua T. Abbott, Joseph Austerweil, Thomas Griffiths, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Learning a visual concept from a small number of positive examples is a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Current methods typically fail to ﬁnd the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classiﬁers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a signiﬁcant advantage results from combining visual classiﬁers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization. 1</p><p>4 0.86164749 <a title="349-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Faster_Ridge_Regression_via_the_Subsampled_Randomized_Hadamard_Transform.html">120 nips-2013-Faster Ridge Regression via the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform</a></p>

<p>Author: Parikshit Ram, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of nearest-neighbor search with the class of binary-spacepartitioning trees, which includes kd-trees, principal axis trees and random projection trees, and try to rigorously answer the question “which tree to use for nearestneighbor search?” To this end, we present the theoretical results which imply that trees with better vector quantization performance have better search performance guarantees. We also explore another factor affecting the search performance – margins of the partitions in these trees. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that large margin partitions can improve tree search performance. 1 Nearest-neighbor search Nearest-neighbor search is ubiquitous in computer science. Several techniques exist for nearestneighbor search, but most algorithms can be categorized into two following groups based on the indexing scheme used – (1) search with hierarchical tree indices, or (2) search with hash-based indices. Although multidimensional binary space-partitioning trees (or BSP-trees), such as kd-trees [1], are widely used for nearest-neighbor search, it is believed that their performances degrade with increasing dimensions. Standard worst-case analyses of search with BSP-trees in high dimensions usually lead to trivial guarantees (such as, an Ω(n) search time guarantee for a single nearest-neighbor query in a set of n points). This is generally attributed to the “curse of dimensionality” – in the worst case, the high dimensionality can force the search algorithm to visit every node in the BSP-tree. However, these BSP-trees are very simple and intuitive, and still used in practice with success. The occasional favorable performances of BSP-trees in high dimensions are attributed to the low “intrinsic” dimensionality of real data. However, no clear relationship between the BSP-tree search performance and the intrinsic data properties is known. We present theoretical results which link the search performance of BSP-trees to properties of the data and the tree. This allows us to identify implicit factors inﬂuencing BSP-tree search performance — knowing these driving factors allows us to develop successful heuristics for BSP-trees with improved search performance. Each node in a BSP-tree represents a region of the space and each non-leaf node has a left and right child representing a disjoint partition of this region with some separating hyperplane and threshold (w, b). A search query on this tree is usually answered with a depth-ﬁrst branch-and-bound algorithm. Algorithm 1 presents a simpliﬁed version where a search query is answered with a small set of neighbor candidates of any desired size by performing a greedy depth-ﬁrst tree traversal to a speciﬁed depth. This is known as defeatist tree search. We are not aware of any data-dependent analysis of the quality of the results from defeatist BSP-tree search. However, Verma et al. (2009) [2] presented adaptive data-dependent analyses of some BSP-trees for the task of vector quantization. These results show precise connections between the quantization performance of the BSP-trees and certain properties of the data (we will present these data properties in Section 2). 1 Algorithm 1 BSP-tree search Input: BSP-tree T on set S, Query q, Desired depth l Output: Candidate neighbor p current tree depth lc ← 0 current tree node Tc ← T while lc < l do if Tc .w, q + Tc .b ≤ 0 then Tc ← Tc .left child else Tc ← Tc .right child end if Increment depth lc ← lc + 1 end while p ← arg minr∈Tc ∩S q − r . (a) kd-tree (b) RP-tree (c) MM-tree Figure 1: Binary space-partitioning trees. We establish search performance guarantees for BSP-trees by linking their nearest-neighbor performance to their vector quantization performance and utilizing the recent guarantees on the BSP-tree vector quantization. Our results provide theoretical evidence, for the ﬁrst time, that better quantization performance implies better search performance1 . These results also motivate the use of large margin BSP-trees, trees that hierarchically partition the data with a large (geometric) margin, for better nearest-neighbor search performance. After discussing some existing literature on nearestneighbor search and vector quantization in Section 2, we discuss our following contributions: • We present performance guarantees for Algorithm 1 in Section 3, linking search performance to vector quantization performance. Speciﬁcally, we show that for any balanced BSP-tree and a depth l, under some conditions, the worst-case search error incurred by the neighbor candidate returned by Algorithm 1 is proportional to a factor which is 2l/2 exp(−l/2β) , (n/2l )1/O(d) − 2 where β corresponds to the quantization performance of the tree (smaller β implies smaller quantization error) and d is closely related to the doubling dimension of the dataset (as opposed to the ambient dimension D of the dataset). This implies that better quantization produces better worst-case search results. Moreover, this result implies that smaller l produces improved worstcase performance (smaller l does imply more computation, hence it is intuitive to expect less error at the cost of computation). Finally, there is also the expected dependence on the intrinsic dimensionality d – increasing d implies deteriorating worst-case performance. The theoretical results are empirically veriﬁed in this section as well. • In Section 3, we also show that the worst-case search error for Algorithm 1 with a BSP-tree T is proportional to (1/γ) where γ is the smallest margin size of all the partitions in T . • We present the quantization performance guarantee of a large margin BSP tree in Section 4. O These results indicate that for a given dataset, the best BSP-tree for search is the one with the best combination of low quantization error and large partition margins. We conclude with this insight and related unanswered questions in Section 5. 2 Search and vector quantization Binary space-partitioning trees (or BSP-trees) are hierarchical data structures providing a multiresolution view of the dataset indexed. There are several space-partitioning heuristics for a BSPtree construction. A tree is constructed by recursively applying a heuristic partition. The most popular kd-tree uses axis-aligned partitions (Figure 1(a)), often employing a median split along the coordinate axis of the data in the tree node with the largest spread. The principal-axis tree (PA-tree) partitions the space at each node at the median along the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the data in that node [3, 4]. Another heuristic partitions the space based on a 2-means clustering of the data in the node to form the two-means tree (2M-tree) [5, 6]. The random-projection tree (RP-tree) partitions the space by projecting the data along a random standard normal direction and choosing an appropriate splitting threshold [7] (Figure 1(b)). The max-margin tree (MM-tree) is built by recursively employing large margin partitions of the data [8] (Figure 1(c)). The unsupervised large margin splits are usually performed using max-margin clustering techniques [9]. Search. Nearest-neighbor search with a BSP-tree usually involves a depth-ﬁrst branch-and-bound algorithm which guarantees the search approximation (exact search is a special case of approximate search with zero approximation) by a depth-ﬁrst traversal of the tree followed by a backtrack up the tree as required. This makes the tree traversal unpredictable leading to trivial worst-case runtime 1 This intuitive connection is widely believed but never rigorously established to the best of our knowledge. 2 guarantees. On the other hand, locality-sensitive hashing [10] based methods approach search in a different way. After indexing the dataset into hash tables, a query is answered by selecting candidate points from these hash tables. The candidate set size implies the worst-case search time bound. The hash table construction guarantees the set size and search approximation. Algorithm 1 uses a BSPtree to select a candidate set for a query with defeatist tree search. For a balanced tree on n points, the candidate set size at depth l is n/2l and the search runtime is O(l + n/2l ), with l ≤ log2 n. For any choice of the depth l, we present the ﬁrst approximation guarantee for this search process. Defeatist BSP-tree search has been explored with the spill tree [11], a binary tree with overlapping sibling nodes unlike the disjoint nodes in the usual BSP-tree. The search involves selecting the candidates in (all) the leaf node(s) which contain the query. The level of overlap guarantees the search approximation, but this search method lacks any rigorous runtime guarantee; it is hard to bound the number of leaf nodes that might contain any given query. Dasgupta & Sinha (2013) [12] show that the probability of ﬁnding the exact nearest neighbor with defeatist search on certain randomized partition trees (randomized spill trees and RP-trees being among them) is directly proportional to the relative contrast of the search task [13], a recently proposed quantity which characterizes the difﬁculty of a search problem (lower relative contrast makes exact search harder). Vector Quantization. Recent work by Verma et al., 2009 [2] has established theoretical guarantees for some of these BSP-trees for the task of vector quantization. Given a set of points S ⊂ RD of n points, the task of vector quantization is to generate a set of points M ⊂ RD of size k n with low average quantization error. The optimal quantizer for any region A is given by the mean µ(A) of the data points lying in that region. The quantization error of the region A is then given by VS (A) = 1 |A ∩ S| x − µ(A) 2 2 , (1) x∈A∩S and the average quantization error of a disjoint partition of region A into Al and Ar is given by: VS ({Al , Ar }) = (|Al ∩ S|VS (Al ) + |Ar ∩ S|VS (Ar )) /|A ∩ S|. (2) Tree-based structured vector quantization is used for efﬁcient vector quantization – a BSP-tree of depth log2 k partitions the space containing S into k disjoint regions to produce a k-quantization of S. The theoretical results for tree-based vector quantization guarantee the improvement in average quantization error obtained by partitioning any single region (with a single quantizer) into two disjoints regions (with two quantizers) in the following form (introduced by Freund et al. (2007) [14]): Deﬁnition 2.1. For a set S ⊂ RD , a region A partitioned into two disjoint regions {Al , Ar }, and a data-dependent quantity β > 1, the quantization error improvement is characterized by: VS ({Al , Ar }) < (1 − 1/β) VS (A).

The PA-tree result can be improved to the RP-tree depends on the covariance dimension O( ) from O( 2 ) with an additional assumption of the data in the node A (β = O(dc )) [7], which [2]. The RP-tree result is in Freund et al.

The 2means problem is NP-hard and an approximate solution is used in practice. These theoretical results are valid under the condition that there are no outliers in A ∩ S. This is characterized as 2 maxx,y∈A∩S x − y ≤ ηVS (A) for a ﬁxed η > 0. This notion of the absence of outliers was ﬁrst introduced for the theoretical analysis of the RP-trees [7]. Verma et al. (2009) [2] describe outliers as “points that are much farther away from the mean than the typical distance-from-mean”. In this situation, an alternate type of partition is used to remove these outliers that are farther away 3 from the mean than expected. For η ≥ 8, this alternate partitioning is guaranteed to reduce the data diameter (maxx,y∈A∩S x − y ) of the resulting nodes by a constant fraction [7, Lemma 12], and can be used until a region contain no outliers, at which point, the usual hyperplane partition can be used with their respective theoretical quantization guarantees. The implicit assumption is that the alternate partitioning scheme is employed rarely. These results for BSP-tree quantization performance indicate that different heuristics are adaptive to different properties of the data. However, no existing theoretical result relates this performance of BSP-trees to their search performance. Making the precise connection between the quantization performance and the search performance of these BSP-trees is a contribution of this paper. 3 Approximation guarantees for BSP-tree search In this section, we formally present the data and tree dependent performance guarantees on the search with BSP-trees using Algorithm 1. The quality of nearest-neighbor search can be quantized in two ways – (i) distance error and (ii) rank of the candidate neighbor. We present guarantees for both notions of search error2 . For a query q and a set of points S and a neighbor candidate p ∈ S, q−p distance error (q) = minr∈S q−r − 1, and rank τ (q) = |{r ∈ S : q − r < q − p }| + 1. Algorithm 1 requires the query traversal depth l as an input. The search runtime is O(l + (n/2l )). The depth can be chosen based on the desired runtime. Equivalently, the depth can be chosen based on the desired number of candidates m; for a balanced binary tree on a dataset S of n points with leaf nodes containing a single point, the appropriate depth l = log2 n − log2 m . We will be building on the existing results on vector quantization error [2] to present the worst case error guarantee for Algorithm 1. We need the following deﬁnitions to precisely state our results: Deﬁnition 3.1. An ω-balanced split partitioning a region A into disjoint regions {A1 , A2 } implies ||A1 ∩ S| − |A2 ∩ S|| ≤ ω|A ∩ S|. For a balanced tree corresponding to recursive median splits, such as the PA-tree and the kd-tree, ω ≈ 0. Non-zero values of ω 1, corresponding to approximately balanced trees, allow us to potentially adapt better to some structure in the data at the cost of slightly losing the tree balance. For the MM-tree (discussed in detail in Section 4), ω-balanced splits are enforced for any speciﬁed value of ω. Approximately balanced trees have a depth bound of O(log n) [8, Theorem 3.1]. For l a tree with ω-balanced splits, the worst case runtime of Algorithm 1 is O l + 1+ω n . For the 2 2M-tree, ω-balanced splits are not enforced. Hence the actual value of ω could be high for a 2M-tree. Deﬁnition 3.2. Let B 2 (p, ∆) = {r ∈ S : p − r < ∆} denote the points in S contained in a ball of radius ∆ around some p ∈ S with respect to the 2 metric. The expansion constant of (S, 2 ) is deﬁned as the smallest c ≥ 2 such B 2 (p, 2∆) ≤ c B 2 (p, ∆) ∀p ∈ S and ∀∆ > 0. Bounded expansion constants correspond to growth-restricted metrics [15]. The expansion constant characterizes the data distribution, and c ∼ 2O(d) where d is the doubling dimension of the set S with respect to the 2 metric. The relationship is exact for points on a D-dimensional grid (i.e., c = Θ(2D )). Equipped with these deﬁnitions, we have the following guarantee for Algorithm 1: 2 1 Theorem 3.1. Consider a dataset S ⊂ RD of n points with ψ = 2n2 x,y∈S x − y , the BSP tree T built on S and a query q ∈ RD with the following conditions : (C1) (C2) (C3) (C4) Let (A ∩ (S ∪ {q}), 2 ) have an expansion constant at most c for any convex set A ⊂ RD . ˜ Let T be complete till a depth L < log2 n /(1 − log2 (1 − ω)) with ω-balanced splits. c ˜ Let β ∗ correspond to the worst quantization error improvement rate over all splits in T . 2 For any node A in the tree T , let maxx,y∈A∩S x − y ≤ ηVS (A) for a ﬁxed η ≥ 8. For α = 1/(1 − ω), the upper bound du on the distance of q to the neighbor candidate p returned by Algorithm 1 with depth l ≤ L is given by √ 2 ηψ · (2α)l/2 · exp(−l/2β ∗ ) q − p ≤ du = . (4) 1/ log2 c ˜ (n/(2α)l ) −2 2 The distance error corresponds to the relative error in terms of the actual distance values. The rank is one more than the number of points in S which are better neighbor candidates than p. The nearest-neighbor of q has rank 1 and distance error 0. The appropriate notion of error depends on the search application. 4 Now η is ﬁxed, and ψ is ﬁxed for a dataset S. Then, for a ﬁxed ω, this result implies that between two types of BSP-trees on the same set and the same query, Algorithm 1 has a better worst-case guarantee on the candidate-neighbor distance for the tree with better quantization performance (smaller β ∗ ). Moreover, for a particular tree with β ∗ ≥ log2 e, du is non-decreasing in l. This is expected because as we traverse down the tree, we can never reduce the candidate neighbor distance. At the root level (l = 0), the candidate neighbor is the nearest-neighbor. As we descend down the tree, the candidate neighbor distance will worsen if a tree split separates the query from its closer neighbors. This behavior is implied in Equation (4). For a chosen depth l in Algorithm 1, the candidate 1/ log2 c ˜ , implying deteriorating bounds du neighbor distance is inversely proportional to n/(2α)l with increasing c. Since log2 c ∼ O(d), larger intrinsic dimensionality implies worse guarantees as ˜ ˜ expected from the curse of dimensionality. To prove Theorem 3.1, we use the following result: Lemma 3.1. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, for any node A at a depth l in the BSP-tree T l on S, VS (A) ≤ ψ (2/(1 − ω)) exp(−l/β ∗ ). This result is obtained by recursively applying the quantization error improvement in Deﬁnition 2.1 over l levels of the tree (the proof is in Appendix A). Proof of Theorem 3.1. Consider the node A at depth l in the tree containing q, and let m = |A ∩ S|. Let D = maxx,y∈A∩S x − y , let d = minx∈A∩S q − x , and let B 2 (q, ∆) = {x ∈ A ∩ (S ∪ {q}) : q − x < ∆}. Then, by the Deﬁnition 3.2 and condition C1, D+d D+d D+2d B (q, D + d) ≤ clog2 d |B (q, d)| = clog2 d ≤ clog2 ( d ) , ˜ ˜ ˜ 2 2 where the equality follows from the fact that B 2 (q, d) = {q}. Now B 2 (q, D + d) ≥ m. Using ˜ ˜ this above gives us m1/ log2 c ≤ (D/d) + 2. By condition C2, m1/ log2 c > 2. Hence we have 1/ log2 c ˜ d ≤ D/(m − 2). By construction and condition C4, D ≤ ηVS (A). Now m ≥ n/(2α)l . Plugging this above and utilizing Lemma 3.1 gives us the statement of Theorem 3.1. Nearest-neighbor search error guarantees. Equipped with the bound on the candidate-neighbor distance, we bound the worst-case nearest-neighbor search errors as follows: Corollary 3.1. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, for any query q at a desired depth l ≤ L in Algorithm 1, the distance error (q) is bounded as (q) ≤ (du /d∗ ) − 1, and the rank τ (q) is q u ∗ bounded as τ (q) ≤ c log2 (d /dq ) , where d∗ = minr∈S q − r . ˜ q Proof. The distance error bound follows from the deﬁnition of distance error. Let R = {r ∈ S : q − r < du }. By deﬁnition, τ (q) ≤ |R| + 1. Let B 2 (q, ∆) = {x ∈ (S ∪ {q}) : q − x < ∆}. Since B 2 (q, du ) contains q and R, and q ∈ S, |B 2 (q, du )| = |R| + 1 ≥ τ (q). From Deﬁnition / 3.2 and Condition C1, |B 2 (q, du )| ≤ c log2 (d ˜ |{q}| = 1 gives us the upper bound on τ (q). u /d∗ ) q |B 2 (q, d∗ )|. Using the fact that |B 2 (q, d∗ )| = q q The upper bounds on both forms of search error are directly proportional to du . Hence, the BSPtree with better quantization performance has better search performance guarantees, and increasing traversal depth l implies less computation but worse performance guarantees. Any dependence of this approximation guarantee on the ambient data dimensionality is subsumed by the dependence on β ∗ and c. While our result bounds the worst-case performance of Algorithm 1, an average case ˜ performance guarantee on the distance error is given by Eq (q) ≤ du Eq 1/d∗ −1, and on the rank q u − log d∗ is given by E τ (q) ≤ c log2 d ˜ E c ( 2 q ) , since the expectation is over the queries q and du q q does not depend on q. For the purposes of relative comparison among BSP-trees, the bounds on the expected error depend solely on du since the term within the expectation over q is tree independent. Dependence of the nearest-neighbor search error on the partition margins. The search error bounds in Corollary 3.1 depend on the true nearest-neighbor distance d∗ of any query q of which we q have no prior knowledge. However, if we partition the data with a large margin split, then we can say that either the candidate neighbor is the true nearest-neighbor of q or that d∗ is greater than the q size of the margin. We characterize the inﬂuence of the margin size with the following result: Corollary 3.2. Consider the conditions of Theorem 3.1 and a query q at a depth l ≤ L in Algorithm 1. Further assume that γ is the smallest margin size on both sides of any partition in the tree T .uThen the distance error is bounded as (q) ≤ du /γ − 1, and the rank is bounded as τ (q) ≤ c log2 (d /γ) . ˜ This result indicates that if the split margins in a BSP-tree can be increased without adversely affecting its quantization performance, the BSP-tree will have improved nearest-neighbor error guarantees 5 for the Algorithm 1. This motivated us to consider the max-margin tree [8], a BSP-tree that explicitly maximizes the margin of the split for every split in the tree. Explanation of the conditions in Theorem 3.1. Condition C1 implies that for any convex set A ⊂ RD , ((A ∩ (S ∪ {q})), 2 ) has an expansion constant at most c. A bounded c implies that no ˜ ˜ subset of (S ∪ {q}), contained in a convex set, has a very high expansion constant. This condition implies that ((S ∪ {q}), 2 ) also has an expansion constant at most c (since (S ∪ {q}) is contained in ˜ its convex hull). However, if (S ∪ {q}, 2 ) has an expansion constant c, this does not imply that the data lying within any convex set has an expansion constant at most c. Hence a bounded expansion constant assumption for (A∩(S ∪{q}), 2 ) for every convex set A ⊂ RD is stronger than a bounded expansion constant assumption for (S ∪ {q}, 2 )3 . Condition C2 ensures that the tree is complete so that for every query q and a depth l ≤ L, there exists a large enough tree node which contains q. Condition C3 gives us the worst quantization error improvement rate over all the splits in the tree. 2 Condition C4 implies that the squared data diameter of any node A (maxx,y∈A∩S x − y ) is within a constant factor of its quantization error VS (A). This refers to the assumption that the node A contains no outliers as described in Section 3 and only hyperplane partitions are used and their respective quantization improvement guarantees presented in Section 2 (Table 1) hold. By placing condition C4, we ignore the alternate partitioning scheme used to remove outliers for simplicity of analysis. If we allow a small fraction of the partitions in the tree to be this alternate split, a similar result can be obtained since the alternate split is the same for all BSP-tree. For two different kinds of hyperplane splits, if alternate split is invoked the same number of times in the tree, the difference in their worst-case guarantees for both the trees would again be governed by their worstcase quantization performance (β ∗ ). However, for any ﬁxed η, a harder question is whether one type of hyperplane partition violates the inlier condition more often than another type of partition, resulting in more alternate partitions. And we do not yet have a theoretical answer for this4 . Empirical validation. We examine our theoretical results with 4 datasets – O PTDIGITS (D = 64, n = 3823, 1797 queries), T INY I MAGES (D = 384, n = 5000, 1000 queries), MNIST (D = 784, n = 6000, 1000 queries), I MAGES (D = 4096, n = 500, 150 queries). We consider the following BSP-trees: kd-tree, random-projection (RP) tree, principal axis (PA) tree, two-means (2M) tree and max-margin (MM) tree. We only use hyperplane partitions for the tree construction. This is because, ﬁrstly, the check for the presence of outliers (∆2 (A) > ηVS (A)) can be computationally S expensive for large n, and, secondly, the alternate partition is mostly for the purposes of obtaining theoretical guarantees. The implementation details for the different tree constructions are presented in Appendix C. The performance of these BSP-trees are presented in Figure 2. Trees with missing data points for higher depth levels (for example, kd-tree in Figure 2(a) and 2M-tree in Figures 2 (b) & (c)) imply that we were unable to grow complete BSP-trees beyond that depth. The quantization performance of the 2M-tree, PA-tree and MM-tree are signiﬁcantly better than the performance of the kd-tree and RP-tree and, as suggested by Corollary 3.1, this is also reﬂected in their search performance. The MM-tree has comparable quantization performance to the 2M-tree and PA-tree. However, in the case of search, the MM-tree outperforms PA-tree in all datasets. This can be attributed to the large margin partitions in the MM-tree. The comparison to 2M-tree is not as apparent. The MM-tree and PA-tree have ω-balanced splits for small ω enforced algorithmically, resulting in bounded depth and bounded computation of O(l + n(1 + ω)l /2l ) for any given depth l. No such balance constraint is enforced in the 2-means algorithm, and hence, the 2M-tree can be heavily unbalanced. The absence of complete BSP 2M-tree beyond depth 4 and 6 in Figures 2 (b) & (c) respectively is evidence of the lack of balance in the 2M-tree. This implies possibly more computation and hence lower errors. Under these conditions, the MM-tree with an explicit balance constraint performs comparably to the 2M-tree (slightly outperforming in 3 of the 4 cases) while still maintaining a balanced tree (and hence returning smaller candidate sets on average). 3 A subset of a growth-restricted metric space (S, 2 ) may not be growth-restricted. However, in our case, we are not considering all subsets; we only consider subsets of the form (A ∩ S) where A ⊂ RD is a convex set. So our condition does not imply that all subsets of (S, 2 ) are growth-restricted. 4 We empirically explore the effect of the tree type on the violation of the inlier condition (C4) in Appendix B. The results imply that for any ﬁxed value of η, almost the same number of alternate splits would be invoked for the construction of different types of trees on the same dataset. Moreover, with η ≥ 8, for only one of the datasets would a signiﬁcant fraction of the partitions in the tree (of any type) need to be the alternate partition. 6 (a) O PTDIGITS (b) T INY I MAGES (c) MNIST (d) I MAGES Figure 2: Performance of BSP-trees with increasing traversal depth. The top row corresponds to quantization performance of existing trees and the bottom row presents the nearest-neighbor error (in terms of mean rank τ of the candidate neighbors (CN)) of Algorithm 1 with these trees. The nearest-neighbor search error graphs are also annotated with the mean distance-error of the CN (please view in color). 4 Large margin BSP-tree We established that the search error depends on the quantization performance and the partition margins of the tree. The MM-tree explicitly maximizes the margin of every partition and empirical results indicate that it has comparable performance to the 2M-tree and PA-tree in terms of the quantization performance. In this section, we establish a theoretical guarantee for the MM-tree quantization performance. The large margin split in the MM-tree is obtained by performing max-margin clustering (MMC) with 2 clusters. The task of MMC is to ﬁnd the optimal hyperplane (w∗ , b∗ ) from the following optimization problem5 given a set of points S = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xm } ⊂ RD : min w,b,ξi s.t. 1 w 2 m 2 2 ξi +C (5) i=1 | w, xi + b| ≥ 1 − ξi , ξi ≥ 0 ∀i = 1, . . . , m (6) m sgn( w, xi + b) ≤ ωm. −ωm ≤ (7) i=1 MMC ﬁnds a soft max-margin split in the data to obtain two clusters separated by a large (soft) margin. The balance constraint (Equation (7)) avoids trivial solutions and enforces an ω-balanced split. The margin constraints (Equation (6)) enforce a robust separation of the data. Given a solution to the MMC, we establish the following quantization error improvement rate for the MM-tree: Theorem 4.1. Given a set of points S ⊂ RD and a region A containing m points, consider an ω-balanced max-margin split (w, b) of the region A into {Al , Ar } with at most αm support vectors and a split margin of size γ = 1/ w . Then the quantization error improvement is given by:  γ 2 (1 − α)2 VS ({Al , Ar }) ≤ 1 − D i=1 1−ω 1+ω λi   VS (A), (8) where λ1 , . . . , λD are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of A ∩ S. The result indicates that larger margin sizes (large γ values) and a smaller number of support vectors (small α) implies better quantization performance. Larger ω implies smaller improvement, but ω is √ generally restricted algorithmically in MMC. If γ = O( λ1 ) then this rate matches the best possible quantization performance of the PA-tree (Table 1). We do assume that we have a feasible solution to the MMC problem to prove this result. We use the following result to prove Theorem 4.1: Proposition 4.1. [7, Lemma 15] Give a set S, for any partition {A1 , A2 } of a set A, VS (A) − VS ({A1 , A2 }) = |A1 ∩ S||A2 ∩ S| µ(A1 ) − µ(A2 ) |A ∩ S|2 2 , (9) where µ(A) is the centroid of the points in the region A. 5 This is an equivalent formulation [16] to the original form of max-margin clustering proposed by Xu et al. (2005) [9]. The original formulation also contains the labels yi s and optimizes over it. We consider this form of the problem since it makes our analysis easier to follow. 7 This result [7] implies that the improvement in the quantization error depends on the distance between the centroids of the two regions in the partition. Proof of Theorem 4.1. For a feasible solution (w, b, ξi |i=1,...,m ) to the MMC problem, m m | w, xi + b| ≥ m − ξi . i=1 i=1 Let xi = w, xi +b and mp = |{i : xi > 0}| and mn = |{i : xi ≤ 0}| and µp = ( ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ and µn = ( i : xi ≤0 xi )/mn . Then mp µp − mn µn ≥ m − i ξi . ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ i : xi >0 ˜ xi )/mp ˜ Without loss of generality, we assume that mp ≥ mn . Then the balance constraint (Equation (7)) 2 tells us that mp ≤ m(1 + ω)/2 and mn ≥ m(1 − ω)/2. Then µp − µn + ω(˜p + µn ) ≥ 2 − m i ξi . ˜ ˜ µ ˜ 2 Since µp > 0 and µn ≤ 0, |˜p + µn | ≤ (˜p − µn ). Hence (1 + ω)(˜p − µn ) ≥ 2 − m i ξi . For ˜ µ ˜ µ ˜ µ ˜ an unsupervised split, the data is always separable since there is no misclassiﬁcation. This implies ∗ that ξi ≤ 1∀i. Hence, µp − µn ≥ ˜ ˜ 2− 2 |{i : ξi > 0}| /(1 + ω) ≥ 2 m 1−α 1+ω , (10) since the term |{i : ξi > 0}| corresponds to the number of support vectors in the solution. Cauchy-Schwartz implies that µ(Al ) − µ(Ar ) ≥ | w, µ(Al ) − µ(Ar ) |/ w = (˜p − µn )γ, µ ˜ since µn = w, µ(Al ) + b and µp = w, µ(Ar ) + b. From Equation (10), we can say ˜ ˜ 2 2 2 that µ(Al ) − µ(Ar ) ≥ 4γ 2 (1 − α) / (1 + ω) . Also, for ω-balanced splits, |Al ||Ar | ≥ (1 − ω 2 )m2 /4. Combining these into Equation (9) from Proposition 4.1, we have VS (A) − VS ({Al , Ar }) ≥ (1 − ω 2 )γ 2 1−α 1+ω 2 = γ 2 (1 − α)2 1−ω 1+ω . (11) Let Cov(A ∩ S) be the covariance matrix of the data contained in region A and λ1 , . . . , λD be the eigenvalues of Cov(A ∩ S). Then, we have: VS (A) = 1 |A ∩ S| D x − µ(A) 2 = tr (Cov(A ∩ S)) = λi . i=1 x∈A∩S Then dividing Equation (11) by VS (A) gives us the statement of the theorem. 5 Conclusions and future directions Our results theoretically verify that BSP-trees with better vector quantization performance and large partition margins do have better search performance guarantees as one would expect. This means that the best BSP-tree for search on a given dataset is the one with the best combination of good quantization performance (low β ∗ in Corollary 3.1) and large partition margins (large γ in Corollary 3.2). The MM-tree and the 2M-tree appear to have the best empirical performance in terms of the search error. This is because the 2M-tree explicitly minimizes β ∗ while the MM-tree explicitly maximizes γ (which also implies smaller β ∗ by Theorem 4.1). Unlike the 2M-tree, the MM-tree explicitly maintains an approximately balanced tree for better worst-case search time guarantees. However, the general dimensional large margin partitions in the MM-tree construction can be quite expensive. But the idea of large margin partitions can be used to enhance any simpler space partition heuristic – for any chosen direction (such as along a coordinate axis or along the principal eigenvector of the data covariance matrix), a one dimensional large margin split of the projections of the points along the chosen direction can be obtained very efﬁciently for improved search performance. This analysis of search could be useful beyond BSP-trees. Various heuristics have been developed to improve locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) [10]. The plain-vanilla LSH uses random linear projections and random thresholds for the hash-table construction. The data can instead be projected along the top few eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix. This was (empirically) improved upon by learning an orthogonal rotation of the projected data to minimize the quantization error of each bin in the hash-table [17]. A nonlinear hash function can be learned using a restricted Boltzmann machine [18]. If the similarity graph of the data is based on the Euclidean distance, spectral hashing [19] uses a subset of the eigenvectors of the similarity graph Laplacian. Semi-supervised hashing [20] incorporates given pairwise semantic similarity and dissimilarity constraints. The structural SVM framework has also been used to learn hash functions [21]. Similar to the choice of an appropriate BSP-tree for search, the best hashing scheme for any given dataset can be chosen by considering the quantization performance of the hash functions and the margins between the bins in the hash tables. We plan to explore this intuition theoretically and empirically for LSH based search schemes. 8 References [1] J. H. Friedman, J. L. Bentley, and R. A. Finkel.

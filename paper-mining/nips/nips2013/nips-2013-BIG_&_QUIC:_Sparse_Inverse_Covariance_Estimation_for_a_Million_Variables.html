<p>Author: Huahua Wang, Arindam Banerjee, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Pradeep Ravikumar, Inderjit Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions using the CLIME estimator, which has several desirable theoretical properties. We present an inexact alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm for CLIME, and establish rates of convergence for both the objective and optimality conditions. Further, we develop a large scale distributed framework for the computations, which scales to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, using hundreds of cores. The proposed framework solves CLIME in columnblocks and only involves elementwise operations and parallel matrix multiplications. We evaluate our algorithm on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, which can use block cyclic distribution of data and parameters to achieve load balance and improve the efﬁciency in the use of memory hierarchies. Experimental results show that our algorithm is substantially more scalable than state-of-the-art methods and scales almost linearly with the number of cores. 1</p><p>3 0.09087988 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Statistical_Active_Learning_Algorithms.html">309 nips-2013-Statistical Active Learning Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the ﬁrst differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case. 1</p><p>4 0.085136563 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Memory_Limited%2C_Streaming_PCA.html">188 nips-2013-Memory Limited, Streaming PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Mitliagkas, Constantine Caramanis, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider streaming, one-pass principal component analysis (PCA), in the highdimensional regime, with limited memory. Here, p-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the k-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require O(p2 ) memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than O(kp) memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the spiked covariance model, where p-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, n, scales proportionally with the dimension, p. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity O(p2 ). Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity O(kp) do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to p. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses O(kp) memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the k-dimensional spike with O(p log p) samplecomplexity – the ﬁrst algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the spiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful on much more general models for the data. 1</p><p>5 0.07514964 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Actor-Critic_Algorithms_for_Risk-Sensitive_MDPs.html">24 nips-2013-Actor-Critic Algorithms for Risk-Sensitive MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Prashanth L.A., Mohammad Ghavamzadeh</p><p>Abstract: In many sequential decision-making problems we may want to manage risk by minimizing some measure of variability in rewards in addition to maximizing a standard criterion. Variance-related risk measures are among the most common risk-sensitive criteria in ﬁnance and operations research. However, optimizing many such criteria is known to be a hard problem. In this paper, we consider both discounted and average reward Markov decision processes. For each formulation, we ﬁrst deﬁne a measure of variability for a policy, which in turn gives us a set of risk-sensitive criteria to optimize. For each of these criteria, we derive a formula for computing its gradient. We then devise actor-critic algorithms for estimating the gradient and updating the policy parameters in the ascent direction. We establish the convergence of our algorithms to locally risk-sensitive optimal policies. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms in a trafﬁc signal control application. 1</p><p>6 0.074400365 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Qirong Ho, James Cipar, Henggang Cui, Seunghak Lee, Jin Kyu Kim, Phillip B. Gibbons, Garth A. Gibson, Greg Ganger, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: We propose a parameter server system for distributed ML, which follows a Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) model of computation that maximizes the time computational workers spend doing useful work on ML algorithms, while still providing correctness guarantees. The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model’s values (parameters and variables), and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older, stale versions of these values from a local cache, instead of waiting to get them from a central storage. This signiﬁcantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values. We provide a proof of correctness under SSP, as well as empirical results demonstrating that the SSP model achieves faster algorithm convergence on several different ML problems, compared to fully-synchronous and asynchronous schemes. 1</p><p>4 0.62496161 <a title="45-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Causal_Inference_on_Time_Series_using_Restricted_Structural_Equation_Models.html">62 nips-2013-Causal Inference on Time Series using Restricted Structural Equation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Causal inference uses observational data to infer the causal structure of the data generating system. We study a class of restricted Structural Equation Models for time series that we call Time Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo). These models require independent residual time series, whereas traditional methods like Granger causality exploit the variance of residuals. This work contains two main contributions: (1) Theoretical: By restricting the model class (e.g. to additive noise) we provide general identiﬁability results. They cover lagged and instantaneous effects that can be nonlinear and unfaithful, and non-instantaneous feedbacks between the time series. (2) Practical: If there are no feedback loops between time series, we propose an algorithm based on non-linear independence tests of time series. We show empirically that when the data are causally insufﬁcient or the model is misspeciﬁed, the method avoids incorrect answers. We extend the theoretical and the algorithmic part to situations in which the time series have been measured with different time delays. TiMINo is applied to artiﬁcial and real data and code is provided. 1</p><p>5 0.6220386 <a title="45-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_blockmodel_approximation_of_a_graphon%3A_Theory_and_consistent_estimation.html">316 nips-2013-Stochastic blockmodel approximation of a graphon: Theory and consistent estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, Thiago B. Costa, Stanley H. Chan</p><p>Abstract: Non-parametric approaches for analyzing network data based on exchangeable graph models (ExGM) have recently gained interest. The key object that deﬁnes an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon. This non-parametric perspective on network modeling poses challenging questions on how to make inference on the graphon underlying observed network data. In this paper, we propose a computationally efﬁcient procedure to estimate a graphon from a set of observed networks generated from it. This procedure is based on a stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) of the graphon. We show that, by approximating the graphon with a stochastic block model, the graphon can be consistently estimated, that is, the estimation error vanishes as the size of the graph approaches inﬁnity.</p><p>6 0.60666627 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Recurrent_linear_models_of_simultaneously-recorded_neural___populations.html">266 nips-2013-Recurrent linear models of simultaneously-recorded neural   populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinghao Pan, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Stefanie Jegelka, Tamara Broderick, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Research on distributed machine learning algorithms has focused primarily on one of two extremes—algorithms that obey strict concurrency constraints or algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conﬂicts are unlikely and if conﬂicts do arise a conﬂict-resolution protocol is invoked. We view this “optimistic concurrency control” paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81331646 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-BIG_%26_QUIC%3A_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation_for_a_Million_Variables.html">45 nips-2013-BIG & QUIC: Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for a Million Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Cho-Jui Hsieh, Matyas A. Sustik, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Russell Poldrack</p><p>Abstract: The 1 -regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been shown to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance matrix even under high-dimensional settings. However, it requires solving a difﬁcult non-smooth log-determinant program with number of parameters scaling quadratically with the number of Gaussian variables. State-of-the-art methods thus do not scale to problems with more than 20, 000 variables. In this paper, we develop an algorithm B IG QUIC, which can solve 1 million dimensional 1 regularized Gaussian MLE problems (which would thus have 1000 billion parameters) using a single machine, with bounded memory. In order to do so, we carefully exploit the underlying structure of the problem. Our innovations include a novel block-coordinate descent method with the blocks chosen via a clustering scheme to minimize repeated computations; and allowing for inexact computation of speciﬁc components. In spite of these modiﬁcations, we are able to theoretically analyze our procedure and show that B IG QUIC can achieve super-linear or even quadratic convergence rates. 1</p><p>3 0.81139064 <a title="45-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Low-rank_matrix_reconstruction_and_clustering_via_approximate_message_passing.html">180 nips-2013-Low-rank matrix reconstruction and clustering via approximate message passing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryosuke Matsushita, Toshiyuki Tanaka</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing low-rank matrices from their noisy observations. We formulate the problem in the Bayesian framework, which allows us to exploit structural properties of matrices in addition to low-rankedness, such as sparsity. We propose an efﬁcient approximate message passing algorithm, derived from the belief propagation algorithm, to perform the Bayesian inference for matrix reconstruction. We have also successfully applied the proposed algorithm to a clustering problem, by reformulating it as a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem with an additional structural property. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms Lloyd’s K-means algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.78491479 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Algorithm_for_Privately_Releasing_Smooth_Queries.html">102 nips-2013-Efficient Algorithm for Privately Releasing Smooth Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziteng Wang, Kai Fan, Jiaqi Zhang, Liwei Wang</p><p>Abstract: We study differentially private mechanisms for answering smooth queries on databases consisting of data points in Rd . A K-smooth query is speciﬁed by a function whose partial derivatives up to order K are all bounded. We develop an -differentially private mechanism which for the class of K-smooth queries has K accuracy O(n− 2d+K / ). The mechanism ﬁrst outputs a summary of the database. To obtain an answer of a query, the user runs a public evaluation algorithm which contains no information of the database. Outputting the summary runs in time d O(n1+ 2d+K ), and the evaluation algorithm for answering a query runs in time d+2+ 2d K ˜ O(n 2d+K ). Our mechanism is based on L∞ -approximation of (transformed) smooth functions by low degree even trigonometric polynomials with small and efﬁciently computable coefﬁcients. 1</p><p>5 0.76141155 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Expressive_Power_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">221 nips-2013-On the Expressive Power of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: James Martens, Arkadev Chattopadhya, Toni Pitassi, Richard Zemel</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the question: What kinds of distributions can be efﬁciently represented by Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)? We characterize the RBM’s unnormalized log-likelihood function as a type of neural network, and through a series of simulation results relate these networks to ones whose representational properties are better understood. We show the surprising result that RBMs can efﬁciently capture any distribution whose density depends on the number of 1’s in their input. We also provide the ﬁrst known example of a particular type of distribution that provably cannot be efﬁciently represented by an RBM, assuming a realistic exponential upper bound on the weights. By formally demonstrating that a relatively simple distribution cannot be represented efﬁciently by an RBM our results provide a new rigorous justiﬁcation for the use of potentially more expressive generative models, such as deeper ones. 1</p><p>6 0.74927568 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>

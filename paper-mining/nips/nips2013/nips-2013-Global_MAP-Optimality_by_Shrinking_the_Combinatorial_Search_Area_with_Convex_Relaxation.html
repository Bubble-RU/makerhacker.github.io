<p>Author: Srikrishna Sridhar, Stephen Wright, Christopher Re, Ji Liu, Victor Bittorf, Ce Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in machine learning can be solved by rounding the solution of an appropriate linear program (LP). This paper shows that we can recover solutions of comparable quality by rounding an approximate LP solution instead of the exact one. These approximate LP solutions can be computed efﬁciently by applying a parallel stochastic-coordinate-descent method to a quadratic-penalty formulation of the LP. We derive worst-case runtime and solution quality guarantees of this scheme using novel perturbation and convergence analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that on such combinatorial problems as vertex cover, independent set and multiway-cut, our approximate rounding scheme is up to an order of magnitude faster than Cplex (a commercial LP solver) while producing solutions of similar quality. 1</p><p>3 0.13236685 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Sensor_Selection_in_High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Trees_with_Nuisances.html">291 nips-2013-Sensor Selection in High-Dimensional Gaussian Trees with Nuisances</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel S. Levine, Jonathan P. How</p><p>Abstract: We consider the sensor selection problem on multivariate Gaussian distributions where only a subset of latent variables is of inferential interest. For pairs of vertices connected by a unique path in the graph, we show that there exist decompositions of nonlocal mutual information into local information measures that can be computed efﬁciently from the output of message passing algorithms. We integrate these decompositions into a computationally efﬁcient greedy selector where the computational expense of quantiﬁcation can be distributed across nodes in the network. Experimental results demonstrate the comparative efﬁciency of our algorithms for sensor selection in high-dimensional distributions. We additionally derive an online-computable performance bound based on augmentations of the relevant latent variable set that, when such a valid augmentation exists, is applicable for any distribution with nuisances. 1</p><p>4 0.096154243 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_via_Univariate_Exponential_Families.html">67 nips-2013-Conditional Random Fields via Univariate Exponential Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar, Genevera I. Allen, Zhandong Liu</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds, which model the distribution of a multivariate response conditioned on a set of covariates using undirected graphs, are widely used in a variety of multivariate prediction applications. Popular instances of this class of models, such as categorical-discrete CRFs, Ising CRFs, and conditional Gaussian based CRFs, are not well suited to the varied types of response variables in many applications, including count-valued responses. We thus introduce a novel subclass of CRFs, derived by imposing node-wise conditional distributions of response variables conditioned on the rest of the responses and the covariates as arising from univariate exponential families. This allows us to derive novel multivariate CRFs given any univariate exponential distribution, including the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential distributions. Also in particular, it addresses the common CRF problem of specifying “feature” functions determining the interactions between response variables and covariates. We develop a class of tractable penalized M -estimators to learn these CRF distributions from data, as well as a uniﬁed sparsistency analysis for this general class of CRFs showing exact structure recovery can be achieved with high probability. 1</p><p>5 0.092970625 <a title="132-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Estimation_of_Latently-grouped_Parameters_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models.html">46 nips-2013-Bayesian Estimation of Latently-grouped Parameters in Undirected Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Liu, David Page</p><p>Abstract: In large-scale applications of undirected graphical models, such as social networks and biological networks, similar patterns occur frequently and give rise to similar parameters. In this situation, it is beneﬁcial to group the parameters for more efﬁcient learning. We show that even when the grouping is unknown, we can infer these parameter groups during learning via a Bayesian approach. We impose a Dirichlet process prior on the parameters. Posterior inference usually involves calculating intractable terms, and we propose two approximation algorithms, namely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with auxiliary variables and a Gibbs sampling algorithm with “stripped” Beta approximation (Gibbs SBA). Simulations show that both algorithms outperform conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Gibbs SBA’s performance is close to Gibbs sampling with exact likelihood calculation. Models learned with Gibbs SBA also generalize better than the models learned by MLE on real-world Senate voting data. 1</p><p>6 0.085568413 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinwoo Shin, Andrew E. Gelfand, Misha Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: Max-product ‘belief propagation’ (BP) is a popular distributed heuristic for ﬁnding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint probability distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It was recently shown that BP converges to the correct MAP assignment for a class of loopy GMs with the following common feature: the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation to the MAP problem is tight (has no integrality gap). Unfortunately, tightness of the LP relaxation does not, in general, guarantee convergence and correctness of the BP algorithm. The failure of BP in such cases motivates reverse engineering a solution – namely, given a tight LP, can we design a ‘good’ BP algorithm. In this paper, we design a BP algorithm for the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem over general graphs. We prove that the algorithm converges to the correct optimum if the respective LP relaxation, which may include inequalities associated with non-intersecting odd-sized cycles, is tight. The most signiﬁcant part of our approach is the introduction of a novel graph transformation designed to force convergence of BP. Our theoretical result suggests an efﬁcient BP-based heuristic for the MWM problem, which consists of making sequential, “cutting plane”, modiﬁcations to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this heuristic performs as well as traditional cutting-plane algorithms using LP solvers on MWM problems. 1</p><p>4 0.64847285 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Sensor_Selection_in_High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Trees_with_Nuisances.html">291 nips-2013-Sensor Selection in High-Dimensional Gaussian Trees with Nuisances</a></p>

<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>6 0.59795308 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Marginals-to-Models_Reducibility.html">184 nips-2013-Marginals-to-Models Reducibility</a></p>

In this paper, we present a class of graph kernels with computational complexity O(n2 (m + log n + δ 2 + d)), where δ is the graph diameter, m is the number of edges, and d is the dimension of the node attributes. Due to the sparsity and small diameter of real-world graphs, these kernels typically scale comfortably to large graphs. In our experiments, the presented kernels outperform state-of-the-art kernels in terms of speed and accuracy on classiﬁcation benchmark datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.6926533 <a title="132-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Factorized_Asymptotic_Bayesian_Inference_for_Latent_Feature_Models.html">115 nips-2013-Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian Inference for Latent Feature Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Kohei Hayashi, Ryohei Fujimaki</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends factorized asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference for latent feature models (LFMs). FAB inference has not been applicable to models, including LFMs, without a speciﬁc condition on the Hessian matrix of a complete loglikelihood, which is required to derive a “factorized information criterion” (FIC). Our asymptotic analysis of the Hessian matrix of LFMs shows that FIC of LFMs has the same form as those of mixture models. FAB/LFMs have several desirable properties (e.g., automatic hidden states selection and parameter identiﬁability) and empirically perform better than state-of-the-art Indian Buffet processes in terms of model selection, prediction, and computational efﬁciency. 1</p><p>4 0.6766575 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Polar_Operators_for_Structured_Sparse_Estimation.html">249 nips-2013-Polar Operators for Structured Sparse Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Yao-Liang Yu, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Structured sparse estimation has become an important technique in many areas of data analysis. Unfortunately, these estimators normally create computational difﬁculties that entail sophisticated algorithms. Our ﬁrst contribution is to uncover a rich class of structured sparse regularizers whose polar operator can be evaluated efﬁciently. With such an operator, a simple conditional gradient method can then be developed that, when combined with smoothing and local optimization, significantly reduces training time vs. the state of the art. We also demonstrate a new reduction of polar to proximal maps that enables more efﬁcient latent fused lasso. 1</p><p>5 0.54175276 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Reshaping_Visual_Datasets_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">276 nips-2013-Reshaping Visual Datasets for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Boqing Gong, Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha</p><p>Abstract: In visual recognition problems, the common data distribution mismatches between training and testing make domain adaptation essential. However, image data is difﬁcult to manually divide into the discrete domains required by adaptation algorithms, and the standard practice of equating datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways (lighting, pose, background, resolution, etc.) We propose an approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets. Our formulation imposes two key properties on domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. By maximum distinctiveness, we require the underlying distributions of the identiﬁed domains to be different from each other to the maximum extent; by maximum learnability, we ensure that a strong discriminative model can be learned from the domain. We devise a nonparametric formulation and efﬁcient optimization procedure that can successfully discover domains among both training and test data. We extensively evaluate our approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.54166627 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Transportability_from_Multiple_Environments_with_Limited_Experiments.html">337 nips-2013-Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments</a></p>

<p>Author: Tamir Hazan, Subhransu Maji, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efﬁciently from Gibbs distributions. Speciﬁcally, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs’ distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical “high signal high coupling” regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds. 1</p><p>3 0.080193043 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Noisy_Labels.html">171 nips-2013-Learning with Noisy Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.078833409 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein_Inequality.html">242 nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein Inequality</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya O. Tolstikhin, Yevgeny Seldin</p><p>Abstract: We present a PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality. The inequality is based on a combination of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique with an Empirical Bernstein bound. We show that when the empirical variance is signiﬁcantly smaller than the empirical loss the PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is signiﬁcantly tighter than the PAC-Bayes-kl inequality of Seeger (2002) and otherwise it is comparable. Our theoretical analysis is conﬁrmed empirically on a synthetic example and several UCI datasets. The PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is an interesting example of an application of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique to self-bounding functions. 1</p><p>5 0.078274801 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Latent_Structured_Active_Learning.html">149 nips-2013-Latent Structured Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenjie Luo, Alex Schwing, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present active learning algorithms in the context of structured prediction problems. To reduce the amount of labeling necessary to learn good models, our algorithms operate with weakly labeled data and we query additional examples based on entropies of local marginals, which are a good surrogate for uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of 3D layout prediction from single images, and show that good models are learned when labeling only a handful of random variables. In particular, the same performance as using the full training set can be obtained while only labeling ∼10% of the random variables. 1</p><p>6 0.073877908 <a title="152-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Structured_Learning_via_Logistic_Regression.html">318 nips-2013-Structured Learning via Logistic Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Justin Domke, Xianghang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Inference in general Ising models is difﬁcult, due to high treewidth making treebased algorithms intractable. Moreover, when interactions are strong, Gibbs sampling may take exponential time to converge to the stationary distribution. We present an algorithm to project Ising model parameters onto a parameter set that is guaranteed to be fast mixing, under several divergences. We ﬁnd that Gibbs sampling using the projected parameters is more accurate than with the original parameters when interaction strengths are strong and when limited time is available for sampling.</p><p>3 0.67089748 <a title="152-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-On_Sampling_from_the_Gibbs_Distribution_with_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Perturbations.html">218 nips-2013-On Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution with Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations</a></p>

<p>Author: Justin Domke</p><p>Abstract: A successful approach to structured learning is to write the learning objective as a joint function of linear parameters and inference messages, and iterate between updates to each. This paper observes that if the inference problem is “smoothed” through the addition of entropy terms, for ﬁxed messages, the learning objective reduces to a traditional (non-structured) logistic regression problem with respect to parameters. In these logistic regression problems, each training example has a bias term determined by the current set of messages. Based on this insight, the structured energy function can be extended from linear factors to any function class where an “oracle” exists to minimize a logistic loss.</p><p>5 0.60009158 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_as_iterated_random_functions_with__applications_to_sequential_inference_in_graphical_models.html">52 nips-2013-Bayesian inference as iterated random functions with  applications to sequential inference in graphical models</a></p>

A convergence theory for iterated random functions is presented. As an application of the general theory we analyze convergence behaviors of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms that arise in a sequential change point detection problem formulated via a latent variable directed graphical model. The sequential inference algorithm and its supporting theory are illustrated by simulated examples.</p><p>6 0.58775347 <a title="152-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_to_Pass_Expectation_Propagation_Messages.html">168 nips-2013-Learning to Pass Expectation Propagation Messages</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Bartz, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Analytic shrinkage is a statistical technique that offers a fast alternative to crossvalidation for the regularization of covariance matrices and has appealing consistency properties. We show that the proof of consistency requires bounds on the growth rates of eigenvalues and their dispersion, which are often violated in data. We prove consistency under assumptions which do not restrict the covariance structure and therefore better match real world data. In addition, we propose an extension of analytic shrinkage –orthogonal complement shrinkage– which adapts to the covariance structure. Finally we demonstrate the superior performance of our novel approach on data from the domains of ﬁnance, spoken letter and optical character recognition, and neuroscience. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76136905 <a title="152-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Efficient_Random_Maximum_A-Posteriori_Predictors_with_Non-Decomposable_Loss_Functions.html">152 nips-2013-Learning Efficient Random Maximum A-Posteriori Predictors with Non-Decomposable Loss Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Shi</p><p>Abstract: The sparse additive model for text modeling involves the sum-of-exp computing, whose cost is consuming for large scales. Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB) and obtains simple yet efﬁcient estimation. Particularly, employing a double majorization bound, we approximate log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound without the log-sumexp terms. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and ℓ1 -norm regularizers. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the optimization task of SAM-LRB can be transformed into the same form as in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efﬁciently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios. Experiments on three real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of SAM-LRB, compared with a few state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>4 0.70903867 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Dynamic_Parameters_in_Social_Networks.html">228 nips-2013-Online Learning of Dynamic Parameters in Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Shahin Shahrampour, Sasha Rakhlin, Ali Jadbabaie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online learning in a dynamic setting. We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a ﬁnite time. 1</p><p>5 0.69975865 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-Ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish theoretical results concerning local optima of regularized M estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex. Our results show that as long as the loss satisﬁes restricted strong convexity and the penalty satisﬁes suitable regularity conditions, any local optimum of the composite objective lies within statistical precision of the true parameter vector. Our theory covers a broad class of nonconvex objective functions, including corrected versions of the Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models and regression in generalized linear models using nonconvex regularizers such as SCAD and MCP. On the optimization side, we show that a simple adaptation of composite gradient descent may be used to compute a global optimum up to the statistical precision stat in log(1/ stat ) iterations, the fastest possible rate for any ﬁrst-order method. We provide simulations to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.68043363 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Accelerating_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_using_Predictive_Variance_Reduction.html">20 nips-2013-Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction</a></p>

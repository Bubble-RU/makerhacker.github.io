<p>Author: Dahua Lin</p><p>Abstract: Reliance on computationally expensive algorithms for inference has been limiting the use of Bayesian nonparametric models in large scale applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian learning algorithm for DP mixture models. Instead of following the conventional paradigm – random initialization plus iterative update, we take an progressive approach. Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the ﬂy when needed. The algorithm can reliably estimate a DP mixture model in one pass, making it particularly suited for applications with massive data. Experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate remarkable improvement on efﬁciency – orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>3 0.17866464 <a title="187-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Parallel_Sampling_of_DP_Mixture_Models_using_Sub-Cluster_Splits.html">243 nips-2013-Parallel Sampling of DP Mixture Models using Sub-Cluster Splits</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Chang, John W. Fisher III</p><p>Abstract: We present an MCMC sampler for Dirichlet process mixture models that can be parallelized to achieve signiﬁcant computational gains. We combine a nonergodic, restricted Gibbs iteration with split/merge proposals in a manner that produces an ergodic Markov chain. Each cluster is augmented with two subclusters to construct likely split moves. Unlike some previous parallel samplers, the proposed sampler enforces the correct stationary distribution of the Markov chain without the need for ﬁnite approximations. Empirical results illustrate that the new sampler exhibits better convergence properties than current methods. 1</p><p>4 0.10821798 <a title="187-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Memory_Limited%2C_Streaming_PCA.html">188 nips-2013-Memory Limited, Streaming PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Mitliagkas, Constantine Caramanis, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider streaming, one-pass principal component analysis (PCA), in the highdimensional regime, with limited memory. Here, p-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the k-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require O(p2 ) memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than O(kp) memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the spiked covariance model, where p-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, n, scales proportionally with the dimension, p. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity O(p2 ). Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity O(kp) do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to p. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses O(kp) memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the k-dimensional spike with O(p log p) samplecomplexity – the ﬁrst algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the spiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful on much more general models for the data. 1</p><p>5 0.10048827 <a title="187-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Active_Learning_for_Probabilistic_Hypotheses_Using_the_Maximum_Gibbs_Error_Criterion.html">23 nips-2013-Active Learning for Probabilistic Hypotheses Using the Maximum Gibbs Error Criterion</a></p>
<p>Author: Nguyen Viet Cuong, Wee Sun Lee, Nan Ye, Kian Ming A. Chai, Hai Leong Chieu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new objective function for pool-based Bayesian active learning with probabilistic hypotheses. This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classiﬁer drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classiﬁer selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a ﬁxed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random ﬁelds and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classiﬁcation task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models. 1</p><p>6 0.098283507 <a title="187-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Online_Inference_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Relational_Models.html">104 nips-2013-Efficient Online Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Relational Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeffrey W. Miller, Matthew T. Harrison</p><p>Abstract: For data assumed to come from a ﬁnite mixture with an unknown number of components, it has become common to use Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) not only for density estimation, but also for inferences about the number of components. The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the number of clusters — that is, the posterior on the number of components represented in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent — it does not concentrate at the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a “mixture” with one standard normal component. Further, we show that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster converges (in probability) to 0. 1</p><p>5 0.55466276 <a title="187-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>6 0.54748839 <a title="187-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Streaming_Variational_Bayes.html">317 nips-2013-Streaming Variational Bayes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the design of strategies for market making in an exchange. A market maker generally seeks to proﬁt from the difference between the buy and sell price of an asset, yet the market maker also takes exposure risk in the event of large price movements. Proﬁt guarantees for market making strategies have typically required certain stochastic assumptions on the price ﬂuctuations of the asset in question; for example, assuming a model in which the price process is mean reverting. We propose a class of “spread-based” market making strategies whose performance can be controlled even under worst-case (adversarial) settings. We prove structural properties of these strategies which allows us to design a master algorithm which obtains low regret relative to the best such strategy in hindsight. We run a set of experiments showing favorable performance on recent real-world stock price data. 1</p><p>2 0.98724502 <a title="187-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Adaptivity_to_Local_Smoothness_and_Dimension_in_Kernel_Regression.html">31 nips-2013-Adaptivity to Local Smoothness and Dimension in Kernel Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the ﬁrst differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case. 1</p><p>4 0.97861832 <a title="187-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Kiraly, Louis Theran</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>5 0.94913018 <a title="187-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_Finite_State_Transducers.html">342 nips-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Bailly, Xavier Carreras, Ariadna Quattoni</p><p>Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FST) are a standard tool for modeling paired inputoutput sequences and are used in numerous applications, ranging from computational biology to natural language processing. Recently Balle et al. [4] presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as ﬁnding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identiﬁability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efﬁciently. 1</p><p>6 0.93884337 <a title="187-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Bonald, Alexandre Proutiere</p><p>Abstract: We consider an inﬁnite-armed bandit problem with Bernoulli rewards. The mean rewards are independent, uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. Rewards 0 and 1 are referred to as a success and a failure, respectively. We propose a novel algorithm where the decision to exploit any arm is based on two successive targets, namely, the total number of successes until the ﬁrst failure and until the ﬁrst m failures, respectively, where m is a ﬁxed parameter. This two-target algorithm achieves a √ long-term average regret in 2n for a large parameter m and a known time horizon n. This regret is optimal and strictly less than the regret achieved by the best √ known algorithms, which is in 2 n. The results are extended to any mean-reward distribution whose support contains 1 and to unknown time horizons. Numerical experiments show the performance of the algorithm for ﬁnite time horizons. 1</p><p>3 0.42710981 <a title="95-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Sequential_Transfer_in_Multi-armed_Bandit_with_Finite_Set_of_Models.html">292 nips-2013-Sequential Transfer in Multi-armed Bandit with Finite Set of Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi azar, Alessandro Lazaric, Emma Brunskill</p><p>Abstract: Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is critical for building lifelong learning agents. Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may signiﬁcantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of sequential transfer in online learning, notably in the multi–armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the total regret over a sequence of tasks by transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for estimating the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it. 1</p><p>4 0.30933934 <a title="95-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Thompson_Sampling_for_1-Dimensional_Exponential_Family_Bandits.html">330 nips-2013-Thompson Sampling for 1-Dimensional Exponential Family Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathaniel Korda, Emilie Kaufmann, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a ﬁnite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families. 1</p><p>5 0.29116672 <a title="95-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Prior-free_and_prior-dependent_regret_bounds_for_Thompson_Sampling.html">253 nips-2013-Prior-free and prior-dependent regret bounds for Thompson Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastien Bubeck, Che-Yu Liu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with a prior distribution on the reward distributions. We are interested in studying prior-free and priordependent regret bounds, very much in the same spirit than the usual distributionfree and distribution-dependent bounds for the non-Bayesian stochastic bandit. We ﬁrst show that Thompson Sampling attains an optimal prior-free bound in the sense that for any prior distribution its Bayesian regret is bounded from above by √ 14 nK. This result is unimprovable in the sense that there exists a prior distribution such that any algorithm has a Bayesian regret bounded from below by √ 1 20 nK. We also study the case of priors for the setting of Bubeck et al. [2013] (where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the smallest gap) and we show that in this case the regret of Thompson Sampling is in fact uniformly bounded over time, thus showing that Thompson Sampling can greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these priors. 1</p><p>6 0.26106602 <a title="95-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Forgetful_Bayes_and_myopic_planning%3A_Human_learning_and_decision-making_in_a_bandit_setting.html">124 nips-2013-Forgetful Bayes and myopic planning: Human learning and decision-making in a bandit setting</a></p>

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the following new variant of prototype learning, called k-prototype learning problem for 3D rigid structures: Given a set of 3D rigid structures, ﬁnd a set of k rigid structures so that each of them is a prototype for a cluster of the given rigid structures and the total cost (or dissimilarity) is minimized. Prototype learning is a core problem in machine learning and has a wide range of applications in many areas. Existing results on this problem have mainly focused on the graph domain. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst algorithm for learning multiple prototypes from 3D rigid structures. Our result is based on a number of new insights to rigid structures alignment, clustering, and prototype reconstruction, and is practically efﬁcient with quality guarantee. We validate our approach using two type of data sets, random data and biological data of chromosome territories. Experiments suggest that our approach can effectively learn prototypes in both types of data. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85225892 <a title="95-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Exploration_in_Multi-Armed_Bandits.html">95 nips-2013-Distributed Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits</a></p>

<p>Author: Abbas Edalat</p><p>Abstract: We solve the mean ﬁeld equations for a stochastic Hopﬁeld network with temperature (noise) in the presence of strong, i.e., multiply stored, patterns, and use this solution to obtain the storage capacity of such a network. Our result provides for the ﬁrst time a rigorous solution of the mean ﬁled equations for the standard Hopﬁeld model and is in contrast to the mathematically unjustiﬁable replica technique that has been used hitherto for this derivation. We show that the critical temperature for stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree or multiplicity, when the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns is negligible compared to the network size. In the case of a single strong pattern, when the ratio of the number of all stored pattens and the network size is a positive constant, we obtain the distribution of the overlaps of the patterns with the mean ﬁeld and deduce that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for retrieving a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong pattern. This square law property provides justiﬁcation for using strong patterns to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in psychology and psychotherapy. 1 Introduction: Multiply learned patterns in Hopﬁeld networks The Hopﬁeld network as a model of associative memory and unsupervised learning was introduced in [23] and has been intensively studied from a wide range of viewpoints in the past thirty years. However, properties of a strong pattern, as a pattern that has been multiply stored or learned in these networks, have only been examined very recently, a surprising delay given that repetition of an activity is the basis of learning by the Hebbian rule and long term potentiation. In particular, while the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network with certain correlated patterns has been tackled [13, 25], the storage capacity of a Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong as well as random patterns has not been hitherto addressed. The notion of a strong pattern of a Hopﬁeld network has been proposed in [15] to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in developmental psychology and psychotherapy. This suggestion has been motivated by reviewing the pioneering work of Bowlby [9] in attachment theory and highlighting how a number of academic biologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists and neuroscientists have consistently regarded Hopﬁeld-like artiﬁcial neural networks as suitable tools to model cognitive and behavioural constructs as patterns that are deeply and repeatedly learned by individuals [11, 22, 24, 30, 29, 10]. A number of mathematical properties of strong patterns in Hopﬁeld networks, which give rise to strong attractors, have been derived in [15]. These show in particular that strong attractors are strongly stable; a series of experiments have also been carried out which conﬁrm the mathematical 1 results and also indicate that a strong pattern stored in the network can be retrieved even in the presence of a large number of simple patterns, far exceeding the well-known maximum load parameter or storage capacity of the Hopﬁeld network with random patterns (αc ≈ 0.138). In this paper, we consider strong patterns in stochastic Hopﬁeld model with temperature, which accounts for various types of noise in the network. In these networks, the updating rule is probabilistic and depend on the temperature. Since analytical solution of such a system is not possible in general, one strives to obtain the average behaviour of the network when the input to each node, the so-called ﬁeld at the node, is replaced with its mean. This is the basis of mean ﬁeld theory for these networks. Due to the close connection between the Hopﬁeld network and the Ising model in ferromagnetism [1, 8], the mean ﬁeld approach for the Hopﬁeld network and its variations has been tackled using the replica method, starting with the pioneering work of Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky [3, 2, 4, 19, 31, 1, 13]. Although this method has been widely used in the theory of spin glasses in statistical physics [26, 16] its mathematical justiﬁcation has proved to be elusive as we will discuss in the next section; see for example [20, page 264], [14, page 27], and [7, page 9]. In [17] and independently in [27], an alternative technique to the replica method for solving the mean ﬁeld equations has been proposed which is reproduced and characterised as heuristic in [20, section 2.5] since it relies on a number of assumptions that are not later justiﬁed and uses a number of mathematical steps that are not validated. Here, we use the basic idea of the above heuristic to develop a veriﬁable mathematical framework with provable results grounded on elements of probability theory, with which we assume the reader is familiar. This technique allows us to solve the mean ﬁeld equations for the Hopﬁeld network in the presence of strong patterns and use the results to study, ﬁrst, the stability of these patterns in the presence of temperature (noise) and, second, the storage capacity of the network with a single strong pattern at temperature zero. We show that the critical temperature for the stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree (i.e., its multiplicity) when the ratio of the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns to the network size tends to zero when the latter tends to inﬁnity. In the case that there is only one strong pattern present with its degree small compared to the number of patterns and the latter is a ﬁxed multiple of the number of nodes, we ﬁnd the distribution of the overlap of the mean ﬁeld and the patterns when the strong pattern is being retrieved. We use these distributions to prove that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong attractor. This result matches the ﬁnding in [15] regarding the capacity of a network to recall strong patterns as mentioned above. Our results therefore show that strong patterns are robust and persistent in the network memory as attachment types and behavioural prototypes are in the human memory system. In this paper, we will several times use Lyapunov’s theorem in probability which provides a simple sufﬁcient condition to generalise the Central Limit theorem when we deal with independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. We require a general form of this theorem kn as follows. Let Yn = N i=1 Yni , for n ∈ I , be a triangular array of random variables such that for each n, the random variables Yni , for 1 ≤ i ≤ kn are independent with E(Yni ) = 0 2 2 and E(Yni ) = σni , where E(X) stands for the expected value of the random variable X. Let kn 2 2 sn = i=1 σni . We use the notation X ∼ Y when the two random variables X and Y have the same distribution (for large n if either or both of them depend on n). Theorem 1.1 (Lyapunov’s theorem [6, page 368]) If for some δ > 0, we have the condition: 1 E(|Yn |2+δ |) → 0 s2+δ n d d as n → ∞ then s1 Yn −→ N (0, 1) as n → ∞ where −→ denotes convergence in distribution, and we denote n by N (a, σ 2 ) the normal distribution with mean a and variance σ 2 . Thus, for large n we have Yn ∼ N (0, s2 ). n 2 2 Mean ﬁeld theory We consider a Hopﬁeld network with N neurons i = 1, . . . , N with values Si = ±1 and follow the notations in [20]. As in [15], we assume patterns can be multiply stored and the degree of a pattern is deﬁned as its multiplicity. The total number of patterns, counting their multiplicity, is denoted by p and we assume there are n patterns ξ 1 , . . . , ξ n with degrees d1 , . . . , dn ≥ 1 respectively and that n the remaining p − k=1 dk ≥ 0 patterns are simple, i.e., each has degree one. Note that by our assumptions there are precisely n p0 = p + n − dk k=1 distinct patterns, which we assume are independent and identically distributed with equal probability of taking value ±1 for each node. More generally, for any non-negative integer k ∈ I , we let N p0 dk . µ pk = µ=1 p µ µ 0 1 We use the generalized Hebbian rule for the synaptic couplings: wij = N µ=1 dµ ξi ξj for i = j with wii = 0 for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N . As in the standard stochastic Hopﬁeld model [20], we use Glauber dynamics [18] for the stochastic updating rule with pseudo-temperature T > 0, which accounts for various types of noise in the network, and assume zero bias in the local ﬁeld. Putting β = 1/T (i.e., with the Boltzmann constant kB = 1) and letting fβ (h) = 1/(1 + exp(−2βh)), the stochastic updating rule at time t is given by: N Pr(Si (t + 1) = ±1) = fβ (±hi (t)), where hi (t) = wij Sj (t), (1) j=1 is the local ﬁeld at i at time t. The updating is implemented asynchronously in a random way. The energy of the network in the conﬁguration S = (Si )N is given by i=1 N 1 Si Sj wij . H(S) = − 2 i,j=1 For large N , this speciﬁes a complex system, with an underlying state space of dimension 2N , which in general cannot be solved exactly. However, mean ﬁeld theory has proved very useful in studying Hopﬁeld networks. The average updated value of Si (t + 1) in Equation (1) is Si (t + 1) = 1/(1 + e−2βhi (t) ) − 1/(1 + e2βhi (t) ) = tanh(βhi (t)), (2) where . . . denotes taking average with respect to the probability distribution in the updating rule in Equation (1). The stationary solution for the mean ﬁeld thus satisﬁes: Si = tanh(βhi ) , (3) The average overlap of pattern ξ µ with the mean ﬁeld at the nodes of the network is given by: mν = 1 N N ν ξi Si (4) i=1 The replica technique for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, used in the case p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞, seeks to obtain the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) by evaluating the partition function of the system, namely, Z = TrS exp(−βH(S)), where the trace TrS stands for taking sum over all possible conﬁgurations S = (Si )N . As it i=1 is generally the case in statistical physics, once the partition function of the system is obtained, 3 all required physical quantities can in principle be computed. However, in this case, the partition function is very difﬁcult to compute since it entails computing the average log Z of log Z, where . . . indicates averaging over the random distribution of the stored patterns ξ µ . To overcome this problem, the identity Zk − 1 log Z = lim k→0 k is used to reduce the problem to ﬁnding the average Z k of Z k , which is then computed for positive integer values of k. For such k, we have: Z k = TrS 1 TrS 2 . . . TrS k exp(−β(H(S 1 ) + H(S 1 ) + . . . + H(S k ))), where for each i = 1, . . . , k the super-scripted conﬁguration S i is a replica of the conﬁguration state. In computing the trace over each replica, various parameters are obtained and the replica symmetry condition assumes that these parameters are independent of the particular replica under consideration. Apart from this assumption, there are two basic mathematical problems with the technique which makes it unjustiﬁable [20, page 264]. Firstly, the positive integer k above is eventually treated as a real number near zero without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Secondly, the order of taking limits, in particular the order of taking the two limits k → 0 and N → ∞, are several times interchanged again without any mathematical justiﬁcation. Here, we develop a mathematically rigorous method for solving the mean ﬁeld problem, i.e., computing the average of the overlaps in Equation (4) in the case of p/N = α > 0 as N → ∞. Our method turns the basic idea of the heuristic presented in [17] and reproduced in [20] for solving the mean ﬁeld equation into a mathematically veriﬁable formalism, which for the standard Hopﬁeld network with random stored patterns gives the same result as the replica method, assuming replica symmetry. In the presence of strong patterns we obtain a set of new results as explained in the next two sections. The mean ﬁeld equation is obtained from Equation (3) by approximating the right hand side of N this equation by the value of tanh at the mean ﬁeld hi = j=1 wij Sj , ignoring the sum N j=1 wij (Sj − Sj ) for large N [17, page 32]: Si = tanh(β hi ) = tanh β N N j=1 p0 µ=1 µ µ dµ ξi ξj Sj . (5) Equation (5) gives the mean ﬁeld equation for the Hopﬁeld network with n possible strong patterns n ξ µ (1 ≤ µ ≤ n) and p − µ=1 dµ simple patterns ξ µ with n + 1 ≤ µ ≤ p0 . As in the standard Hopﬁeld model, where all patterns are simple, we have two cases to deal with. However, we now have to account for the presence of strong attractors and our two cases will be as follows: (i) In the p0 ﬁrst case we assume p2 := µ=1 d2 = o(N ), which includes the simpler case p2 N when p2 µ is ﬁxed and independent of N . (ii) In the second case we assume we have a single strong attractor with the load parameter p/N = α > 0. 3 Stability of strong patterns with noise: p2 = o(N ) The case of constant p and N → ∞ is usually referred to as α = 0 in the standard Hopﬁeld model. Here, we need to consider the sum of degrees of all stored patterns (and not just the number of patterns) compared to N . We solve the mean ﬁeld equation with T > 0 by using a method similar in spirit to [20, page 33] for the standard Hopﬁeld model, but in our case strong patterns induce a sequence of independent but non-identically distributed random variables in the crosstalk term, where the Central Limit Theorem cannot be used; we show however that Lyapunov’s theorem (Theorem (1.1) can be invoked. In retrieving pattern ξ 1 , we look for a solution of the mean ﬁled 1 equation of the form: Si = mξi , where m > 0 is a constant. Using Equation (5) and separating 1 the contribution of ξ in the argument of tanh, we obtain:  1 mξi = tanh    mβ  1 d1 ξi + N 4 µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj  . j=i,µ>1 (6) For each N , µ > 1 and j = i, let dµ µ µ 1 (7) ξ ξ ξ . N i j j 2 This gives (p0 − 1)(N − 1) independent random variables with E(YN µj ) = 0, E(YN µj ) = d2 /N 2 , µ 3 3 3 and E(|YN µj |) = dµ /N . We have: YN µj = s2 := N 2 E(YN µj ) = µ>1,j=i 1 N −1 d2 ∼ N 2 µ>1 µ N d2 . µ (8) µ>1 Thus, as N → ∞, we have: 1 s3 N 3 E(|YN µj |) ∼ √ µ>1,j=i µ>1 N( d3 µ µ>1 d2 )3/2 µ → 0. (9) as N → ∞ since for positive numbers dµ we always have µ>1 d3 < ( µ>1 d2 )3/2 . Thus the µ µ Lyapunov condition is satisﬁed for δ = 1. By Lyapunov’s theorem we deduce: 1 N µ µ 1 dµ ξi ξj ξj ∼ N d2 /N µ 0, (10) µ>1 µ>1,j=i Since we also have p2 = o(N ), it follows that we can ignore the second term, i.e., the crosstalk term, in the argument of tanh in Equation (6) as N → ∞; we thus obtain: m = tanh βd1 m. (11) To examine the ﬁxed points of the Equation (11), we let d = d1 for convenience and put x = βdm = dm/T , so that tanh x = T x/d; see Figure 1. It follows that Tc = d is the critical temperature. If T < d then there is a non-zero (non-trivial) solution for m, whereas for T > d we only have the trivial solution. For d = 1 our solution is that of the standard Hopﬁeld network as in [20, page 34].

<p>Author: Ryan D. Turner, Steven Bottone, Clay J. Stanek</p><p>Abstract: The Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm provides an efﬁcient way to do exact inference when the parameters of an underlying model may suddenly change over time. BOCPD requires computation of the underlying model’s posterior predictives, which can only be computed online in O(1) time and memory for exponential family models. We develop variational approximations to the posterior on change point times (formulated as run lengths) for efﬁcient inference when the underlying model is not in the exponential family, and does not have tractable posterior predictive distributions. In doing so, we develop improvements to online variational inference. We apply our methodology to a tracking problem using radar data with a signal-to-noise feature that is Rice distributed. We also develop a variational method for inferring the parameters of the (non-exponential family) Rice distribution. Change point detection has been applied to many applications [5; 7]. In recent years there have been great improvements to the Bayesian approaches via the Bayesian online change point detection algorithm (BOCPD) [1; 23; 27]. Likewise, the radar tracking community has been improving in its use of feature-aided tracking [10]: methods that use auxiliary information from radar returns such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which depend on radar cross sections (RCS) [21]. Older systems would often ﬁlter only noisy position (and perhaps Doppler) measurements while newer systems use more information to improve performance. We use BOCPD for modeling the RCS feature. Whereas BOCPD inference could be done exactly when ﬁnding change points in conjugate exponential family models the physics of RCS measurements often causes them to be distributed in non-exponential family ways, often following a Rice distribution. To do inference efﬁciently we call upon variational Bayes (VB) to ﬁnd approximate posterior (predictive) distributions. Furthermore, the nature of both BOCPD and tracking require the use of online updating. We improve upon the existing and limited approaches to online VB [24; 13]. This paper produces contributions to, and builds upon background from, three independent areas: change point detection, variational Bayes, and radar tracking. Although the emphasis in machine learning is on ﬁltering, a substantial part of tracking with radar data involves data association, illustrated in Figure 1. Observations of radar returns contain measurements from multiple objects (targets) in the sky. If we knew which radar return corresponded to which target we would be presented with NT ∈ N0 independent ﬁltering problems; Kalman ﬁlters [14] (or their nonlinear extensions) are applied to “average out” the kinematic errors in the measurements (typically positions) using the measurements associated with each target. The data association problem is to determine which measurement goes to which track. In the classical setup, once a particular measurement is associated with a certain target, that measurement is plugged into the ﬁlter for that target as if we knew with certainty it was the correct assignment. The association algorithms, in effect, ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate on the measurement-to-track association. However, approaches such as the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) ﬁlter [2] and the probability hypothesis density (PHD) ﬁlter [16] have deviated from this. 1 To ﬁnd the MAP estimate a log likelihood of the data under each possible assignment vector a must be computed. These are then used to construct cost matrices that reduce the assignment problem to a particular kind of optimization problem (the details of which are beyond the scope of this paper). The motivation behind feature-aided tracking is that additional features increase the probability that the MAP measurement-to-track assignment is correct. Based on physical arguments the RCS feature (SNR) is often Rice distributed [21, Ch. 3]; although, in certain situations RCS is exponential or gamma distributed [26]. The parameters of the RCS distribution are determined by factors such as the shape of the aircraft facing the radar sensor. Given that different aircraft have different RCS characteristics, if one attempts to create a continuous track estimating the path of an aircraft, RCS features may help distinguish one aircraft from another if they cross paths or come near one another, for example. RCS also helps distinguish genuine aircraft returns from clutter: a ﬂock of birds or random electrical noise, for example. However, the parameters of the RCS distributions may also change for the same aircraft due to a change in angle or ground conditions. These must be taken into account for accurate association. Providing good predictions in light of a possible sudden change in the parameters of a time series is “right up the alley” of BOCPD and change point methods. The original BOCPD papers [1; 11] studied sudden changes in the parameters of exponential family models for time series. In this paper, we expand the set of applications of BOCPD to radar SNR data which often has the same change point structure found in other applications, and requires online predictions. The BOCPD model is highly modular in that it looks for changes in the parameters of any underlying process model (UPM). The UPM merely needs to provide posterior predictive probabilities, the UPM can otherwise be a “black box.” The BOCPD queries the UPM for a prediction of the next data point under each possible run length, the number of points since the last change point. If (and only if by Hipp [12]) the UPM is exponential family (with a conjugate prior) the posterior is computed by accumulating the sufﬁcient statistics since the last potential change point. This allows for O(1) UPM updates in both computation and memory as the run length increases. We motivate the use of VB for implementing UPMs when the data within a regime is believed to follow a distribution that is not exponential family. The methods presented in this paper can be used to ﬁnd variational run length posteriors for general non-exponential family UPMs in addition to the Rice distribution. Additionally, the methods for improving online updating in VB (Section 2.2) are applicable in areas outside of change point detection.

The clutter measurements (birds in this case) are shown with black dots (·). The distributions on the SNR (RCS) for each track (blue and red) and the clutter (black) are shown on the right. To our knowledge this paper is the ﬁrst to demonstrate how to compute Bayesian posterior distributions on the parameters of a Rice distribution; the closest work would be Lauwers et al. [15], which computes a MAP estimate. Other novel factors of this paper include: demonstrating the usefulness (and advantages over existing techniques) of change point detection for RCS estimation and tracking; and applying variational inference for UPMs where analytic posterior predictives are not possible. This paper provides four main technical contributions: 1) VB inference for inferring the parameters of a Rice distribution. 2) General improvements to online VB (which is then applied to updating the UPM in BOCPD). 3) Derive a VB approximation to the run length posterior when the UPM posterior predictive is intractable. 4) Handle censored measurements (particularly for a Rice distribution) in VB. This is key for processing missed detections in data association. 2 1 Background In this section we brieﬂy review the three areas of background: BOCPD, VB, and tracking. 1.1 Bayesian Online Change Point Detection We brieﬂy summarize the model setup and notation for the BOCPD algorithm; see [27, Ch. 5] for a detailed description. We assume we have a time series with n observations so far y1 , . . . , yn ∈ Y. In effect, BOCPD performs message passing to do online inference on the run length rn ∈ 0:n − 1, the number of observations since the last change point. Given an underlying predictive model (UPM) and a hazard function h, we can compute an exact posterior over the run length rn . Conditional on a run length, the UPM produces a sequential prediction on the next data point using all the data since the last change point: p(yn |y(r) , Θm ) where (r) := (n − r):(n − 1). The UPM is a simpler model where the parameters θ change at every change point and are modeled as being sampled from a prior with hyper-parameters Θm . The canonical example of a UPM would be a Gaussian whose mean and variance change at every change point. The online updates are summarized as: P (rn |rn−1 ) p(yn |rn−1 , y(r) ) p(rn−1 , y1:n−1 ) . msgn := p(rn , y1:n ) = rn−1 hazard UPM (1) msgn−1 Unless rn = 0, the sum in (1) only contains one term since the only possibility is that rn−1 = rn −1. The indexing convention is such that if rn = 0 then yn+1 is the ﬁrst observation sampled from the new parameters θ. The marginal posterior predictive on the next data point is easily calculated as: p(yn+1 |y1:n ) = p(yn+1 |y(r) )P (rn |y1:n ) . (2) rn Thus, the predictions from BOCPD fully integrate out any uncertainty in θ. The message updates (1) perform exact inference under a model where the number of change points is not known a priori. BOCPD RCS Model We show the Rice UPM as an example as it is required for our application. The data within a regime are assumed to be iid Rice observations, with a normal-gamma prior: yn ∼ Rice(ν, σ) , ν ∼ N (µ0 , σ 2 /λ0 ) , σ −2 =: τ ∼ Gamma(α0 , β0 ) (3) 2 =⇒ p(yn |ν, σ) = yn τ exp(−τ (yn + ν 2 )/2)I0 (yn ντ )I{yn ≥ 0} (4) where I0 (·) is a modiﬁed Bessel function of order zero, which is what excludes the Rice distribution from the exponential family. Although the normal-gamma is not conjugate to a Rice it will enable us to use the VB-EM algorithm. The UPM parameters are the Rice shape1 ν ∈ R and scale σ ∈ R+ , θ := {ν, σ}, and the hyper-parameters are the normal-gamma parameters Θm := {µ0 , λ0 , α0 , β0 }. Every change point results in a new value for ν and σ being sampled. A posterior on θ is maintained for each run length, i.e. every possible starting point for the current regime, and is updated at each new data point. Therefore, BOCPD maintains n distinct posteriors on θ, and although this can be reduced with pruning, it necessitates posterior updates on θ that are computationally efﬁcient. Note that the run length updates in (1) require the UPM to provide predictive log likelihoods at all sample sizes rn (including zero). Therefore, UPM implementations using such approximations as plug-in MLE predictions will not work very well. The MLE may not even be deﬁned for run lengths smaller than the number of UPM parameters |θ|. For a Rice UPM, the efﬁcient O(1) updating in exponential family models by using a conjugate prior and accumulating sufﬁcient statistics is not possible. This motivates the use of VB methods for approximating the UPM predictions. 1.2 Variational Bayes We follow the framework of VB where when computation of the exact posterior distribution p(θ|y1:n ) is intractable it is often possible to create a variational approximation q(θ) that is locally optimal in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence KL(q p) while constraining q to be in a certain family of distributions Q. In general this is done by optimizing a lower bound L(q) on the evidence log p(y1:n ), using either gradient based methods or standard ﬁxed point equations. 1 The shape ν is usually assumed to be positive (∈ R+ ); however, there is nothing wrong with using a negative ν as Rice(x|ν, σ) = Rice(x|−ν, σ). It also allows for use of a normal-gamma prior. 3 The VB-EM Algorithm In many cases, such as the Rice UPM, the derivation of the VB ﬁxed point equations can be simpliﬁed by applying the VB-EM algorithm [3]. VB-EM is applicable to models that are conjugate-exponential (CE) after being augmented with latent variables x1:n . A model is CE if: 1) The complete data likelihood p(x1:n , y1:n |θ) is an exponential family distribution; and 2) the prior p(θ) is a conjugate prior for the complete data likelihood p(x1:n , y1:n |θ). We only have to constrain the posterior q(θ, x1:n ) = q(θ)q(x1:n ) to factorize between the latent variables and the parameters; we do not constrain the posterior to be of any particular parametric form. Requiring the complete likelihood to be CE is a much weaker condition than requiring the marginal on the observed data p(y1:n |θ) to be CE. Consider a mixture of Gaussians: the model becomes CE when augmented with latent variables (class labels). This is also the case for the Rice distribution (Section 2.1). Like the ordinary EM algorithm [9] the VB-EM algorithm alternates between two steps: 1) Find the posterior of the latent variables treating the expected natural parameters η := Eq(θ) [η] as correct: ¯ q(xi ) ← p(xi |yi , η = η ). 2) Find the posterior of the parameters using the expected sufﬁcient statis¯ ¯ tics S := Eq(x1:n ) [S(x1:n , y1:n )] as if they were the sufﬁcient statistics for the complete data set: ¯ q(θ) ← p(θ|S(x1:n , y1:n ) = S). The posterior will be of the same exponential family as the prior. 1.3 Tracking In this section we review data association, which along with ﬁltering constitutes tracking. In data association we estimate the association vectors a which map measurements to tracks. At each time NZ (n) step, n ∈ N1 , we observe NZ (n) ∈ N0 measurements, Zn = {zi,n }i=1 , which includes returns from both real targets and clutter (spurious measurements). Here, zi,n ∈ Z is a vector of kinematic measurements (positions in R3 , or R4 with a Doppler), augmented with an RCS component R ∈ R+ for the measured SNR, at time tn ∈ R. The assignment vector at time tn is such that an (i) = j if measurement i is associated with track j > 0; an (i) = 0 if measurement i is clutter. The inverse mapping a−1 maps tracks to measurements: meaning a−1 (an (i)) = i if an (i) = 0; and n n a−1 (i) = 0 ⇔ an (j) = i for all j. For example, if NT = 4 and a = [2 0 0 1 4] then NZ = 5, n Nc = 2, and a−1 = [4 1 0 5]. Each track is associated with at most one measurement, and vice-versa. In N D data association we jointly ﬁnd the MAP estimate of the association vectors over a sliding window of the last N − 1 time steps. We assume we have NT (n) ∈ N0 total tracks as a known parameter: NT (n) is adjusted over time using various algorithms (see [2, Ch. 3]). In the generative process each track places a probability distribution on the next N − 1 measurements, with both kinematic and RCS components. However, if the random RCS R for a measurement is below R0 then it will not be observed. There are Nc (n) ∈ N0 clutter measurements from a Poisson process with λ := E[Nc (n)] (often with uniform intensity). The ordering of measurements in Zn is assumed to be uniformly random. For 3D data association the model joint p(Zn−1:n , an−1 , an |Z1:n−2 ) is: NT |Zi | n pi (za−1 (i),n , za−1 n n−1 i=1 (i),n−1 ) × λNc (i) exp(−λ)/|Zi |! i=n−1 p0 (zj,i )I{ai (j)=0} , (5) j=1 where pi is the probability of the measurement sequence under track i; p0 is the clutter distribution. The probability pi is the product of the RCS component predictions (BOCPD) and the kinematic components (ﬁlter); informally, pi (z) = pi (positions) × pi (RCS). If there is a missed detection, i.e. a−1 (i) = 0, we then use pi (za−1 (i),n ) = P (R < R0 ) under the RCS model for track i with no conn n tribution from positional (kinematic) component. Just as BOCPD allows any black box probabilistic predictor to be used as a UPM, any black box model of measurement sequences can used in (5). The estimation of association vectors for the 3D case becomes an optimization problem of the form: ˆ (ˆn−1 , an ) = argmax log P (an−1 , an |Z1:n ) = argmax log p(Zn−1:n , an−1 , an |Z1:n−2 ) , (6) a (an−1 ,an ) (an−1 ,an ) which is effectively optimizing (5) with respect to the assignment vectors. The optimization given in (6) can be cast as a multidimensional assignment (MDA) problem [2], which can be solved efﬁciently in the 2D case. Higher dimensional assignment problems, however, are NP-hard; approximate, yet typically very accurate, solvers must be used for real-time operation, which is usually required for tracking systems [20]. If a radar scan occurs at each time step and a target is not detected, we assume the SNR has not exceeded the threshold, implying 0 ≤ R < R0 . This is a (left) censored measurement and is treated differently than a missing data point. Censoring is accounted for in Section 2.3. 4 2 Online Variational UPMs We cover the four technical challenges for implementing non-exponential family UPMs in an efﬁcient and online manner. We drop the index of the data point i when it is clear from context. 2.1 Variational Posterior for a Rice Distribution The Rice distribution has the property that x ∼ N (ν, σ 2 ) , y ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) =⇒ R = x2 + y 2 ∼ Rice(ν, σ) . (7) For simplicity we perform inference using R2 , as opposed to R, and transform accordingly: x ∼ N (ν, σ 2 ) , 1 R2 − x2 ∼ Gamma( 2 , τ ) , 2 τ := 1/σ 2 ∈ R+ =⇒ p(R2 , x) = p(R2 |x)p(x) = Gamma(R2 − x2 | 1 , τ )N (x|ν, σ 2 ) . 2 2 (8) The complete likelihood (8) is the product of two exponential family models and is exponential family itself, parameterized with base measure h and partition factor g: η = [ντ, −τ /2] , S = [x, R2 ] , h(R2 , x) = (2π R2 − x2 )−1 , g(ν, τ ) = τ exp(−ν 2 τ /2) . By inspection we see that the natural parameters η and sufﬁcient statistics S are the same as a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance. Therefore, we apply the normal-gamma prior on (ν, τ ) as it is the conjugate prior for the complete data likelihood. This allows us to apply the VB-EM 2 algorithm. We use yi := Ri as the VB observation, not Ri as in (3). In (5), z·,· (end) is the RCS R. VB M-Step We derive the posterior updates to the parameters given expected sufﬁcient statistics: n λ0 µ0 + i E[xi ] , λn = λ0 + n , αn = α0 + n , λ0 + n i=1 n n 1 1 nλ0 1 βn = β0 + (E[xi ] − x)2 + ¯ (¯ − µ0 )2 + x R2 − E[xi ]2 . 2 i=1 2 λ0 + n 2 i=1 i x := ¯ E[xi ]/n , µn = (9) (10) This is the same as an observation from a Gaussian and a gamma that share a (inverse) scale τ . 2 2 ¯ VB E-Step We then must ﬁnd both expected sufﬁcient statistics S. The expectation E[Ri |Ri ] = 2 2 Ri trivially; leaving E[xi |Ri ]. Recall that the joint on (x, y ) is a bivariate normal; if we constrain the radius to R, the angle ω will be distributed by a von Mises (VM) distribution. Therefore, ω := arccos(x/R) ∼ VM(0, κ) , κ = R E[ντ ] =⇒ E[x] = R E[cos ω] = RI1 (κ)/I0 (κ) , (11) where computing κ constitutes the VB E-step and we have used the trigonometric moment on ω [18]. This completes the computations required to do the VB updates on the Rice posterior. Variational Lower Bound For completeness, and to assess convergence, we derive the VB lower bound L(q). Using the standard formula [4] for L(q) = Eq [log p(y1:n , x1:n , θ)] + H[q] we get: n 2 1 E[log τ /2] − 1 E[τ ]Ri + (E[ντ ] − κi /Ri )E[xi ] − 2 E[ν 2 τ ] + log I0 (κi ) − KL(q p) , 2 (12) i=1 where p in the KL is the prior on (ν, τ ) which is easy to compute as q and p are both normal-gamma. Equivalently, (12) can be optimized directly instead of using the VB-EM updates. 2.2 Online Variational Inference In Section 2.1 we derived an efﬁcient way to compute the variational posterior for a Rice distribution for a ﬁxed data set. However, as is apparent from (1) we need online predictions from the UPM; we must be able to update the posterior one data point at a time. When the UPM is exponential family and we can compute the posterior exactly, we merely use the posterior from the previous step as the prior. However, since we are only computing a variational approximation to the posterior, using the previous posterior as the prior does not give the exact same answer as re-computing the posterior from batch. This gives two obvious options: 1) recompute the posterior from batch every update at O(n) cost or 2) use the previous posterior as the prior at O(1) cost and reduced accuracy. 5 The difference between the options is encapsulated by looking at the expected sufﬁcient statistics: n ¯ S = i=1 Eq(xi |y1:n ) [S(xi , yi )]. Naive online updating uses old expected sufﬁcient statistics whose n ¯ posterior effectively uses S = i=1 Eq(xi |y1:i ) [S(xi , yi )]. We get the best of both worlds if we adjust those estimates over time. We in fact can do this if we project the expected sufﬁcient statistics into a “feature space” in terms of the expected natural parameters. For some function f , q(xi ) = p(xi |yi , η = η ) =⇒ Eq(xi |y1:n ) [S(xi , yi )] = f (yi , η ) . ¯ ¯ If f is piecewise continuous then we can represent it with an inner product [8, Sec. 2.1.6] n n ¯ f (yi , η ) = φ(¯) ψ(yi ) =⇒ S = ¯ η φ(¯) ψ(yi ) = φ(¯) η η ψ(yi ) , i=1 i=1 (13) (14) where an inﬁnite dimensional φ and ψ may be required for exact representation, but can be approximated by a ﬁnite inner product. In the Rice distribution case we use (11) f (yi , η ) = E[xi ] = Ri I (Ri E[ντ ]) = Ri I ((Ri /µ0 ) µ0 E[ντ ]) , ¯ I (·) := I1 (·)/I0 (·) , (15) 2 Ri where recall that yi = and η1 = E[ντ ]. We can easily represent f with an inner product if we can ¯ represent I as an inner product: I (uv) = φ(u) ψ(v). We use unitless φi (u) = I (ci u) with c1:G as a log-linear grid from 10−2 to 103 and G = 50. We use a lookup table for ψ(v) that was trained to match I using non-negative least squares, which left us with a sparse lookup table. Online updating for VB posteriors was also developed in [24; 13]. These methods involved introducing forgetting factors to forget the contributions from old data points that might be detrimental to accuracy. Since the VB predictions are “embedded” in a change point method, they are automatically phased out if the posterior predictions become inaccurate making the forgetting factors unnecessary. 2.3 Censored Data As mentioned in Section 1.3, we must handle censored RCS observations during a missed detection. In the VB-EM framework we merely have to compute the expected sufﬁcient statistics given the censored measurement: E[S|R < R0 ]. The expected sufﬁcient statistic from (11) is now: R0 E[x|R < R0 ] = 0 ν ν E[x|R]p(R)dR RiceCDF (R0 |ν, τ ) = ν(1 − Q2 ( σ , R0 ))/(1 − Q1 ( σ , R0 )) , σ σ where QM is the Marcum Q function [17] of order M . Similar updates for E[S|R < R0 ] are possible for exponential or gamma UPMs, but are not shown as they are relatively easy to derive. 2.4 Variational Run Length Posteriors: Predictive Log Likelihoods Both updating the BOCPD run length posterior (1) and ﬁnding the marginal predictive log likelihood of the next point (2) require calculating the UPM’s posterior predictive log likelihood log p(yn+1 |rn , y(r) ). The marginal posterior predictive from (2) is used in data association (6) and benchmarking BOCPD against other methods. However, the exact posterior predictive distribution obtained by integrating the Rice likelihood against the VB posterior is difﬁcult to compute. We can break the BOCPD update (1) into a time and measurement update. The measurement update corresponds to a Bayesian model comparison (BMC) calculation with prior p(rn |y1:n ): p(rn |y1:n+1 ) ∝ p(yn+1 |rn , y(r) )p(rn |y1:n ) . (16) Using the BMC results in Bishop [4, Sec. 10.1.4] we ﬁnd a variational posterior on the run length by using the variational lower bound for each run length Li (q) ≤ log p(yn+1 |rn = i, y(r) ), calculated using (12), as a proxy for the exact UPM posterior predictive in (16). This gives the exact VB posterior if the approximating family Q is of the form: q(rn , θ, x) = qUPM (θ, x|rn )q(rn ) =⇒ q(rn = i) = exp(Li (q))p(rn = i|y1:n )/ exp(L(q)) , (17) where qUPM contains whatever constraints we used to compute Li (q). The normalizer on q(rn ) serves as a joint VB lower bound: L(q) = log i exp(Li (q))p(rn = i|y1:n ) ≤ log p(yn+1 |y1:n ). Note that the conditional factorization is different than the typical independence constraint on q. Furthermore, we derive the estimation of the assignment vectors a in (6) as a VB routine. We use a similar conditional constraint on the latent BOCPD variables given the assignment and constrain the assignment posterior to be a point mass. In the 2D assignment case, for example, ˆ q(an , X1:NT ) = q(X1:NT |an )q(an ) = q(X1:NT |an )I{an = an } , (18) 6 2 10 0 10 −1 10 −2 10 10 20 30 40 50 RCS RMSE (dBsm) RCS RMSE (dBsm) 10 KL (nats) 5 10 1 8 6 4 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 100 200 Sample Size (a) Online Updating 4 300 Time (b) Exponential RCS 400 0 100 200 300 400 Time (c) Rice RCS Figure 2: Left: KL from naive updating ( ), Sato’s method [24] ( ), and improved online VB (◦) to the batch VB posterior vs. sample size n; using a standard normal-gamma prior.

Middle: The RMSE (dB scale) of the estimate on the mean RCS distribution E[Rn ] is plotted for an exponential RCS model.

The dashed lines are 95% conﬁdence intervals. where each track’s Xi represents all the latent variables used to compute the variational lower bound on log p(zj,n |an (j) = i). In the BOCPD case, Xi := {rn , x, θ}. The resulting VB ﬁxed point ˆ equations ﬁnd the posterior on the latent variables Xi by taking an as the true assignment and solving ˆ the VB problem of (17); the assignment an is found by using (6) and taking the joint BOCPD lower bound L(q) as a proxy for the BOCPD predictive log likelihood component of log pi in (5). 3 3.1 Results Improved Online Solution We ﬁrst demonstrate the accuracy of the online VB approximation (Section 2.2) on a Rice estimation example; here, we only test the VB posterior as no change point detection is applied. Figure 2(a) compares naive online updating, Sato’s method [24], and our improved online updating in KL(online batch) of the posteriors for three different true parameters ν as sample size n increases. The performance curves are the KL divergence between these online approximations to the posterior and the batch VB solution (i.e. restarting VB from “scratch” every new data point) vs sample size. The error for our method stays around a modest 10−2 nats while naive updating incurs large errors of 1 to 50 nats [19, Ch. 4]. Sato’s method tends to settle in around a 1 nat approximation error. The recommended annealing schedule, i.e. forgetting factors, in [24] performed worse than naive updating. We did a grid search over annealing exponents and show the results for the best performing schedule of n−0.52 . By contrast, our method does not require the tuning of an annealing schedule. 3.2 RCS Estimation Benchmarking We now compare BOCPD with other methods for RCS estimation. We use the same experimental example as Slocumb and Klusman III [25], which uses an augmented interacting multiple model (IMM) based method for estimating the RCS; we also compare against the same α-ﬁlter and median ﬁlter used in [25]. As a reference point, we also consider the “identity ﬁlter” which is merely an unbiased ﬁlter that uses only yn to estimate the mean RCS E[Rn ] at time step n. We extend this example to look at Rice RCS in addition to the exponential RCS case. The bias correction constants in the IMM were adjusted for the Rice distribution case as per [25, Sec. 3.4]. The results on exponential distributions used in [25] and the Rice distribution case are shown in Figures 2(b) and 2(c). The IMM used in [25] was hard-coded to expect jumps in the SNR of multiples of ±10 dB, which is exactly what is presented in the example (a sequence of 20, 10, 30, and 10 dB). In [25] the authors mention that the IMM reaches an RMSE “ﬂoor” at 2 dB, yet BOCPD continues to drop as low as 0.56 dB. The RMSE from BOCPD does not spike nearly as high as the other methods upon a change in E[Rn ]. The α-ﬁlter and median ﬁlter appear worse than both the IMM and BOCPD. The RMSE and conﬁdence intervals are calculated from 5000 runs of the experiment. 7 45 80 40 30 Northing (km) Improvement (%) 35 25 20 15 10 5 60 40 20 0 0 −5 1 2 3 4 −20 5 Difficulty 0 20 40 60 80 100 Easting (km) (a) SIAP Metrics (b) Heathrow (LHR) Figure 3: Left: Average relative improvements (%) for SIAP metrics: position accuracy (red ), velocity accuracy (green ), and spurious tracks (blue ◦) across difﬁculty levels.

The standard tracker has spurious tracks over east London and near Ipswich. Background map data: Google Earth (TerraMetrics, Data SIO, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO, Europa Technologies) 3.3 Flightradar24 Tracking Problem Finally, we used real ﬂight trajectories from ﬂightradar24 and plugged them into our 3D tracking algorithm. We compare tracking performance between using our BOCPD model and the relatively standard constant probability of detection (no RCS) [2, Sec. 3.5] setup. We use the single integrated air picture (SIAP) metrics [6] to demonstrate the improved performance of the tracking. The SIAP metrics are a standard set of metrics used to compare tracking systems. We broke the data into 30 regions during a one hour period (in Sept. 2012) sampled every 5 s, each within a 200 km by 200 km area centered around the world’s 30 busiest airports [22]. Commercial airport trafﬁc is typically very orderly and does not allow aircraft to ﬂy close to one another or cross paths. Feature-aided tracking is most necessary in scenarios with a more chaotic air situation. Therefore, we took random subsets of 10 ﬂight paths and randomly shifted their start time to allow for scenarios of greater interest. The resulting SIAP metric improvements are shown in Figure 3(a) where we look at performance by a difﬁculty metric: the number of times in a scenario any two aircraft come within ∼400 m of each other. The biggest improvements are seen for difﬁculties above three where positional accuracy increases by 30%. Signiﬁcant improvements are also seen for velocity accuracy (11%) and the frequency of spurious tracks (6%). Signiﬁcant performance gains are seen at all difﬁculty levels considered. The larger improvements at level three over level ﬁve are possibly due to some level ﬁve scenarios that are not resolvable simply through more sophisticated models. We demonstrate how our RCS methods prevent the creation of spurious tracks around London Heathrow in Figure 3(b). 4 Conclusions We have demonstrated that it is possible to use sophisticated and recent developments in machine learning such as BOCPD, and use the modern inference method of VB, to produce demonstrable improvements in the much more mature ﬁeld of radar tracking. We ﬁrst closed a “hole” in the literature in Section 2.1 by deriving variational inference on the parameters of a Rice distribution, with its inherent applicability to radar tracking. In Sections 2.2 and 2.4 we showed that it is possible to use these variational UPMs for non-exponential family models in BOCPD without sacriﬁcing its modular or online nature. The improvements in online VB are extendable to UPMs besides a Rice distribution and more generally beyond change point detection. We can use the variational lower bound from the UPM and obtain a principled variational approximation to the run length posterior. Furthermore, we cast the estimation of the assignment vectors themselves as a VB problem, which is in large contrast to the tracking literature. More algorithms from the tracking literature can possibly be cast in various machine learning frameworks, such as VB, and improved upon from there. 8 References [1] Adams, R. P. and MacKay, D. J.

<p>Author: Raif Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of applications require processing of signals deﬁned on weighted graphs. While wavelets provide a ﬂexible tool for signal processing in the classical setting of regular domains, the existing graph wavelet constructions are less ﬂexible – they are guided solely by the structure of the underlying graph and do not take directly into consideration the particular class of signals to be processed. This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. Our construction uses the lifting scheme, and is based on the observation that the recurrent nature of the lifting scheme gives rise to a structure resembling a deep auto-encoder network. Particular properties that the resulting wavelets must satisfy determine the training objective and the structure of the involved neural networks. The training is unsupervised, and is conducted similarly to the greedy pre-training of a stack of auto-encoders. After training is completed, we obtain a linear wavelet transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph. Improved sparsity of our wavelet transform for the test signals is conﬁrmed via experiments both on synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>6 0.79695094 <a title="95-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Submodular_Maximization%3A_Identifying_Representative_Elements_in_Massive_Data.html">97 nips-2013-Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></p>

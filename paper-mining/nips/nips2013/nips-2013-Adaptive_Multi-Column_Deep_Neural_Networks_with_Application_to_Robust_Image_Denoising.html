<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Li Yao, Guillaume Alain, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying datagenerating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justiﬁcation which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-inﬁnitesimal corruption noise (or non-inﬁnitesimal contractive penalty). 1</p><p>3 0.11249679 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Transfer_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Rank_Constraints.html">285 nips-2013-Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), a well-established technique for data analysis and processing, provides a convenient form of dimensionality reduction that is effective for cleaning small Gaussian noises presented in the data. However, the applicability of standard principal component analysis in real scenarios is limited by its sensitivity to large errors. In this paper, we tackle the challenge problem of recovering data corrupted with errors of high magnitude by developing a novel robust transfer principal component analysis method. Our method is based on the assumption that useful information for the recovery of a corrupted data matrix can be gained from an uncorrupted related data matrix. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the data recovery problem as a joint robust principal component analysis problem on the two data matrices, with common principal components shared across matrices and individual principal components speciﬁc to each data matrix. The formulated optimization problem is a minimization problem over a convex objective function but with non-convex rank constraints. We develop an efﬁcient proximal projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem with convergence guarantees. Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA with rank constraints. 1</p><p>4 0.1108311 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Misha Denil, Babak Shakibi, Laurent Dinh, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there is signiﬁcant redundancy in the parameterization of several deep learning models. Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.099245846 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_a_Deep_Compact_Image_Representation_for_Visual_Tracking.html">163 nips-2013-Learning a Deep Compact Image Representation for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of tracking the trajectory of a moving object in a video with possibly very complex background. In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Speciﬁcally, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked denoising autoencoder ofﬂine to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from ofﬂine training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classiﬁcation neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classiﬁcation layer. Both the feature extractor and the classiﬁer can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU). 1</p><p>6 0.085528746 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machine (MP-DBM). The MPDBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classiﬁcation tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classiﬁcation, classiﬁcation with missing inputs, and mean ﬁeld prediction tasks.1 1</p><p>4 0.59938502 <a title="27-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Ratio_Matching_of_RBMs_for_Sparse_High-Dimensional_Inputs.html">315 nips-2013-Stochastic Ratio Matching of RBMs for Sparse High-Dimensional Inputs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yann Dauphin, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Sparse high-dimensional data vectors are common in many application domains where a very large number of rarely non-zero features can be devised. Unfortunately, this creates a computational bottleneck for unsupervised feature learning algorithms such as those based on auto-encoders and RBMs, because they involve a reconstruction step where the whole input vector is predicted from the current feature values. An algorithm was recently developed to successfully handle the case of auto-encoders, based on an importance sampling scheme stochastically selecting which input elements to actually reconstruct during training for each particular example. To generalize this idea to RBMs, we propose a stochastic ratio-matching algorithm that inherits all the computational advantages and unbiasedness of the importance sampling scheme. We show that stochastic ratio matching is a good estimator, allowing the approach to beat the state-of-the-art on two bag-of-word text classiﬁcation benchmarks (20 Newsgroups and RCV1), while keeping computational cost linear in the number of non-zeros. 1</p><p>5 0.58976048 <a title="27-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification.html">83 nips-2013-Deep Fisher Networks for Large-Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: As massively parallel computations have become broadly available with modern GPUs, deep architectures trained on very large datasets have risen in popularity. Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classiﬁcation benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper, we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the stateof-the-art Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture signiﬁcantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted image classiﬁcation pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination further improves the accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.57659471 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>3 0.70206457 <a title="27-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_with_Noisy_Labels.html">171 nips-2013-Learning with Noisy Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.70203662 <a title="27-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-On_Flat_versus_Hierarchical_Classification_in_Large-Scale_Taxonomies.html">216 nips-2013-On Flat versus Hierarchical Classification in Large-Scale Taxonomies</a></p>
<p>Author: Rohit Babbar, Ioannis Partalas, Eric Gaussier, Massih-Reza Amini</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper ﬂat and hierarchical classiﬁcation strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. To this end, we ﬁrst propose a multiclass, hierarchical data dependent bound on the generalization error of classiﬁers deployed in large-scale taxonomies. This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of ﬂat and hierarchical classiﬁers. We then introduce another type of bound targeting the approximation error of a family of classiﬁers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classiﬁer to decide which nodes to prune (or ﬂatten) in a large-scale taxonomy. We ﬁnally illustrate the theoretical developments through several experiments conducted on two widely used taxonomies. 1</p><p>5 0.70114762 <a title="27-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Latent_Source_Model_for_Nonparametric_Time_Series_Classification.html">10 nips-2013-A Latent Source Model for Nonparametric Time Series Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: George H. Chen, Stanislav Nikolov, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: For classifying time series, a nearest-neighbor approach is widely used in practice with performance often competitive with or better than more elaborate methods such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. We develop theoretical justiﬁcation for the effectiveness of nearest-neighbor-like classiﬁcation of time series. Our guiding hypothesis is that in many applications, such as forecasting which topics will become trends on Twitter, there aren’t actually that many prototypical time series to begin with, relative to the number of time series we have access to, e.g., topics become trends on Twitter only in a few distinct manners whereas we can collect massive amounts of Twitter data. To operationalize this hypothesis, we propose a latent source model for time series, which naturally leads to a “weighted majority voting” classiﬁcation rule that can be approximated by a nearest-neighbor classiﬁer. We establish nonasymptotic performance guarantees of both weighted majority voting and nearest-neighbor classiﬁcation under our model accounting for how much of the time series we observe and the model complexity. Experimental results on synthetic data show weighted majority voting achieving the same misclassiﬁcation rate as nearest-neighbor classiﬁcation while observing less of the time series. We then use weighted majority to forecast which news topics on Twitter become trends, where we are able to detect such “trending topics” in advance of Twitter 79% of the time, with a mean early advantage of 1 hour and 26 minutes, a true positive rate of 95%, and a false positive rate of 4%. 1</p><p>6 0.69812828 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Convex_Optimization_with_Multiple__Objectives.html">311 nips-2013-Stochastic Convex Optimization with Multiple  Objectives</a></p>
